purposes abortion may be defined as the interruption of gestation before viability of the child hj boldt md the boy who belonged to st clouds in the hospital of the orphanagethe boys division at st clouds mainetwo nurses were in charge of naming the new babies and checking that their little penises were healing from the obligatory circumcision in those days in all boys born at st clouds were circumcised because the orphanage physician had experienced some difficulty in treating uncircumcised soldiers for this and for that in world war i the doctor who was also the director of the boys division was not a religious man circumcision was not a rite with himit was a strictly medical act performed for hygienic reasons his name was wilbur larch which except for the scent of ether that always accompanied him reminded one of the nurses of the tough durable wood of the coniferous tree of that name she hated however the ridiculous name of wilbur and took offense at the silliness of combining a word like wilbur with something as substantial as a tree the other nurse imagined herself to be in love with dr larch and when it was her turn to name a baby she frequently named him john larch or john wilbur her fathers name was john or wilbur walsh her mothers maiden name had been walsh despite her love for dr larch she could not imagine larch as anything but a last nameand when she thought of him she did not think of trees at all for its flexibility as a first or as a last name she loved the name of wilburand when she tired of her use of john or was criticized by her colleague for overusing it she could rarely come up with anything more original than a robert larch or a jack wilbur she seemed not to know that jack was often a nickname for john if he had been named by this dull lovestruck nurse he probably would have been a larch or a wilbur of one kind or another and a john a jack or a robertto make matters even duller because it was the other nurses turn he was named homer wells the other nurses father was in the business of drilling wells which was hard harrowing honest precise work to her thinking her father was composed of these qualities which lent the word wells a certain deep downtoearth aura homer had been the name of one of her familys umpteen cats this other nursenurse angela to almost everyone rarely repeated the names of her babies whereas poor nurse edna had named three john wilbur juniors and two john larch the thirds nurse angela knew an inexhaustible number of nononsense nouns which she diligently employed as last namesmaple fields stone hill knot day waters to list a fewand a slightly less impressive list of first names borrowed from a family history of many dead but cherished pets felix fuzzy smoky sam snowy joe curly ed and so forth for most of the orphans of course these nursegiven names were temporary the boys division had a better record than the girls division at placing the orphans in homes when they were babies too young ever to know the names their good nurses had given them most of the orphans wouldnt even remember nurse angela or nurse edna the first women in the world to fuss over them dr larch made it a firm policy that the orphans adoptive families not be informed of the names the nurses gave with such zeal the feeling at st clouds was that a child upon leaving the orphanage should know the thrill of a fresh startbut especially with the boys who were difficult to place and lived at st clouds the longest it was hard for nurse angela and nurse edna and even for dr larch not to think of their john wilburs and john larches their felix hills curly maples joe knots smoky waterses as possessing their nursegiven names forever the reason homer wells kept his name was that he came back to st clouds so many times after so many failed foster homes that the orphanage was forced to acknowledge homers intention to make st clouds his home it was not easy for anyone to accept but nurse angela and nurse ednaand finally dr wilbur larchwere forced to admit that homer wells belonged to st clouds the determined boy was not put up for adoption anymore nurse angela with her love of cats and orphans once remarked of homer wells that the boy must adore the name she gave him because he fought so hard not to lose it st clouds mainethe townhad been a logging camp for most of the nineteenth century the camp andgraduallythe town set up shop in the river valley where the land was flat which made the first roads easier to build and the heavy equipment easier to transport the first building was a saw mill the first settlers were french canadianswoodsmen lumberjacks sawyers then caime the overland haulers and the river bargemen then the prostitutes then the vagrants and the thugs and at last there was a church the first logging camp had been called simply clouds because the valley was low and the clouds broke up reluctantly a fog hung over the violent river until midmorning and the falls which roared for three miles upstream from the site of the first camp produced a constant mist when the first woodcutters went to work there the only impediments to their rape of the forest were the black flies and the mosquitoes these infernal insects preferred the nearly constant cover of clouds in the stagnant valleys of inland maine to the sharp air of the mountains or to the crisp sunlight by the bright maine sea dr wilbur larchwho was not only the doctor for the orphanage and the director of the boys division he had also founded the placewas the selfappointed historian of the town according to dr larch the logging camp called clouds became st clouds only because of the fervent backwoods catholic instinct to put a saint before so many thingsas if to grant those things a grace they could never quite acquire naturally the logging camp remained st clouds for nearly half a century before the apostrophe was insertedprobably by someone who was unaware of the camps origin but by the time it became st clouds it was more of a mill town than a logging camp the forest for miles around was cleared instead of logs jamming the river and the rough camp full of men lamed and crippled by falling from trees or by trees falling on them one saw the high orderly stacks of freshcut boards drying out in the hazy sun overall lay a silty sawdust occasionally too fine to see but everpresent in the sneezes and wheezes of the town in the towns perpetually itching noses and in its rasping lungs the towns wounded now sported stitches instead of bruises and broken bones they wore gashes and found ways to flaunt their missing parts from the mills many saws the keen whine of those blades was as constant in st clouds as the fog the mist the humidity that overhangs inland maine in the damp cold of its long wet snowedin winters and in the fetid stifling heat of its drizzly summersblessed only occasionally by violent thunderstorms there was never any spring in that part of maine except that period of time in march and april distinguished by thawing mud the heavy equipment of the lumbering business was immobilized the work of the town shut down the impassable roads kept everyone at homeand the springtime river was so swollen and ran so fast that no one dared to travel on it spring in st clouds meant trouble drinking trouble brawling trouble whoring and raping trouble spring was the suicide season in spring the seeds for an orphanage were planted and overplanted and what of the fall in his journalhis whatnot diary his daily record of the business of the orphanage dr wilbur larch wrote of the fall each of dr larchs entries began here in st cloudsexcept for those entries that beganin other parts of the world of the fall dr larch wrote in other parts of the world fall is for the harvest one gathers the fruits of spring and summers labors these fruits provide for the long slumber and the season of ungrowing that is called winter but here in st clouds the fall is only five minutes long what sort of climate would anyone expect for an orphanage could anyone imagine resort weather would an orphanage bloom in an innocent town in his journal dr larch was demonstratively conservative with paper he wrote in a small cramped hand on both sides of the pages which were absolutely filled dr larch was not a man for leaving margins here in st clouds he wrote guess who is the enemy of the maine forests the villainous father of the unwanted babies the reason the river is choked with deadwood and the valley land stripped unplanted eroded by the river floodsguess who is the insatiable destroyer first of a logger with his hands pitchy and his fingers mashed then of a lumberman a sawmill slave whose hands are dry and cracked with some fingers only a memory and guess why this glutton is not satisfied with logs or with lumberguess who to dr larch the enemy was paperspecifically the ramses paper company there were enough trees for lumber dr larch imagined but there would never be enough trees for all the paper the ramses paper company seemed to want or to needespecially if one failed to plant new trees when the valley surrounding st clouds was cleared and the second growth scrub pine and random unmanaged softwoods sprang up everywhere like swamp weed and when there were no more logs to send downriver from three mile falls to st cloudsbecause there were no more treesthat was when the ramses paper company introduced maine to the twentieth century by closing down the saw mill and the lumberyard along the river at st clouds and moving camp downstream and what was left behind the weather the sawdust the scarred bruised bank of the river where the big log drives jamming had gouged out a raw new shore and the buildings themselves the mill with its broken windows with no screens the whore hotel with its dance hall downstairs and the bingoformoney room overlooking the rough river the few private homes logcabin style and the church which was catholic for the french canadians and which looked too clean and unused to belong to st clouds where it had never been half as popular as the whores or the dance hall or even bingoformoney in dr larchs journal he wrote in other parts of the world they play tennis or poker but here in st clouds they play bingoformoney and the people who were left behind there were no ramses paper company people left behind but there were people the older and the less attractive prostitutes and the children of these prostitutes not one of the neglected officers of the catholic church of st clouds stayed there were more souls to save by following the ramses paper company downstream in his a brief history of st clouds dr larch documented that at least one of these prostitutes knew how to read and write on the last barge downriver following the ramses paper company to a new civilization a relatively literate prostitute sent a letter addressed to whichever official of the state of maine who is concerned with orphans somehow this letter actually reached someone forwarded many times for its curiosity dr larch wrote as much as for its urgency the letter was delivered to the state board of medical examiners the youngest member of this boarda puppy right out of medical school as dr larch described himselfwas shown the prostitutes letter as a kind of bait the rest of the board thought that young larch was the one hopelessly naive democrat and liberal among them the letter said there should be a goddamned doctor and a goddamned school and even a goddamned policeman and a goddamned lawyer in st clouds which has been deserted by its goddamn men who were never much and left to helpless women and orphans the chairman of the state board of medical examiners was a retired physician who thought that president teddy roosevelt was the only other man in the world besides himself who had not been made from a banana why dont you look into this mush larch the chairman said little knowing that out of this invitation a statesupported facilityfor orphanswould soon develop it would one day gain at least partial federal support and even that most vague and least dependable support offered by private benefactors anyway in as the twentieth centuryso young and full of promiseblossomed even in inland maine dr wilbur larch undertook the task of righting the wrongs of st clouds he had his work cut out for him for almost twenty years dr larch would leave st clouds only oncefor world war i where it is doubtful he was more needed what better man could be imagined for the job of undoing what the ramses paper company had done than a man named after one of the worlds coniferous trees in his journalas he was only beginningdr larch wrote here in st clouds it is high time something was done for the good of someone what better place for improvement could there be for selfimprovement and for the good of allthan a place where evil has so clearly flourished if not altogether triumphed in when homer wells was born and had his little penis snipped and was named nurse edna who was in love and nurse angela who wasnt had in common a pet name of their own for st clouds founder physician town historian war hero he was even decorated and director of the boys division saint larch they called himand why not when wilbur larch granted homer wells permission to remain at st clouds for as long as the boy felt he belonged there the doctor was merely exercising his considerable and earned authority on the issue of belonging to st clouds dr larch was an authority st larch had found his placein the twentieth centuryto be as he put it of use and that is precisely how dr larch instructed homer wells when the doctor sternly accepted the boys need to stay at st clouds well then homer said st larch i expect you to be of use he was nothing homer wells if not of use his sense of usefulness appears to predate dr larchs instructions his first foster parents returned him to st clouds they thought there was something wrong with himhe never cried the foster parents complained that they would wake to the same silence that had prompted them to adopt a child in the first place theyd wake up alarmed that the baby hadnt woken them theyd rush into the babys room expecting to find him dead but homer wells would be toothlessly biting his lip perhaps grimacing but not protesting that he was unfed and unattended homers foster parents always suspected that hed been awake quietly suffering for hours they thought this wasnt normal dr larch explained to them that the babies of st clouds were used to lying in their beds unattended nurse angela and nurse edna dearly devoted though they were could not be rushing to each and every baby the second it cried crying was not of much use at st clouds though in his heart of hearts dr larch knew very well that homers capacity for withholding tears was unusual even for an orphan it was dr larchs experience that foster parents who could so easily be deterred from wanting a baby were not the best parents for an orphan homers first foster parents were so quick to assume theyd been given a wrong oneretarded a lernon braindamagedthat dr larch didnt extend himself to assure them that homer was a very fit baby bound to have a courageous long haul in the life ahead his second foster family responded differently to homers lack of soundhis stiffupperlip and bitethebulletwhilejustlyingthere placidity his second foster family beat the baby so regularly that they managed to get some appropriately babylike noise out of him homers crying saved him if hed proven himself to be stalwart at resisting tears now when he saw that tears and howls and shrieks seemed to be what his foster family most desired of him he tried to be of use and gave with his whole heart the lustiest wails he could deliver he had been such a creature of contentment dr larch was surprised to learn that the new baby from st clouds was disturbing the peace in the fortunately small and nearby town of three mile falls its fortunate that three mile falls was small because the stories of homers cries were the center of the areas gossip for several weeks and its fortunate that three mile falls was nearby because the stories found their way to st clouds and to nurse angela and nurse edna who had cornered the gossip market in all those river wood and paper towns when they heard the tales of how their homer wells was keeping three mile falls awake until the small hours and how he would wake up the town before it was light the nurses good memories did not forsake them they went straight to st larch thats not my homer nurse angela cried hes not a natural at crying wilbur nurse edna saidtaking every opportunity she had to pronounce that name so dear to her heart wilbur it always made nurse angela cross with her whenever nurse edna indulged her desire to call dr larch a wilbur to his face doctor larch nurse angela said with pointed and excessive formality if homer wells is waking up three mile falls that family you let have him must be burning that boy with their cigarettes they werent that kind of family that was a favorite fantasy of nurse angelasshe hated smoking just the look of a cigarette dangling from anyones mouth made her remember a frenchspeaking indian whod come to see her father about digging a well and had stuck his cigarette in one of her cats faces burning its nosethe cat an especially friendly spayed female had jumped up in the indians lap that cat had been named bandit shed had the classic masked face of a raccoon nurse angela had restrained herself from naming any of the orphans after banditshe thought of bandit as a girls name but the family from three mile falls were not sadists of a very known kind an older man and his younger wife lived with his grownup children of a previous marriage the young wife wanted a child of her own but she couldnt get pregnant everyone in the family thought it would be nice for the young wife to have her own baby what no one mentioned was that one of the grownup children from the previous marriage had had a baby illegitimately and she hadnt cared for it very well and the baby had cried and cried and cried everyone complained about the baby crying night and day and one morning the grownup daughter had simply taken her baby and gone she left only this note behind im sick of hearing from all of you about how much my baby cries i guess if i go you wont miss the crying or me either but they did miss the cryingeveryone missed that wonderful bawling baby and the dear dimwitted daughter who had taken it away be sure nice to have a baby crying around here again someone in the family had remarked and so they went and got themselves a baby from st clouds they were the wrong family to be given a baby who wouldnt cry homers silence was such a disappointment to them that they took it as a kind of affront and challenged each other to discover who among them could make the baby cry first after first they progressed to loudest after loudest came longest they first made him cry by not feeding him but they made him cry loudest by hurting him this usually meant pinching him or punching him but there was ample evidence that the baby had been bitten too they made him cry longest by frightening him they discovered that startling babies was the best way to frighten them they must have been very accomplished at achieving the loudest and longest in order to have made homer wellss crying a legend in three mile falls it was especially hard to hear anyr thing in three mile fallsnot to mention how hard it was to make a legend out of anything there the falls themselves made such a steady roar that three mile falls was the perfect town for murder no one there could hear ashotor ascream if you murdered someone in three mile falls and threw the body in the river at the falls the body couldnt possibly be stopped or even slowed down not to mention found until it went three miles downriver to st clouds it was therefore all the more remarkable that the whole town heard the kind of crying homer wells made it took nurse angela and nurse edna about a year before homer wells stopped waking up with a scream or letting out a wail whenever someone crossed his field of vision or whenever he heard a human sound even a chair being dragged across the floor or even a bed creak a window shut a door open every sight and sound connected with a human being who might possibly be headed in homers direction produced a high stammering shout and such tearful blubbering that anyone visiting the boys division would have thought that the orphanage was in fairytale fashion a torture shop a prison of child molestation and abuse beyond imagining homer homer dr larch would say soothingly while the boy burned scarlet and refilled his lungs homer youre going to get us investigated for murder youre going to get us shut down poor nurse edna and poor nurse angela were probably more permanently scarred by the family from three mile falls than homer wells was and the good and the great st larch never fully recovered from the incident he had met the family hed interviewed them alland been horribly wrong about them and hed seen them all again on the day he went to three mile falls to bring homer wells back to st clouds what dr larch would always remember was the fright in all of their expresions when hed marched into their house and taken homer up in his arms the fear in their faces would haunt dr larch forever the epitome of everything he could never understand about the great ambiguity in the feelings people had for children there was the human body which was so clearly designed to want babiesand then there was the human mind which was so confused about the matter sometimes the mind didnt want the babies but sometimes the mind was so perverse that it made other people have babies they knew they didnt want for whom was this insisting done dr larch wondered for whom did some minds insist that babies even clearly unwanted ones must be brought screaming into the world and when other minds thought they wanted babies but then couldnt or wouldnt take proper care of themwell what were these minds thinking when dr larchs mind ran away with him on the subject it was always the fear in those faces of the family from three mile falls that he saw and homer wellss legendary howl that he heard the fear in that family was fixed in st larchs vision no one he believed who had seen such fear should ever make a woman have a baby she didnt want to have no one dr larch wrote in his journal not even someone from the ramses paper company if you had an ounce of sanity you would not speak against abortion to dr wilbur larchor you would suffer every detail there was to know about the six weeks homer wells spent with the family from three mile falls this was larchs only way of discussing the issue which was not even open to debate with him he was an obstetrician but when he was askedand when it was safehe was an abortionist too by the time homer was four he didnt have those dreams anymorethe ones that could awaken every living soul in st clouds the dreams that caused one night watchman to resign my heart he said wont take another night of that boy and that resided so soundly in the memory of dr wilbur larch that he was known for years to hear babies crying in his sleep and to roll over saying homer homer its all right now homer at st clouds of course babies were always crying in everyones sleep but no baby ever woke up crying in quite the manner that homer wells managed it lord its as if he was being stabbed nurse edna would say as if he was being burned with a cigarette nurse angela would say but only wilbur larch knew what it was really likethat way that homer wells woke up and in his violent waking woke everyone else as if he were being circumcised dr larch wrote in his journal as if someone were snipping his little penisover and over again just snipping it and snipping it the third foster family to fail with homer wells was a family of such rare and championship qualities that to judge humanity by this familys example would be foolish they were that good a family they were that perfect or dr larch would not have let homer go to them after the family from three mile falls dr larch was being especially careful with homer professor draper and his wife of nearly forty years lived in waterville maine waterville was not much of a college town in when homer wells went there but if you compared waterville to st clouds or to three mile falls you would have to say that waterville was a community of moral and social giants though still inland it was of considerably higher elevationthere were nearby mountains and from these there were actual vistas mountain life like the life on an ocean or on the plains or on open farmland affords the inhabitant the luxury of a view living on land where you can occasionally see a long way provides the soul with a perspective of a beneficially expansive natureor so believed professor draper he was a born teacher unfarmed valley land he would intone which i associate with forests too low and too dense to provide a view tends to cramp the uplifting qualities of human nature and enhance those instincts which are meanspirited and small now homer mrs draper would say the professor is a born teacher you have to take him with a grain of salt everyone called her mom no one including his grown children and his grandchildren called him any thing but professor even dr larch didnt know what his first name was if his tone was professorial at times even officious he was a man of very regular habits and temperament and his manner was jocular wet shoes the professor once said to homer are a fact of maine they are a given your method homer of putting wet shoes on a windowsill where they might be dried by the faint appearance albeit rare of the maine sun is admirable for its positivism its determined optimism however the professor would go on a method i would recommend for wet shoesa method i must add that is independent of the weatherinvolves a more reliable source of heat in maine namely the furnace when you consider that the days when shoes get wet are days as a rule when we dont see the sun youll recognize the furnaceroom method as having certain advantages with a grain of salt homer mrs draper would tell the boy even the professor called her mom even mom called him professor if homer wells found the professors conversation abounding in pithy maxims he didnt complain if professor drapers students at the college and his colleagues in the history department thought that the professor was a sententious boreand tended to flee his path like rabbits escaping the slow but nosetotheground hound they could not influence homers opinion of the first father figure in his life to rival dr larch homers arrival in waterville was greeted by the kind of attention the boy had never known nurse angela and nurse edna were emergency providers and dr larch an affectionate if stern and distracted overseer but mrs draper was a moms mom she was a hoverer she was up before homer was awake the cookies she baked while he ate his breakfast were miraculously still warm in his lunch bag at noon mom draper hiked to school with homerthey went overland disdaining the road it was her constitutional she said in the afternoons professor draper met homer in the schools playgroundschools end seemed magically timed to coincide with the professors last class of the day at the collegeand they would tramp home together in the winter which in waterville came early this was a literal trampingon snowshoes the mastery of which the professor placed on a level of learning to read and write use the body use the mind homer the professor said its easy to see why wilbur larch was impressed with the man he vigorously represented usefulness in truth homer liked the routine of it the tramptramp of it the utter predictability of it an orphan is simply more of a child than other children in that essential appreciation of the things that happen daily on schedule for everything that promises to last to stay the same the orphan is a sucker dr larch ran the boys division with as many of the simulated manifestations of daily life as are possible to cultivate at an orphanage meals were promptly served at the same time every day dr larch would read aloud at the same evening hour for the same length of time even if it meant leaving a chapter in midadventure with the boys shouting more more just read the next thing that happens and st larch would say tomorrow same time same place there would be groans of disappointment but larch knew that he had made a promise he had established a routine here in st clouds he wrote in his journal security is measured by the number of promises kept every child understands a promiseif it is kept and looks forward to the next promise among orphans you build security slowly but regularly slow but regular would describe the life that homer wells led with the drapers in waterville every activity was a lesson each corner of the comfortable old house held something to be learned and then counted upon this is rufus hes very old the professor would say introducing homer to the dog this is rufuss rug this is his kingdom when rufus is sleeping on his kingdom do not wake himunless you are prepared for him to snap whereupon the professor would rouse the ancient dog who would snap awakeand then appear to puzzle over the air he had bitten tasting in it the drapers grownup children now married and with children of their own homer met them all for thanksgiving thanksgiving with the drapers was an experience in family guaranteed to make other families feel inferior mom would outdo herself at momness the professor had a lecture ready on every conceivable subject the qualities of white meat and of dark the last election the pretension of salad forks the superiority of the nineteenthcentury novel not to mention other aspects of that centurys superiority the proper texture of cranberry sauce the meaning of repentance the wholesomeness of exercise including a comparison between splitting wood and ice skating the evil inherent in naps to each laboriously expressed opinion of the professors his grown children two married women one married man would respond with a fairly balanced mixture of just so isnt that always the way right again professor these robotlike responses were punctuated with equal precision by moms oftrepeated grain of salt grain of salt homer wells listened to these steady rhythms like a visitor from another world trying to decipher a strange tribes drums he couldnt quite catch on the seeming constancy of everyone was overwhelming he wouldnt know until he was much older just which it was that didnt set well with himthe implicit and explicit and selfcongratulatory dogooderism or the heartiness with which life was tediously oversimplified whichever it was he stopped liking it it became an obstacle in the path he was looking for that led to himself to who he was or should be he remembered various thanksgivings at st clouds they were not so cheery as the waterville thanksgiving with the draper family but they seemed a lot more real he remembered how he had felt of use there were always babies who couldnt feed themselves there was the likelihood of a snowstorm that would knock out the electricity homer was put in charge of the candles and the kerosene lamps he was also in charge of helping the kitchen staff clear of helping nurse angela and nurse edna comfort the crying of being dr larchs messenger the most prized responsibility that was conferred in the boys division before he was ten and long before he would be given such explicit instruction from dr larch homer felt full of usefulness at st clouds what was it about thanksgiving at the drapers that contrasted so severely with the same event at st clouds mom had no match as a cook it couldnt have been the foodwhich at st clouds suffered from a visible and seemingly terminal grayness was it the saying of grace at st clouds grace was a rather blunt instrument dr larch not being a religious man let us be thankful he would say and then pause as if he were truly wondering what for let us be thankful for what kindness we have received larch would say cautiously looking at the unwanted and abandoned around him let us be thankful for nurse angela and for nurse edna he would add with more assurance in his voice let us be thankful that weve got options that weve got second chances he added once looking at homer wells the event of graceat thanksgiving at st clouds was shrouded with chance with understandable caution with typically larchlike reserve grace at the drapers was effusive and strange it seemed somehow connected with the professors defini tion of the meaning of repentance professor draper said that the start of real repentance was to accept yourself as vile for grace the professor cried out say after me i am vile i abhor myself but i am thankful for everyone in my family they all said soeven homer even mom who for once withheld her recommended grain of salt st clouds was a sober place but its manner of giving what little thanks it could seemed frank sincere some contradiction in the draper family occurred to homer wells for the first time at thanksgiving unlike st clouds life in waterville seemed goodbabies for example were wanted where did repentance come from then was there guilt attached to feeling lucky and if larch as homer had been told was named from a tree god whom homer heard a lot about in waterville seemed to be named from even tougher stuff maybe from mountain maybe from ice if god was sobering in waterville the draper thanksgiving wasto homers surprise a drunken occasion the professor was in moms words in his cups this homer deduced meant that the professor had consumed more than his normal daily amount of alcoholwhich in moms words made him only tipsy homer was shocked to see the two married daughters and the married son behave as if they were in their cups too and since thanksgiving was special and he was allowed to stay up latewith all the grandchildrenhomer observed that nightly occurrence he had previously only heard as he was falling asleep the thudding dragging shuffling sound and the muffled voice of reason which was the professor slurring his protest of the fact that mom forcibly assisted him upstairs and with astonishing strength lifted him to and deposited him upon the bed value of exercise shouted the grown and married son before toppling from the green chaise and collapsing upon the rug beside old ruf usas if hed been poisoned like father like son said one of the married daughters the other married daughter homer noted had nothing to say she slept peacefully in the rocking chair her whole handabove the second knuckle jointswas submerged in her nearly full drink which rested precariously in her lap the unmanaged grandchildren violated the houses million rules the professors passionate readings of various riot acts were seemingly ignored for thanksgiving homer wells not yet ten crept quietly to his bed invoking an especially sad memory of st clouds was a way he frequently forced sleep upon himself what he remembered was the time he saw the mothers leaving the orphanage hospital which was within view of the girls division and which adjoined the boys divisionthey were architecturally linked by a long shed formerly a storage room for spare blades to the circular saw it was early morning but it was still dark out and homer needed the coach lights in order to see that it was snowing he slept badly and was often awake for the arrival of the coach which came from the railroad station and delivered to st clouds the kitchen and cleaning staff and the first hospital shift the coach was simply an abandoned railroad car set on sled runners in the winter it was a converted sleigh pulled by horses when there wasnt enough snow on the dirt road the sled runners struck sparks against the stones in the ground and made a terrible grating noise they were reluctant to change the runners for wheels until they knew the winter was over a bright light like a flare sputtered by the heavily blanketed driver on the makeshift carriage seat softer lights winked inside the coach car this morning homer noted there were women waiting in the snow to be picked up by the coach homer wells didnt recognize the women who fidgeted the whole time it took the st clouds staff to unload there seemed to be a certain tension between these groups the women waiting to board appeared shy even ashamed the men and women coming to work seemed by comparison arrogant even superior and one of them it was a woman made a rough remark to the women waiting to leave homer couldnt hear the remark but its effect drove the waiting women away from the coach like a blast of the winter wind the women who boarded the coach did not look back or even at each other they didnt even speak and the driver who struck homer as a friendly man who had something to say to nearly everyone in any weather had no word for them the coach simply turned around and glided across the snow to the station in the lit windows homer wells could see that several of the women had their faces in their hands or sat as stonily as the other kind of mourner at a funeralthe one who must assume an attitude of total disinterest or else risk total loss of control he had never before seen the mothers who had their unwanted babies at st clouds and then left them there and he didnt see them very clearly this time it was unquestionably more meaningful that he first saw them as they were taking their leave rather than arriving fullbellied and undelivered of their problems importantly homer knew they did not look delivered of all their problems when they left no one he had seen looked more miserable than those women he suspected it was no accident that they left in darkness when he tried to put himself to sleep thanksgiving night with the drapers in waterville homer wells saw the mothers leaving in the snow but he also saw more than hed actually seen on the nights he couldnt sleep homer rode in the coach to the station with the women he boarded the train with them he went to their homes with them he singled out his mother and followed her it was hard to see what she looked like and where she lived where shed come from if shed gone back thereand harder still was to imagine who his father was and if she went back to him like most orphans homer wells imagined that he saw his missing parents often but he was always unrecognized by them as a child he was embarrassed to be caught staring at adults sometimes affectionately other times with an instinctual hostility he would not have recognized on his own face you stop it homer dr larch used to say to him at those times you just cut it out as an adult homer wells would still get caught staring but on thanksgiving night in waterville he stared so hard into his real parents lives that he almost found them before he fell asleep exhausted he was abruptly awakened by one of the grandchildren an older boy homer had forgotten he was going to share his bed with him because the house was crowded move over the boy said homer moved over keep your pecker in your pajamas the boy told homer who had no intention of taking it out you know what buggering is the boy asked then no homer said yes you do pecker head the boy said thats what you all do at saint clouds you bugger yourselves all the time im telling you you try to bugger me and youll go back there without your pecker the boy said ill cut off your pecker and feed it to the dog you mean rufus homer wells asked thats right pecker head the boy said you want to tell me again you dont know what buggering is i dont know homer said you want me to show you dont you the boy asked i dont think so homer said yes you do pecker head the boy said and he then tried to bugger homer wells homer had never seen or heaid of anyone being so abused at st clouds although the older boy had learned his style of buggery at a private schoola very good onehe had never been educated in the kind of crying that homer wells bad been taught by the family from three mile falls it seemed to homer that it was a good time for crying loudlyif one wanted to escape the buggeryand his crying immediately awakened the one adult in the draper household who had merely gone to sleep as opposed to passing out in other words homer woke mom he woke all the grandchildren too and since several of them were younger than homer and all of them had no knowledge of homers capacity for howls his crying produced sheer terror among themand even aroused rufus who snapped what in heavens name mom asked at homers door he tried to bugger me so i let him have it said the private school boy homer who was struggling to get his legendary howls under controlto send them back to historydidnt know that grandchildren are believed before orphans here in st clouds wrote dr larch it is selfdefeating and cruel to give much thought to ancestors in other parts of the world im sorry to say an orphans ancestors are always under suspicion mom hit homer as hard as any representative of the failed family from three mile falls ever hit him she then banished him to the furnace room for the remainder of the night it was at least warm and dry there and there was a foldout cot which in the summers was used for camping trips there were also lots of wet shoesa pair of which even belonged to homer some of the wet socks were almost dry and fit him and the assortment of wet snowsuits and hardy tramping clothes gave homer an adequate selection he dressed himself in warm outdoor clothes which werefor the most partnearly dry he knew that mom and the professor thought too highly of family ever to send him back to st clouds over a mere buggery if he wanted to go back and he did hed have to leave on his own initiative in fact mom had provided homer with a vision of how his alleged buggery would be treated and doubtlessly cured shed made him kneel before the foldout cot in the furnace room say after me she said and repeated the professors strange version of grace i am vile i abhor myself mom said and homer had said it after herknowing that every word was untrue hed never liked himself so much he felt he was on the track to finding out who he was and how he could be of use but he knew that the path led back to st clouds when mom kissed him good night she said now homerji dont mind what the professor has to say about this whatever he says you just take it with a grain of salt homer wells didnt wait to hear the text of the professors lesson regarding buggery homer stepped outside even the snow didnt stop him in waterville in it was no surprise to see so much snow on the ground for thanksgiving and professor draper had very carefully instructed homer on the merits and methods of snowshoeing homer was a good tramper he found the town road fairly easily and the bigger road after that it was daylight when the first truck stopped it was a logging truck this seemed to homer appropriate to where he was going i belong to saint clouds he told the driver i got lost in every logger knew where st clouds was this driver knew it was in the other direction youre going the wrong way kid he advised the boy turn around and look for a truck going the other way what are you from saint clouds the driver asked like most people he assumed that orphans were always running away from the orphanagenot running to it i just belong there homer wells said and the driver waved goodbye in dr larchs opinion this driver in order to be so insensitive as to let a boy go off alone in the snowsimply had to be an employee of the ramses paper company the next driver was also driving a logging truck it was empty it was heading back to the forest for more logs and st clouds was more or less on the way you an orphan the driver asked homer when he said he was going to st clouds no homer said i just belong therefor now in it took a long time to drive anywhere in maine especially with snow on the roads it was growing dark when homer wells returned to his home the quality of the light was the same as the early morning when hed seen the mothers leaving their babies behind homer stood at the hospital entrance for a while and watched the snow fall then he went and stood at the entrance to the boys division then he went back and stood outside the hospital entrance because there was better light there he was still thinking of exactly what to say to dr larch when the coach from the railroad stationthat unmerry sleighstopped at the hospital entrance and let out a single passeinger she was so pregnant that the driver at first appeared concerned she might slip and fall then the driver appeared to realize why the woman had come here and it must have struck him as immoral that he should actually help a woman like that through the snow he drove off and left her making her careful way toward the entrance and toward homer wells homer rang the bell at the entrance for the woman who didnt seem to know what to do it occurred to him that she was hoping for a little time to think of what she too wanted to say to dr larch to anyone seeing them there this was a mother with her son there was just that kind of familiarity in the way that they looked at each other and in the clear recognition between themthey knew perfectly well what the other was up to homer was worried what dr larch would say to him but he realized that the woman was more worried than he wasthe woman didnt know dr larch she had no idea what sort of place st clouds was more lights were turned on inside and homer recognized the divine shape of nurse angela coming to open the door for some reason he reached out arid took the pregnant womans hand maybe it was the tear frozen to her face that the new light had allowed him to see but he wanted a hand to hold himself he wais calm homer wellsas nurse angela peered into the snowy night in disbelief while she struggled to open the frozen door to the pregnant woman and to her unwanted child homer said dont worry everyone is nice here he felt the pregnant woman squeeze his hand so hard that it hurt the word mother was strangely on his lips when nurse angela finally got the door open and seized homer wells in her arms oh ohy she cried oh homermy homer our homer i knew youd be back and because the pregnant womans hand still firmly held homers handneither one of them felt able to let gonurse angela turned and included the woman in her embrace it seemed to nurse angela that this pregnant woman was just another orphan who belonged like homer wells exactly where she was what he told dr larch was that hed felt of no use in waterville because of what the drapers had said when theyd called larch to say that homer had run away homer had to explain about the buggeryafterward st larch explained all about buggery to homer the professors drinking surprised dr larch he was good as a rule at detecting that and the prayers baffled larch dr larchs note to the drapers was of a brevity the professors own language rarely allowed repent the note said larch might have left it at that but he couldnt resist adding you are vile you should abhor yourselves wilbur larch knew that a fourth foster family for homer wells would not be easy to find the search took dr larch three years by which time homer was twelvealmost thirteen larch knew what the danger would be it would take homer a great many years to feel as comfortable anywhere else as he felt at st clouds here in st clouds larch wrote in his journal we have only one problem that there will always be orphans is not in the category of a problem that is simply not to be solvedone does the best one can with that one takes care of them that our budget will always be too small is also not a problem that wont be solved eitheran orphanage goes down to the wire by definition that is what should happen and it is not a problem that every woman who gets pregnant doesnt necessarily want her baby perhaps we can look ahead to a more enlightened time when women will have the right to abort the birth of an unwanted childbut some women will always be uneducated will always be confused will always be frightened even in enlightened times unwanted babies will manage to be born and there will always be babies who were very much wanted who will end up orphansby accident by both planned and random acts of violence which are not problems either here in st clouds we would waste our limited energy and our limited imagination by regarding the sordid facts of life as if they were problems here in st clouds we have only one problem his name is homer wells we have been very successful with homer we have managed to make the orphanage his home and that is the problem if you try to give an institution of the state or of any government anything like the love one is meant to invest in a familyand if the institution is an orphanage and you succeed in giving it lovethen you will create a monster an orphanage that is not a waystation to a better life but an orphanage that is the first and last stop and the only station the orphan will accept there is no excuse for cruelty butat an orphanage perhaps we are obliged to withhold love if you fail to withhold love at an orphanage you will create an orphanage that no orphan will willingly leave you will create a homer wellsa true orphan because his only home will always be at st clouds god or whoever forgive me i have made an orphan his name is homer wells and he will belong to st clouds forever by the time homer was twelve he had the run of the place he knew its stoves and its wood boxes its fuse boxes its linen closets its laundry room its kitchen its corners where the cats sleptwhen the mail carne who got any everyones name who w as on what shift where the mothers went to be shaved when they arrived how long the mothers stayed whenand with what necessary assistancethey left he knew the bells in fact he rang them he knew who the tutors were he could recognize their style of walking from the train station when they were still two hundred yards away he was even known at the girls division although the very few girls older than he was frightened him and he spent as little time there as he couldgoing only on errands for dr larch messages and delivering medicines the director of the girls division was not a doctor so when the girls were sick either they visited dr larch at the hospital or larch went to the girls division to visit them the director of the girls division was boston irish and had worked for a while at the new england home for little wanderers her name was mrs grogan although she never mentioned mr grogan and no one seeing her would have an easy time imagining that there had ever been a man in her life she may have preferred the sound of missus to the sound of miss at the new england home for little wanderers she had belonged to a society called gods little servants which had given dr larch pause but mrs grogan showed no signs of seeking members for such a society in st clouds perhaps she was too busyin addition to her duties as director of the girls division she was responsible for arranging what little education was available for the orphans if there was an orphan who remained at st clouds past the sixth grade level of school there was no school to go toand the only school for grades one through six was in three mile falls this was only a onestation stop on the train from st clouds but in the trains were often delayed and the thursday engineer was notorious for forgetting to stop at the st clouds station as if the sight of so many abandoned buildings convinced him that st clouds was still a ghost town or perhaps he disapproved of the women who got off the train there the majority of the pupils in the oneroom schoolhouse in three mile falls thought themselves superior to the occasional orphans in attendance this feeling prevailed the most strongly among those students who came from families where they were neglected or abused or both and thus grades one through six for homer wells were comprised of experiences more combative than educational he missed three thursdays out of four for years and at least one other day every week because of a late train in the winters he missed a day a week because he was sick and when there was too much snow the trains didnt run the three tutors suffered the same perils pressed upon the train service in those years because they all came to st clouds from three mile falls there was a woman who taught math she was a bookkeeper for a textile mill a reallife accountant nurse edna claimedbut she refused to have anything to do with algebra or geometry and she firmly preferred addition and subtraction to multiplication and division homer wells would be a grown man before dr larch would discover that the boy had never learned the multiplication table another woman a welltodo plumbers widow taught grammar and spelling her method was rigorous and messy she presented great clumps of uncapitalized misspelled and unpunctuated words and demanded that the clumps be put into proper sentences meticulously punctuated and correctly spelled she then corrected the corrections the final documentshe employed a system of differentcolored inksresembled a muchrevised treaty between two serniliterate countries at war the text itself was always strange to homer wells even when it was finally correct this was because the woman borrowed heavily from a family hymnal and homer wells had never seen a church or heard a hymn unless one counted christmas carols or the songs mrs grogan sangand the plumbers widow was not such a fool that she used christmas carols homer wells used to have nightmares about deciphering the passages that the plumbers widow concocted o lorde mi got wen i en ausum wundor konsider al the wurlds thi hends hav mad or there was this one o ruck of eges clift fur me let mi hid misulf en theee and so forth the third tutor a retired schoolteacher from camden was an old unhappy man who lived with his daughters family because he couldnt take care of himself he taught history but he had no books he taught the world from memory he said the dates werent important he was capable of sustaining a rant about mesopotamia for a full half hour but when he paused for breath or for a sip of water he would find himself in rome or in troy he would recite long uninterrupted passages from thucydides but a mere swallow would transport him to elba with napoleon i think nurse edna once remarked to dr larch that he manages to give a sense of the scope of history nurse angela rolled her eyes whenever i try to listen to him she said i can think of a hundred good reasons for war she meant homer wells understood that no one should live so long it is easy to understand why homer was more fond of doing chores than he was fond of education homers favorite chore was selecting for dr larch the evening reading he was supposed to estimate a passage that would take dr larch exactly twenty minutes to read this was difficult because when homer read aloud to himself he read more slowly than dr larch but when he simply read to himself he read more quickly than dr larch could read aloud at twenty minutes an evening it took dr larch several months to read greatexpectations and more than a year to read davidcopperfieldat the end of which time st larch announced to homer that he would start at the beginning of great expectations again except for homer the orphans whod first heard great expectations had moved on almost none of them understood great expectations or david copperfield anyway they were not only too young for the dickerisian language they were also too young to comprehend the usual language of st clouds what mattered to dr larch was the idea of reading aloudit was a successful soporific for the children who didnt know what they were listening to and for those few who understood the words and the story the evening reading provided them with a way to leave st clouds in their dreams in their imaginations dickens was a personal favorite of dr larch it was no accident of course that both great expectations and david copperfield were concerned with orphans what in hell else would you read to an orphan dr larch inquired in his journal and so homer wells was familiar with the vision of that gibbet in the marshlandwith some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirateand homers imagination of the orphan pip and the convict magwitchthe beautiful estella the vengeful miss havishamprovided him with sharper details when falling asleep he would follow the ghostly mothers who left st clouds in the cover of darkness and boarded the horsedrawn coach cair or later the bus which replaced the coach and gave homer wells his first sensation of the passage of time of progress soon after the bus replaced the coach all bus service in st clouds was discontinued thereafter the mothers walked this gave homer further understanding of progress the mothers he saw in his sleep never changed but the men who had not bothered to accompany them to st cloudswhere were they homer liked the part in great expectations when pip is just starting out and he says that the mists had all solemnly risenand the world lay spread before me a boy from st clouds knew plenty about miststhey were what shrouded the river the town the orphanage itself they drifted downriver from three mile falls they were what concealed ones parents they were the clouds of st clouds that allowed ones parents to slip away unseen homer dr larch would say one day youll get to see the ocean youve only been as far as the mountains theyre not nearly as spectacular as the sea theres fog on the coastit can be worse than the fog hereand when the fog lifts homerwell said st larch thats a moment you must see but homer wells had already seen it hed already imagined itthe mistsall solemnly risen he smiled at dr larch and excused himself it was time to ring a bell that was what he was doingbellringing when his fourth foster family arrived at st clouds to fetch him dr larch had prepared him very well homer had no trouble recognizing the couple they were in todays language sportsoriented in maine in when homer wells was twelve the couple who wanted to adopt him were simply thought fanatical about everything that could be done outdoors they were a whitewatercanoeing couple an oceansailing couplea mountainclimbing deepseadiving wildernesscamping couple a onehundredmile at forcedmarchpace tramping couple athletesbut not of organized sports they were not a sissysport couple the day they arrived at st clouds homer wells rang the bell for ten oclock fourteen times he was transfixed by themby their solid muscular looks by their loping strides by his safari hat by her bushwhacking machete in a long sheath with indian beads at her cartridge belt they both wore boots that looked lived in their vehicle was a homemade pioneer of what would years later be called a camper it looked equipped to capture and contain a rhino homer instantly foresaw that he would be made to hunt bears wrestle alligatorsin short live off the land nurse edna stopped him before he could ring fifteen oclock wilbur larch was being cautious he didnt fear for homers mind a boy who has read great expectations and david copperfield by himself twice eachand had each word of both books read aloud to him also twice is more mentally prepared than most dr larch felt that the boys physical or athletic development had been less certain sports seemed frivolous to larch when compared to the learning of more necessary more fundamental skills larch knew that the st clouds sports programwhich consisted of indoor football in the dining hall when there was bad weatherwas inadequate in good weather the boys and girls divisions played tag or kick the can or sometimes nurse edna or nurse angela pitched for stickball the ball was composed of several socks wrapped in adhesive tape it moved poorly larch had nothing against an outdoor life he also knew nothing about one he guessed that a little of its wasted energy wasted to larch would be good for homerpossibly such physical activity might enhance the boys sense of humor the couples name was a source of humor for nurse edna and nurse angela their married name was winklehe was called grant she was called billy they were members of maines very small money class their business as they ridiculously called it didnt make a cent but they didnt need to make money they were born rich their needless enterprise consisted of taking people to the wilderness and creating for them the sensation that they were lost there they also took people shooting down rapids in frail rafts or canoes creating for them the sensation that they would surely be bashed to death before they drowned the winkles were in the business of manufacturing sensations for people who were so removed from any sensations of their own making or circumstances that only high but simulated adventure could provoke any response from them at all dr larch was not impressed with the winkles business he knew that they were simply rich people who did exactly what they wanted to do and needed to call what they did something more serioussounding than play what impressed larch with the winkles was that they were deliriously happy among adultsand among orphanswilbur larch noted that delirious happiness was rare in other parts of the world dr larch wrote delirious happiness is thought to be a state of mind here in st clouds we recognize that delirious happiness is possible only for the totally mindless i would call it therefore that thing most rare a state of the soul larch was often facetious when he discussed the soul he liked to tease nurse edna and nurse angela in the operating room where the subject of the soul could catch the dear nurses offguard once with a body open on the table larch pointed dramatically to a smooth maroon shape beneath the rib cage and above the bellys viscera it looked like a threepound loaf of bread or a slug with two great lobes look larch whispered you rarely see it but weve caught it napping look quickly before it moves the nurses gaped the soul larch whispered reverentially in fact it was the bodys largest gland empowered with skills also ascribed to the soulfor example it could regenerate its own abused cells it was the liver which larch thought more of than he thought of the soul but whether the delirious happiness of the winkles was a state of mind or a state of the soul wilbur larch wished that some of it could rub off on homer wells the winkles had always wanted a childto share the world of nature with us they said and just to make a child happy of course looking at them dr larch had his own ideas as to why they could not successfully breed lack of the essential concentration larch thought larch suspected that the winkles never stopped moving long enough to mate perhaps he speculated looking at billy winkle she is not really a woman grant had a plan he has no face dr larch noticed trying to discern the mans blunt features somewhere between his blond beard and his blonder hair the hair was cropped in bangs completely concealing a low forehead the cheeks or what larch could see of them were a ridge the eyes hidden behind them the rest was bearda blond underbrush that dr larch imagined billy winkle needed her machete to hack through grants plan was that they borrow homer for a little moosewatching the winkles were going on a canoe trip and portage through the northern state forest the principal fun of which was to see moose a secondary pleasure would be introducing homer wells to a little white water st larch felt that such a trip in the massive hands of the winkles wouldnt be dangerous for homer he felt less sure that homer would want to stay with these people to actually be adopted by them he hardly worried that the winkles craziness would bother the boy and it wouldnt have what boy is troubled by perpetual adventure what wilbur larch suspected was that the winkles would bore homer to tears if not to death a camping trip in the state forestwhite water now and then a moose or twomight give the boy an idea of whether or not he could stand grant and billy forever and if you have a good time in the woods grant winkle told homer cheerfully then well take you out on the ocean they probably ride whales homer imagined they tease sharks dr larch thought but dr larch wanted homer to try it and homer wells was willinghe would try anything for st larch nothing dangerous larch said sternly to the winkles oh no cross our hearts cried billy grant crossed his too dr larch knew there was only one road hat ran through the northern state forest it was built by and remained the property of the ramses paper company they were not allowed to cut the trees in the state forest but they could drive their equipment through it en route to the trees that were theirs only thisthat homer was going anywhere near where the ramses paper company was operatingtroubled dr larch homer was surprised at how little room there was in the cab of the homemade safari vehicle that the winkles drove the equipment it carried was impressive the canoe the tent the fishing gear the cooking miscellany the guns but there was little room for the driver and the passengers in the cab homer sat on billys lap it was a big lap but strangely uncomfortable because of the hardness of her thighs homer had felt a womans lap only once before during st clouds annual threelegged race once a year the boys and girls divisions amused the town with this race it was a fundraiser for the orphanage so everyone endured it the last two years homer had won the raceonly because his partner the oldest girl in the girls division was strong enough to pick him up and run with him in her arms across the finish line the idea was that a boy and a girl of comparable age fastened his left leg to her right they then hopped toward the finish line on each of their free legs dragging the miserable socalled third leg between them the big girl from the girls division hadnt needed to drag homer she cheated she just carried him but last year she had fallen at the finish line pulling homer into her lap by mistake trying to get out of her lap hed put his hand on her breast and shed sharply pinched what the private school boy in waterville had called his pecker her name was melony which was like several of the orphans names in the girls division a typographical error melonys name had been officially melody but the girls division secretary was a terrible typist the mistyping was a fortunate mistake actually because there was nothing melodious about the girl she was about sixteen no one really knew her exact age and there was in the fullness of her breasts and in the roundness of her bottom very much the suggestion of melons in the long ride north homer worried that billy winkle might pinch his pecker too he watched the houses disappear and the farm animals other cars and trucks were gone from the roads soon it was just a road a single roadmost often it ran alongside water the water ran fast ahead of themfor hours it seemed loomed a mountain that had snow on the top although it was july the mountain had an indian name thats where were going homer grant winkle told the boy just under all that snow theres a lake the moose are crazy about the lake billy told homer and youll be crazy about the lake too homer didnt doubt it it was an adventure dr larch had told him he didnt have to stay the winkles stopped for the night before it got dark between the single road and the rushing water they pitched a tent with three rooms in it they lit a cookstove in one of the rooms and billy did one hundred situps in another room homer held her feet while grant caught some brook trout it was such a cool evening there werent any bugs they kept the lamps running long after dark with the tent flaps open grant and billy told adventure stories in his journal dr larch would later write what the hell else would they tell grant told about the sixtyyearold lawyer who had hired them to show him a bear giving birth billy showed homer her bear scars and then there was the man who had asked the winkles to cast him adrift at sea in a small boatwith only one oar this man had been interested in the sensation of survival he wanted to see if he could find his way back to land but he wanted the winkles to observe him and rescue him if he was getting into real trouble the trick to that was not letting the man know he was being observed at nightwhen the fool fell asleep and drifted farther out to seathe winkles would cautiously tow him toward shore but in the morning once even within sight of landthe man always found a way to get lost again they finally had to rescue him when they caught him drinking salt water hed been so disappointed he gave them several bad checks before he finally paid his adventure fee adventure fee was billys name for it homer thought it might make his wouldbe adoptive parents selfconscious if he told them any stories about life at st cloudsor worse about thanksgiving in waterville he felt he had to contribute something to the campfire spirit of this present adventure but the only good stories he knew were great expectations and davidcopperfield dr larch had let him take the copy of great expectations with him it was homers favorite of the two homer asked the winkles if he could read them a little of his favorite story of course they said theyd love it theyd never been read to not that they could remember homer was a little nervous as many times as hed read great expectations hed never read aloud to an audience before but he was wonderful he even mastered what he guessed was joe gargerys accent and by the time he got to the part where mr wopsle cries out no with the feeble malice of a tired man homer sensed he had found the proper voice for the whole talehe felt he might also have discovered his first talent unfortunately talented though he was his reading put the winkles fast asleep homer kept reading by himself through the end of chapter maybe its not my reading homer thought maybe its the winklesall her situps all his troutcatching all the fierce rigor of the indisputably great outdoors homer attempted to arrange the winkles sleeping baga huge single bagcomfortably around them he blew out the lamps he went to his own room in the vast tent and crawled into his own sleeping bag he lay with his head by the open tent flap he could see the stars he could hear the nearby crashing water it did not remind him of three mile falls because the stream here was so different from that river it was just as fast but it ran through a deep narrow gorgesparkling clean roundbouldered with glossy pools where grant had caught the trout it was not unpleasant imagining further adventures with the winkles but homer had more trouble imagining a moose exactly how big would a moose be bigger than the winkles homer exhibited no mistrust and certainly no fear of the winkles he felt for them only a detached wariness he was sure they werent dangerous but they were of a slightly altered species he fell asleep confusing the winkles in his childs mind with moose in the morning he woke up to the sound of what he was sure were moose only to discover that it was the winkles in the tent room next to his the winkles appeared to greet the morning vigorously although homer had never heard human beings make love or moose mate he knew perfectly well that the winkles were mating if dr larch had been present he might have drawn new conclusions concerning the winkles inability to produce offspring he would have concluded that the violent athleticism of their coupling simply destroyed or scared to death every available egg and sperm homer politely feigned sleep the winkles then roused him playfully like large dogs they burst into his room on all fours tugging at his sleeping bag with their teeth they were going to swim they told him they were such large people homer wondered at the sheer abundance of their active flesh he also wondered how they intended to swim in the raging stream without being bashed against the boulders and swept away homer didnt know how to swimnot even in calm water but the winkles were old hands at outdoor feats of skill and they were cunning with equipment they threw a line across the rapids it was called a survival rope they told homer the rope attached to a rakelike cluster of spikes which grant winkle neatly lodged among the rocks on the far shore of the roaring river he then strung a second rope to this one and then a third these additional ropes were complicated with metal eyelets and hooks and adjustable safety straps that went around the winkles themselves and held them tightly at their waists with the assistance of this truly adventuresome gear the winkles were able to bounce semisuspended into the thick of the rapidswhere they were tossed about like bathtub toys while remaining safely in the same place attached to each other and to the socalled survival rope it was fun for homer to watch them the water seemed to swallow them completely at timesstreaming sheets of it would engulf them and suck them down yet they would emerge in seconds bouncing appearing to walk across the churning rolling foam they played in midstream like giant blond otters homer was very nearly convinced of their mastery of the elementsat least of waterand felt himself to be on the verge of asking them to let him try the game of showering in the rapids when it occurred to him that they couldnt hear him if hed called out to themeven if hed screamedthe whoosh of the turbid water all around the winkles would have drowned out any noise he could muster he had resolved therefore to remain sitting on the shore and watch his wouldbe adoptive parents play when the ground began to shake under him he knew this more from certain badly told stories in badly written childrens books than from the felt recognition of the moving ground itself in those childrens books when something terrible is about to happen the ground always shakes he almost chose not to believe it but the ground was unmistakably trembling a dull hammering reached his ears homer watched the winkles more closely believing them to be in control of everything the winkles continued to play in the rapids they heard nothing they didnt feel the ground shake because they werent on the ground oh my god a moose is coming thought homer wells he stood up he watched his feet hopall by themselves on the jumping ground it is a herd of moose he thought to add to the hammering sound homer now heard sharper noises cracks some as startling as pistol shots he looked at the winkles and could tell that theyd heard these harsh slaps too whatever it was that was coming the winkles were familiar with it their entire attitude changedthey were no longer playful they seemed to be struggling and on their faces now disappearing in the rushing white froth their expressions were both knowledgeable and frightened when they got a second to look between plunges into the rapids they looked upstream so did homerin time to see the log drive when it was about twentyfive yards away the trees along the shoreline were occasionally snapped off as cleanly as kindling snapped over a kneeby a random log as big as a telephone pole but stouter hurtling out of the water striking a boulder and spinning for twenty feet through the air leveling a patch of forest wherever it crashed and rolled on the mass of logs each as big as telephone poles moved swiftly downstream with a wall of water in front of it this water was not like the clear water of the river but muddy with turmoil clogged with slabs of bark messy with whole chunks of ground that had been gouged out of the shore the ramses paper company called it a modest log drive they said thered been no more than four hundred maybe seven hundred logs in that particular drive downriver homer wells was still running when he reached the road where he was safe he turned in time to see the logs surge by a line from the tent had been attached to the winkles survival rope and the entire tent and everything in it homers copy of great expectations too were swept downstream in the pounding flow and charge of logs the ramses paper company wouldnt recover billy and grants bodies for three days they found them nearly four miles away homer wells was fairly calm he looked upstream waiting for more of anything upstream was clearly the direction whatever might come next would come from after a while he relaxed he examined the winkles safari vehicle which looked naked without the tent and the kitchen equipment he found some fishing gear but he didnt dare to fish it meant standing too close to the stream he found some guns but he had no idea how they worked he felt comforted that the guns were there however he chose the biggest most dangerouslooking onea twelvegauge doublesbarrel shotgunand dragged it around with him he was quite hungry by midafternoori but before it was dark he heard a logging truck coming nearer and nearer he knew it was a full one because of the straining sound of the gears it was also a piece of luck on the order of his not knowing how to swim and therefore not joining the winkles in their sport that the truck was going homers way saint clouds he told the baffled driver who was impressed with the shotgun it was a ramses paper company truck and dr larch was at first furious to see it pull up to the hospital entrance unless this is an absolute emergency he told the smitten nurse edna i will not do a stitch of work on anyone from that company larch was actually disappointed to see homer wells and alarmed to see the shotgun homer had the bewildered expression on his face of the many patients larch had observed emerging from the spell of ether you didnt give the winkles much of a chance homer dr larch said gravely then homer explained why hed come back so soon you mean the winkles are gone dr larch asked swept away said homer wells whoosh that was when wilbur larch gave up on finding homer wells a home that was when dr larch said that homer could stay at st clouds for as long as homer felt he belonged there that was when st larch said well then homer i expect you to be of use for homer wells this was easy of use he felt was all that an orphan was born to be the lords work a child of maine wilbur larch was born in portland in the son of a sullen tidy woman who was among the staff of cooks and housekeepers for a man named neal dow the mayor of portland and the socalled father of the maine law that introduced prohibition to that state neal dow once ran for the presidency as the candidate of the prohibition party but he won barely ten thousand votesproving that the general voter was wiser than wilbur larchs mother who worshiped her employer and saw herself more as his coworker for temperance reform than as his servant which she was interestingly wilbur larchs father was a drunk no small feat in the portland of mayor dows day it was permitted to advertise beer in the shop windowsscotch ale and bitter beer which wilbur larchs father consumed copiously it was necessary he claimed to drink these weak brews by the bucketful in order to get a buzz on to young wilbur his father never looked drunkhe never staggered or fell or lay in a stupor he never shouted or slurred his speech rather he had about him the appearance of one perpetually surprised of one given to frequent and sudden revelations that would stop him in his tracks or in midsentence as if something had just come to him or had just escaped him that had preoccupied him for days he shook his head a lot and all his life dispensed this misinformation that the nineteenthousaridton ship the great eastern which was built in portland was destined to sail the north atlantic between europe and maine it was the opinion of wilbur larchs father that the two best wharves in portland harbor had been built specifically for the great eastern that the new and huge hotel in portland had been built expressly to house the greateasterns passengers and that someone evil or at least corrupt or just plain foolish was responsible for keeping the great eastern from returning to her home port in maine wilbur larchs father had worked as a lathe operator during the building of the great eastern and perhaps the complaining noise of that machinery and the constant buzz he felt from all the beer he consumed had deceived him the great eastern had not been built for voyages to and from portland she was originally intended for the route to australia but the many delays in getting her to sea drove her owners to bankruptcy and she was purchased for use on the north atlantic route for which she proved unsuitable she was in fact a failure so wilbur larchs father had an addled memory of his days as a lathe operator and he had considerable loathing for temperance reform his wifes beliefs and his wifes employer mayor neal dow himself in the opinion of wilbur larchs father the great eastern didnt return to portland because of prohibitionthat curse which had limited him to a bilious dependency on scotch ale and bitter beer since wilbur knew his father only in the mans later years when the great eastern was gone and his father was a porter in the portland station of the grand trunk railway he could only imagine why working a woodturning machine had been the high point of his fathers life as a boy it never occurred to wilbur larch that his fathers missing fingers were the result of too many scotch ales and bitter beers while operating the lathejust accidents his father saidor that his mothers zeal for temperance reform might be the result of a lathe operators demotion to porter of course wilbur realized later his parents were servants their disappointment made wilbur become what his teachers called a whale of a student although he grew up in the mayors mansion wilbur larch always used the kitchen entrance and ate his meals with the great prohibitionists hired help his father drank his meals down at the docks wilbur larch was a good student because he preferred the company of books to overhearing his mothers talk of temperance with mayor dows servants he went to bowdoin college and to harvard medical schoolwhere a fascination with bacteria almost deterred him from practicing medicine almost turned him into a laboratory animal or at least a bacteriologist he had a gift for the field his professor told him and he enjoyed the careful atmosphere of the laboratory also he had a burning desire to learn about bacteria for nearly a year of medical school young wilbur carried a bacterium that so offended and pained him that he was driven by more than scientific curiosity to discover its cure he had gonorrhea a gift indirectly from his father the old man in his beer buzz had been so proud of wilbur that he sent him to medicine school in with a present he bought the boy a portland whore setting up his son with a night of supposed pleasure in one of the wharf side boardinghouses it was a present the boy had been too embarrassed to refuse his fathers selfish nostalgia allowed him so few gestures toward his son his mothers bitter righteousness was selfish in her own way young wilbur was touched that his father had offered to give him anything in the boardinghousethe wood dry with salt and a seadamp clinging to the curtains and to the bedspread the whore reminded wilbur of one of his mothers more attractive servantcolleagues he shut his eyes and tried to imagine that he was embarking on a forbidden romance in a back room of the mayors mansion when he opened his eyes he saw the candlelight deepening the stretch marks across the whores abdomen he didnt know they were stretch marks then the whore seemed unconcerned whether wilbur noticed the stretch marks or not in fact as they fell asleep with his head on her stomach he was vaguely wondering if the womans wrinkles would transfer to his facemarking him a sharp unpleasant smell awakened him and he moved quickly off the woman without disturbing her in a chair in the room the one where shed put her clothes someone was smoking a cigarwilbur saw the end glow brighter with each inhalation he assumed that a man the whores next customerwas politely waiting for him to leave but when he asked if there was a fresh candle to light he needed to locate his clothes it was a young girls voice that answered him you could have had me for less was all she said he could not see her distinctly butsince there was no fresh candleshe lit his way to his clothes by puffing earnestly on her cigar casting both a red glow and a haze of smoke over his search he thanked her for her help and left on the morning train to boston he was embarrassed to meet the whore again a chatty woman in the daylight she was carrying a bandbox with the authority of a chronic shopper he fell obliged to give her his seat on the overcrowded train a young girl was traveling with the whoremy daughter the whore said indicating the girl with a jab of her thumb the daughter reminded wilbur that theyd already met by breathing her astonishingly foul cigar breath into his face she was a girl not quite wilburs age the whores name was mrs eamesshe rhymes with screams wilburs father had told him mrs eames told wilbur she was a widow who lived a proper life in boston but that in order to afford such a life she found it necessary to sell herself in some outoftheway town she begged wilbur to allow her to keep her appearances and her reputation intactin boston wilbur not only assured her that her reputation was safe with him he also unasked paid her more money of his own on the spot than his father had originally paid the woman the amount of the original payment he learned later when his father told wilbur that mrs eames was a proper portlander of good reputation who occasionally was obliged to sell herself in boston so that she might afford to keep up her appearances in portland as an old favor to wilburs father she had allowedjust this oncethe exception of lowering herself in her hometown wilburs father didnt know that mrs eames had a daughter whoby her own confessioncost less than her mother and made no pretense of keeping up appearances in either boston or portland the sullen girl never spoke on the train ride into bostons north station her cigar breath and her scornful gaze spoke for her wilbur never told his father that there was some contradiction regarding which town mrs eames had a good reputation in and he never told his father that he caught the clap from mrs eames who might not have known she had it at medical school wilbur learned that gonorrhea could live in the fallopian tubes of females for years only the appearance of an abscess in the pelvis might allow the woman to know that she carried the disease the symptomatology the discharge and so forth could go unnoticed for a long time it did not go unnoticed in wilbur larch the bacterial infection in these prepenicillin days lived on for months in young wilbur giving him his passionate interest in bacteriology before burning itself out it left his urethra scarred and his prostate rocky it left him fond of ether toobecause the ether sleeps he occasionally administered to himself relieved him of the burning sensation he experienced both when he urinated and when he dreamed this singular and painful encounter with sexual pleasurein combination with wilburs memory of his parents loveless marriageconvinced the wouldbe doctor that a life of sexual abstinence was both medically and philosophically sound in the same year that wilbur larch became a doctor neal dow died in grief wilbur larchs mother shortly followed her temperance hero to the grave a few days later wilburs father auctioned every item from their servants rooms in the former mayors mansion and rode the grand trunk railway to montreal a town less temperanceminded than portland and where wilbur larchs father pushed his liver beyond limits his body was returned to portland on the same grand trunk railway that had carried the former lathe operator away wilbur larch met the train he played the porter to his fathers remains from the nearcadavers of the cirrhotic that he had seen during his first internship young dr larch knew exactly what must have been his fathers condition at the end cirrhosis turns the liver to a mass of scars and lumps the skin reflects the bile of jaundice the stools lighten the urine darkens the blood doesnt clot dr larch doubted that his father would have even noticed the accompanying impotence how moving to conclude that young larch chose to be an obstetrician because the loss of his parents inspired him to bring more children into the world but the road that led larch to obstetrics was strewn with bacteria the demonstrator of bacteriology at harvard medical school a dr harold ernst is best remembered as one of the first college baseball pitchers to throw a curve ball he was also the first college baseball player to become a bacteriologist in the early morning laboratory before dr ernstthe former curveball pitcherwould arrive to set up his demonstrations young wilbur larch would be all alone he didnt feel alone in the presence of so many bacteria growing in the little petri dishes in the presence of the bacteria inhabiting his urethra and his prostate gland he would milk a drop of pus from his penis onto an ordinary stained slide magnified more than a thousand times the villains he spotted every morning under the microscope were still smaller thsm common red ants years later larch would write that the gonococci looked stooped like tootall visitors in ain igloo they bend he wrote as if they have waists and are bowing to each other young larch would stare at his pus until dr ernst would arrive and greet his little living experiments all over the lab as if they were his old baseball teammates honestly larch the famous bacteriologist said one morning the way you look into that microscope you appear to be plotting revenge but it was not the smirk of vengeance that dr ernst recognized on wilbur larchs face it was simply the intensity with which larch was emerging from his etherdaze the young medical student had discovered that the light tasty vapor was a safe effective killer of his pain in his days spent fighting the dancing gonococci larch had become quite a knowledgeable imbiber of ether by the time the fierce bacteria had burned themselves out larch was an ether addict he was an opendropmethod man with one hand he held a cone over his mouth and nose he made this mask himself by wrapping many layers of gauze around a cone of stiff paper with his other hand he wet the cone he used a quarterpound ether can punctured with a safety pin the drops that fell from the elbow of the safety pin fell in exactly the correct size and at exactly the correct rate it was the way he would give ether to his patients too except that he gave himself much less when the hand that held the ether can felt unsteady he put the can down when the hand that held the cone over his mouth and nose dropped to his side the cone fell off his faceit wouldnt stay in place if no one held it he felt nothing of the panic that a patient being anesthetized with ether experienceshe never approached the moment when there wasnt enough air to breathe before that happened he always dropped the mask when young dr larch first set out from the south branch of the boston lyingin to deliver babies in the poor districts of the city he had a place in his mind where the peace of ether resided although he carried the ether can and the gauze cone with him he didnt always have time to anesthetize the patient the womans labor was often too far advanced for the ether to help her of course he used it when he had the time he would never share the opinion of some of his elder colleagues that ether was a deviation from the giventhat children should be brought forth in pain larch delivered his first child to a lithuanian family in a coldwater topfloor apartmentthe surrounding streets littered with squashed fruit and tattered vegetables and horse droppings there was no ice to put on the abdomen over the uterus in case of postpartum hemorrhage there was a pot of water already boiling on the stove but larch wished he could sterilize the entire apartment he sent the husband out for ice he measured the womans pelvis he mapped out the fetus he listened to its heartbeat while he watched a cat toying with a dead mouse on the kitchen floor there was a wouldbe grandmother present she spoke lithuanian to the woman in labor to dr larch shespoke a strange language of gestures which suggested to him that the wouldbe grandmother was feebleminded she indicated that a large mole on her face was either a source of hysterical pleasure or hysterical painlarch couldnt tell which perhaps she simply wanted him to remove it either before or after he delivered the baby she found several ways to exhibit the moleonce by holding a spoon under it as if it were about to fall once capping it with a teacup and revealing it suddenly as if it were a surprise or a kind of magicians trick but the zeal she brought to each revelation of the mole suggested to wilbur larch that the old woman simply forgot that she had already shown him her mole when the husband returned with the ice he trod on the cat which voiced its disapproval in tones that made wilbur larch think the child was being born larch was grateful not to have to use the forceps it was a short safe loud delivery following which the husband refused to wash the baby the grandmother offered but larch feared that her combination of excitement and feeblemindedness would cause an accident indicating as well as he could without the benefit of lithuanian that the child should be washed in warm water and soapbut not boiled in the pot on the stove and not held head down under the coldwater taplarch turned his attention to the afterbirth which refused to come away the way the patient kept bleeding larch knew he would soon be faced with serious hemorrhage he begged the husband to hack him some icethe strong fellow had brought a whole block borrowing the ice companys tongs for this purpose and standing in the kitchen with the tongs on his shoulder in a menacing fashion the block of ice could cool the uteri of several bleeding patients to apply it whole to a single patient would likely crush the uterus if not the patient at this moment the grandmother lost her grip on the soapy child and dropped it among the dishes soaking in the coldwater sink this happened the instant that the husband again trod upon the cat seizing the moment when he saw that the grandmother and the husband were distracted larch grasped the top of his patients uterus through her abdominal wall and squeezed hard the woman screamed and grabbed his hands the grandmother abandoning the baby among the dishes tackled larch at the waist and bit him between the shoulder blades the husband retrieved the child from the sink with one hand but he raised the ice tongs over larch with the other whereupon lucky wilbur larch felt the placenta separate when he calmly pointed to its appearance the grandmother and the husband seemed more in awe of it than of the child after washing the baby himself and giving the mother some ergot he bowed a wordless goodbye leaving the apartment he was surprised to hear a commotion almost the instant he closed the door the grandmother the iced patient the husbandall shouting in lithuanianand the baby giving forceful voice to its first family quarrel it was as if the delivery and dr larchs entire appearance had been only a brief interruption to a life of unintelligible turmoil larch navigated the dark stairs and groped his way outside he stepped on a rotting head of lettuce which gave under his foot with the disquieting softness of a newborn babys skull this time he did not confuse the cats terrible yowl with the sounds a child can make he looked up in time to see the object flying through the window of the lithuanian apartment he was in time to dodge it it had clearly been hurled at him and larch wondered what particular perhaps lithuanian offense he had caused these poor people larch was shocked to see that the object thrown from the windowand now dead on the ground at his feetwas the cat but he was not that shocked for a passing second he feared it might have been the child he had been told by his professor of obstetrics at harvard that the tensile strength of the newborn was a marvel but larch knew that the tensile strength of a cat was also considerable and he noted that the beast had failed to survive its fall here in st clouds dr larch would write i am constantly grateful for the south end of boston he meant he was grateful for its children and for the feeling they gave him that the act of bringing them into this world was perhaps the safest phase of their journey larch also appreciated the blunt reminder given him by the prostitutes in the south end they recalled for him the painful gift of mrs eames he could not see the prostitutes without imagining their bacteria under the microscope and he could not imagine those bacteria without feeling the need for the giddy warmth of etherjust a sniff just a light dose and a light doze he was not a drinking man dr larch and he had no taste for tobacco but now and then he provided his sagging spirits with an ether frolic one night when wilbur was dozing in the south end branch of the boston lyingin he was informed by one of the doctors that there was an emergency arrival and that it was his turn although she had lost a lot of weight and all of her youthfulness since larch had last seen her he had no trouble recognizing mrs eames she was so frightened and in such intense pain that she had difficulty catching her breath and more trouble telling the nursereceptionist her name rhymes with screams said dr larch helpfully if mrs eames recognized him right away she didnt let on she was cold to the touch her pulse was very fast and her abdomen was as hard and white as the knuckles of a tight fist larch could detect no signs of labor and he couldnt hear the heartbeats of the fetus which larch couldnt help imagining as having features similar to mrs eamess sullen teenage daughter how old would she be now he wondered still about his own age that much he had time to remember before attending to his diagnosis of mrs eames hemorrhage within the abdomen he operated as soon as the house officer could locate the necessary donors for the transfusion missus eames he asked her softly still seeking some recognition from her hows your father wilbur she asked him just before he operated her abdomen was full of blood he sponged away looking for the source and saw that the hemorrhage issued from a sixinch rupture in the back of the uterus larch performed a caesarean section and delivered a stillborn childthe pinched scornful face of which forcibly reminded him of the cigarsmoking daughter he wondered why mrs eames had come here alone to this point in the operation young larch felt in charge despite his memories of the woman opened up before himand his memories of her transmitted disease which he was only recently rid ofhe felt he was handling a fairly manageable emergency but when he tried to sew up mrs eamess uterus his stitches simply pulled through the tissue which he noticed was the texture of a soft cheeseimagine trying to put stitches in muenster he had no choice then he had to remove the uterus after all the transfusions larch was surprised that mrs eamess condition seemed pretty good he conferred with a senior surgeon in the morning at the boston lyingin it was standard that an obstetricians background was surgicallarch had interned in surgery at mass generaland the senior surgeon shared young larchs bafflement with the disintegrating consistency of mrs eamess uterus even the rupture was a puzzle there was no scar of a previous caesarean section that could have given way the placenta could not have weakened the wall of the uterus because the afterbirth had been on the other side of the uterus from the tear there had been no tumor for fortyeight hours mrs eames did very well she consoled young wilbur on the death of his parents i never knew your mother of course she confided she again expressed her concern that wilbur consider her reputation which wilbur assured her he would and hadby refraining from expressing his fears to the senior surgeon that the condition of mrs eames might somehow be the result of gonorrhea he briefly wondered which story mrs eames was using at the moment regarding her reputation whether she was claiming to live a proper life in portland or in boston whether a third city was now involved and necessarily a third fictitious life on the third day after the removal of her strange uterus mrs eames filled up with blood again and wilbur larch reopened her wound this time he was quite afraid of what hed find at first he was relieved there was not as much blood in her abdomen as before but when he sponged the blood away he perforated the intestine which he had hardly touched and when he lifted up the injured loop to close the hole his fingers passed as easily through the intestine as through gelatin if all her organs were this same fragile jelly larch knew mrs eames wouldnt live very long she lived three more days the night she died larch had a nightmarehis penis fell oft sf in his hands he tried to sew it back on but it kept disintegrating then his fingers gave way in a similar fashion how like a surgeon he thought fingers are valued above penises how like wilbur larch this helped to strengthen larchs conviction regarding sexual abstinence he waited for whatever had destroyed mrs eames to claim him but the autopsy which was performed by a distinguished pathologist seemed off the track scurvy the pathologist said so much for pathologists thought wilbur larch scurvy indeed missus eames was a prostitute larch told the pathologist respectfully she wasnt a sailor but the pathologist was sure about it it had nothing to do with the gonorrhea nothing to do with the pregnancy mrs eames had died of the sailors curse she had not a trace of vitamin c and the pathologist said she had destruction of connective tissue and the tendency to bleed that goes with it scurvy though this was a puzzle it convinced larch that it wasnt a venereal puzzle and he had one good nights sleep before mrs eamess daughter came to see him its not my turn is it he sleepily asked the colleague who roused him she says youre her doctor the colleague told him he did not recognize mrs eamess daughter who had once cost less than mrs eames now she would have charged more than her mother could get if on the train she had seemed only a few years younger than wilbur now she seemed several years older her sullen teenage quality had matured in a brash and caustic fashion her makeup her jewelry and her perfume were excessive her dress was slatternly her hairin a sinrle thick braid with a seagull feather stuck in itwas so severely pulled back from her face that the veins in her temples seemed strained and her neck muscles were tensedas if a violent lover had thrown her to her back and held her there by her strong dark pigtail she greeted wilbur larch by roughly handing him a bottle of brown liquidits pungent odor escaping through a leaky cork stopper the bottles label was illegibly stained thats what did her in the girl said with a growl i aint having any theres other ways is it miss eames wilbur larch asked searching for her memorable cigar breath i said theres other ways miss eames said i aint so far along as she was i aint quick wilbur larch sniffed the bottle in his hand he knew what quick meant if a fetus was quick it meant the mother had felt it move it meant the mother was about half through her gestation period usually in her fourth or fifth month to some doctors with religion when a fetus was quick it meant it had a soul wilbur larch didnt think anyone haid a soul but until the middle of the nineteenth century the common laws attitude toward abortion was simple and to wilbur larch sensible before quickeningbefore the first felt movement of the fetusabortion was legal more important to the doctor in wilbur larch it was not dangerous to the mother to perform an abortion before the fetus was quick after the third month whether the fetus was quick or not wilbur larch knew it had a grip on the uterus that required more force to break for example the liquid in the bottle wilbur larch was holding had not provided sufficient force to break the grip that mrs eamess fetus had on heralthough apparently it had exerted enough force to kill the fetus and turn mrs eamess insides to mush its gotta be pure poison mrs eamess tough daughter remarked to wilbur larch who dabbed a little of his beloved ether on the bottles stained label cleaning it up enough to read french lunar solution restores female monthly regularity stops suppression suppression young larch knew was a euphemism for pregnancy caution dangerous to married women almost certainly causes miscarriages the label concluded which of course was why mrs eames had taken it and taken it larch had studied the abuse of aborticides in medical school somelike the ergot larch used to make the uterus contract after delivery and pituitary extract directly affected the uterus others ruined the intestines they were simply drastic purgatives two of the cadavers larch had worked with in medical school had been victims of a rather common household aborticide of the time turpentine people who didnt avant babies in the s and s were also killing themselves with strychnine and oil of rue the french lunar solution mrs eames had tried was oil of tansy she had taken it for such a long time and in such amounts that her intestines had lost their ability to absorb vitamin c thus did she turn herself into muenster she died as the pathologist had correctly observed of scurvy mrs eames could have chosen several other ways of attempting to abort the birth of another child there were stories that a rather notorious abortionist in the south end was also the districts most successful pimp because he charged nearly five hundred dollars for an abortion which very few poor women could afford in their indebtedness they became his whores his quarters and others like hiswere called simply off harrisonappropriately vague but not without meaning one of the facilities of the south branch of the boston lyingin was established on harrison street so that off harrison in street language correctly implied something unofficialnot to mention illegal it did not make much sense to have an abortion off harrison as mrs eames perhaps had reason to know her daughter also knew the methods of that place which was why she gave wilbur larch a chance to do the joband gave herself a chance to have the job done well i said i aint quick mrs eamess daughter told young larch id be easy id get out of here in just a couple of minutes it was after midnight at the south branch the house officer was asleep the nursepractitioner an anesthetist was also asleep the colleague who had woken larchhed gone to sleep too the dilation of the cervix at any stage of pregnancy usually leads to uterine contractions which expel the contents of the uterus larch also knew that any irritant to the uterus would usually have the desired effect contraction expulsion young wilbur larch stared at mrs eamess daughter his legs felt rocky perhaps he was still standing with his hand on the back of mrs eamess seat on that swaying train from portland before he knew he had the clap you want an abortion wilbur larch said softly it was the first time he had spoken the word mrs eamess daughter took the seagull feather out of her pigtail and jabbed larch in the chest with the quill end shit or get off the pot she said it was with the words shit and pot that the sour stench of cigar reached him wilbur larch could hear the nurseanesthetist sleeping she had a sinus condition for an abortion he wouldnt need as much ether as he liked to use for a delivery he would need only a little more than he routinely gave himself he also doubted it was necessary to shave the patient patients were routinely shaved for a delivery and larch would have preferred it for an abortion but to save time he could skip it he would not skip ether he would put red merthiolate on the vaginal area if hed had a childhood like mrs eamess daughter he wouldnt have wanted to bring a child into the world either he would use the set of dilators with the douglass points rounded snubnosed points they had the advantage of an easy introduction into the uterus and eliminated the danger of pinching tissue in withdrawal with the cervix dilated to the desired size he doubted thatunless mrs eamess daughter was well along in her third or fourth monthhe would need to use forceps and then only for the removal of placenta and the larger pieces a medical school textbook had referred euphemistically to the products of conception these could be scraped from the wall of the uterus with a curette perhaps with two differentsized curettes the small one to reach into the corners but he was too young wilbur larch he hesitated he was thinking about the time for recovery from ether that he would need to allow mrs elamess daughter and what he would say to his colleagues or to the nurse if she woke upor even to the house officer if it turned out to be necessary to keep the girl until the morning if there was any excessive bleeding for example he was surprised by the sudden pain in his chest mrs eamess savage daughter was stabbing him with the seagull feather again i aint quick i aint quick i said the eames girl screamed at him stabbing him again and again until the feather bent in her hand she left it stuck in his shirt in turning away from him her heavy braid brushed his face the braids odor overwhelmingly conveying smoke when she was gone and larch plucked the seagull feather from his breast he noticed that the oil of tansy the french lunar solutionhad spilled on his hands its smell was not unpleasant but it momentarily overpowered the smell larch liked and was used to it overpowered the ether it put an end to his peace of mind they did not use ether off harrison they didnt concern themselves with pain there for pain off harrison they used music an outfit called the german choir practiced lieder in the front rooms off harrison they sang passionately perhaps mrs eamess daughter appreciated it but she made no mention of the music when she was brought back to the south branch a week later no one was sure how she got there she appeared to have been flung against the door she also appeared to have been beaten about the face and neck perhaps for failing to pay the usual abortion fee she had a very high feverher swollen face was as hot and dry to the touch as bread fresh from the oven from the fever and the tenseness of her abdomen rigid as glass the house officer and the night nurse suspected peritonitis the reason they woke wilbur was that mrs earness daughter had a piece of paper pinned to the shoulder of her dress doctor larch shit or get off the pot pinned to the other shoulderlike a mismatched epaulette pulling her dress askewwas a pair of ladies underwear they were her only pair it was discovered she wasnt wearing any apparently her panties had been pinned there in a hurry that way they wouldnt be lost wilbur larch didnt need to examine mrs barness daughter very thoroughly in order to discover that the abortion attempt had failed a fetus with no heartbeat was imprisoned in her uterus which had suffered some haywire contraction and was in a state of spasm the hemorrhage and infection could have come from any of the several methods employed off harrison there was the watercure school which advocated the use of an intrauterine tube and syringe but neither the tube nor the water was sterileand the syringe had many other uses there was a primitive suction system simply an airtight cup from which all the air could be sucked by a footoperated pump it had the power to abort but it also had the power to draw blood through the pores of the skin it could do a lot of damage to soft tissue andas the little sign said on the door off harrison we treat menstrual suppression electrically there was the mclntosh galvanic battery the long leads were hooked up to the battery the leads had intravaginal and intrauterine attachments on insulated rubbercovered handles that way the abortionist wouldnt feel the shock in his hands when mrs eamess daughter diedbefore dr larch could operate on her and without her having further words with him beyond the shit or get off the pot note that was pinned to her shoulder her temperature was nearly the house officer felt compelled to ask larch if he knew the woman the note certainly implied an intimate message she was angry with me for not giving her an abortion wilbur larch replied good for you said the house officer but wilbur larch failed to see how this was good for anyone there was a widespreaid inflammation of the membranes and viscera of the abdominal cavity the uterus had been perforated twice and the fetus which was dead was true to mrs eamess daughters prediction it had not been quick in the morning dr larch visited off harrison he needed to see for himself what happened there he wanted to know where women went when doctors turned them down on his mind was mrs eamess daughters last puff of cigar breath in his face as he bent over her before she diedreminding him of course of the night he needed her puffing cigar to find his clothes if pride was a sin thought dr larch the greatest sin was moral pride he had slept with someones mother and dressed himself in the light of her daughters cigar he could quite comfortably abstain from having sex for the rest of his life but how could he ever condemn another person for having sex the german choir blasted him at the door with the little sign that promised the return of menstruation electrically there was a harsh and outoftune pianono oboe no english horn no mezzosopranoyet larch thought the music was remindful of mahlers kindertotenlieder years later when he first heard the screamconcealing sound of the water rushing through three mile falls he would remember the abortionists songs that pumped like jism off harrison he beat on the door he could have screamedbut no one heard him when he opened the door and stepped inside no one bothered to look at him the german choir kept singing the only instrument was a piano and there were not nearly enough chairs for the women and there were only a few music stands the men stood huddled in two groups far from the women there werent enough copies of the sheet music to go around the choir conductor stood by the piano a lean bald man without a shirt he wore a dirtywhite shirt collar perhaps to catch the sweat and kept his eyes half closed as if in prayer while his arms wildly pummeled the airas if the air which was full of cigar smoke and the urinelike stink of cheap draft beer were hard to move the choir pursued the mans wild arms a fussy or critical god thought wilbur larch would strike us all dead larch walked behind the piano and through the only open door he entered into a room with nothing in itnot a piece of furniture not a window there was only a closed door larch opened it and found himself in what was obviously the waiting roomat least people appeared to be waiting there there were even newspapers and fresh flowers and an open window four people sat in pairs no one read the papers or sniffed the flowers or looked out the window everyone looked down and continued to look down when wilbur larch walked in at a desk with only a pad of paper and a cashbox on it sat an alert man eating something that looked like navy beans out of a bowl the man appeared young and strong and indifferent he wore a pair of work overalls and a sleeveless undershirt around his neck like a gym instructors whistle hung a keyobviously to the cashbox he was as bald as the choir conductor larch considered that their heads were shaved without looking at wilbur larch the man who might have been one of the choir sitting out a song or two said hey you dont come here you just have the lady come by herself or with a lady friend in the front room wilbur larch heard them singing something about someones dear motherwasnt that what mütterlein meant im a doctor dr larch said the cashbox man kept eating but he looked up at larch the singers took a deep breath and in the splitsecond silence larch heard the mans swift skillful spoon scrape against the bowland from another room the sound of someone retching quickly followed by the splash of vomit in a metal basin one of the women in the waiting room began to cry but before larch could identify which of the women it was the singers caught their breath and bore down again something about christs blood larch thought what do you want the man asked larch im a doctor i want to see the doctor here larch said no doctor here the man said just you then i want to give advice larch said medical advice free medical advice the man studied larchs face he appeared to think that a response to larchs offer could be found there youre not the first one here the man said after a while you wait your turn that seemed to satisfy both men for the moment and larch looked for a seattaking a chair precisely between the twosomes of women already in the room he was too shocked by everything to be surprised when he recognized one of the couples the lithuanian woman whose child hed delivered his first delivery sat mutely with her molefaced mother they wouldnt look up at him larch smiled at them and nodded the woman was very pregnanttoo pregnant for an easy abortion under the safest of circumstances larch realized with panic that he couldnt convey this to her she spoke only lithuanian she would associate him with delivering only live babies also he knew nothing of what might have become of her first babynothing of what her life with that baby had been or was now he tapped his foot nervously and looked at the other couplealso clearly a mother and her daughter but both of them were younger than the lithuanians and it was hard to tell which of them was pregnant this abortion at least looked easier to perform the daughter looked too young to be pregnant but then why larch wondered had the mother brought the girl here did she need the company so badly or was this meant as a lesson watch outthis could happen to you in the front room the singers grew hysterical on the subject of gods love and something that sounded like blinding destinyverblendenengeschike wilbur larch stared at the shut door behind which he had heard unmistakable vomiting a bee crazily out of place buzzed in the open window and seemed to find the flowers fakes it buzzed straight out again when larch looked at the lithuanian couple he saw that the grandmother had recognized himand she had discovered a new way to exhibit her mole which had grown additional and longer hairs and had slightly changed color pinching her fingers to either side of the mole the grandmother inflamed the surrounding skin and made the mole appear to explode from her facelike a boil come to a head about to burst the pregnant woman seemed not to notice her mothers charmless demonstration and when she stared at larch she appeared not to recognize him for larch there was only lithuanian written on her face perhaps larch thought her husband threw her baby out the window and drove her mad for a moment larch thought that the choir might be lithuanian but he recognized something about a battle between gottund schicksalclearly german clearly god and fate the scream that cut through the shut door had no difficulty rising above the voices declaring that god had won the young girl jumped from her seat sat down hugged herself cried out she put her face in her mothers lap to muffle her cries larch realized shed been the one to cry before he also realized that she must be the one needing the abortionnot her mother the girl didnt look older than ten or twelve excuse me larch said to the mother im a doctor he felt like an actor with good potential whod been crippled with a single stupid lineit was all lie had to say im a doctor what followed from that so youre a doctor the mother said bitterly but larch was happy to hear she didnt speak lithuanian so what help are you the mother asked him how many months is she larch asked the mother maybe three the mother said suspiciously but i already paid them here how old is she larch asked the girl looked up from her mothers lap a strand of her dirtyblond hair caught in her mouth im fourteen she said defensively shell be fourteen next year the mother said larch stood up and said to the man with the cashbox key pay them back ill help the girl i thought you came for advice the man said to give it dr larch said why not take some while youre here the man said when you pay theres a deposit you dont get a deposit back how much is the deposit larch asked the man shrugged he drummed his fingers on the cashbox maybe halfhesaid eureganzemacht the choir sang your whole power translated wilbur larch many medical students were good in german when the evil door opened an old couple like someones bewildered grandparents peered anxiously into the waiting roomboth confusion and curiosity on their faces which like the faces of many old couples had grown to resemble each other they were small and stooped and behind them on a cotas still as a paintinga woman lay resting under a sheet her eyes open but unfocused the vomit basin had been placed on a towel on the floor within her reach he says hes a doctor the cashbox man said without looking at the old couple he says he came to give you free medical advice he says to pay these ladies back he says hell take care of the you ng lady himself by the way that the old whitehaired woman had become a presenceor stronger a forcein the doorway between the waiting room and the operating theater larch realized thatshe was in charge the old whitehaired man was her assistant the old woman would have looked at home in a pleasant kitchen baking cookies inviting the neighborhood children to come and go as they pleased doctor larch dr larch said bowing a little too formally oh yes doctor larchthe old woman said neutrally come to shit or to get off the pot the abortionist was known in the neighborhood off harrison as mrs santa glaus she was not the original author of that remarkor of that note mrs eamess daughter had written that herself before she went to see mrs santa glaus she knew enough about the dangersoff harrison to know that she might be in no shape to write anything at all after mrs santa glaus finished with her larch was unprepared for mrs santa glausspecifically for her attitude he had imagined that in any meeting with an abortionist he dr larch would take charge he still tried to he walked into the operating theater and picked up something just to demonstrate his authority what he picked up was the suction cup with a short hose running to the foot pump the cup fitted neatly into the palm of his hand he had no trouble imagining what else it fitted to his surprise when he had attached the cup to his palm mrs santa glaus began stepping on the foot pump when he felt the blood rushing to his pores he popped the cup out of his palm before the thing could raise more than a blood blister on the heel of his hand well mrs glaus asked aggressively whats your advice doctor as if in reply the patient under the sheet drew larch to her the womans forehead was clammy with sweat you dont know what youre doing dr larch said to mrs santa glaus at least im doing something the old woman said with hostile calm if you know how to do it why dont you do it mrs santa glaus asked if you know how why dont you teach me the woman under the sheet looked groggy but she was trying to pull herself together she sat up and tried to examine herself she discovered that under the sheet she still wore her own dress this knowledge appeared to relax her please listen to me dr larch said to her if you have a feverif you have more than just a little bleedingyou must come to the hospital dont wait i thought the advice was for me mrs santa glaus said wheres my advice larch tried to ignore her he went out to the waiting room and told the mother with her young daughter that they should leave but the mother was concerned about the money pay them back mrs santa glaus told the cashbox man they dont get the deposit back the man said again pay them back the deposit too the old woman said angrily she came into the waiting room to oversee the disgruntled transaction she put her hand on dr larchs arm ask her who the father is mrs santa glaus said thats none of my business larch said youre right the old woman said that much you got right but ask her anywayits an interesting story larch tried to ignore her mrs santa glaus grabbed hold of both the mother and her daughter she spoke to the mother tell him who the father is she said the daughter began to snivel and whine mrs santa glaus ignored her she looked only at the mother tell him she repeated my husband the woman murmured and then she addedas if it werent clearher father her father is the father mrs santa glaus said to dr larch got it yes ive got it thank you dr larch said he needed to put his arm around the thirteenyearold who was sagging she had her eyes shut maybe a third of the young ones are like her mrs santa glaus told larch nastily she treated him as if he were the father about a third of them get it from their fathers or their brothers rape mrs santa glaus said incest you understand yes thank you larch said pulling the girl with himtugging the sleeve of the mothers coat to make her follow shit or get off the pot mrs santa glaus yelled after them all you starving doctors the cashbox man hollered youre all over the choir was singing larch thought he heard them say vom keinen sturm erschrecketfrightened by no storm in the empty room that separated the songs from the abortions larch and the mother with her daughter collided with the woman whod been under the sheet she was still groggy her eyes were darting and her dress was plastered with sweat to her back please remember larch said to her if theres a fever if theres more than a little bloodthen he saw the womans underwear pinned to the shoulder of her dress that reminding epaulette was the badge of off harrison a kind of ribbon for bravery obviously the woman didnt know that her panties were there larch imagined that the south end was sprinkled liberally with these staggering women their panties pinned to their shoulders marking them as indelibly as that longago puritan new england a upon their bosoms wait larch cried and grabbed for the underwear the woman didnt want to wait as she pulled herself free of his grasp the pin opened and stuck larch in the hand after shed gone he put her panties in his suitjacket pocket he led the mother and her daughter through the room that was always so heady with song but the choir was taking a beer break the lean bald conductor had just dipped into his frothy stein when he looked up and saw dr larch leaving with the women a moustache of foam whitened his lip and a dab of the white froth shone on the end of his nose the conductor raised his stein toward dr larch offering a toast praise the lord the conductor called you keep on saving those poor souls doc danke schön the choir called after him of course they could not have been singing mahlers songs on thedeath of children but those were the songs wilbur larch had heard in other parts of the world wrote dr wilbur larch upon his arrival in st clouds an ability to act before you thinkbut to act nonetheless correctlyis essential perhaps there will be more time to think here in st clouds in boston he meant he was a hero and he wouldnt have lasted longbeing a hero he took the young girl and her mother to the south branch he instructed the house officer to write up the following this is a thirteenyearold girl her pelvis is only three and a half inches in diameter two previous violent deliveries have lacerated her soft parts and left her with a mass of unyielding scar tissue this is her third pregnancy as a result of incestas a result of rape if allowed to come to term she can be delivered only by caesarean section whichgiven the childs delicate state of health she is a child not to mention her state of mindwould be dangerous therefore ive decided to give her an abortion you have the house officer asked thats right wilbur larch saidand to the nurseanesthetist he said well do it immediately the abortion took only twenty minutes larchs light touch with ether was the envy of his colleagues he used the set of dilators with the douglass points and both a mediumsized and a small curette there was of course no mass of unyielding scar tissue there were no lacerated soft parts this was a ifirst not a third pregnancy and although she was a small girl her pelvis was certainly greater than three and a half inches in diameter these fictional details which wilbur larch provided for the house officer were intended to make the house officers report more convincing no one at the boston lyingin ever questioned larchs decision to perform this abortion no one ever mentioned it but dr larch could tell that something had changed he detected the dying of conversations upon his entering a room he detected a general aloofness although he was not exactly shunned he was never invited he dined alone at a nearby german restaurant he ate pig knuckles and sauerkraut and one night he drank a beer it reminded him of his father it was wilbur larchs first and last beer at this time in his life wilbur larch seemed destined to a firstandlast existence one sexual experience one beer one abortion but hed had more than one experience with ether and the news in the south endthat there was an alternative to mrs santa glaus and the methods practised off harrisontraveled fast he was first approached while standing at a fruiitvendors cart drinking freshsqueezed orange juice a tall gaunt woman with a shopping bag and a laundry basket materialized beside him i aint quick the woman whispered to wilbur larch whats it cost i aint quick i swear after her they followed him everywhere sleepily at the south branch he was always saying to one colleague or another its not my turn is it and always the answer was the same shesays youre her doctor a child of maine wilbur larch was used to looking into peoples faces and finding their eyes now he looked down or away like a city person he made their eyes hunt for his in the same mail with his catalogue of surgical instruments from fred halsam co he received a copy of mrs w h maxwells a female physician to theladies of the united states until late in mrs maxwell had operated a womans clinic in new york the authoress has not established her hospital simply for the benefit of lyingin women she wrote she believes that in the view of the uncharitableness of general society towards the erring it is fit that the unfortunate should have some sanctuary to which to flee in whose shade they may have undisturbed opportunity to reflect and hiding forever their present unhappiness nerve themselves to be wiser in the future the true physicians soul cannot be too broad and gentle of course wilbur larch saw that the south end was mercilessly full of evidence of uncharitableness towards the erring and that he had become in the view of the erring the sanctuary to which to flee instead he fled he went home to maine he applied to the maine state board of medical examiners for a useful position in obstetrics while they sought a position for him in some developing community they liked his harvard degree and made him a member of their board wilbur larch awaited his new appointment in his old hometown of portland that safe harborthe old mayors mansion where he had spent the half life of his childhood the salty boardinghouse where he had caught his dose of life from mrs eames he wondered if he would miss the south end the palmist who had assured him he would live a long time and have many children too many to count which larch understood as confirmation that in seeking to become an obstetrician he had made the right choice the fortune teller who had told young larch that he would never follow in his fathers footsteps which was all right with wilbur larch who had no knowledge of lathes no fondness for drink and was sure that his liver wouldnt be the culprit of his final undoing and the chinese herb doctor who had told larch that he could cure the clap by applying crushed green leaves and bread mold to his penis the quack was almost right the chlorophyll in the plants would destroy the bacteria that contributed to gangrene butit wouldnt kill the dance couples in the pus cells those lively gonococci the penicillin extracted from some bread molds would years later larch would dream that if only dr harold ernst harvard medical schools bacteriologist and curveball pitcher and the chinese herb doctor from the south end had put their heads togetherwell what wouldnt they have cured they would not have cured orphans wrote dr larch when he woke from that dream and the orphans of the south end wilbur larch remembered them from the branch hospitals of the boston lyingin in less than half the mothers were married in the institutions charter it was written that no patient would be admitted unless a married woman or one recently widowed and known to be of good moral character the benevolent citizen groups who had first contributed thousands of dollars to provide for a lyingin hospital for the poorthey had insisted but in truth almost everyone was admitted there was an astonishing number of women claiming to be widows or claiming marriage to sailors off to seagone with the great eastern wilbur larch used to imagine in portland he wondered why were there no orphans no children or women in need wilbur larch did not feel of much use in the tidy town of portland it is ironic to think that while he waited to be sent somewhere where he was needed a prostitutes letterabout abandoned women and orphanswas making its way to him from st clouds but before the letter arrived wilbur larch had another invitation the pleasure of his company was requested by a mrs channingpeabody of the boston channingpeabodys who spent every summer on their coastal property just east of portland the invitation suggested that perhaps young larch missed the boston society to which hed doubtlessly become accustomed and would enjoy some tennis or croquet or even some sailing before a dinner with the channingpeabodys and friends larch had been accustomed to no boston socifity he associated the channingpeabodys with cambridge or with beacon hillwhere he was never invitedand although he knew that channing and peabody were old boston family names he was unfamiliar with this strange coupling of the two for all wilbur larch knew about this level of society the channings and the peabodys might be throwing a party together and for the purpose of the invitation had agreed to hyphenate their names as for sailing wilbur larch had never been on the wateror in it a child of maine he knew better than to learn to swim in that water the maine water in wilbur larchs opinion was for summer people and lobsters and as for tennis or croquet he didnt own the proper clothing from a watercolor of some strange lawn games he had once imagined that striking a wooden ball with a wooden mallet as hard as he could would be rewarding but he wanted time to practice this art alone and unobserved he regretted the expense of hiring a driver to take him to the channingpeabody summer house and he felt uncomfortably dressed for the seasonhis only suit was a dark heavy one and he hadnt worn it since the day of his visit off harrison as he lifted the big brass door knocker of the channingpeabody house choosing to introduce himself formally rather than wandering among the people in their whites at play at various sports around the grounds he felt the suit was not only too hot but also needed a pressing and he discovered in the jacket pocket the panties of the woman whod aborted the birth of her child off harrison wilbur larch was holding the panties in his hand and staring at themremembering their valiant epaulette position their jaunty bravery on the womans shoulderwhen mrs channingpeabody opened the door to receive him he could not return the panties to his jacket pocket quickly enough so he stuffed them into the pocket in the attitude of a handkerchief hed just been caught blowing his nose in by the quick way mrs channingpeabody looked away from them larch knew shed seen the panties for what they were womens underdrawers plain as day doctor larch mrs channingpeabody said cautiously as if the panties had provided her with a clue to larchs identity i should simply leave now wilbur larch thought but he said yes doctor larch and bowed to the woman a great gunship of a woman with a tanned face and a head helmeted in silvergray hair as sleek and as dangerouslooking as a bullet you must come meet my daughter the woman said and all the rest of us she added with a booming laugh that chilled the sweat on wilbur larchs back all the rest of them seemed to be named charming or peabody or channingpeabody and some of them had first names that resembled last names there was a cabot and a chadwick and a loring and an emerald who had the dullest brown eyes but the daughter whom mrs channingpeabody had designated to meet dr larch was the plainest and youngest and least healthylooking of the bunch her name was missy missy wilbur larch repeated the girl nodded and shrugged they were seated at a long table next to each other across from them and about their age was one of the young men in tennis whites either the chadwick or the cabot he looked cross or else hed just had a fight with miss channingpeabody or else he would rather have been seated next to her himself or maybe hes just her brother and wishes he were seated farther away from her thought wilbur larch the girl looked unwell in a family of tans she was pale she picked at her food it was one of those dinners where the arrival of each course caused a complete change of dishes and as the conversation lapsed and failed or at least grew fainter the sound of china and silverware grew louder and a tension mounted at the dinner table it was not a tension caused by any subject of conversationit was a tension caused by no subject of conversation the rather senile retired surgeon who was seated on wilburs other sidehe was either a channing or a peabodyseemed disappointed to learn that larch was an obstetrician still the old codger insisted on knowing dr larchs preferred method of expelling the placenta into the lower genital tract wilbur larch tried quietly to describe the expression of placenta to dr peabody or dr channing or whoever he was but the old man was hard of hearing and insisted that young larch speak up their conversation which was the dinner tables only conversation thus progressed to injuries to the perineumincluding the method of holding back the babys head to prevent a perineal tearand the proper mediolateral incision for the performance of an episiotomy when a tear of the perineum seems imminent wilbur larch was aware that missy channingpeabodys skin was changing color beside him she went from milk to mustard to springgrass green and almost back to milk before she fainted her skin was quite cool and clammy and when wilbur larch looked at her he saw that her eyes were almost completely rolled up into her head her mother and the cross young man in tennis whites the cabot or the chadwick whisked her away from the tableshe needs air mrs channingpeabody announced but air was not in short supply in maine wilbur larch already knew what missy needed she needed an abortion it came to him through the visible anger of young chadwick or cabot it came to him over the babbling senility of the old surgeon inquiring about modern obstetrical procedure it came to him through the absence of other conversation and through the noise of the knives and the forks and the plates that was why hed been invited missy channingpeabody suffering from morning sickness needed an abortion rich people needed them too even rich people who in wilbur larchs opinion were the last to learn about anything even rich people knew about him he wanted to leave but now it was his fate that held him sometimes when we are labeled when we are branded our brand becomes our calling wilbur larch felt himself called the letter from the prostitute from st clouds was on its way to him and he would go there but first he was being called to performhere he rose from the table the men were being sent to some special roomfor cigars the women had gathered around someones babya nurse or a governess a servant thought wilbur larch had brought a baby into the dining room and the women were having a look wilbur larch had a look too the women made room for him the baby was rosylooking and cheerful about three months old but dr larch noticed the forceps mark on its cheek a definite indentation it would leave a scar i can do better work than this he thought isnt that a darling baby doctor larch one of the women asked him its too bad about that forceps mark larch said and that shut them all up mrs channingpeabody took him out into the hall he let her lead him to the room that had been prepared for him on the way she said we have this little problem how many months along is she he asked mrs channingpeabody is she quick quick or not missy channingpeabody had certainly been prepared the family had converted a small reading room into an operating theater there were old pictures of men in uniform and books looking long untouched stood at attention in the grim rooms foreground was a solid table appropriately set with cotton batting and rubber sheeting and missy herself w as lying in the correct examining position she was already shaved already swabbed with the bichloride solution someone had done the necessary homework perhaps theyd pumped the senile family surgeon for details dr larch saw the alcohol the green soap the nail brush which he proceeded immediately to use there was a set of six metal dilators and a set of three curettes in a leathercovered satinlined case there was chloroform and a chloroform inhaler and this one mistakethat they didnt know wilbur larchs preference for ether made larch almost forgive them what wilbur larch could not forgive was the obvious loathing they felt for him there was an old woman in attendance perhaps some faithful household servant who had played midwife to countless little channingpeabodys maybe even midwife to missy the old woman was particularly chiselfaced and sharpeyed when she looked at larch as if she expected him to congratulate herat which moment she would not acknowledge that hed spoken to herfor her precision in readying the patient mrs channingpeabody herself seemed unable to touch him she did offer to hold his coat which he let her take before he asked her to leave send that young man larch told her he should be here i think he meant the particularly hostile young man in tennis whites whether he was the outraged brother or the guilty lover or both these people need me but they hate me larch was thinking as he scrubbed under his nails while he let his arms soak in the alcohol bath he wondered how many doctors the channingpeabodys must know how many must be in the family but they would never have asked one of their kind for help with this little problem they were too pure for it you want my help the sullen young man asked larch not really larch replied dont touch anything and stand to my left just look over my shoulder and be sure you can see everything that classconscious look of scorn had all but left young chadwicks or young cabots face when wilbur larch went to work with the curette with the first appearance of the products of conception the young mans expression openedthat certain judgmental air was not discernible in any aspect of his face which seemed softened and resembled his tennis whites in its color i have made this observation about the wall of the uterus dr larch told the ghostly young man it is a good hard muscular wall and when youve scraped it clean it responds with a gritty sound thats how you know when youve got all of itall the products of conception you just listen for that gritty sound he scraped some more can you hear it he asked no the young man whispered well perhaps sound isnt the right word wilbur larch said perhaps its more like a gritty feeling but its a sound to me gritty he said as young cabot or young chadwick attempted to catch his own vomit in his cupped hands take her temperature every hour larch told the rigid servant who held the sterile towels if theres more than a little bleeding or if she has a fever i should be called and treat her like a princess wilbur larch told the old woman and the ashen empty young man no one should be allowed to make her feel ashamed he would have departed like a gentleman after he looked under missys eyelids at her chloroform gaze but when he put his coat on he felt the envelope bulge in the breast pocket he didnt count the money but he saw there were several hundred dollars it was the mayors mansion all over again the servants quarters treatment it meant the channingpeabodys wouldnt ask him back for tennis or croquet or a sail he promptly handed about fifty dollars to the old woman who had bathed missys genitals with the bichloride solution and had covered her with a sterile vulval pad he gave about twenty dollars to the young tennis player who had opened the door to the patio to breathe a little of the garden air larch was going to leave then when he shoved his hands in his coat pockets and found the panties again on an impulse he grabbed the placenta forceps and took the instrument with him he went off looking for the old surgeon but there were only servants in the dining roomstill clearing the table he gave each of them about twenty or thirty dollars he found the senile doctor asleep in a reading chair in another room he optened the mouth of the forceps clamped the pair of panties from off harrison in it and then clamped the whole business to the old snorers lapel he found the kitchen and several servants busy in it and gave away about two hundred dollars there he went out on the grounds and gave the last of the money another two hundred dollars to a gardener who was on his knees in a flower bed by the main door he would have liked to have handed the empty envelope back to mrs channingpeabody the grand lady was hiding from him he tried to fold the envelope and pin it to the main door under the big brass door knocker the envelope kept blowing free in the wind then he got angry and wadded it up in a ball and threw it into a manicured circle of green lawn which served as a rotary for the main driveway two croquet players on a far lawn held up their game and stared first at the crumpled envelope and then at the blue summer sky as if a lightning bolt at the very least were momentarily expected to strike larch dead on his way back to portland wilbur larch reflected on the last century of medical historywhen abortion was legal when many more complex procedures than a simple abortion were routinely taught medical students such things as utero decapitation and fetal pulverization these in lieu of the more dangerous caesarean section he mumbled those words to himself utero decapitation fetal pulverization by the time he got back to portland he had worked the matter out he was an obstetrician he delivered babies into the world his colleagues called this the lords work and he was an abortionist he delivered mothers too his colleagues called this the devils work but it was all the lords work to wilbur larch as mrs maxwell had observed the true physicians soul cannot be too broad and gentle later when he would have occasion to doubt himself he would force himself to remember he had slept with someones mother and dressed himself in the light of her daughters cigar he could quite comfortably abstain from having sex for the rest of his life but how could he ever condemn another person for having sex he would remember too what he hadnt done for mrs eamess daughter and what that had cost he would deliver babies he would deliver mothers too in portland a letter from st clouds awaited him when the maine state board of medical examiners sent him to st clouds they could not have known wilbur larchs feeling for orphansnor could they have known his readiness to leave portland that safe harbor from which the great eastern had sailed with no plans for return and they would never know that in the first week wilbur larch spent in st clouds he founded an orphanage because it was needed delivered three babies one wanted two inevitableone would be another orphan and performed one abortion his third it would take larch some years to educate the population regarding birth controlthe ratio would endure for some time one abortion for every three births over the years it would go to one in four then to one in five during world war i when wilbur larch went to france the replacement physician at the orphanage would not perform abortions the birth rate would climb the number of orphans would double but the replacement physician said to nurse edna and to nurse angela that he was put on this earth to do the lords work not the devils this feeble distinction would later prove useful to nurse angela and to nurse edna and to dr wilbur larch who wrote his good nurses from france that he had seen the real devils work the devil worked with shell and grenade fragments with shrapnel and with the little dirty bits of clothing carried with a missile into a wound the devils work was gas bacillus infection that scourge of the first world warwilbur larch would never forget how it crackled to the touch tell him larch wrote nurse angela and nurse edna tell that fool he meant his replacement that the work at the orphanage is all the lords work everything you do you do for the orphans you deliver them and when the war was over and wilbur larch came home to st clouds nurse edna and nurse angela were already familiar with the proper language for the work of st cloudsthe lords work and the devils work they called it just to keep it straight between themselves which operation was being performed when wilbur larch went along with itit was useful languagebut both nurses were in agreement with larch that it was all the lords work that they were performing it was not until that they encountered their first problem his name was homer wells he went out into the world and came back to st clouds so many times that it was necessary to put him to work by the time a boy is a teenager he should be of use but would he understand the nurses and dr larch wondered homer had seen the mothers come and go and leave their babies behind but how long before he stairted counting heads and realized that there were more mothers coming and going than there were babies left behind how long before he observed that not all the mothers who came to st clouds were visibly pregnantand some of them didnt even stay overnight should they tell him the nurses and dr larch wondered wilbur nurse edna said while nurse angela rolled her eyes the boy has the run of the placehes going to figure it out for himself hes growing older every minute nurse angela said hes learning something new every day it was true that they never let the women recovering from the abortions rest in the same room with the new mothers who were gaining their strength to leave their babies behind that was something even a child could observe and homer wells was frequently in charge of emptying the wastebasketsall the wastebaskets even the operatingroom wastebaskets which were leakproof and taken directly to the incinerator what if he looks in a wastebasket wilbur nurse edna asked dr larch if hes old enough to look hes old enough to learn st larch replied perhaps larch meant if hes old enough to recognize what there was to be seen after the lords work or after the devils much that would be in the wastebasket would be the same in most cases blood and mucus cotton and gauze placenta and pubic hair both nurses told dr larch there was no need to shave a patient for an abortion but larch was fussy and if it was all the lords work he thought let it all look the same the wastebaskets that homer wells would carry to the incinerator held the history of st clouds the clipped ends of the silk and gut sutures fecal matter and soap suds from the enemas and what nurse edna and nurse angela feared homer wells would seethe socalled products of conception a human fetus or a recognizable part thereof and that is how homer wells an unlucky thirteen would discover that both the quick and the not quick were delivered at st clouds one day walking back from the incinerator he saw a fetus on the ground it had fallen from the wastebasket hed been carrying but when he saw it he assumed it had fallen from the sky he bent over it then he looked for the nest it might have dropped fromonly there were no trees homer wells knew that birds didnt deliver their eggs in flightor that an egg while falling couldnt lose its shell then he imagined that some animal had miscarried in an orphanage around a hospital one heard that word but what animal it weighed less than a pound it was maybe eight inches long and that shadow on its almost translucent head was the first phase of hair not feathers and those were almost eyebrows on its scrunched face it had eyelashes too and were those nipplesthose little pale pink dots emerging on that chest the size of a large thumb and those slivers at the fingertips and at the toes those were nails holding the whole thing in one hand homer ran with it straight to dr larch larch was sitting at the typewriter in nurse angelas office he was writing a letter to the new england home for little wanderers i found something homer wells said he held out his hand and larch took the fetus from him and placed it on a clean white piece of typing paper on nurse angelas desk it was about three monthsat the most four not quite quick dr larch knew but almost what is it homer wells asked the lords work said wilbur larch that saint of st clouds because that was when he realized that this was also the lords work teaching honner wells telling him everything making sure he learned right from wrong it was a lot of work the lords work but if one was going to be presumptuous enough to undertake it one had to do it perfectly princes of maine kings of new england here in st clouds dr larch wrote we treat orphans as if they came from royal families in the boys division this sentiment informed his nightly blessinghis benediction shouted over the beds standing in rows in the darkness dr larchs blessing followed the bedtime reading whichafter the unfortunate accident to the winklesbecame the responsibility of homer wells dr larch wanted to give homer more confidence when homer told dr larch how he had loved reading to the winkles in their safari tentand how he thought he had done it well except that the winkles had fallen asleepthe doctor decided that the boys talent should be encouraged in almost immediately after seeing his first fetus homer wells began reading david copperfield to the boys division just twenty minutes a crack no more no less he thought it would take him longer to read it than it took dickens to write it faltering at firstand teased by the very few boys who were near his own age no boy was olderhomer improved every night he would murmur aloud to himself that books opening passage it had the effect of a litanyon occasion it allowed him to sleep peacefully whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life homer whispered to himself he remembered the dryness in his eyes and nose in the furnace room at the drapers in waterville he remembered the spray from the water that had swept the winkles away he remembered the cool damp curledinoriitself beginning that lay dead in his hand that thing he had held in his hand could not have been a hero and after lights out and nurse edna or nurse angela had asked if anyone wanted a last glass of water or if anyone needed a last trip to the pottywhen those dots of light from the justextinguished lamps still blinked in the darkness and every orphans mind was either sleeping dreaming or lingering with david copperfields adventuresdr larch would open the door from the hall with its exposed pipes and its hospital colors good night he would call good nightyou princes of maine you kings of new england that thing homer had held in his hand was no princeit hadnt lived to be king then bangthe door would close and the orphans would be left in a new blackness whatever image of royalty that they could conjure would be left to them what princes and kings could they have seen what futures were possible for them to dream of what royal foster families would greet them in sleep what princesses would love them what queens would they marry and when would they escape the darkness left with them after larch closed the door after they could no longer hear the retreating squeaks of nurse ednas and nurse angelas shoes that thing he had held in his hand could not have heard the shoesit had the smallest most wrinkled ears for homer wells it was different he did not imagine leaving st clouds the princes of maine that homer saw the kings of new england that he imagined they reigned at the court of st clouds they traveled nowhere they didnt get to go to sea they never even saw the ocean but somehow even to homer wells dr larchs benediction was uplifting full of hope these princes of maine these kings of new england these orphans of st cloudswhoever they were they were the heroes of their own lives that much homer could see in the darkness that much dr larch like a father gave him princely even kingly behavior was possible even at st clouds that seemed to be what dr larch was saying homer wells dreamed he was a prince he lifted up his eyes to his king he watched st larchs every move it was the astonishing coolness of the thing that homer couldnt forget because it was dead right he asked dr larch thats why it was cool right yes said dr larch in a way homer it was never alive never alive said homer wells sometimes dr larch said a woman simply cant make herself stop a pregnancy she feels the baby is already a babyfrom the first speckand she has to have italthough she doesnt want it and she cant take care of itand so she comes to us and has her baby here she leaves it here with us she trusts us to find it a home she makes an orphan said homer wells someone has to adopt it someone usually adopts it dr larch said usually said homer wells maybe eventually dr larch said and sometimes said homer wells the woman doesnt go through with it right she doesnt go through with having the baby sometimes said dr larch the woman knows very early in her pregnancy that this child is unwanted an orphan from the start said homer wells you might say said wilbur larch so she kills it said homer wells you might say said wilbur larch you might also say that she stops it before it becomes a childshe just stops it in the first three or four months the fetusor the embryo i dont say then the childit does not quite have a life of its own it lives off the mother it hasnt developed its developed only a little said homer wells it hasnt moved independently said dr larch it doesnt have a proper nose said homer wells remembering it on the thing he had held in his hand neither the nostrils nor the nose itself had developed to its downward slope the nostrils pointed straight out from the face like the nostrils of a pig sometimes said dr larch when a woman is very strong and knows that no one will care for this baby if she has it and she doesnt want to bring a child into the world and try to find it a homeshe comes to me and i stop it tell me again whats stopping it called asked homer wells an abortion dr larch said right said homer wells an abortion and what you held in your hand homer was an aborted fetus dr larch said an embryo about three to four months an aborted fetus an embryo about three to four months said homer wells who had an irritating habit of repeating the pigtails of sentences very seriously as if he were planning to read them aloud like david copperfield and thats why dr larch said patiently some of the women who come here dont look pregnantthe embryo the fetus theres just not enough of it for it to show but they all are pregnant said homer wells all the women who come heretheyre either going to have an orphan or theyre going to stop it right thats right dr larch said im just the doctor i help them have what they want an orphan or an abortion an orphan or an abortion said homer wells nurse edna teased dr larch about homer wells you have a new shadow wilbur she said doctor larch nurse angela said you have developed an echo youve got a parrot following you around god or whatever forgive me wrote dr larch i have created a disciple i have a thirteenyearold disciple by the time homer was fifteen his reading oit davidcopperfield was so successful that some of the older girls in the girls division asked dr larch if homer might be persuaded to read to them just to the older girls homer asked dr larch certainly not said dr larch youll read to all of them in the girls division homer asked well yes dr larch said it would be awkward to have all the girls come to the boys division right said homer wells but do i read to the girls first or to the boys first the girls larch said the girls go to bed earlier than the boys they do homer asked they do here dr larch said and do i read them the same passage homer asked he was at the time in his fourth journey through davidcopperfield only his third aloudat chapter i am a new boy in more senses than one but dr larch decided that girl orphans should hear about girl orphansin the same spirit that he believed boy orphans should hear about boy orphansand so he assigned homer the task of reading aloud to the girls division from jane eyre it struck homer immediately that the girls were more attentive than the boys they were an altogether better audienceexcept for the giggles upon his arrival and upon his departure that they should be a better audience surprised homer for he found jane eyre not nearly so interesting as david copperfieid he was convinced that charlotte bronte was not nearly as good a writer as charles dickens compared to little david homer thought little jane was something of a whinera snivelerbut the girls in the girls division always cried for more for just one more scene when every evening homer would stop and hurry away out of the building and into the night racing for the boys division and dickens the night between the boys and girls division frequently smelled of sawdust only the night had kept the memory of the original st clouds intact dispensing in its secretive darkness the odors of the old sawmills and even the rank smell of the sawyers cigars the night sometimes smells like wood and cigars homer wells told dr larch who had his own memory of cigars the doctor shuddered the girls division homer thought had a different smell from the boys although the same exposed pipes the same hospital colors the same dormitory discipline prevailed on the one hand it smelled sweeter on the other hand it smelled sickerhomer had difficulty deciding for going to bed the boys and girls dressed alike undervests and underpantsand whenever homer arrived at the girls division the girls were already in their beds with their legs covered some of them sitting up some of them lying down the very few with visible breasts were usually sitting with their arms folded across their chests to conceal their development all but one the biggest one the older one she was both bigger and older than homer wells she had carried homer across the finish line of a particularly famous threelegged race she was the one called melony who was meant to be melody the one whose breasts homer had mistakenly touched the one whod pinched his pecker melony sat for the reading indianstyleon top of her bedcovers her underpants not quite big enough for her her hands on her hips her elbows pointed out like wings her considerable bosom thrust forward a bit of her big bare belly was exposed every night mrs grogan who directed the girls division would say wont you catch cold outside your covers melony nope melony would say and mrs grogan would sighit was almost a groan that was her nickname mrs groan her authority rested in her ability to make the girls think that they caused her pain by doing harm to themselves or each other oh that hurts me to see that she would tell them when they fought pulled hair gpuged eyeballs bit each other in the face that really hurts me her method was effective with the girls who liked her it was not effective with melony mrs grogan was especially fond of melony but she felt she was a failure at making melony like her oh it hurts me melony to see you catching cold outside your covers mrs grogan would say only partially clothed that really hurts me but melony would stay put her eyes never leaving homer wells she was bigger than mrs grogan she was too big for the girls division she was too big to be adopted shes too big to be a girl thought homer wells bigger than nurse edna bigger than nurse angela almost as big as dr larchshe was fat but her fat looked solid although he had not competed in the threelegged race for several years homer wells also knew that melony was strong homer had decided not to compete as long as he would be paired with melony and he would be paired with her as long as he was the oldest boy and she was the oldest girl in reading aloud from jane eyre homer needed to keep his eyes off melony one look at her would remind him of having his leg tied to hers he sensed that she resented his withdrawal from the annual competition he was also afraid that she might sense how he liked her heavinesshow fat to an orphan seemed such good fortune the sweeter passages of jane eyre too sweet for homer wells brought tears to the eyes of the girls in the girls division and drew the most plaintive sighs and moans from mrs grogan but these same sweeter passages extracted from melony the most tortured breathingas if sweetness provoked in her an anger barely restrainable the end of chapter four provided melony with too much anger to restrain that afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony homer wells read to them hearing melony hiss at the words peace and harmony he bravely read on and in the evening bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories and sang rne some of her sweetest songs homer continued glad there was only one more sentence to get through he saw melonys broad chest heave even for me chirped little jane eyre life had its gleams of sunshine gleams of sunshine melony shouted in violent disbelief let her come here let her show me the gleams of sunshine oh how it hurts me melonyto hear you say that mrs grogan said sunshine melony said with a howl the younger girls crawled all the way under their bedcovers some of them began to cry the pain this causes me i dont know if i can bear it melony mrs grogan said homer wells slipped away it was the end of the chapter anyway he was due at the boys division this time the giggles attendant on his departure were mixed with sobs and with melonys derision gleams melony called after him how this hurts us all mrs grogan said more firmly outside the night seemed full of new scents to homer wells mingled with the sawdust smell and the rank cigars was that a waft of the raucous perfume drifting over him from the former whore hotel and something like sweat from the bingoformoney room the river itself gave off a smell in the boys division they were waiting for him some of the smaller ones had fallen asleep the others were openeyedseemingly openmouthed like baby birds homer felt he was rushing from nest to nest his voice feeding them as they always cried for more his reading like food made them sleepy but it often woke homer up he usually lay awake after the nightly benediction the ince in princes and the ing in kings still rang in the dark room sometimes he wished he could sleep in the baby room the constant waking and crying there might be more rhythmic the older orphans had their irritating habits one of nurse ednas john wilburs slept on a rubber sheet homer would lie awake waiting to hear him wet his bed some nights homer would wake the child march him to the toilet point his tiny pecker in the right direction and whisper tee john wilbur pee now pee here the child asleep on his feet would hold it back waiting for the welcoming rubber sheet that familiar dent and warm puddle in the bed some nights when he felt irritable homer wells would simply stand by john wilburs bedside and whisper his command in the boys ear tee with almost instantaneous results more upsetting was nurse angelas namechild the sickly little fuzzy stone fuzzy had a cough a constant dry hack he had wet red eyes he slept inside a humidified tent a waterwheel cranked by a battery and a fan to distribute the vapor ran all night fuzzy stones chest sounded like a tiny failing motor the damp cool sheets enclosing him fluttered through the night like the tissue of a giant semitransparent lung the waterwheel the fan fuzzy stones dramatic gaspsthey merged in homers mind if one of the three were to stop homer doubted hed know which two were still alive dr larch told homer that he suspected fuzzy stone was allergic to dust that the boy was born and slept in a former sawmill was doubtlessly not the best thing for him a child with chronic bronchitis was not easily adoptable who wants to take home a cough when fuzzy stones coughing was too much for homer wells when the various engines that struggled to maintain fuzzy were too much on homers mind lungs waterwheel and fanhomer would quietly seek out the baby room nurse angela or nurse edna was always there usually awake and tending to one of the babies sometimes when the babies were quiet even the nurse on duty was sleeping and homer wells would tiptoe past them all one night he saw one of the mothers standing in the baby room she did not appear to be looking for her baby in particular she was just standing in her hospital gown in the middle of the baby room her eyes closed absorbing the smells and sounds of the baby room through her other senses homer was afraid the woman would wake up nurse angela who was dozing on the duty bed nurse angela would have been cross with her slowly as homer imagined you might assist a sleepwalker he led the woman back to the mothers room the mothers were often awake when he went to peek in on them sometimes he would get someone a glass of water the women who came to st clouds for the abortions rarely stayed overnight they required less time to recover than the women who had delivered and dr larch discovered that they were most comfortable if they arrived in the morning shortly before light and left in the early evening just after dark in the daytime the sound of the babies was not so prevailing because the noise the older orphans made and the talk among the mothers and the nurses confused everything it was the sound of the newborn babies that dr larch observed upset the women having the abortions at nightexcept for john wilburs peeing and fuzzy stones coughthe waking babies and the owls made the only sounds at st clouds it was a simple enough observation to make the women having abortions were not comforted to hear the cries and prattle of the newborn you could not plan the exact hour for a delivery but larch tried to plan the abortions for the early morning which gave the women the whole day to recover and allowed them to be gone by evening some of the women traveled a long wayin these cases larch recommended that they come to st clouds the night before their abortions when he could give them something strong to help them sleep theyd have the whole of the next day to recover if one of those women spent the night it was never in the room with the expectant or delivered mothers homer wellsin his insomniac tour of st cloudssaw that in sleep the expressions of these overnight visitors were no more nor less troubled than the expressions of the women who were having or whod already had babies homer wells would try to imagine his own mother among the faces of the sleeping and the wakeful women where was she waiting to get back towhen the pain of her labor was behind her or was there no place she wanted to go and what when she was lying there was his father thinkingif he even knew he was a father if she even knew who he was these are the things the women would say to him are you in training to be a doctor are you going to be a doctor when you grow up are you one of the orphans how old are you hasnt anyone adopted you yet did someone send you back do you like it here and he would answer i might become a doctor of course doctor larch is a good teacher thats right one of the orphans almost sixteen i tried being adopted but it just wasnt for me i wanted to come back of course i like it here one of the womenvery expectant her belly huge under a taut sheetasked him do you mean if someone wanted to adopt you you wouldnt go i wouldnt go said homer wells right you wouldnt even consider it the woman asked he almost couldnt look at hershe seemed so ready to explode well i guess id think about it homer wells said but id probably decide to stay as long as i can help out around hereyou know be of use the pregnant woman began to cry be of use she said as if shed learned to repeat the pigtails of sentences from listening to homer wells she pulled down the sheet she pulled up her hospital gown nurse edna had already shaved her she put her hands on her great belly look at that she whispered you want to be of use right said homer wells who held his breath no one but me ever put a hand on me to feel that baby no one wanted to put his ear against it and listen the woman said you shouldnt have a baby if theres no one who wants to feel it kick or listen to it move i dont know said homer wells dont you want to touch it or put your ear down to it the woman asked him okay said homer wells putting his hand on the womans hot hard belly put your ear down against it too the woman advised him right homer said he touched his ear very lightly to her stomach but she strongly pressed his face against her she was like a drumall pings and pongs she was a warm engineshut off but still tapping with heat if homer had been to the ocean he would have recognized that she was like the tide like surfsurging in and out and back and forth no one should have a baby if theres no one who wants to sleep with his head right there the woman whispered patting the place where she roughly held homers face right where homer wondered because there was no comfortable place to put his head no place between her breasts and her belly that wasnt round her breasts at least looked comfortable but he knew that wasnt where she wanted his head he found it hard to imagine from all the noise and motion inside her that the woman was carrying only one baby homer wells thought that the woman was going to give birth to a tribe you want to be of use the woman asked him crying gently now yes be of use he said sleep right here the woman told him he pretended to sleep with his face against the noisy boulder w here she held him snug he knew when her water had broken before she knew itshe had fallen that soundly asleep he went and found nurse edna without waking the woman who before dawn delivered a sevenpound baby girl since neither nurse edna nor nurse angela was in charge of naming the girl orphans after a few days someone there gave her a nameprobably mrs grogan who favoured irish names or if mrs grogan had momentarily exhausted her supply the secretary who typed badly and was responsible for melony instead of melody she also enjoyed naming the little girls homer wells never knew which one she was but he kept looking for her as if his nighttime vigil with his face upon the mothers jumping belly might have given him the senses necessary to recognize her child he never would recognize her of course all he had to go on was the fluid sound of her and how shed moved under his ear in the dark but he kept looking he watched the girls in the girls division as if he expected her to do something that would give her away he even admitted his private game to melony once but melony was typically derisive just what do you think the kids going to do so youll know which one she is melony asked is she going to gurgle is she going to fartor kick you in the ear but homer wells knew he was just playing a game by himself with himself orphans are notorious for interior games for example one of the oldest games that orphans play is imagining that their parents want them backthat their parents are looking for them but homer had spent an evening with the mystery babys mother hed heard all about the mystery babys fatherand his lack of interest in the matter homer knew that the mystery babys parents weren t looking for her that may have been why he decided hed look for her if that baby girl was growing up and if she was playing the old orphans game wouldnt it be better if there was at least someone who was looking for hereven if it was just another orphan dr larch tried to talk to homer about melonys anger anger is a funny thingdr larch began believing that anger was an unfunny thing i mean i agree the passage about the gleams of sunshineokay its sappy homer said its one of those thingsit makes you wince when you read it but its just what jane would say its just like her so what can you do homer asked but melony was violent about it dr larch knew that melony was one of the few orphans still at st clouds who was not born at st clouds shed been left at the hospital entrance one early morning when shed been four or five she was always so big for her age it had been hard to tell how old she was she hadnt talked until she was eight or nine at first larch thought she might be retarded but that wasnt the problem melony was always angry dr larch tried to explain we dont know about her origins or her early years and she may not know herself what all the sources of her anger are larch was deliberatingwhether or not he should tell homer wells that melony had been adopted and had been returned more times than homer melony had several unfortunate experiences in foster homes dr larch said cautiously if you have the opportunity to ask her about her experiencesand if she wants to talk about themit might provide her with a welcome release for some of her anger ask her about her experiences said homer wells shaking his head i dont know he said i never tried to talk to her dr larch already regretted his suggestion perhaps melony would remember her first foster family and tell homer about them they had sent her back because she allegedly bit the family dog in an altercation concerning a ball it wasnt just the one fracas that upset the family they claimed that melony repeatedly bit the dog for weeks after the incident she would creep up on the animal and surprise it when it was eating or when it was asleep the family accused melony of driving the dog crazy melony had run away from the second and third families alleging that the men in the families either fathers or brothers had taken a sexual interest in her the fourth family claimed that melony had taken a sexual interest in a younger female child in the case of number five the husband and wife eventually separated because of melonys relationship with the husband the wife claimed that her husband had seduced melony the husband claimed that melony had seduced he said attacked him melony was not ambiguous about the matter no one seduces me she told mrs grogan proudly in the case of number six the husband had died of a heart attack shortly after melonys arrival and the wife had sent the girl back to st clouds because she felt unequipped for the task of raising melony alone melonys only remark to mrs grogan had been you bet shes unequipped all this suddenly dr larch imagined homer hearing firsthand from melony the vision disturbed him he feared that he had made homer wells his apprentice an attendant to the gritty operation of st clouds while at the same time he could not resist screening the boy from some of the harder truths it was so like nurse angela of course to call homer wells angelic and so like nurse edna to speak of the boys perfection and of his innocence but dr larch worried about homers contact with the damaged women who sought the services of st cloudsthose departing mothers in whose characters and histories the boy must be seeking some definition of his own mother and the troubled women who were scraped clean and went away leaving no one behind just the products of conceptionwhat impression did they make on the boy homer wells had a good open face it was not a face that could hide thingsevery feeling and thought was visible upon it the way a lake in the open reflects every weather he had a good hand for holding and eyes you could confess to dr larch was worried about the specific details of the life stories homer would be exposed tonot simply the sordidness but also the abundant rationalizations he would hear and now melony the undisputed heavyweight of the girls division had disturbed the boy with her anger with what dr larch suspected was only the tip of the iceberg of her power her potential for educating homer wells seemed to be both terrible and vast melony began her contribution to homers education the very next evening when he read to the girls division homer had arrived early hoping to leave early but he found the girls dormitory quarters in disarray many of the girls were out of their bedssome of them shrieking when they saw him their legs were bare homer was embarrassed he stood under the hanging bulb in the communal bedroom searching the room without success for mrs grogan who was always nice to him and clutching his copy of jane eyre in both handsas if the wild girls were likely to tear it away from him he did notice that melony was already in her usual position in her expected brief attire he met her eyes which were piercing but withholding opinion then he looked down or away or at his hands holding jane eyre hey you he heard melony say to himand he heard a subsequent hush fall among the other girls hey you melony repeated when he looked up at her she was kneeling on her bed and shoving toward him the biggest bare ass hed ever seen a blue shadow pierhaps a bruise discolored one of melonys straining thighs between the bulging flexed cheeks of her intimidating buttocks a single dark eye stared at homer wells hey sunshine melony said to homer who blushed the color of the sun at sunrise or sunset hey sunshine melony crooned sweetly to himthus giving to the orphan homer wells her own name for him sunshine when homer told dr larch what melony had done to him dr larch reconsidered the wisdom of allowing homer to read to the girls division but to remove this chore from the boys duties would constitute larch felt a kind of demotion homer might suffer a sense of failure the work at an orphanage is fairly decisive when wilbur larch felt indecisive regarding homer wells he knew he was suffering from the natural feelings of a father the thought that he had allowed himself to become a father and a sufferer of a fathers indecision so depressed dr larch that he sought the good peace of etherto which he was becoming steadily more accustomed there were no curtains at st clouds the hospital dispensary was a corner room it had ai south window and an east window and it was the east window in nurse ednas opinion that made dr larch such an early riser the slim whiteiron hospital bed never looked slept in dr larch was the last to bed and the first to riseenhancing the rumor that he never slept at all if he slept it was generally agreed that he slept in the dispensary he did his writing at night at the typewriter in nurse angelas office the nurses had long ago forgotten why this room was called nurse angelas office it was st clouds only office room and dr larch had always used it for his writing since the dispensary was where he slept perhaps dr larch felt the need to say that the office belonged to someone else the dispensary had two doors one leading to a toilet and shower which in such a small room created a problem with furniture with a window on the south end and on the east wall and a cloor on the north and on the west there was no wall one could put anything against the stark bed fit under the east window the closed and locked cupboards with their frail glass doors formed an awkward maze around the dispensary counter in the middle of the room it seemed fitting for a dispensary that the medicines and the ether cans and the hardware of small surgery should occupy the most central space but larch had other reasons for arranging the room this way the labyrinth of cabinets in the middle of the room not only left access to the hall and bathroom doors it also blocked the bed from view of the hall door which like all the doors in the orphanage had no lock the cluttered dispensary afforded him some privacy for his ether frolics how larch hiked the heft of that quarterpound can ether is a matter of experience and technique imbibing ether is pungent but light even though ether is twice as heavy as air inducing ether anesthesiabringing ones patients through the panic of that suffocating odoris different with his more delicate patients larch often preceded his ether administration with five or six drops of oil of orange for himself he required no aromatic preparation no fruity disguise he was always conscious of the bump the ether can made when he set it on the floor by the bed he was not always conscious of the moment when his fingers lost their grip on the mask the coneby the force of his own exhalationsfell from his face he was usually conscious of the limp hand that had released the cone oddly that hand was the first part of him to wake up often reaching for the mask that was no longer there he could usually hear voices outside the dispensaryif they were calling him he was confident that he would always have time to recover doctor larch nurse angela or nurse edna or homer wells would ask which was all larch needed to be brought back from his ether voyage right here larch would answer just resting it was the dispensary after all dont the dispensaries of surgeons always smell of ether and for a man who worked so hard and slept so little if he slept at all wasnt it natural that he would need an occasional nap it was melony who first suggested to homer wells that dr larch possessed certain remote habits and singular powers listen sunshine melony told homer how come your favorite doctor doesnt look at women he doesnt believe me he wont even look at me and every male everywhere every time looks at memen and boys look at me even you sunshine you look at me but homer wells looked away and whats the smell he carries around melony asked ether said homer wells hes a doctor he smells like ether youre saying this is normal melony asked him right said homer wells like a dairy farmer melony asked slyly hes supposed to smell like milk and cowshit right right said homer wells cautiously wrong sunshine melony said tour favorite doctor smells like hes got ether inside himlike hes got ether instead of blood homer let this pass the top of his dark head measured up to melonys shoulder they were walking on the treestripped and eroded riverbank in the part of st clouds where the abandoned buildings had remained abandoned the river there had eroded not only the bank but also the foundations of these buildings which in several cases did not have proper foundations or even cellar holessome of these buildings were set on posts which were visible and rotting in the gnawing water at the rivers edge the building homer and melony preferred had a porch that had not been designed to overhang the river though it hung over the river now through the porchs broken floorboards homer and melony could watch the bruisecolored water rush by the building had been a kind of dormitory for the rough men who worked in the saw mills and lumberyards of the old st clouds it was not a building of sufficient style for the bosses or even the forementhe ramses paper company people had kept rooms in the whore hotel it was a building for the sawyers the stackers the yardmen the men who broke up the logjams who drove the logs downstream who hauled the logs and cut lumber overland the men who worked the mills usually homer and melony stayed outside the building on the porch inside there were only an empty communal kitchen and the countless sordid bunkrooms the ruptured mattresses infested with mice because of the railroad hoboes had come and gone staking out their territory in the manner of dogs by peeing around it thus isolating the mattresses least overrun by the mice even with the window glass gone and the rooms half filling with snow in the winters there was no ridding the inside of that building from the smell of urine one day when the weak spring sun had lured a blacl snake sluggish with cold to warm itself on the floorboards of the porch melony said to homer wells watch this sunshine with surprising quickness of hand for such a big girl she seized the napping snake behind its head it was a milk snakealmost three feet long and it twined around melonys arm but melony held it the proper way tightly behind the head not choking it once she had caught it she seemed to pay no attention to it she watched the sky as if for a sign and went on talking to homer wells your favorite doctor sunshine melony said he knows more about you than you know and more about me than i know maybe homer let this pass he was wary of melony especially now that she had a snake she could grab hold of me just as quickly he was thinking she could do something to me with the snake you ever think about your mother melony asked still searching the sky you ever wish you knew who she was why she didnt keep you who your father was you know those things right said homer wells who kept his eyes on the snake it wound itself around melonys arm then it uncoiled itself and hung like a rope then it thickened and thinned all by itself tentatively it explored around melonys big hip appearing to feel more secure it settled around her thick waistit could just reach i was told i was left at the door melony said maybe so maybe not i was born here said homer wells so you were told melony said nurse angela named me homer offered in evidence nurse angela or nurse edna would have named you if youd been left melony said she still watched the sky she remained indifferent to the snake shes bigger than i am shes older than i am she knows more than i do thought homer wells and she has a snake he reminded himself letting melonys last remark pass sunshine melony said absently just think about it if you were born here in saint clouds theres got to be a record of it your favorite doctor knows who your mother is hes got to have her name on file youre written down on paper its a law a lawhomer wells said flatly its a law that theres got to be a record of you melony said in writinga record a file youre history sunshine history said homer wells he had an image of dr larch sitting at the typewriter in nurse angelas office if there were records that was where they would be if you want to know who your mother is melony said all you got to do is look her up you just look up your file you could look me up while you were at it a smart reader like you sunshineit wouldnt take you much time and any of it would make more interesting reading than jane eyre my file alone is more interesting than that ill bet and who knows whats in yours homer allowed himself to be distracted from the snake he looked through a hole in the porch floorboards at some passing debris a broken branch perhaps or a mans bootmaybe a mans legwas swept by in the river when he heard a whistling sound like a whip he regretted taking his eyes from the snake he ducked melony was still concentrating on the sky she was swinging the snake around and around her head yet her attention was entirely on the skynot on any sign that appeared there either but on a redshouldered hawk it hung above the river in that lazyseeming spiral soaring of hawks when they are hunting melony let the snake sail out over the river the hawk following it even before the snake struck the water and started swimming for its life for shore the hawk began to dive the snake didnt fight the current it raced with it trying to find the angle that would bring it safely under the eroded bank or into the tangled bracken watch this sunshine melony said a long ten yards offshore the hawk seized the swimming snake and carried it writhing and striking aloft i want to show you something else melony said already turning her attention from the sky now that the outcome was clear right said homer wellsall eyes all ears at first the weight and movement of the snake appeared to make the hawks rising a struggle but the higher the hawk rose the more easily it flewas if the higher air had different properties from the air down where the snake had flourished sunshine melony called impatiently she led him inside the old building and upstairs to one of the darker bunkrooms the room smelled as if there might be someone in itpossibly someone alivebut it was too dark to see either the miceinvaded mattresses or a body melony forced open a ragged shutter hanging by one hinge and knelt on a mattress against a wall that the open shutter had brought to light an old photograph was tacked to the wall in line with what had once been the head of someones bed the tack had rusted and had bled a rusty path across the sepia tones of the photograph homer had looked at other photographs in other rooms though he had neglected this one the ones he remembered were baby pictures and pictures of mothers and fathers he presumedthe kind of family photographs that are always of interest to orphans come look at this sunshine melony said she was trying to pick the tack loose with her fingernail but the tack had been stuck there for years homer knelt beside melony on the rotting mattress it took awhile for him to grasp the content of the photograph possibly he was distracted by his awareness that he had not been as physically close to melony since hed last been tied to her in the threelegged race once homer had understood the photograph at least he understood its subject if not its reason for existing he found it a difficult photograph to go on looking at especially with melony so close to him on the other hand he suspected he would be accused of cowardice if he looked away the photograph reflected the cute revisions of reality engineered in many photographic studios at the turn of the century the picture was edged with fake clouds with a funereal or reverential mist the participants in the photograph appeared to be performing their curious act in a very stylish heaven or hell homer wells guessed it was hell the participants in the photograph were a leggy young woman and a short pony the naked woman lay with her long legs spreadeagled on a ruga wildly confused persian or oriental homer wells didnt know the differenceand the pony facing the wrong way straddled her his head was bent as if to drink or to graze just above the womans extensive patch of pubic hair the ponys expression was slightly cameraconscious or ashamed or possibly just stupid the ponys penis looked longer and thicker than homer wellss arm yet the athleticlooking young woman had contorted her neck and had sufficient strength in her arms and hands to bend the ponys penis to her mouth her cheeks were puffed out as if shed held her breath too long her eyes bulged yet the womans expression remained ambiguousit was impossible to tell if she was going to burst out laughing or if she was choking to death on the ponys penis as for the pony his shaggy face was full of faked indifferencethe placid pose of strained animal dignity lucky pony huh sunshine melony asked him but homer wells felt passing through his limbs a shudder that coincided exactly with his sudden vision of the photographer the evil manipulator of the woman the pony the clouds of heaven or the smoke of hell the mists of nowhere on this earth at least homer imagined homer saw briefly as fast as a tremble the darkroom genius who had created this spectacle what lingered with homer longer was his vision of the man who had slept on this mattress where he now knelt with melony in worship of the mans treasure this was the picture some woodsman had chosen to wake up with the portrait of pony and woman somehow substituting itself for the mans family this was what caused homer the sharpest pain to imagine the tired man in the bunkroom at st clouds drawn to this woman and this pony because he knew of no friendlier imageno baby pictures no mother no father no wife no lover no brother no friend but in spite of the pain it caused him homer wells found himself unable to turn away from the photograph with a surprisingly girlish delicacy melony was still picking at the rusty tackin such a considerate way that she never blocked homers view of the picture if i can get the damn thing off the wall she said ill give it to you i dont want it said homer wells but he wasnt sure sure you do melony said theres nothing in it for me im not interested in ponies when she finally dug the tack out of the wall she noticed that shed broken her nail and torn her cuticle a fine spatter of her blood newly marred the photograph quickly drying to a color similar to the streak of rust that ran down the ponys mane across the womans thigh melony stuck the finger with the broken nail in her mouth and handed the photograph to homer wells melony allowed her finger to tug a little at her lower lip pressing it against her lower teeth you get it dont you sunshine she asked homer wells you see what the womans doing to the pony right right said homer wells howd you like me to do to you what that woman is doing to that pony melony asked him she stuck her finger all the way into her mouth then and closed her lips around it over the second knuckle joint in this fashion she waited for his answer but homer wells let the question pass melony took her wet finger out of her mouth then and touched its tip to homers still lips homer didnt move he knew that if he looked at her finger his eyes would cross if youd like me to do that to you sunshine melony said all youve got to do is get me my fileget me my records she pressed her finger against his lips a little too hard of course while youre looking up the file on me you can look up yourselfif youre interested melony added she took her finger away give me your finger sunshine she said but homer wells holding the photograph in both hands decided to let this request pass come on melony coaxed i wont hurt you he gave her his left hand keeping the photograph in his right he actually extended his closed fist to her so that it was necessary for her to open his hand before she could slip his left index finger into her mouth look at the picture sunshine she told him he did as he was told she tapped his finger against her teeth while she managed to say just get me the file and you know what youll get just keep the picture and think about it melony said what homer thought was that the anxiety of looking at the photograph with his finger in melonys mouth kneeling beside her on the mattress home of countless mice would be eternal but there was such a startling thump on the roof of the buildinglike a falling body followed by a lighter thump as if the body had bounced that melony bit down hard on his finger before he could instinctively retrieve it from her mouth still on their knees they lurched into each others arms they hugged each other and held their breath homer wells could feel his heart pound against melonys breasts what the hell was that melony asked homer wells let the question pass he was imagining the ghost of the woodsman whose photograph he clutched in his hand the actual body of the sawmill laborer landing on the roof a man with a rusty ripsaw in each hand a man whose ears would hear in eternity only the whine of those lumberyard blades in that thump of dead weight upon the roof of the abandoned building homer himself heard the snarling pitch of those longago sawsbut what was that sharp almost human noise he heard singing above the buzz it was the sound of cries homer imagined the paperthin wails of the babies on the hill those first orphans of st clouds his hot cheek felt the flutter of the pulse in melonys throat the lightest most delicate footsteps seemed to walk the roofas if the body of the ghost after his fall were changing back to spirit jesus melony said shoving homer wells away from her so forcefully that he fell against the avail the noise homer made caused the spirit on the roof to scurry and to emit a piercing twosyllable shriekthe easily identified whistle of the redshouldered hawk keeyer the hawk said the hawks cry was apparently not recognizable to melony who screamed but homer knew instantly what was on the roof he rushed down the stairs across the porch to the wrecked rail he was in time to see the hawk ascending this time the snake appeared easier to carry it hung straight down as true as a plumb line it was impossible to know if the hawk had lost control of the snake or if the bird had dropped the snake intentionally realizing that this was a sure if not entirely professional way to kill it no matter the long fall to the roof had clearly finished the snake and its dead weight was easier to bear away than when it had lived and writhed in the hawks talons and had repeatedly struck at the hawks breast homer noted that the snake was slightly longer and not quite as thick as the ponys penis melony out of breath stood on the porch beside homer when the hawk was out of sight she repeated her promise to him just keep the picture and think about it she repeated not that homer wells needed any instruction to think about it what a lot he had to think about adolescence wrote wilbur larch is it the first time in life we discover that we have something terrible to hide from those who love us for the first time in his life homer wells was hiding something from dr larchand from nurse angela and nurse edna and with the photograph of the pony with its penis in the womans mouth homer wells was also hiding his first misgivings concerning st larch with the photograph he hid his first lustnot only for the woman who gagged on the ponys amazing instrument but also for the inspired promise melony had made him hidden with the photograph under his hospitalbed mattress pinned against the bedsprings were homers anxieties concerning what he might discover in the socalled filesin the imagined record of his birth at st clouds his own mothers history lay in hiding with that photograph which homer found he was more and more drawn to he took it out from under the mattress and looked at it three or four times a day and at night when he couldnt sleep he looked at it in candlelighta drowsy light in which the womans eyes appeared to bulge less violently a light in the flicker of which homer imagined he could see the womans cheeks actually move the movement of the candlelight appeared to stir the ponys mane one night when he was looking at the picture he heard john wilbur wet his bed more often homer looked at the picture to the accompaniment of fuzzy stones dramatic gaspsthe cacophony of lungs waterwheel and fan seemed appropriate to the womanandpony act that homer wells so fully memorized and imagined something changed in homers insomnia dr larch detected the difference or else it was the deception within him that made homer wells conscious of dr larchs observations of him when homer would tiptoe down to nurse angelas office late at night it seemed to him that dr larch was always at the typewriterand that he would always notice homers careful movement in the hall anything i can do for you homer dr larch would ask just cant sleep homer would reply so whats new dr larch would ask did the man write all night in the daytime nurse angelas office was busyit was the only room for interviews and phone calls it was full of dr larchs papers toohis correspondence with other orphanages with adoption agencies with prospective parents his noteworthy if occasionally facetious journal his whatnot diary which he called a brief history of st clouds it was no longer brief and it grew dailyevery entry faithfully beginning here in st clouds or in other parts of the world dr larchs papers also included extensive family historiesbut only of the families who adopted the orphans contrary to melonys belief no records were kept of the orphans actual mothers and fathers an orphans history began with its date of birthits sex its length in inches its weight in pounds its nursegiven name if it was a boy or the name mrs grogan or the girls division secretary gave it if it was a girl this with a record of the orphans sicknesses and shots was all there was a substantially thicker file was kept on the orphans adoptive familiesknowing what he could about those families was important to dr larch here in st clouds he wrote i try to consider with each rule i make or break that my first priority is an orphans future it is for his or her future for example that i destroy any record of the identity of his or her natural mother the unfortunate women who give birth here have made a very difficult decision they should not later in their lives be faced with making this decision again and in almost every case the orphans should be spared any later search for the biological parents certainly the orphans should in most cases be spared the discovery of the actual parents i am thinking of them always of themonly of the orphans of course they will one day want to know at the very least they will be curious but how does it help anyone to look forward to the past how are orphans served by having their past to look ahead to orphans especially must look ahead to their futures and would an orphan be served by having his or her biological parent in later years regret the decision to give birth here if there were records it would always be possible for the real parents to trace their children i am not in the business of reuniting orphans with their biological beginnings that is the storytelling business i am in the business for the orphans that is the passage from a brief history of st clouds that wilbur larch showed to homer wells when he caught homer in nurse angelas office going through his papers i was just looking for something and i couldnt find it homer stammered to dr larch i know what you were looking for homer dr larch told him and it is not to be found that is what the note said the one homer passed to melony when he went to the girls division to read jane eyre each night they had repeated a wordless habit melony would stick her finger in her mouthshe appeared to stick it halfway down her throat her eyes bulging in mockery of the woman with the ponyand homer wells would simply shake his head indicating that he hadnt found what he was looking for the note that said not to be found provoked a look of profound suspicion on melonys restless countenance homer dr larch had said i dont remember your mother i dont even remember you when you were born you didnt become you until later i thought there was a law homer said he meant melonys lawa law of records or written history but wilbur larch was the only historian and the only law at st clouds it was an orphanage law an orphans life began when wilbur larch remembered it and if an orphan was adopted before it became memorable which was the hope then its life began with whoever had adopted it that was larchs law after all he had taken the necessary responsibility to follow the common law regarding when a fetus was quick or not yet quick the rules governing whether he delivered a baby or whether he delivered a mother were his rules too ive been thinking about you homer dr larch told the boy i think about you more and more but i dont waste my timeor yoursthinking about who you were before i knew you larch showed homer a letter he was writingit was still in the typewriter it was a letter to someone at the new england home for little wanderers which had been an orphanage even longer than st clouds the letter was friendly and familiar larchs correspondent appeared to be an old colleague if not an old friend there was in the tone of larchs argument too the sparkle of frequent debateas if the correspondent were someone larch had often used as a kind of philosophical opponent the reasons orphans should be adopted before adolescence is that they should be loved and have someone to love before they embark on that necessary phase of adolescence namely deceitfulness larch argued in the letter a teenager discovers that deceit is almost as seductive as sex and much more easily accomplished it may be especially easy to deceive loved onesthe people who love you are the least willing to acknowledge your deceit but if you love no one and feel that no one loves you theres no one with the power to sting you by pointing out to you that youre lying if an orphan is not adopted by the time he reaches this alarming period of adolescence he may continue to deceive himself and others forever for a terrible time of life a teenager deceives himself he believes he can trick the world he believes he is invulnerable an adolescent who is an orphan at this phase is in danger of never growing up of course dr larch knew homer wells was different he was lovedby nurse angela and nurse edna and by dr larch in spite of himselfand homer wells not only knew that he was loved he also probably knew that he loved these people his age of deceit might be blessedly brief melony was the perfect example of the adolescent orphan larch described in his letter to the new england home for little wanderers this also occurred to homer wells who had asked melonybefore he gave her the note that her history was not to be foundwhat she wanted to find her mother for to kill her melony had said without hesitation maybe ill poison her but if shes not as big as i am if im much stronger than she is and i probably am then id like to strangle her to strangle her repeated homer wells uncontrollably why melony asked him what would you do if you found your mother i dont know he said ask her some questions maybe ask her some questions melony said homer had not heard such scorn in melonys voice since her response to jane eyres gleams of sunshine homer knew that his simple notenot to be found would never satisfy her although homer had found dr larch as usual to be convincing homer was also holding back he was still deceiving dr larch and himself a little the photograph of the woman with the pony was still pinned between his mattress and his bedsprings it had grown almost soft with handling frankly homer was full of regret he knew he could not produce melonys history and that without it he would be denied the ponys seemingly singular experience what does he mean not to be found melony screamed at homer they were on the sagging porch of the building where the woman and the pony had spent so many years what he means is hes playing godhe gives you your history or he takes it away if thats not playing god what is homer wells let this pass dr larch homer knew played god in other ways it was still homers cautious opinion that dr larch played god pretty well here in st clouds dr larch wrote i have been given the choice of playing god or leaving practically everything up to chance it is my experience that practically everything is left up to chance much of the time men who believe in good and evil and who believe that good should win should watch for those moments when it is possible to play godwe should seize those moments there wont be many here in st clouds there may be more moments to seize than one could find in the rest of the world but that is only because so much that comes this way has been left to chance already goddamn him melony screamed but the river was everloud the empty building had heard much worse than this in its day and homer wells let this remark pass too too bad for you sunshine melony snapped at him isnt it she insisted he kept his distance so she yelledof which the maine woods across the river managed only a short echo of the o she lifted her heavy leg and kicked a whole section of the wrecked porch rail into the river so this is it melony cried but the forest was too dense to manage even a clipped echo of the it the maine woods like homer wells let melonys remark pass jesus melony cried but the forest repeated nothing the old building might have creakedpossibly it sighed it was difficult to destroy that building time and other vandals had already destroyed it melony was looking for possible parts of the building she could still destroy homer followed her at a safe distance sunshine melony said finding a small pane of glass that hadnt been smashedand smashing it sunshine weve got nobody if you tell me weve got each other ill kill you it had not occurred to homer to offer this or any other suggestion to melony he kept silent if you tell me weve got your favorite doctor larch or this whole place she saidstamping her foot through a floorboard trying to pry the floorboard loose with both handsif you tell me that ill torture you before i kill you right said homer wells with the floorboard in both hands melony attacked the banister of the main staircase the banister was knocked apart easily but the banister post which anchored the whole railing in the downstairs hall remained upright melony dropped the floorboard and seized the banister post in a bear hug goddamn you she screamedat dr larch at her mother at st clouds at the world she wrestled the post to the floor it was still attached to a main support beam under the floorboards but melony swung a piece of the banister railing like a club until she was able to knock the post free when she tried to lift the post and couldnt she turned to homer wells cant you see i need help she said to him together they lifted the post using it as a battering ram they knocked down the kitchen wall why arent you angry she asked homer whats wrong with you youre never going to find out who did this to you dont you care i dont know said homer wells together they ran the post headon into what appeared to be a fairly major beam maybe it supports the second floor thought homer wells they hit the beam three blows bouncing off in a different direction each time with the fourth try they cracked it something in the building above them appeared to shift melony dropped her share of the banister post and bearhugged the cracked beam she tried to run with the beam her momentum carrying her over the doorsill out onto the porch one of the upstairs bunkrooms fell downstairs into the kitchen when that happened the porch roof partially collapsed and what remained of the porch railing was launched into the river even melony seemed impressed with this much destruction she took homer wells by the hand and almost gently led him upstairsmore than half the upstairs was still upstairs including the bunkroom where the pony and the woman had entertained a former woodsman of st clouds help me melony said softly to homer wells they went to the window and together managed to wrest the shutter free of the one hinge that held it they watched it fall straight through the porch roof and pass even more easily through the porch floorboards before it splashed in the river neat huh melony asked dully she sat on the mattress where theyd been kneeling when the snake hit the roof help me melony said again she indicated to homer that he should sit beside her help me or im going to run away she told him help me or im going to kill someone these notions seemed vaguely parallel if not equal to her homer realized that it was not easy for him in the case of melony to be of use but he tried dont kill anyone he said dont run away why stay she countered youre not stayingi dont mean youll run away i mean someone will adopt you no they wont homer said besides i wouldnt go youll go melony said i wont homer said please dont run awayplease dont kill anyone if i stay youll stayis that what youre saying melony asked him is that what i mean thought homer wells but melony as usual gave him no time to think promise me youll stay as long as i stay sunshine melony said she moved closer to him she took his hand and opened his fingers and put his index finger in her mouth lucky pony melony whispered but homer wells wasnt sure if the pony had been so lucky the old building gave a groan melony slid his index finger in and out of her mouth promise me youll stay as long as i stay sunshine she said right said homer wells she bit him i promise homer said more of the upstairs fell into the kitchen there was a sympathetic shriek from the twisted beams that still supported what was left of the porch roof what was it that distracted himwhen melony finally found his tiny penis and put it into her mouth he was not afraid that the old building would collapse and kill them both this would have been a reasonable fear he was not thinking about the history of the mattress they were lying on its history was violenteven by melonys standards he was not thinking of his own lost history and he wasnt thinking that his being with melony was or wasnt a betrayal of dr larch in part the noise distracted homer there was the noise that melony made with her mouthand her breathingand then there was his own breathing the racket of this passion reminded him of little fuzzy stone and the energy of those mechanisms that struggled to keep fuzzy alive that such wet breathy effort was made in fuzzys behalf seemed to emphasize how fragile his life was homer grew only a little bigger in melonys mouth when he started to grow smaller melony increased her efforts homers major distraction was the photograph itself which he saw very clearly he could even see the dustfree rectangle on the wall where the photograph had been if the photograph had at first inspired him to imagine this act with melony now the photograph directly blocked his ability to perform at all if the woman in the photograph had at first encouraged him to think of melony now the woman and melony seemed only abused the ponys brute insensitivity remained the same the dumb beasts inappropriate passivity homer felt himself grow tinier than he felt hed ever been melony was humiliated she shoved him away goddamn you she screamed at him whats wrong with you anyway and dont you tell me theres anything wrong with me right homer said there isnt you bet there isnt melony cried but her lips looked soreeven bruisedand he saw tears in the anger in her eyes she yanked the mattress out from under him then she folded it in half and threw it out the window the mattress fell on the roof and stuck half through the hole the shutter had made this seemed to enrage melony that the mattress hadnt passed cleanly through to the river she began to dismantle the bunk bed nearest her crying while she worked homer wells as he had retreated from her outrage at the gleams of sunshine retreated from her now he sneaked down the weakened stairs when he stepped on the porch it gave a short creak and slumped in the direction of the river momentarily throwing him offbalance he heard what sounded like several bunk beds or a part of a wall landing on the roof above him he fled for open ground melony must have seen him through the upstairs window you promised me sunshine she screamed at him you promised you wouldnt leave me as long as i stay you stay i promise he called to her but he turned away and started down the river along the bank heading back to the occupied buildings of st clouds and to the orphanage on the hill above the river he was still on the riverbank near the waters edge when melony managed to dislodge the overhanging porch the porch roof went with it he stood and watched what looked like half the building float downstream homer imagined that melonygiven time enoughcould possibly rid the landscape of the entire town but he didnt stay to watch her ongoing efforts at destruction he went directly to his bed in the sleeping room of the boys division he lifted his mattress he intended to throw the photograph away but it was gone it wasnt me said fuzzy stone although it was midday fuzzy was still in the sleeping room imprisoned in his humidified tent that meant homer knew that fuzzy was having a kind of relapse the tent at night was fuzzys home but when fuzzy spent the day in the tent the tent was referred to as his treatment he had to have what dr larch called tests all the time too and every day everyone knew he had to have a shot homer stood next to the flapping breathing gasping contraption and asked fuzzy stone where the photograph was homer was informed that john wilbur had wet his bed so thoroughly that nurse angela had told him to lie down on homers bed while she replaced the ruined mattress john wilbur had found the photograph he showed it to fuzzy and to a few of the other boys who were around among them wilbur walsh and snowy meadows snowy had thrown up then what happened homer asked fuzzy who was already out of breath fuzzy was nine next to homer wells he was the oldest orphan in the boys division fuzzy said that nurse angela had come back with a fresh mattress for john wilbur and she had seen the photograph naturally shed taken it away of course john wilbur had told her where hed found it by now homer knew nurse edna would have seen it and dr larch would have seen it too it crossed homers mind to go find john wilbur and hit him but the boy was too smallhe would only pee there would be this new evidence against homer but what was it fuzzy stone gasped to homer i thought you saw it homer said i saw it but what was it fuzzy repeated he looked genuinely frightened snowy meadows had thought that the woman was eating the ponys intestines fuzzy explained wilbur walsh had run away john wilbur had probably peed some more thought homer wells what were they doing fuzzy stone pleaded the woman fuzzy said with a gasp how could she how could she breathe fuzzy asked breathlessly he was wheezing badly when homer left him in the daylight fuzzy seemed almost transparent as ifif you held him up to a bright enough source of lightyou could see right through him see all his frail organs working to save him dr larch was not in nurse angelas office where homer had expected to find him homer was thankful that nurse edna and nurse angela were not around he felt especially ashamed to face them outside the hospital entrance he could see nurse angela talking to the man who hauled away the nonburnable trash the issue of their conversation was john wilburs old mattress homer went to the dis pensary to see if dr l arch was there it had been quite a day for wilbur larch who had reclined on his hospital bed in the dispensary with a gauze cone that was more heavily saturated with ether than was his usual habit the reported vandalism to the socalled sawyers lodge had upset larch less than it had disturbed certain townspeople who had witnessed the damage done by homer and melonymostly by melony dr larch was sure what are abandoned buildings for dr larch wonderedif not for kids to vandalize a little the report that half the building had floated downriver was surely exaggerated he inhaled and thought about what had really upset him that photograph that woman with the pony larch was not bothered that homer wells had the picture teenagers were interested in that kind of thing larch knew that homer never would have shown it to the younger boys that homer had kept such a photograph meant to wilbur larch that it was time homer was given more serious adult responsibilities it was time to step up the apprenticeship and the photograph itselfto larchwas not that upsetting after all he had worked in the south end such photographs were everywhere in wilbur larchs days at the boston lyingin such pictures cost a dime what troubled larch was the particular woman in the photograph he had no trouble recognizing mrs eamess brave daughter larch had seen her cheeks puffed out beforeshe was a veteran cigar smoker no stranger to putting terrible things in her mouth and when shed been brought to his door with acute peritonitis the result of whatever unspeakable injuries she had suffered off harrison her eyes had bulged then to look at the photograph reminded larch of the life she must have had it reminded him too that he could have eased the pain of her lifejust a littleby giving her an abortion the photograph reminded larch of a life he could haveeven if only momentarilysaved mrs eamess tragic daughter should have been his first abortion patient wilbur larch looked at the photograph and wondered if mrs eamess daughter had been paid enough for posing with the pony to be able to afford the abortion fee off harrison probably not he concludedit wasnt even a very good photograph whoever had posed the participants had been careless with the young womans stunning dark pigtail it could have been draped over her shoulder or even been made to lie near her breast where its darkness would have accented the whiteness of her skin it could have been flung straight back behind her head which at least would have emphasized the pigtails unusual thickness and length obviously no one had been thinking about the pigtail it lay off to the side of mrs eamess daughters face curled in a shadow that was cast by one of the ponys stout short shaggy legs in the photograph the pigtail was lost you had to know mrs eamess daughter to know what that dark shape off to the side of the womans straining face was im sorry larch said inhaling mrs eamess daughter did not respond so he said again im sorry he exhaled he thought he heard her calling him doctor larch rhymes with screams wilbur larch murmured he took the deepest possible breath his hand lost touch with the cone which rolled off his face and under the bed doctor larch homer wells said again the smell of ether in the dispensary seemed unusually strong to homer who passed through the labyrinth of medicine chests to see if dr larch was on his bed shit or get off the pot he heard dr larch say inhale exhale im sorry dr larch said when he saw homer beside his bed he sat up too fast he felt very lightheaded the room was swimming im sorry he repeated thats okay said homer wells im sorry i woke you up rhymes with screams said wilbur larch pardon me said homer wells in the closed dispensary a fragrant mothball sent its vapory messages everywhere sit down homer said dr larch who realized that homer was already sitting beside him on the bed larch wished his head was clearer he knew this was an important confrontation for the boy homer expected to be reprimanded and not in uncertain terms but larch feared he might not be in the best shape for sounding certain vandalism larch launched in pornography now theres a start he thought but the boy sitting beside him just waited patiently larch took a gulp of what he hoped was clearer air the fragrance of ether was still heavily present in the dispensary the air in the immediate vicinity was alternately drowsy and sparkling with little stars vandalism is one thing homer larch said and pornographyquite another right said homer wellsgrowing older learning something new every day more central to our relationship homer is the issue of you deceiving me right righthomer said finelarch said the stars sparkled so brightly on the ceiling of the dispensary that for a moment dr larch thought that their dialogue was taking place under the nighttime firmament he tipped his head back to escape the fumes but he lost his balance and fell back on the bed are you okayhomer asked him fine larch boomed heartilythen he started to laugh it was the first time homer wells had heard dr larch laugh listen homer dr larch said but he giggled if youre old enough to vandalize whole buildings and masturbate to pictures of women giving blow jobs to ponies then youre old enough to be my assistant this struck larch as so funny that he doubled up on the bed homer thought it was a funny thing to say too and he began to smile you dont get it do you larch asked still giggling you dont get what i mean he lay on his back and waved his feet in the air while the firmament of stars circled above them im going to teach you surgery larch shouted at homer which dissolved both of them into tears of laughter obstetrical procedure homer larch said homer now fell back on the bed too the lords work and the devils homerlarch said hooting the works he screamed homer started to cough he was laughing so hard he was surprised when larchlike a magician produced the photograph of the worn an and the pony and waved it in front of him if youre old enough even to contemplate this larch said youre old enough to have a grownups job this cracked up larch so completely that he had to hand the photograph to homer wellsor else he would have dropped it listen homer larch said youre going to finish medical school before you start high school this was especially funny to homer but dr larch suddenly grew serious he snatched the photograph back from homer look at this he commanded they sat on the edge of the bed and larch held the photograph steady on his knee ill show you what you dont know look at that he said pointing to the pigtail obscured in the shadow of the ponys leg what is it he asked homer wells teenagers you think you know everything larch said threateningly homer caught the new tone of voice he paid close attention to this part of the picture hed never looked at beforea stain on the rug maybe or was it a pool of blood from the womans ear well larch asked its not in david copperfield its not in jane eyre eitherwhat you need to know he added almost nastily the medical slant of the conversation convinced homer wells that it was a pool of blood in the photograph that only a doctor could recognize it so positively blood homer said the womans bleeding larch ran with the photograph to the lamp at the dispensary counter blood larch said blood he looked the photograph all over thats not blood you idiot thats a pigtail he showed the photograph once more to homer wells it would be homers last look at the photograph though dr larch would look at it often he would keep it attached to the pages of a brief history of st clouds he did not keep it for pornographic interest but because it reminded him of a woman he had abused twice he had slept with her mother in front of her and he had not provided her with a service that she had every right to request he had not been a proper doctor to her and he wanted to remember her that he was forced to remember her with a ponys penis in her mouth made dr larchs mistakes all the more forcefully mistakes to him larch liked it that way he was a hard manon himself too he took a harder line toward homer wells than the hilarity of his promises to the boy at first suggestedto teach him the works as larch called it was not so funny surgery obstetrical procedureeven a normal birth even the standard d and crequired considerable background and preparation you think its tough to look at a woman with a ponys penis in her mouth homer larch asked him the next daywhen he was not under the influence of ether you ought to look at something thats harder to understand than that here larch said handing homer the wellworn copy of grays anatomy look at this look at it three or four times a day and every night forget pony penises and learn this here in st clouds wrote dr wilbur larch i have had little use for my grays anatomy but in france in world war i i used it every day it was the only road map i had over there larch also gave homer his personal handbook of obstetrical procedure his notebooks from medical school and from his internships he began with the chemistry lectures and the standard textbook he set aside a corner of the dispensary for a few easy experiments in bacteriology although the sight of petri dishes caused larch flashes of no uncertain pain he was not fond of the world there was to be seen under the microscope larch was also not fond of melonyspecifically he was not fond of her apparent hold on homer wells larch assumed that they slept together he assumed that melony had initiated him which was true and now forced him to continue which was not the case in time they would sleep together albeit routinely and that hold that dr larch imagined melony had on homer was balanced by a hold homer had on melony homers promise to her which larch couldnt see he saw melony as mrs grogans responsibility and he was unaware how his responsibility for homer wells might cloud his other responsibilities he sent homer to the river to catch a frog then he made homer dissect it although not everything in the frog could be properly accounted for in grays anatomy it was homers first visit to the river since he had fled from melonys destruction of the socalled sawyers lodge and homer was impressed to see that truly half the building was gone homer was also impressed with the first live birth he was asked to observenot so much with any special skill that seemed to be required of dr larch and not with the formal efficient procedures carried out by nurse angela and nurse edna what impressed homer was the process that was already so much under way before dr larchs procedure began what impressed homer was how much had happened to the woman and her child that was internally just their natural progressthe actual rhythm of the labor you could set a watch to it the power of the womans pushing muscles the urgency of the child to be born the most unnatural thing about it to homer wells was how clearly hostile the child found the environment in which it first exercised its lungshow clearly unfriendly though not unexciting the childs new world was to the child whose firsl choice had it been given a choice might have been to remain where it was not a bad reaction meloriy might have observed had she been there however much homer enjoyed having sex with melony he was troubled that the act was more arbitrary than birth when homer went to read jane eyre to the girls division melony seemed subdued to him not defeated or even resigned something in her had been tired out something about her look was worn down she had been wrong after all about the existence of her history in dr larchs handsand being wrong about important things is exhausting she had been humiliated too first by the incredible shrinking penis oif little homer wells and second by how quickly homer appeared to take sex with her for granted and homer thought she must be physically tiredafter all she had singlehandedly obliterated a sizable chunk of the manmade history of st clouds she had pushed half a building into the flow of time she has a right to look worn out thought homer wells something in the way he read jane eyre struck homer as different tooas if this or any story were newly informed by the recent experiences in his life a woman with a ponys penis in her mouth his first sexual failure his first routine sex grays anatomy and a live birth he read with more appreciation of janes anxiety which had struck him earlier as tedious jane has a right to be anxious he thought it was unfortunate timingafter what he and melony had been through togetherthat he encountered that passage in the middle of chapter ten where jane imagines how it might be to leave her orphanage where she realizes that the real world is wide and that her own existence is not enough did homer only imagine there was a new reverence in the girls division when he read this sectionhat melony especially seemed poised above the sentences as if she were hearing them for the first time and then he hit this line i tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon his mouth went dry when he read it he needed to swallow which gave the line more emphasis than he wanted to give it when he tried to begin again melony stopped him what was that read that again sunshine i tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon homer wells read aloud i know just how she feels melony said bitterly but quietly it hurts me to hear you say that melony mrs grogan began softly i know just how she feels melony repeated and so do you sunshine she added little jane should try fifteen or sixteen or seventeen years melony announced loudly she should try it and see if she doesnt tire of that routine youll only hurt yourself dear if you keep on like that mrs grogan said and indeed this seemed true melony was crying she was such a big girlto put her head in mrs grogans lap and allow her to stroke her hairbut she just went on crying quietly mrs grogan could not remember when shed last held melonys head in her lap homer caught the look from mrs grogan that he should leave it was not the end of the chapter not even the end of the scene or even of a paragraph there was more to read the next line began i desired liberty but it would have been cruel to continue jane eyre had already made her point homer and melony had already had several such afternoonsthose days that tire you out about your whole life this night the air between the girls and boys divisions seemed odorless and void of history it was simply dark outside when he went back to the boys division nurse angela told him that john wilbur was goneadopted a nice family nurse angela told homer happily the father of the family used to be a bedwetter theyre going to be very sympathetic as was dr larchs habit when someone was adopted his routine benediction to the boys in the darkness was altered slightly before he addressed them as princes of maine as kings of new england he made an oddly formal announcement let us be happy for john wilbur wilbur larch said he has found a family good night john dr larch said and the boys murmured after him good night john good night john wilbur and dr larch would pause respectfully before saying the usual good night you princes of maineyou kings of new england homer wells looked at a little of grays anatomy in the candlelight allowed him before he tried to go to sleep it was not just john wilburs peeing that was missing from the night something else was gone it took homer a while to detect what was absent it was the silence that finally informed him fuzzy stone and his noisy apparatus had been taken to the hospital apparently the breathing contraptionand fuzzyrequired more careful monitoring and dr larch had moved the whole business into the private room next to surgery where nurse edna or nurse angela could keep a close eye on fuzzy it was not until homer wells had some experience with dilatation and curettage that he would know what fuzzy stone resembled he looked like an embryo fuzzy stone looked like a walking talking fetus that was what was peculiar about the way you could almost see through fuzzys skin and his slightly cavedin shape that was what made him appear so especially vulnerable he looked as if he were not yet alive but still in some stage of development that should properly be carried on inside the womb dr larch told homer that fuzzy had been born prematurelythat fuzzys lungs had never adequately developed homer would not have a picture of what this meant until he confronted the few recognizable parts in his first look at the standard procedure for removing the products of conception are you listening homer wilbur larch asked when the procedure was over yeshomer wells said im not saying its right you understand im saying its her choiceits a womans choice shes got a right to have a choice you understand larch asked right said homer wells when he couldnt sleep he thought about fuzzy stone when homer went down to the private room next to surgery he couldnt hear the breathing apparatus he stood very still and listened he could always track fuzzy down by his soundlungs waterwheel and fanbut the silence homer wells listened to made a more startling noise to him than the sound of that snake hitting the roof while his finger was in melonys mouth poor melony he thought she now listened to jane eyre as if it were her life story being told to her and the only thing she ever said to homer wells was to remind hi m of his promise you wont leave here before i do remember you promised where is hehomer asked dr larch wheres fuzzy dr larch was at the typewriter in nurse angelas off ice where he wasvery latealmost every night i was thinking of a way to tell you larch said you said i was your apprentice right homer asked him if thats what i am i should be told if youre teaching me you cant leave anything out right thats right homer dr larch agreed how the boy had changed how does one mark the passage of time in an orphanage why hadnt larch noticed that homer wells needed a shave why hadnt larch taught him to do that i am responsible for everythingif i am going to be responsible at all larch reminded himself fuzzys lungs werent strong enough homer dr larch said they never developed properly he was susceptible to every respiratory infection that i ever saw homer wells let it pass he regretted that fuzzy h ad seen the photograph homer was growing up he was starting the process of holding himself responsible for things that photograph had upset fuzzy stone there was nothing homer or even dr larch could have done for fuzzys lungs but the photograph hadnt been necessary what are you going to tell the little ones homer asked dr larch wilbur larch looked at homer god how he loved what he saw proud as a father he had trouble speaking his affection for homer wells had virtually etherized him what do you think i should say homer dr larch asked it was homers first decision as an adult he thought about it very carefully in he was almost sixteen he was beginning the process of learning how to be a doctor at a time when most boys his age were learning how to drive a car homer had not yet learned how to drive a car wilbur larch had never learned how to drive a car i think said homer wells that you should tell the little ones what you usually tell them you should tell them that fuzzy has been adopted wilbur larch watched homer carefully in a briefhistory of st clouds he would write how i resent fatherhoodf the feelings it gives one they completely ruin ones objectivity they wreck ones sense of fair play i worry that i have caused homer wells to skip his childhood i worry that he has absolutely skipped being a child but many orphans find it easier to skip childhood altogether than to indulge themselves as children when they are orphans if i helped homer wells to skip his childhood did i help him skip a bad thing damn the confusion of feeling like a father loving someone as a parent can produce a cloud that conceals from ones vision what correct behavior is when he wrote that line wilbur larch saw the cloud created in the photographers studio the cloud that so falsely edged the photograph of mrs eamess daughter with the pony he launched off into a paragraph on clouds the terrible weather in inland maine the clouds of st clouds and so forth when homer wells suggested to dr larch that he tell the little ones that fuzzy stone had been adopted larch knew that homer was right there were no clouds around that decision the next night wilbur larch followed the advice of his young apprentice perhaps because he was lying he forgot the proper routine instead of beginning with the announcement about fuzzy stone he gave the usual benediction he got the whole business out of order good night you princes of maineyou kings of new england dr larch addressed them in the darkness then he remembered what he was supposed to say oh he said aloud in a startled voice that caused one of the little orphans to leap in his bed in fright whats wrong cried snowy meadows who was always throwing up he did not throw up only when confronted with the image of a woman with what he thought was a ponys intestines in her mouth nothings wrong dr larch said heartily but the whole room of boys was charged with anxiety into this jumpy atmosphere larch tried to say the usual about the unusual let us be happy for fuzzy stone dr larch said homer wells knew what was meant when it was said that you could hear a pin drop fuzzy stone has found a family dr larch said good night fuzzy good night fuzzy someone said but homer wells heard a pause in the air it had all been done out of order and not everyone was completely convinced good night fuzzy homer wells said with authority and a few of the little voices followed him good night fuzzy good night fuzzy stone homer wells also knew what was meant when it was said that silence could be deafening after dr larch had left them little snowy meadows was the first to speak homer snowy said right here said homer wells in the darkness how could anyone adopt fuzzy stone homer snowy meadows asked who could do it said little wilbur walsh someone with a better machine said homer wells someone who had a better breathing machine than the one doctor larch built for fuzzy its a family that knows all about breathing machines its the family business he added breathing machines lucky fuzzy someone said in a wondering voice homer knew he had convinced them when snowy meadows said good night fuzzy homer wells not yet sixteenan apprentice surgeon a veteran insomniacwalked down to the river that had carried away so many pieces of the history of st clouds the loudness of the river was a comfort to homer more comforting than the silence in the sleeping room that night he stood on the riverbank where the porch to the sawyers lodge had been where hed seen the hawk come from the sky more quickly than the snake could swim to shoreand the snake had been very fast if wilbur larch had seen homer there he would have worried that the boy was saying goodbye to his own childhoodtoo soon but dr larch had ether to help him sleep and homer wells had no cure for his insomnia good night fuzzy homer said over the river the maine woods typically let the remark pass but homer insisted that he be heard good night fuzzy he cried as loud as he could and then louder good night fuzzy he yelled it and yelled itthe grownup boy whose crying had once been a legend upriver in three mile falls good night fuzzy stone young dr wells in other parts of the world wrote wilbur larch there is what the world calls society here in st clouds we have no societythere are not the choices the betterthan or worsethan comparisons that are nearly constant in any society it is less complicated here because the choices and comparisons are either obvious or nonexistent but having so few options is what makes an orphan so desperate to encounter societyany society the more complex with intrigue the more gossipridden the better given the chance an orphan throws himself into societythe way an otter takes to the water what wilbur larch was thinking of regarding options was that homer wells had no choice concerning either his apprenticeship or melony he and melony were doomed to become a kind of couple because there was no one else for them to couple with in society it would have mattered if they were suited for each other that they were not suited for each other didnt matter in st clouds and since homer had exhausted the resources of the dismal tutors employed at st clouds what else was there for him to learn if he didnt learn surgery specifically obstetrical procedure and what was far simpler for dr larch to teach him dilatation and curettage homer wells kept his notes in one of dr larchs old medical school notebooks larch had been a cramped sparse notetakerthere was plenty of room in larchs opinion there was no need for homer to have a notebook of his own wilbur larch had only to look around him to see what paper cost the trees were gone they had been replaced by orphansall for paper under the heading d c homer wrote the woman is most secure in stirrups in dr larchs procedure she was also shaved the vaginal area is prepared with an antiseptic solution wrote homer wells he did a lot of capitalizingit was related to his habit of repeating the ends of sentences or key words the uterus is examined to estimate its size one hand is placed on the abdominal wall two or three fingers of the other hand are in the vagina a vaginal speculum which looks like a ducks bill is inserted in the vaginathrough which the cervix is visible the cervix he wrote parenthetically as if to remind himself is the necklike part of the lower constricted end of the uterus the hole in the middle of the cervix is the entrance of the uterus it is like a cherry life saver in pregnancy the cervix is swollen and shiny with a series of metal dilators the cervix is dilated to admit entrance of the ovum forceps these are tongs with which the doctor grabs at whats inside the uterus he pulls what he can out what this was what homer meant was blood and slime the products of conception he called it with a curette noted homer the wall of the uterus is scraped clean one knows when its clean when one hears a gritty sound and thats all that was entered in the notebook concerning dilatation and the process of curetting as a footnote to this procedure homer added only this the womb one reads about in literature is that portion of the genital tract in which the fertilized ovum implants itself a page number was jotted in the margin of this notebook entrythe page in grays anatomy that begins the section the female organs of generation where the most useful illustrations and descriptions can be found by homer wells not yet twenty had been a midwife to countless births and the surgical apprentice to about a quarter as many abortions he had delivered many children himself with dr larch always present but larch had not allowed homer to perform an abortion it was understood by both larch and homer that homer was completely able to perform one but larch believed that homer should complete medical schoola real medical schooland serve an internship in ainother hospital before he undertook the operation it was not that the operation was complicated it was larchs opinion that homers choice should be involved what larch meant was that homer should know something of society before he made the decision by himself whether to perform abortions or not what dr larch was looking for was someone to sponsor homer wells larch wanted someone to send the boy to college not only in order for homer to qualify for admission to medical school but also in order to expose homer to the world outside st clouds how to advertise for such a sponsor was a puzzle to wilbur larch should he ask his colleague and correspondent at the new england home for little wanderers if he could make use of their large mailing list accomplished midwife qualified abortionist seeks sponsor for college yearsplus medical school expenses where was the society where homer wells could fit in wondered wilbur larch mainly larch knew he had to get his apprentice away from melony the two of them together how they depressed larch they struck the doctor as a tired and loveless married couple what sexual tensions melony had managed to conduct between them in the earlier years of their angry courtship seemed absent now if they still practised a sexual exchange they practised infrequently and without enthusiasm over lunch they sat together without speaking in plain view of the girls or of the boys divisions together they examined the wellworn copy of grays anatomy as if it were the intricate map they had to follow if they were ever to find their way out of st clouds melony didnt even run away anymore it appeared to dr larch that some wordless joyless pact bound homer and melony together their sullenness toward each other reminded dr larch of mrs eamess daughter who would spend eternity with a ponys penis in her mouth melony and homer never fought they never argued melony seemed to have given up raising her voice if there was still anything sexual between them larch knew that it happened randomly and only out of the keenest boredom larch even got melony a job as livein help for a welltodo old woman in three mile falls it may have been that the woman was a cranky invalid who would have complained about anyone she certainly complained about melonyshe said melony was insensitive that she was never forthcoming with conversation and that in regard to such physical attentions as helping her in and out of her bath the girl was unbelievably rough dr larch could believe it and melony herself complained she said she preferred to live at st clouds if she had to have a job she wanted one she could go to and then leave i want to come home at night she told mrs grogan and dr larch home larch thought there was another job in town but it required that melony know how to drive although dr larch even found a local boy to teach melony her driving thoroughly frightened the young man and she needed to take the drivers examination for her license three times in order to pass it once she then lost the jobdelivering parts and tools for a building contractor she was unable to account for more than two hundred miles that had accumulated in one week on the delivery vans odometer i just drove to places because i was bored she told dr larch shrugging and there was a guy i was seeing for a couple of days larch fretted that melony who was almost twenty was now unemployable and unadoptable she had grown dependent on her proximity to homer wells although whole days passed when there didnt appear to be a word between themin fact no intercourse beyond mere presence was observable for weeks in succession if melonys presence could ever be called mere because of how much melony depressed dr larch dr larch assumed that her presence was depressing to homer wells wilbur larch loved homer wellshe had never loved anyone as he loved that boy and he could not imagine enduring a life at st clouds without him but the doctor knew that homer wells had to have an authentic encounter with society if the boy was going to have a chosen life at all what larch dreamed of was that homer would venture out in the world and then choose to come back to st clouds but who would choose such a thing larch wondered maine had many towns there wasnt one as charmless as st clouds larch lay down in the dispensary and sniffed a little ether fie recalled portlands safe harbor his mind ticked off the towns either east or inland from portland and his lips tried the towns with the good maine names inhale exhale wilbur larch could almost taste those towns their vapory names there was kennebunk and kennebunkport there was vassalborough and nobleboro and waldoboro there was wiscasset and west bath damariscotta and friendship penobscot bay and sagadahoc bay yarmouth and camden rockport and arundel rumford and biddeford and livermore falls east of cape kenneth the tourist trap lies hearts haven inland from the small pretty harbor town thats called a haven squats the town of hearts rock the rock in hearts rock is named for the uninhabited rock island that appears to float like a dead whale in the otherwise perfect harbor of hearts haven it is an eyesore island unloved by the people of hearts haven perhaps they were moved to name the eyesore town of hearts rock after their birdbeshitted and fishbellywhite rock nearly covered at high tide and lying fairly flat in the water it lists slightlyhence its name dead whale rock there is no actual rock in hearts rock which is not a town deserving to be looked down upon it is only five miles inland and from some of its hills the ocean is visible in most of the town the sea breeze is refreshingly felt but compared to hearts haven every other town is a mongrel when condemning hearts rock the people of hearts haven do not mention the simple quaintness of the towns only storessanborns general store and titus hardware and plumbing the people of hearts haven are more likely to mention drinkwater lake and the summer cottages on its murky shores a notveryfresh freshwater lake more of a pondbecause by midjuly the bottom is cloudy and rank with algae drinkwater lake is hearts rocks only offering to summer people people who summer on drinkwater lake have not traveled far they may live elsewhere in hearts rockor even more rustically in kenneth corners the summer camps and cottages that dot the lakeshore are also used during the huntingseason weekends in the fall the cottages and camps have names of a striving wishfulness echos end and bucks last stand this one is decked with antlers there is one called endless weekend with a floating dock one called wee three suggesting inhabitants of an almost unbearable cuteness and a frank sort of place called shermans hole in the ground which is an accurate description in drinkwater lake was already cluttered and by it would become intolerably busy with powerboats and water skispropellers fouled and oars festooned with the slimegreen algae stirred up from the bottom the lake is too woodsy to let the wind through sailboats always die on the deadcalm surface which is perfect for hatching mosquitoes and over the years the accumulated childrens urine and gasoline would give the lake an unwell glossy sheen there are wonderfully remote lakes in maine but drinkwater lake was never one of them the occasional bewildered canoeist looking for the wilderness would not find it there the wildhearted departed winkles would not have favored the place you would not willingly drink the water of drinkwater lake and there are many tiresome jokes on that subject all conceived in hearts haven where the habit of judging hearts rock by its single sorry body of water is longstanding when homer wells would first see drinkwater lake he would imagine that if there were ever a summer camp for the luckless orphans of st clouds it would be situated in the bog that separates echos end from shermans hole in the ground not all of hearts rock was so ugly it was a town of stayput people on fairly open neatly farmed land it was dairycow country and fruittree country in the ocean view orchard on drinkwater road which connected hearts rock to hearts haven was pretty and plentifuleven by the standards of the spoiled and hardtoplease of hearts haven although the ocean view orchards were in hearts rock there was a hearts haven look to the place the farmhouse had flagstone patios the grounds were landscaped with rose bushes like the hearts haven homes on the more elegant coastand the lawns spreading from the main house to the swimming pool all the way to the nearest apple orchard were kept up and fussed over by the same yard gangs who made the hearts haven lawns look so much like putting greens the owner of ocean view orchards wallace worthington even had a hearts haven kind of name meaning it was not a localsounding name indeed not because wallace worthington was from new york hed fled investments for apple farming just before everyones investments crashed and if he didnt know all there was to know about applesbeing a gentleman farmer in soul and in bones and in clotheshe knew almost everything about money and had hired the right foremen to run ocean view men who did know apples worthington was a perpetual board member at the haven club he was the only member whose position on the board was never votedand the only hearts rock resident who was a haven club member since his orchard employed half the locals of hearts rock wallace worthington had the rare distinction of being appreciated in both towns wallace worthington would have reminded wilbur larch of someone he might have met at the channingpeabodys where dr larch went to perform his second abortionthe rich peoples abortion as larch thought of it wallace worthington would strike homer wells as what a real king of new england should look like youd have to live in hearts rock or in hearts havenand be familiar with the social histories of the townsto know that wallace worthingtons wife was not every inch a queen she certainly looked like a queen and conducted herself every inch as such but the townspeople knew that olive worthingtonalthough a hearts haven nativehad come from the wrong part of town society is so complex that even hearts haven had a wrong part to it olive worthington was born alice bean to the knowledgeable she was bruce beans the clamdiggers daughter she was bucky beans the welldiggers clever sisterwhich falsely implied that bucky wasnt clever he was at least cleverer than his father bruce welldigging the business of nurse angelas father the business that yielded homer wells a name was goodpaying work welldigging beats clamdigging by dollars and by miles as they say in maine olive worthington grew up selling clams out of the back of a pickup truck that leaked ice her mother maud never talked she kept a cracked makeup mirror on a chopping block at the crowded corner of a kitchen counterher cosmetics which fascinated hermingled with stray clams a large clam shell was her onlyashtray sometimes the black and gritty skin discarded from the neck of a cleaned clam clung to a bottle of her blushup she died of lung cancer when olive was still in high school alice bean became a worthington by marrying wallace worthington she became an olive by altering her own name at the town clerks office in hearts haven it was a willful legal changeofname form that she filled outeasy to do in part because it required the changing of only two letters to make an alice into an olive there was no end to the way the locals liked to play with the name olive as if they were moving around in their mouths the disagreeable pits of that odd food and behind her back there were many who still called her alice bean though only her brother bucky would call olive alice to her face everyone else respected her enough to say olive if thats what she wanted to hear and it was agreed that although she married a worthington and therefore had married into apples and money she had got no bargain in wallace cheerful funloving a goodtimer wallace worthington was generous and kind he adored olive and everything about herher gray eyes and her ashblonde hair turning softly to pearl and her collegelearned new british accent which was often imitated at the haven club her brother buckys success as a welldigger had paid for olives college accent without which she might not have enticed wallace worthington to notice her it may have been gratitude that caused olive to tolerate bucky calling her alice to her face she even tolerated his predictable appearances at ocean view orchardshis boots always muddy with that claycolored muck from the middle of the earth the stuff only welldiggers find olive tried not to cringe while he tromped about the house in those boots calling her alice baby and on hot summer days he would dive into the swimming pool in all his clothes leaving only those middleearth boots out of the bright water which he left sloshing in atlantic turmoil and claycolored at the edges bucky bean could leave a ring on a swimming pool the way a dirty child could ring a bathtub for all that olive worthington had been spared by escaping the alice bean in herself there was something wrong with wallace worthington despite his being a real gentleman and excellent at teasing the republicans at the haven club and fair to his orchardmen he provided them with health insurance policies at his expense at a time when most farm workers were living below the standard of minimum everythingdespite wallace worthingtons lovable flamboyance all the farm and personal vehicles at ocean view orchards bore his monogram on a big red apple despite everything that was grand about wallace he appeared to be drunk all the time and he exhibited such a childish quality of hyperactivity and restlessness that everyone in hearts haven and in hearts rock agreed that he must certainly be no prize to live with he was drunk at the haven club when he lowered the net at center court which he could not seem to adjust properly by cutting through it with the saw blade of his jackknife he was drunk again at the haven club when dr darryrimple had his stroke wallace tossed the old gentleman into the shallow end of the poolto revive him he said later the old fellow nearly drowned in addition to suffering his stroke and the offended darryrimples were so outraged that they canceled membership and wallace was drunk in his own orchards when he drove his cadillac headlong into the fivehundredgallon hardie sprayer dousing himself and his oysterwhite convertible with chemicals that gave him a rash in his lap and permanently bleached the cadillacs scarlet upholstery he was drunk again when he insisted on driving the tractor that towed the flatbed with half of ira titcombs beehives on it promptly dumping the loadthe honey the hives and millions of angry bees at the intersection of drinkwater road and day lane getting himself badly stung also stung were everett taft and his wife dot and dots kid sister debra pettigrew who were working in the day lane orchard at the time of the accident yet no one doubted that wallace worthington was faithful to olivethe cynics saying that he was too drunk to get it up with anyone else and possibly too drunk to get it up with olive it was clear he had gotten it up with her at least once he had produced a son just turning twenty in as big arid handsome and charming as his father with his mothers smoky eyes and with not quite her former blondeness his was tawny not ash he even had a bit of her new british accent wallace worthington junior was too goodlooking ever to be called junior he was called wally from the day of wallys birth wallace worthington was called senior even by olive and eventually by wally and this is only a beginning to an understanding of the societies of hearts haven and hearts rock if he had known only this much dr larch might have tried to keep homer wells away from the place he might have guessed that homers life would get complicated there what did an orphan know about gossip or care about class but to wilbur larch hearts haven and hearts rock were very pretty names improved by ether if dr larch had spent some time around senior worthington larch might have figured out that the man was unfairly judged of course he drank too muchmany people who drink at all drink too much but senior was not a drunk he bore the classic clinical features of alzheimers disease and wilbur larch would have spotted it for what it wasa progressive organic brain syndrome alzheimers presenile dementia is marked by deterioration of intellect failure of memory and a striking appearance of rapid aging in a patient in middle life symptoms that become progressively more severe over a period of just a few years and terminate in death restlessness hyperactivity defective judgement are other hallmarks of the disease but as keen as the wit in hearts haven was the townspeople didnt know the difference between drunkenness and alzheimers disease they were deadsure they had the worthingtons figured out they misjudged olive worthington too she had earned her name she might have been desperate to leave the clam level of life but she knew what work was she had seen how quickly the ice in the pickup melted how short a time the clams could be kept cool she knew hustle she knew knowhow she saw instantly that wallace worthington was good about money and weak on apples and so she took up apples as her cause she found out who the knowledgeable foremen were and she gave them raises she fired the others and hired a younger more reliable crew she baked apple pies for the families of the orchardmen who pleased her and she taught their wives the recipe too she installed a pizza oven in the apple mart and soon could turn out fortyeight pies in one baking adding greatly to the business over the counter at harvest timeformerly reserved for apple cider and apple jelly she overpaid for the damages to ira titcombs beehives and soon was selling apple blossom honey over the counter too she went to the university and learned everything about crosspollination and how to plant a newtree orchard she learned more about mousing and suckering and thinning and the new chemicals than the foremen knew and then she taught them olive had a vision of her silent mother maud mesmerized by her own fading image in the makeup mirror clams everywhere around her the little cotton balls dabbed with cosmetics the color of the clay on her brother buckys terrible boots were flecked with the ashes from the cigarettes overstuffing the clamshell ashtray these images strengthened olive she knew the life she had escaped and at ocean view orchards she more than earned her keep she took the farm out of seniors careless hands and she ran it very intelligently for him at night coming back from the haven club she always drove olive would leave senior passed out in the passenger seat and put a note on her son wallys pillow asking him when he got home to remember to carry his father up to bed wally always did so he was a golden boy riot just a picture of one the one night that young wally had drunk too much to carry his father to bed olive worthington was quick to point out to her son the error of his ways you may resemble your father with my pelmission in every aspect but in his drunkenness she told wally if you resemble him in that aspect you will lose this farmand every penny made by every apple do you think your father could prevent me from doing that to you wally looked at his father whom he had allowed to sleep all night in the passenger seat of the cadillac now mottled by spraying chemicals it was obvious to the boy that senior worthington could prevent nothing no mom wally said to his mother respectfully not just because he was educated and polite he could have taught tennis and manners at the haven club and taught them well but also because he knew his mother olive worthington hadnt married into anything more than a little working cash the work had been supplied by her wilbur larch would have respected that the sadness was that olive too misjudged poor senior who was only a tangential victim of alcoholism and a nearly complete victim of alzheimers disease there are things that the societies of towns know about you and things that they miss senior worthington was baffled by his own deterioration which he also believed to be the result of the evils of drink when he drank lessand still couldnt remember in the morning what hed said or done the evening before still saw no relenting of his remarkable speededup process of aging still hopped from one activity to the next leaving a jacket in one place a hat in another his car keys in the lost jacketwhen he drank less and still behaved like a fool this bewildered him to such an extreme that he began to drink more in the end he would be a victim of both alzheimers disease and alcoholism a happy drunk with unexplained plunges of mood in a better and betterinformed world he would have been cared for like the nearly faultless patient that he was in this one respect hearts haven and hearts rock resembled st clouds there was no saving senior worthington from what was wrong with him as surely as there had been no saving fuzzy stone in homer wells began grays anatomyat the beginning he began with osteology the skeleton he began with bones in he was making his third journey through grays anatomy some of which he shared with melony melony showed a wayward concentration though she confessed interest in the complexity of the nervous system specifically the description of the twelfth or hypoglossal nerve which is the motor nerve of the tongue whats a motor nerve melony asked sticking out her tongue homer tried to explain but he felt tired he was making his sixth journey through david copperfield his seventh through great expectations his fourth through jane eyre only last night he had come to a part that always made melony cringewhich made homer anxious its near the beginning of chapter twelve when jane shrewdly observes it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity they must have action and they will make it if they cannot find it just remember sunshine melony interrupted him as long as i stay you stay a promise is a promise but homer wells was tired of melony making him anxious he repeated the line this time reading it as if he were personally delivering a threat it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity they must have action and they will make it if they cannot find it mrs grogan looked taken aback at the ominousness in his voice he copied the line in a handwriting nearly as orderly and cramped as dr larchs homer typed it on nurse angelas typewriter making only a few mistakes and when wilbur larch was just resting in the dispensary homer crept up on the tired saint and placed the piece of paper with the quotation from jane eyre on dr larchs rising and falling chest dr larch felt less threatened by the actual text of the quotation than he felt a general unease that homer knew dr larchs ether habit so exactly that the boy could approach his bed undetected or am i using a little more of this stuff than i used to larch wondered was it meant as a message that homer had used the ether cone to hold the jane eyre quotation to larchs chest history wrote dr larch is composed of the smallest often undetected mistakes he may have been referring to something as small as the apostrophe that someone added to the original st clouds his point is also illuminated by the case of the heart in both hearts haven and in hearts rock a case similar in error to how melody became forever a melony the explorer credited with the discovery of the fine pretty harbor at hearts havena seafaring man named reginald hartwas also the first settler of hearts rock to clear land and try to be a farmer the general illiteracy of the times and of the times following reginald harts death prevailed no one knew of any written difference between one heart and another the first settlers of hearts haven and hearts rock probably never knowing that reginald hart had been given the name of a deer quite comfortably named their towns after an organ a hollow muscular organ of conical form as homer wells could recite by rote from grays anatomy enclosed in the cavity of the pericardium by homer had looked at each of the hearts in the three cadavers dr larch had acquired for him each cadaver outliving its usefulness for exploratory purposes in about two years time the cadavers were female it hardly served dr larchs purposein the process of educating homer wells in obstetrical procedure and procedures of a related kindto have his student examining male cadavers there was always a problem getting a body once one was delivered in water that was supposed to be ice another had to be disposed of because the embalming fluid had clearly been old or too weak homer remembered the three cadavers distinctly it was not until the third body that he developed enough of a sense of humor to give the body a name they called her clara after david copperfields wimpish motherthat poor weak woman whod allowed herself and young david to be so bullied by the terrible mr murdstone you should call her jane melony advised homer melony was alternately sick of jane eyre and completely identified with her i could have called her melony homer responded but humor was not reliably to be found in melony who preferred to play her own jokes body number two provided homer with the essential practice that prepared him for his first caesarean section for that one he had felt dr larchs eyes so riveted to his hands that his hands seemed not his ownthey moved with such smooth purpose that homer was sure that dr larch had discovered a way to make that perfect nobiggerthannecessary incision in the uterus with his mind no need for using hands at all the harangue that developed at the railroad station over the arrival of the body homer would call clara gave homer his first experience with eclamptic convulsions or puerperal convulsions as they were called in wilbur larchs days at the boston lyingin at the exact moment that dr larch was at the railroad station arguing with the stationm aster about the release form for the unfortunate clara homer wells was at st clouds trying to locate exactly the inferior thyroid vein on body number two although he didnt know it lie had a good excuse for having momentarily lost his way body number two was wholly shopworn and many things were hard to locate within it he would have consulted his grays in another minute or two but just then nurse edna burst upon himshrieking as she always did when she saw homer with body number two it was as if shed caught him up to something with melony oh homer she cried but she couldnt speak she flapped her arms in an agitated chickenlike fashion before she managed to point homer in the direction of the dispensary he ran there as quickly as he could finding a woman lying on the dispensary floorher eyes staring so wildly and so steadily unseeing that at first he mistook her for the body he knew dr larch was trying to liberate from the stationmaster then the woman began to move and homer wells knew she was quite close to becoming a cadaver the convulsions began with a twitching in her face but they spread rapidly through all the muscles of the frame her face which had been flushed turned a shiny blueblack her heels struck the floor with such force that both her shoes flew offhomer saw instantly that her ankles wererkugely swollen her jaws were set her mouth and chin were wet with a frothy spittle laced with blood because shed bitten her tonguewhich was at least preferable to her swallowing it her respiration was hardworking she expelled air with a hiss and the spray splashed homers face with a violence hed not felt since he stood back from the bank and watched therwinkles being swept away eclampsia homer wells said to nurse edna it derives from the greek dr larch had told him that the word refers to the flashes of light a patient sees at the onset of the puerperal convulsions with any sensible prenatal care homer knew eclampsia was usually avoidable there was an easily detected rise in blood pressure the presence of albumin in the urine swelling of the feet and hands headaches vomiting and of course those spots and flashes in the eyes bed rest diet reduction of fluid intake and free catharsis usually worked but if they didnt the bringing on of premature labor almost always prevented the convulsions and often produced a living baby but the patients dr larch saw were not women who sought or even understood prenatal care this patient was very lastminuteeven by the standards of dr larchs practice doctor larch is at the railroad station homer told nurse edna calmly someone has to get him you and nurse angela should stay to help me in lifting the woman and carrying her to the delivery room homer felt the womans moist cold skin and was reminded of body number one and body number two the latter he recalled had been left on the examining table in the room now used for his anatomical studies near the boys division kitchen in the last century homer wells knew a doctor would have given this patient an ether anesthesia and would have dilated the mouth of the wornb to effect a forcible deliverya method that usually caused the patients death at the boston lyingin wilbur larch had learned to fortify the heart muscle with doses of digitalis which helped prevent the development of fluid in the lungs homer listened to the womans watery breathing and realized he might be too late even if he correctly remembered the procedure he knew that one had to be conservative with eclampsia if he was forced to deliver the woman prematurely he must allow the labor to develop as naturally as possible the woman just then moaned her head and heels whacked the operating table in unison her pregnant belly seemed to levitateand one of her arms without will without purposeful direction flew up and hit homer in the face he knew that sometimes a woman had only one puerperal convulsion it was recorded that a few patients had survived as many as a hundred what homer didnt know of course was whether he was observing this womans second convulsion or her ninetieth when nurse edna returned to the delivery room with nurse angela homer instructed the nurses to administer morphine to the patient homer himself injected some magnesium sulphate into a vein to lower blood pressure at least temporarily in the interval between her last and what homer knew would be her next convulsion he asked nurse edna to take a urine sample from the woman and he asked nurse angtla to examine the specimen for traces of albumin he asked the woman to tell him how many convulsions she had already suffered but although the woman was coherent and could even answer questions intelligently she couldnt pinpioint the number of convulsions typically she remembered nothing of the convulsions themselvesonly their onset and their draining aftereffects she estimated she was at least a month away from expecting her baby at the onset of her next convulsion homer gave the woman a light ether sedation hoping he might reduce the violence of the fit this fit was different in character from the last though homer doubted it was any less violent the womans motion was slower butif anything more powerful homer lay across her chest but her body abruptly jackknifedlifting him off the operating table in the next interval while the woman was still relaxed under the ether sedation homers investigations showed him that the neck of the patients womb was not shortened its mouth was not dilated labor hadnt begun he contemplated beginning it prayed that he wouldnt have to make this decision wondered why it was taking so long to find dr larch an orphan with a bad cold had been assigned to locate larch at the railroad station he returned with a thick rivulet of snot in each nostril and strung across one cheek like a welt from a whiplash his name nurse angelas of course was curly day and he wetly announced that dr larch had boarded the train to three mile fallsin order to chase down and capture the body that the stationmaster in a pique of perversity prompted by religious outrage had forwarded to the next stop the stationmaster had simply refused to accept the cadaver larch in a rage now surpassing the stationmasters had taken the next train after it ohoh nurse edna said homer gave his patient her first dose of digitalis he would repeat this periodically until he could see its effects on the womans heartbeat while he waited with the woman for her next seizure he asked her if she had decided to put her baby up for adoption or if she had come to st clouds only because it was the nearest hospital in short was this a baby she very much wanted or one she didnt want you mean its going to die the woman asked he gave her dr larchs best of course not kind of smile but what he thought was that it was likely the baby would die if he didnt deliver it soon and likely the woman would die if he rushed the delivery the woman said she had hitchhiked to st clouds because there was no one in her life to bring her and that she didnt want to keep the babybut that she wanted it very much to live right homer said as if this decision would have been his own you seem kinda young the woman said im not going to die am i she asked thats right youre not said homer wells using dr larchs smile again it at least made him look older but in twelve hours when dr larch had not returned and when the woman was arching her body on the operating table suffering what was her seventh seizure homer wells could not remember the exact expression that produced the reassuring smile he looked at nurse angela who was trying to help him hold the woman and he said im going to start her labor im going to rupture the bag of waters im sure you know whats best homer nurse angela said but her own imitation of dr larchs confidenceinspiring smile was very poor in twelve more hours the patients uterine contractions commenced homer wells would never remember the exact number of convulsions the woman experienced in that time he was beginning to worry more about dr larch than about the woman and he had to fight down his fear of something happening to dr larch in order to concentrate on his job another ten hours after the onset of the womans contractions she delivered herself of a boyfour pounds eleven ounces in good condition the mothers improvement was rapidas homer had expected there were no more convulsions her blood pressure returned to normal the traces of albumin in her urine were minimal in the evening of the day after the morning when he had gone to the station to retrieve the body that the stationmaster would neither keep nor relinquish wilbur larchtogether with the rescued cadaver soon to be called clarareturned tired and triumphant to st clouds he had followed the body to three mile falls but the stationmaster there had registered such horror that the body was never unloaded from the train it had traveled on and larch had traveled after it arriving at the next and at the next station always a train behind no one wanted clara except to put her in the ground and it was thought that this should not be the responsibility of a stationmasterwho would surely not accept at his station a body that no one came forward for clara was a body clearly not intended for the ground the unearthly sloshing sound of the embalming fluid the leathery skin the outerspace colors of the occasionally exposed arteries and veinswhatever that is i dont want it here said the stationmaster in three mile falls and so clara went from three mile falls to misery gore to moxie gore to east moxieon and on larch got in a terrible row with the stationmaster in harmony maine where clara had stopped for a few minutes giving the railroad personnel the fright of their lives before shed been sent on that was my body larch screamed it had my name on it it is intended for the instruction of a student of medicine who is training with me in my hospital in saint clouds its mine larch yelled why are you sending it in the wrong direction why are you sending it away from me it came here didnt it the stationmaster said it didnt get taken at saint clouds it appears to me the stationmaster in saint clouds is crazy larch hollered he gave a little hopa little jump which made him appear a little crazy too maybe he is maybe he isnt said the stationmaster in harmony all i know is the body come here and i sent it on for christs sake its not haunted larch said with a wail didnt say it was said the stationmaster maybe it is maybe it isntwasnt here long enough to tell idiots larch shouted and took the train in cornville where the train didnt stop wilbur larch screamed out the window at a couple of potato farmers who were waving at the train maine is full of morons he yelled riding on in skowhegan he asked the stationmaster just where in hell he thought the damn body was going bath i suppose the skowhegan stationmaster said thats where it came from and if nobody wants it at the other end thats where its going back to somebody does want it at the other end screamed wilbur larch i want it the body had been sent to the hospital in st clouds from the hospital in bath a woman who was a willing bodydonor had died and the pathologist at bath memorial hospital knew that wilbur larch was looking for a fresh female dr larch caught up with clara in augusta augusta was very sophisticated for maine and the stationmaster simply saw that the body was going the wrong way of course its going the wrong way wilbur larch cried damndest thing the stationmaster said dont they speak english up in your parts they dont hear english larch yelled td like to send a cadaver to every damn one of those townsone a day that sure would rile up a bunch of folks the stationmaster said dryly wondering how riled up dr larch was going to get on the long ride back to st clouds with claira dr larch didnt calm down in each of the towns that offended himin harmony especially but in east moxie and in moxie gore and in all the rest of them toohe offered his opinions to the respective stationmasters while the train paused at the stations moronville he told the stationmaster in harmony tell me one thing thats harmonious hereone thing it was pretty harmonious before you and your damn body got here the stationmaster said moronville larch shouted out the window as the train pulled away idiotsburg to his great disappointment when the train arrived in st clouds the stationmaster was not there lunch someone told dr larch but it was early evening perhaps you mean supper dr larch asked perhaps the stationmaster doesnt know the difference he said nastily he hired the help of two louts to lug clara up the hill to the boys division he was surprised by the disarray in which homer wells had left body number two in the excitement of the emergency homer had forgotten to put body number two away and larch ordered the two oafs to carry clara in therenot preparing the simpletons for the shopworn cadaver exposed on the table one of the clods ran into a wall terrible crying out and jumping around larch went shouting through the orphanage looking for homer here i am running after a new body for youacross half the damn state of maineand you leave a mess like that just lying out in the open where any fool can fall upon it homer dr larch yelled goddamn it he muttered to himself there is no way a teenager is going to be an adult ahead of his own good timeno way you can expect a teenager to accept adult responsibilities to do an adults goddamn job he went muttering all over the boys division looking for homer wells but homer had collapsed on larchs whiteiron bed in the dispensary and had fallen into the deepest sleep the aura of ether surrounding that spare bed under that eastern window might have enhanced homers drowsiness but he scarcely needed ether to sleep he had been up for nearly forty hours with the eclampsia patientdelivering her and her child nurse angela interrupted dr larch before he could find homer wells and wake him up whats happening around here larch demanded to know is no one the least bit interested in where in hell ive been and why has that boy left his body looking like a war casualty i go away overnight and just look at this place but nurse angela straightened him out she told him it had been the worst case of puerpural convulsions shed ever seen and she had seen somein her time wilbur larch had seen some too in his days at the boston lyingin hed lost a lot of women to eclampsia and even in about a quarter of the deaths in childbirth were credited to these convulsions homer did this larch asked nurse angela aid nurse edna he was reading the report he had examined the mother who was fine and the premature baby boy who was normal and healthy he was almost as calm as you wilbur nurse edna said admiringly you can be real proud of him he is an angel in my opinion nurse angela said he looked a little grirn when he had to break the water nurse edna remembered but he did everything just right he was as sure as snow nurse angela said he did almost everything right wilbur lsrch was thinking it really was amazing larch thought it was a slight error that homer had failed to record the exact number of convulsions in the second twelvehour period especially after correctly counting them in the first twelve hours and homer had not mentioned the number or the severity of the convulsions or if there were any in the tenhour period after the patients labor contractions began and before she delivered minor criticism wilbur larch was a good teacher he knew that this criticism was better withheld homer wells had performed all the hard parts correctly his procedure had been perfect hes not even twentyis he larch asked but nurse edna had gone to bed she was exhausted in her dream she would mingle homers heroism with her already con siderable love for larch she would sleep very well nurse angela was still up in her office and when dr larch asked her why the premature baby had not been named she told larch that it was nurse ednas turn and nurse edna had been too tired well its just a matter of form said wilbur larch you name it theni want it named it wont kill you to go out of turn will it but nurse angela had a better idea it was homers babyhe had saved it and the mother homer wells should name this one nurse angela said yes youre right he should dr larch replied filling with pride in his wonderful creation homer wells would wake to a day of naming in the same day he would be faced with naming body number three and his first orphan he would name the new body clara and what else could he have named a baby boy except david copperfield he was reading great expectations at the time and he preferred great expectations to david copperfield as a book but he would not name anyone pip and he didnt care for the character of pip as much as he cared for little david it was an easy decision and he woke that morning very refreshed and capable of more demanding decisions than that one he had slept almost through the night he woke only once on the dispensary bed aware that dr larch was back larch was in the room probably looking at him but homer kept his eyes closed he somehow knew larch was there because of the sweet scent of ether which larch wore like cologne and because of the steadiness of larchs breathing then he felt larchs handa doctors hand feeling for feverpass very lightly over his forehead homer wells not yet twentyquite accomplished in obstetrical procedure and as knowledgeable as almost any doctor on the care of the female organs of generationlay very still pretending to sleep dr larch bent over him and kissed him very lightly on his lips homer heard larch whisper good work homer he felt a second even lighter kiss good work my boy the doctor said and then left him homer wells felt his tears come silently there were more tears than he remembered crying the last time he had criedwhen fuzzy stone had died and homer had lied about fuzzy to snowy meadows and the others he cried and cried but he never made a sound he would have to change dr larchs pillowcase in the morning he cried so much he cried because he had received his first fatherly kisses of course melony had kissed him she didnt do it much anymore but she had and nurse edna and nurse angela had kissed him silly but they kissed everyone dr larch had never kissed him before and now he had kissed him twice homer wells cried because hed never known how nice a fathers kisses could be and he cried because he doubted that wilbur larch would ever do it againor would have done it if hed thought homer was awake dr larch went to marvel at the good health of the eclampsia patient and at her thriving tiny childwho in the morning would become the orphan david copperfield david copperfield junior dr larch would enjoy saying then larch went to the familiar typewriter in nurse angelas office but he couldnt write anything he couldnt even think he was so agitated from kissing homer wells if homer wells had received his first fatherly kisses dr larch had given the first kisses he had ever givenfatherly or otherwisesince the day in the portland boardinghouse when he caught the clap from mrs eames and the kisses he gave o mrs eaines were more in the nature of explorations than they were gifts of love oh god thought wilbur larch what will happen to me when homer has to go where he would go was hardly a place of comparable excitement of comparable challenge of comparable sadness of comparable gloom but where he would go was nice and what would homer wells with his background make of nice wouldnt it simply seduce him wouldnt anyone rather have nice what did hearts haven or hearts rock know of trouble and what did anyone do there to be of use yes olive worthington suffered her brother buckys intrusionshis welldigging slime in her swimming pool and his trekking across her rugs big deal yes olive worried if young wally would have gumption if he would really learn and contribute to the applegrowing businessor would the pretty boy become like senior a goodtimer turning pathetic but what were these worries compared to the business of st clouds compared to the lords work and the devils work werent these concerns trivial wasnt life in nice places shallow but trouble can come to nice places too trouble travels trouble visits trouble even takes holidays from the places where it thrives from places like st clouds the trouble that visited hearts haven and hearts rock was a fairly trivial and common form of trouble it began as trouble often does with falling in love here in st clouds wrote wilbur larch i dont imagine that anyone falls in love it would be too evident a luxury to fall in love here larch didnt know that nurse edna had been in love with him from day one but he was correct in supposing that it hadnt been exactly love that passed between melony and homer wells and what clung to each of them after the first passion had passed was surety not love and that picture of mrs eamess daughter with the ponys penis in her mouth that photograph was the oldest resident of st clouds and surely it had no love in it that picture was as far from love as hearts haven and hearts rock were from st clouds in other parts of the world wrote wilbur larch i imagine that people fall in love all the time if not all the time a lot young wally worthington for example thought hed been in love twice before he was twenty and once when he was twentyone now in he was just three years older than homer wells wally fell fullforce in loveior the fourth time he didnt know that this time would be for keeps the girl young wallys heart would select for life was a lobstermans daughter he was no ordinary lobsterman and it was no surprise to anyone that he had an extraordinary daughter raymond kendall was so good at lobstering that other lobstermen through binoculars watched him pull and bait a pot when he changed his mooring lines they changed theirs when he didnt go to sea but stayed at home or at his dock mending pots they stayed home too and mended theirs but they couldnt match him he had so many pots in the water lhat his personalized black and orange buoys gave the hearts haven harbor the razzledazzle of collegiate competition once a contingent of yale men from the haven club beseeched raymond kendall to change his colors to blue and white but kendall only muttered that he didnt have time for games other contingents from the haven club would beseech him the subject was rarely the color of his lobster buoys the haven club faced the far jetty of hearts haven harbor where raymond kendalls lobster pound and dock were long established kendall lived above the pound which might have enticed a more superficial man to comply with the haven clubs requests that he beautify his immediate environs his establishment was considered by summer peoples standards an eyesore on a harborfront of otherwise natural andor expensively groomed beauty even his bedroom window wes hung with buoys in various stages of repainting the lobster pots undergoing repairs were piled so high on his dock that it was impossible from shore to see if boats were moored on the far side of the dock the parking lot for the lobster pound was nearly fulland not of customers cars there was never enough room for the customers it was full of the various trucks and cars that raymond kendall was working on and full of the vast and oily inboard engines for his lobster boats everything surrounding the harborfront property of raymond kendall was teeming with a messy mechanics condition of total overhaul everything was in progress incomplete dismantled still wet waiting for parts and for noise there were the constant grinding sounds of the generator that ran the water tanks for the lobsters in the pound and the greasy belching of an inboard engine idling at the dock and then there was the smell of tarred rope of that slightlydifferentfromfishy fishiness that a lobster has of the fuel and motor oil that slicked the ocean at his dock which was matted with seaweed studded with periwinkles festooned with yellow oilskin suits hung out to dry raymond kendall lived his work he liked his work in evidence around him the jetty end of hearts haven harbor was his artists studio he was not just an artist with lobster he also was an expert at fixing thingsat keeping everything anyone else would throw away running if asked raymond kendall wouldnt tell you he was a lobsterman it was not that he was ashamed of it but he was prouder of his qualities as a mechanic im just a tinkerer he liked to say and if the haven club complained about the constant evidence of his tinkering which they strongly felt tarnished their splendid view they didnt complain too much raymond kendall fixed what belonged to them too for example he repaired the filter system for their swimming poolin the days when no one had pools when no one else would have touched it and ray kendall himself had never seen a filter system before i suppose it just does what youd think it should he said taking ten minutes with the job it was rumored that the only thing ray kendall threw away was uneaten food which he threw overboard or off the end of his dock j us t feeding the lobsters which feed me he would say to anyone who complained just feeding the sea gulls who are hungrier than you and me it was rumored he had more money than senior worthington there was almost no evidence of his spending anyexcept on his daughter like the children of the haven club members she went to a private boarding school and raymond kendall paid the considerable annual dues for a haven club membershipnot for himself he went to the club only on request to fix things but for his daughter whod learned to swim in the heated pool there and whod taken her tennis lessons on the same courts graced by young wally worthington kendalls daughter had her own car tooit looked out of place in the haven club parking lot it was a lobsterpoundparkinglot sort of car a mishmash of the parts that were still serviceable from other cars one of its fenders was unpainted and was attached with wires it had a ford insignia on its hood and a chrysler emblem on the trunk and the passengerside door was sealed completely shut however its battery never went dead in the haven club lot it was never this relic that wouldnt start when one of the haven club members had a car that vouldnt start he went looking for raymond kendalls daughter who kept jumper cables in her sturdy wreck and had been taught by her father how to use them some of the fabulous money raymond kendall was rumored to have and to hoard was paid him as salary by olive worthington in addition to his lobstering ray kendall kept the vehicles and machinery of the ocean view orchards running olive worthington paid him a full foremans salary because he knew almost as much about apples as he knew about lobsters and he was indispensable as the farms mechanic but ray refused to work more than two hours a day he picked his own two hours toosometimes coming first thing saying it was a bad time to go to sea and sometimes showing up at the end of the workday just in time to hear the orchardmens complaints about what was wrong with the nozzle of the hardie or with the pump of the bean sprayer or what was plugged in the carburetor of the deere tractor or out of tune with the international harvester he saw instantly what was crooked in the mower blades fucked up in the forklift jammed in the conveyor dead in the pickup or out of alignment in the cider mill raymond kendall did in two hours what another mechanic would have spent a day doing a halfassed job of and he almost never came to olive and told her that she had to get a new this or a new that it was always olive who made the first suggestion that something should be replaced isnt the clutch on the deere always in need of adjustment ray she would politely ask him would you recommend its replacement but raymond kendall was a surgeon among tinkerers he had a doctors hearty denial of deathand he found replacing something an admission of weakness of failure he would almost always say well now olive if i fixed it before i can fix it again i can always just goon fixing it olive respected raymond kendalls contempt for people who didnt know their own work and had no capacity for work of any kind anyhow she agreed with him completely and she also appreciated that he never included in his contempt either senior or her father bruce bean besides senior worthington knew enough about managing money with his left hand that hed been very successful without working more than an hour a dayusually on the telephone the crop olive would say of her beloved apples can survive bad weather even at blossom time by which she meant wind a stiff offshore breeze would keep ira titcombs bees in their hives and the wild bees would be blown back into the woods where they pollinated everything but apple trees the crop can even survive a bad harvest olive said she might have meant rain when the fruit is slippery gets dropped gets bruised is then good only for cider or even a hurricane which is a real danger for a coastal orchard the crop couid even survive something happening to me olive claimedat which modesty both senior worthington and young wally would voice protest but what the crop could never survive olive would say is losing ray kendall she meant that without raymond nothing would work or that theyd have to buy new everything which soon wouldnt work any better than the old stuff that only ray could keep running i doubt very much mother said young wally if either hearts haven or hearts rock could survive without raymond kendall ill drink to that senior worthington said and promptly did so causing olive to look tragic and inspiring young wally to change the subject despite the fact that ray kendall worked two hours every day at ocean view he was never seen to eat an apple only rarely did he eat lobster he preferred chicken or pork chops or even hamburger during a haven club regatta several sailors claimed that they could smell ray kendall frying hamburger aboard his lobster boat while he was pulling in his pots but whatever legend of the work ethic ray represented and whatever griping was done on account of the evidence of his work with which raymond kendall preferred to surround himself no fault could be found with his beautiful daughterexcept the fault of her name which was not her fault who would ever have named herself a candice and therefore been a candy to all and which everyone knew had been the name of her dead mother and therefore was not the mothers fault either candice candy kendall was named after her mother who had died in childbirth raymond had named his daughter in memory of his departed wife whom everyone had liked and who in her day had kept the environs of the lobster pound and the dock slightly better picked up who could find fault with any name that was given out of love you had only to know her to know that she was not a candy she was lovely but never falsely sweet she was a great and natural beauty but no crowdpleaser she had daily reliability written all over her she was at once friendly and practicalshe was courteous energetic and substantial in an argument without ever being shrill she complained only about her name and she was always goodhumored about it she would never hurt her fathers feelingsor anyone elses feelings willingly she appeared to combine her fathers enraptured embrace of the work ethic with the education and the refinements he had allowed hershe took to both labor and sophistication with ease if other girls at the haven club or in the rest of hearts haven and hearts rock were jealous of the attention young wally worthington gave to her there was still no one who disliked her if shed been born an orphan even at st clouds half the population there would have fallen in love with her even olive worthington liked her and olive was suspicious of the girls who dated wally she questioned what they wanted from him she could never forget how much she had wanted to get out of her life and into a worthingtons green and applebright existence at ocean view and this memory of her younger self gave olive an eye for girls who might be more interested in the ocean view life than they were interested in wally olive knew this wasnt the case with candy who seemed to think that her own life above ray kendalls crawling livelobster pound was perfect she was as fond of her fathers orneriness as she was deservedly proud of his industry she was well cared for by the latter she wasnt looking for money and she preferred taking wally for an ocean swimoff her fathers treacherous and crowded dockto swimming in the haven club pool or in the worthingtons private swimming pool where she knew she was welcome in truth olive worthington thought that candy kendall might be too good for her son whom she knew to be rather unsettled or at least not industriousshe would grant you he was charming and genuinely goodnatured and then there was the uncertain pain that candy caused in olives memory of her mother maucl frozen among her cosmetics and clams olive envied candy her perfect love of her mother whom shed never seen the girls absolute goodness made olive feel guilty for how much she despised her own origins her mothers silence her fathers failure her brothers vulgarity candy worshiped at the little shrines to her mother that raymond kendall constructedthere were actual altarpieces assembledall over the upstairs rooms of the lobster pound where they lived above the gurgle of the lobster tank and everywhere were gathered the photographs of candys young mother many taken with candys young father who was so unrecognizably youthful whose smile was so unrecognizably constant in the pictures that candy looked at ray at times as if he were as much a stranger to her as her mother candys mother was said to have smoothed out rays rough edges shed had a sunny spirit shed kept on top of everything shed had the boundless energy that raymond kendall possessed for his work and candy had in abundance for everything on the coffee table in the kitchen alongside a disassembled magneto case and ignition system for the evinrude was a triptych of pictures of ray and candice at their wedding which had been the only time ray kendall had attended an event at the haven club when he was not dressed to repa ir something in rays bedroom on the night table next to the broken toggles witch to the johnson the inboard johnson there was an outboard too was a picture of candice and rayboth in their oilskin slickers both pulling pots on a rough sea and it was clear to anyone especially to candy that candice was pregnant and hard at work in her own bedroom candy kept the picture of her mother when her mother had been candys age which was homer wellss age exactly young candice talbot of the hearts haven talbotsthe longstanding haven club talbots he was in a long white dress for tennis of all things and she looked just like candy the picture was taken the summer she met ray an older boy strong and dark and determined to fix everything to make everything work if he had seemed a hick or a little too serious he was at least not grim about his ambitions and alongside him the boys at the haven club had appeared as court dandies as spoiled upperclass fops candy had her mothers blondness it was darker than wallys blondnessand much darker than her mothers and than olive worthingtons former blondness she had her fathers dark skin and dark brown eyes and her fathers height ray kendall was a tall man a disadvantage for a lobsterman and for a mechanic he used to say goodnaturedly because of the strain on the lower back when pulling lobster potsthere is nearly constant lifting in that workand because of a mechanics need to crawl under and bend over things candy was extremely tall for a woman which intimidated olive worthington just a bitbut was felt by olive as only a mild flaw in olives nearperfect satisfaction with candy kendall as the correct match for wally olive worthington was fairly tall herself taller than senior especially when senior was staggering and she looked in a somewhat unfriendly fashion upon everyone who was taller than she her son wally was taller than she too which olive still found difficult at times especially when she desired to reprimand him is candy taller than you wally she asked him once a sudden alarm in her voice no mom were exactly the same height wally told his mother that was another thing that slightly bothered her about the two of them being together they sfiemed so alike physically was their attraction to each other a form of narcissism olive worried and since each of them was an only child were they seeing in each other the brother or sister they always wanted wilbur larch would have got along with olive worthington she was a born worrier together they could have outworried the rest of the world they shared the concept that there was a rest of the world by which they meant the whole rest of the worldworld outside their making they were both smart enough to know why they feared this other world so much they fully understood that despite their considerable efforts they were only marginally in control of the worlds of their own delicate making when candy kendall and wally worthington fell in love with each other in the summer of everyone in hearts haven and in hearts rock always knew they wouldit was a wonder only that it had taken them this long to discover it themselves for years both towns had thought them perfect for each other even crusty raymond kendall approved ray thought wally was unfocused but that was not the same as lazy and anyone could see the boy was goodhearted ray also approved of wallys mother he had a thorough liking for the way olive worthington respected work everyone felt sorry for how out of it poor senior seemed how his drinking they thought had aged him overnight it wont be long alice before the guys pissing his pants in public the charmless bucky bean said to olive and candy thought that olive worthington would be a perfect motherinlaw when candy dreamed of her own mothergrown older than shed been allowed to grow in this life grown naturally older in a better world she always thought her mother would have aged to resemble olive worthington candy hoped at least that her mother would have managed olives refinement if not perhaps her collegelearned new british candy would be going to college in a year she assumed and she had no intentions of learning an accent there but except for the accent candy thought olive worthington was wonderful it was sad about senior but the man was certainly sweet so everyone was happy with this love affair that was as certain to become a marriage made in heaven as any love affair hearts haven and hearts rock had seen it was understood that wally would finish college first and that candy would be allowed to finish collegeif she wanted tobefore they got married but with olive worthingtons instincts for worry one might have assumed that olive would have foreseen the possible causes for a change of plans after all it was there was a war in europe there were many people who thought that more than europe would be involved before long but olive had a mothers wish to keep war out of her mind wilbur larch had the war in europe very much in his mind he had been in the last war and he foresaw that if there was another war it might coincide with homer wellgs being the right age to go since that would be the wrong age to be the good doctor had already taken somepains to see that homer wells wouldnt have to go to a war if there was one larch was after all the historian of st clouds he wrote the only records that were kept there he usually wrote the notsosimple history of the place but he had tried his hand at fiction too in the case of fuzzy stone for exampleand in the other very few cases of orphans who had died in his carewilbur larch hadnt liked the actual endings hadnt wanted to record the actual outcomes to those small foreshortened lives wasnt it fair if larch took libertiesif he occasionally indulged himself with happy endings in the case of the few who had died wilbur larch made up a longer life for them for example the history of f stone read like a case study of what wilbur larch wished for homer wells following fuzzys most successful adoption every member of the adoptive family was scrupulously described and the most successful treatment and cure imaginable of fuzzys respiratory difficulties the young man would pursue an education at none other than bowdoin college wilbur larchs own alma mater and study medicine at harvard medical schoolhe would even follow larchs footsteps to internships at mass general and at the boston lyingin larch intended to make a devoted and skilled obstetrician out of fuzzy stone the orphans fictional history was as carefully done as everything wilbur larch didallowing a possible exception for his use of ether and larch was especially pleased to note that some of his fictional history was more convincing than what had actually happened to some of the others snowy meadows for example would be adopted by a family in bangor by the name of marsh who would believe that a meadows became a marsh wilbur larch was pleased with himself for making up better stories than that the marshes were in the furniture business and snowy who had been unimaginatively named robert would attend the university of maine only briefly before marrying some local flower and going into the marsh family furniture business as a salesman its for keeps snowy would write dr larch about the girl who caused him to drop out of school and i really love the furniture business whenever he wrote to dr larch snowy meadows alias robert marsh would always ask say whats happened to homer wells the next thing you know larch thought snowy meadows will suggest a reunion larch grumbled to himself for days trying to think of what to say to snowy meadows about homer he would have liked to brag about homers perfect procedure with the eclampsia patient but larch was aware that his training of homer wellsand the business of the lords work arid the devils work in st cloudswould not meet with everyones approval homer is still with us larch would write to snowy ambiguously snowy is a sneaky one larch concluded snowy meadows also never failed to ask in each of his letters about fuzzy stone whats happening with fuzzy these days snowy always asked and wilbur larch would carefully check the history he had written for fuzzyjust to keep snowy up to date larch ignored snowys requests for fuzzy stones address dr larch was convinced that the young furniture salesman robert marsh was a dogged sort of fool whoif he had any of the other orphans addresses would bother everyone about starting an orphan club or an orphan society larch even complained to nurse edna and to nurse angela about snowy meadows saying i wish someone out of maine had adopted that one someone far away that snowy meadows is so stupid he writes to me as if i ran a boarding school the next thing you know hell expect me to publish an alumni magazine this was a somewhat unfeeling remark to make to nurse edna and to nurse angela larch realized later these two dear but sentimental ladies would have jumped at the idea of an alumni magazine they missed every orphan they ever gave away if things were up to them there would be reunions planned every year every month larch thought and groaned he lay down in the dispensary he thought about a slight modification he had been shrewd enough to make in the history of homer wells he would tell homer about it one day if the situation demanded it he was very pleased with himself for this slight fiction that he had so skillfully blended with the actual history of homer wells of course hed included nothing of the medical training he had incriminated himself by what hed written about the abortions many times but larch knew well enough that homer wells should be left out of that written history what wilbur larch had written about homer wells was that the boy had a heart defect a heart that was damaged and weakened from birth larch had even taken the trouble to make this the first entry about homer which necessitated his locating some olderlooking paper and painstakingly revising and retyping all the earlierand actualhistory but he managed to work in the heart defect in the correctly casual places the reference was always vague and uncharacteristically lacking in medical precision the words defect and damaged and weakened would not have convinced a good detective or even a good doctor whom wilbur larch imagined he might one da need to convince in fact he worried a little if he could convince homer of itgiven what the boy had learned but larch would face that if and when the situation arose the situation larch was thinking of was war the socalled war in europe larch and many others feared that the war wouldnt stay there im sorry homer larch imagined having to tell the boy i dont want you to worry but you have a bad heart it just wouldnt stand up to a war what larch meant was that his own heart would never stand up to homer wellss going to war the love of wilbur larch for homer wells extended even to his tampering with history a field wherein he was an admitted amateur but it was nonetheless a field that he respected and also loved in an earlier entry in the file on homer wellsan entry that dr larch removed for it lent an incorrect tone of voice or at least a tone of voice unusual for historydr larch had written i love nothing or no one as much as i love homer wells period thus wilbur larch was more prepared for how a war could change important plans than olive worthington was prepared for it the other and more probable cause for a change in the wedding plans of her son and candy kendallanother way in which the young lovers plans could be changedhad been foreseen by olive it was an unwanted pregnancy a pity that it was not foreseen by either candy or wally thus when candy got pregnant shed been a virgin naturally she and wally were much distressed but they were also surprised olive would have been distressed had she known but she wouldnt have been surprised getting pregnant would never have surprised wilbur larch who knew that it happened and happened by accident all the time but candy kendall and wally worthington so full of beauty and of the moment and of their own tightness for each other simply couldnt believe it they were not the sort of people who would have been ashamed or unable to tell their parents they were simply stunned at the prospect of having to derail their perfect plansof having to get married ahead of schedule did wally worthington need a college degree to inherit his parents apple orchard of course not did candy kendall need to go to college at all she didnt wouldnt she refine herself and educate herself if left to her own means of course she would and wally wasnt much of a student anyway was he of course he wasnt he was a botany major but only at the insistence of his motherolive thought that the study of plants might stimulate her son to become more excited and more knowledgeable about applegrowing its just that were not ready candy said to wally i mean we arent are we do you feel ready i love you wally said he was a brave boy and true and candywho had not cried a single tear at the surprising discovery that she was with childloved him too but its just not the right time for us is it wally candy asked him i want to marry you anytime he said truthfully but he added something that she hadnt thought of he had thought of the war in europe even if his mother had missed it he said what if theres a wari mean what if we get involved in it what if what said candy truly shocked i mean if we were at war id goid have to id want to wally said only if there was a child it wouldnt feel rightgoing to a war when would it feel right to go to a war wally candy asked him well i mean id just have to thats allif we had one he said i mean its our country and besides for the experiencei couldnt miss it she slapped his face she started to cryin a rage for the experience youd want to go to war for the experience well not if we had a childthats when it wouldnt feel right wally said would it he was about as innocent as rain and about as thoughtless what about me candy asked still shockedand shocked further that she had slapped him she put her hand very softly where his cheek was so red with or without a child what would it be like for me if you went to a war well its all what if isnt it wally asked its just something to think about he added about the business of the child especiallyi think if you see what i mean he said i think we should try not to have the baby candy told him i wont have you going to one of those places where theres no real doctor wally said of course not she agreed but arent there any real doctors who do it its not what ive heard wally admitted he was too much of a gentleman to tell her what hed heard that there was a butcher in cape kenneth who did you for five hundred dollars you went to a parking lot and put a blindfold around yourself and waited you went alone someone picked you up and took you to the butcher you were brought back when the butcher was through you were blindfolded throughout and what was worse you had to appear absolutely hysterical in front of some fairly dignified and local doctor before the doctor would even tell you where the parking lot was and how you got in contact with the butcher if you didnt act upset enough if you werent completely crazy the doctor wouldnt put you in touch with the butcher that was the story wally had heard and he wanted no part of any of it for candy he doubted if candy could act upset enough anyway wally would have the baby instead of any of that hed marry candy and be happy about it too it was what he wanted one day anyway the story wally had heard was partially true you did have to go to the fairly dignified and local doctor and you did have to work yourself up into a frenzy and if the doctor thought you were ready to drown yourself only then would he tell you the location of the parking lot and how to approach the butcher what wally didnt know was the more human part of the story if you were calm and collected and wellspoken and obviously sane the doctor would skip the whole story about the parking lot and the butcher if you looked like a reasonable woman someone who wouldnt turn him in laterthe doctor would simply give you an abortion right there in his office for five hundred dollars and if you acted like a nut he also gave you an abortionright there in his officefor five hundred dollars the only difference was that you had to stand around blindfolded in a parking lot and think that you were being operated on by a butcher thats what acting crazy got you what was decidedly unjust in either case was that the doctor charged five hundred dollars but wally worthington was not seeking the correct information about that doctor or that socalled butcher he hoped to get advice about another abortionist somewhere and he had a vague plan concerning the people hed ask there was little point in seeking the advice of the members of the haven club hed been told t hat one member had actually taken a cruise to sweden for an abortion but that was out of the question for candy wally knew the orchardmen at ocean view were the sort of men who might have need of a less extravagant remedy he also knew that they liked him and that with few exceptions they could be trusted to keep what wally thought was a reliable manly confidence about the matter he went first to the only bachelor on the orchard crew supposing that bachelors and this one was also a notorious ladies man might have more use for abortionists than married men wally approached a member of the apple crew named herb fowler a man only a few years older than wallyhe was goodlooking in a toothin topcruel kind of way with a toothin moustache on his dark lip herb fowlers present girlfriend worked in the packinghouse during harvest during the times of the year when the apple mart was open she worked with the other mart women she was younger than herb just a local girl about candys ageher name was louise tobey and the men called her squeeze louise which was apparently okay with herb he was rumored to have other girlfriends and he had the appalling habit of carrying lots of prophylactics on himat all times of the day and nightand when anyone said anything at all about sex herb fowler would reach into his pocket for a rubber and flip it at the speaker all rolled up in its wrapper of course hed just flip a prophylactic and say see these they keep a fella free wally had already had several rubbers flipped at him and he was tired of the joke and he was not in the best humor to have the joke played on him again in his present situationbut he imagined that herb fowler was the right sort of man to ask that despite the rubbers herb fowler was always getting girls in trouble one way or another herb looked like trouble for every girl alive hey herb wally said to him it was a rainy latespring day college was out and wally was working alongside herb in the storage cellar which was empty in the spring they were varnishing ladders and when they finished the ladders they would start painting the tracks for the conveyors that ran nonstop when the packinghouse was in full operation every year everything was repainted yup thats my name herb said he kept a cigarette so fixedly drooped from his lips that his eyes were always squinted half shut and he kept his long face tipped up and back so that he could inhale the trail of smoke through his nose herb i was wondering wally said if you got a girl pregnant what would you do about it knowing your view wally smartly added about keeping yourself free that stole herbs punch line and probably made herb cross he had a rubber half out of his pocket ready to flip at wally while delivering his usual remark on the subject but wallys saying it for him forced him to arrest the motion of his flipping hand he never brought the rubber out whod you knock up herb asked instead wally corrected him i didnt say id knocked up anybody i asked you what youd doif herb fowler disappointed wally all he knew about was the same mysterious parking lot in cape kenneth something about a blindfold a butcher and five hundred dollars maybe meany hyde would know about it herb added why dontcha ask meany what hed do if he knocked anybody up herb fowler smiled at wally he was not a nice characterbut wally wouldnt satisfy him wally just smiled back meany hyde was a nice man hed grown up with a bunch of older brothers who beat him up and otherwise abused him steadily his brothers had nicknamed him meanyprobably just to confuse him meany was everfriendly he had a friendly wife florence who was one of the packinghouse and apple mart women there had been so many children that wally couldnt remember all their names or tell one from the other and therefore he found it hard to imagine that meany hyde even knew what an abortion was meany listens to everything herb fowler told wally dontcha ever watch meany whats he do except listen so wally went to find meany hyde meany was waxing the press boards for the cider press he was generally in charge of the cider mill and because of his nice disposition he was often in charge of overseeing all the cider house activitiesincluding the dealings with the migrant workers who lived in the cider house during the harvest olive made a point of keeping herb fowler at a considerable distance from those poor migrant workers herbs disposition was not so agreeable wally watched meany hyde waxing for a whi le the sharp but clean odor of the fermented cider and the old cider apples was strongest on a wet day but meany seemed to like it wally didnt mind it either say meany wally said after a while i thought you forgot my name meany said cheerfully meany what do you know about abortion wally asked i know its a sin meany hyde said and i know grace lynch has had oneand in her case i sympathize with herif you know what i mean grace lynch was vernon lynchs wife wallyand everyone elseknew that vernori beat her they had no children it was rumored that this was the result of vernons beating grace so much that graces organs of generation as homer wells knew them were damaged grace was one of the pie women during the harvest and when the apple mart was humming wally wondered if shed be working today there was lots to do in the orchards on a good day in late spring but when it was raining there was just painting and washing or fixing up the cider house to get it ready for the harvest it was just like meany hyde to be waxing the press boards too early someone would probably tell him to wax them again just before it was time for the first press but meany didnt like painting or washing up and when it rained he could kill whole days fussing over his beloved cider press who do you know needs an abortion wally meany hyde asked a friend of a friend wally said which would have prompted a rubber from herb fowlers pocket but meany was nicehe took no pleasure in anyone elses bad luck thats a shame wally meany said i think you should speak to grace about itjust dont speak to her when vernons around wally didnt have to be told that he had often seen the bruises on the backs of grace lynchs arms where vernon had grabbed her and shook her once he had seized her by the arms and yanked her toward him lowering his head in order to butt her in the face this had happened wally knew because senior had paid for graces dental work shed told senior and olive that shed fallen downstairs vernon had also beaten up a black man one of the migrants in the orchard called old trees several harvests ago the men had been telling jokes and the black man had offered a joke of his own vernon hadnt liked a black man telling jokes that had anything to do with sexhed told wally in fact that black people should be prevented from having sex or pretty soon vernon had said therell be too many of them in the old trees orchard vernon had snapped the man off his ladder and when the man picked himself off the ground vernon held both his arms and butted him in the face over and over again until everett taft who was one of the foremen and ira titcomb the beekeeper had to pull vernon off the black man had taken over twenty stitches in his mouth in his lips and in his tongue everyone knew grace lynch hadnt lost her teeth falling down any stairs it was vernon who should have had meanys name or something worse wally meany asked him as he was leaving the cider house dont tell grace i told you to ask her so wally went looking for grace lynch he drove the pickup through the muddy lane that divided the orchard called frying pan because it was in a valley anc was the hottest to work in from the orchard called doris after someones wife he drove to the building called number two it was simply the second building for keeping the larger vehicles the sprayers were sheltered in number two because the building was more isolated and the sprayersand the chemicals that went inside them stank vernon lynch was painting in there he had a spray gun with a long needlelike nozzle and he was hosing down the hardie fivehundredgallon sprayer with a fresh coat of apple red vernon wore a respirator to protect himself from the paint fumes it was the same mask the men wore when they sprayed the trees and he wore his foulweather gearthe complete oilskin suit wally somehow knew it was vernon although not a single feature of vernon was visible vernon had a way of attacking his work that made his actions unmistakably his and wally noticed that vernon was painting the hardie as if he were wielding a flamethrower wally drove on he didnt want to ask vernon where his wife was today wally shuddered as he imagined several of vernons leering responses in the empty offseason apple mart three of t he mart women were smoking cigarettes and talking they didnt have much to do and when they saw the bosss son coming they didnt throw down their coffee cups stamp out their cigarettes and disperse in different directions they just stepped a little away from one another and smiled at wally sheepishly florence hyde meanys wife didnt even pretend to be busy at anything she dragged on her cigarette and called out to wally hi honey hi florence wally said smiling big dot taft whod miraculously run a mile getting stung all the while the night senior had dumped ira titcombs bees put out her cigarette and picked up an empty crate then she put the crate down and wondered where shed left her broom hi cutey dot said to wally cheerfully whats new wally asked the women nothing new here said irene titcomb iras wife she laughed and turned her face away she was always laughingand turning away the side of her face with the burn scar as if she were meeting you for the first time and could keep the scar a secret the accident had happened years ago and there couldnt have been anyone in hearts haven or hearts rock who hadnt seen irene titcombs scar and didnt know the exact details of how she got it one night ira titcomb had sat out in his yard all night with an oil torch and a shotgun something had been getting into his hivesprobably a bear or a raccoon irene had known this was iras plan yet she was surprised when she woke up hearing him calling her he was on the lawn and waving the lit torch under her window all she saw was the torchlight he asked her to make him some bacon and eggs if she wouldnt mind because he was so bored waiting for whatever it was he intended to shoot that hed gotten hungry irene was humming to herself watching the bacon fry when ira came to the kitchen window and tapped on the pane to find out if the food was ready irene was unprepared for the vision of ira in his beekeeper suit moving out of the darkness and into the faint light from the kitchen window with fire in his hands she had seen her husband in his beekeeper suit many times but she hadnt imagined that hed be wearing it while he waited to shoot a bear or a coon shed never seen the way the suit glowed in firelight or at night either ira had worn the suit because hed imagined that his shotgun blast might rip into one of the hives and loose a few bees he had no intention of scaring his wife but poor irene looked out the window and saw what she thought was a flaming white apparition no doubt this was what had been molesting the hives the ghost of a beekeeper of bygone days it had probably killed poor ira and was now coming for her the frying pan flew up in her hands splashing the hot bacon grease on her face irene was lucky she didnt blind herself oh those athome accidents how they surprise you whatcha want big boy big dot taft asked wally the apple mart women teased and flirted with wally endlessly they thought he was gorgeous and a lot of fun and these three had known him since he was a little boy he wants to take us for a ride cried irene titcomb still laughingher face still turned away why dont you take us to a movie wally florence hyde asked him oh god what i wouldnt do for you wally dot taft said if you took me to a movie dont you want to make us happy wally florence asked him whining a little maybe wallys going to fire us irene titcomb shrieked and that broke up the three of them dot taft roared so loud that florence hyde inhaled her cigarette the wrong way and began to cough which made dot roar some more is grace here today wally asked casually when the women calmed down oh god he wants grace dot taft said whats she got that we havent got bruises wally thought broken bones false teeth certainly genuine aches and pains i just want to ask her something wally said smiling shylyhis shyness was deliberate he handled himself very smoothly around the mart women ill bet shell say no irene titcomb said giggling no everyone says yes to wally florence hyde teased wally allowed the laughter to subside then dot taft said grace is cleaning the pie oven thank you ladies wally said blowing them kisses backing away youre bad wally florence hyde told him you just came here to make us jealous that grace must have a hot oven dot taft said and this started more laughter and coughing dont get burned wally irene titcomb called after him and he left the mart women chattering and smoking at a higher pitch than when hed found them he was not surprised that grace lynch had drawn the worst job for a rainy day the other women sympathized with her but she was not one of them she stood apart as if she were afraid everyone might suddenly turn on her and beat her as badly as vernon did as if the beatings shed already survived had cost her the necessary humor for trading stories equally with florence and irene and dot grace lynch was much thinner and a little younger than these women her thinness was unusual among the regular mart women even herb fowlers girlfriend squeeze louise was heftier than grace and dot tafts kid sister debra pettigrewwho was fairly regular in pie season and when the assembly line to the packinghouse was runningeven debra had more flesh on her than grace had and since she had needed new teeth grace was even tighterlipped than usual there was a grim concentration to the narrow line of her mouth wally couldnt remember ever seeing grace lynch laughand some form of yucking it up was essential to relieve the boredom of the life of the apple mart women grace was simply the cowed dog among them she didnt look as if she took any pleasure from eating pieor from eating anything at all she didnt smoke and in everyone smoked even wally she was noiseshy and flinched around the machinery wally hoped she was wearing long sleeves so that he wouldnt have to look at the bruises on her arms but she was half in one of the deep shelves of the pie oven when wally found her she was wearing a longsleeved shirt but both sleeves were rolled up above her elbows to spare the shirt some of the ovenblack wally startled her with her head in the oven and half her body too ami grace made a little cry and banged one of her elbows against the door hinge as she withdrew in too much of a hurry sorry i scared you grace wally said quicklyit was hard to walk up on grace without making her bump into something she said nothing she rubbed one elbow she folded and unfolded her thin arms hiding her very slight breasts or by keeping her arms in constant motion concealing her bruises she wouldnt look wally in the eye as poised as wally was he always felt a terrific tension when he tried to talk with her he felt she might suddenly run away from him or throw herself ai him either with her claws out or kissing him with her tongue stabbing he wondered if she mistook his inescapable search for the new bruises on her body for a sexual interest maybe that was part of the problem between them that poor woman is just crazy ray kendall had told wally once maybe that was all grace wally asked and grace trembled she was squeezing a wad of steel wool so tightly that the di rty suds streaked down one arm and wet the waist of her shirt and the bony hip of her denim work jeans a single tooth probably false appeared out of her mouth and clenched a tiny piece of her lower lip uh grace wally said ive got a problem she stared at him as if this news frightened her more than anything anyone had ever told her she looked quickly away and said im cleaning the oven wally thought he might have to grab her to keep her from crawling back in the oven he suddenly realized that all his secretsthat anyones secretswere entirely safe with grace lynch there was absolutely nothing she dared to say and no one in her life to tell it toif she ever got up the courage candy is pregnant wally said to grace who wobbled as if a wind had come upor the strong ammonia fumes of the oven cleaner had overpowered her she looked at wally again with her eyes as round as a rabbits i need advice wally said to her it occurred to him that if vernon lynch saw him talking to grace vernon would probably find that just cause for giving grace another beating please just tell me what you know grace wally said grace lynch spat it out from between her very tight lips saint clouds she hissed it was a loud whisper wally thought it was someones namethe name of a saint or else a kind of nickname for an exceptionally evil abortionistst clouds grace lynch it was clear had no luck if shed been to an abortionist wouldnt it have to be the worst abortionist one could imagine i dont know the doctors name grace confided still whispering and not looking up at wally anymoreshe would never again look up at him the place is called saint clouds and the doctors goodhes kinda gentle he makes it okay for her this was virtually a sermonat least a speech but dont make her go alone okay wally grace said actually reaching out and touching himbut recoiling the instant she made contact as if wallys skin were hotter than the pie oven when it was fired up no i wont make her go alone of course wally promised her you ask for the orphanage when you get off the train grace said she climbed back in the oven before he could thank her grace lynch had gone to st clouds alone vernon hadnt even known she was going or he would probably have beaten her for it since shed been gone overnight hed beaten her for that but perhaps it was a lesser beating by his standards grace had arrived in the early evening just after dark as was customary shed not been housed with the expectant mothers shed been so jittery that dr larchs sedation had not affected her very much and shed been awake through the night listening to everything it had been before homers days as an apprentice so if homer had seen her he would never remember her and when one daygrace lynch would see homer wells she wouldnt recognize him shed had the standard d and c at a proper and safe time in her pregnancy arid thered been no complications except in her dreams there had never been any serious complications following any abortion dr larch had ever performed and no permanent damage from any of the operationsunless it was something so interior so very much in the mind that dr larch couldnt have been responsible for it stillthough nurse edna and nurse angela had made her feel welcome and larch had been as grace had told wally gentlegrace lynch hated to think of st clouds it was not so much for her own experience or because of her own trouble but because of the atmosphere of the place in the long night shed stayed awake the dense air hung like a great weight the disturbed river smelled like death the cries of the babies were weirder than the cries of loonsand there were owls and someone peeing and someone walking around there was a faroff machine the typewriter and a shout from another buildingjust one long wail possibly that had been melony after wally had visited with her grace balked at finishing the pie oven job she felt sick to her stomachit was like the cramps shed had that timeand she went out to the apple mart and asked the women there if theyd finish the oven for her she just didnt feel well she said nobody teased grace big dot taft asked her if shed like a ride home and irene titcomb and florence hyde who had nothing to do anyway said theyd tackle the oven in two shakes as they say in maine grace lynch went to find olive worthington she told olive she wasnt feeling well and was going home early olive was her usual kind self regarding the matter when she saw vernon lynch later she gave vernon a glarehard enough for vernon to feel discomforted by it he was cleaning the nozzle for the spray gun down at number two when olive cruised past him in the faded pickup olives look was such that vernon wondered for a moment if hed been fired if that look was all the notice he was going to get but the thought quickly passed the way thoughts tended to pass through vernon lynch he looked at the muddy tracks left by olives pickup and said something typical suck my dick you rich bitch vernon lynch said then he continued to clean out the spraygun nozzle that night wally sat on ray kendalls dock with candy and told her what little he knew about st clouds he didnt know for example that there was an apostrophe hed not bothered to apply to harvard his grades werent good enough to get him into bowdoin the university of maine where he was halfheartedly majoring in botany hadnt taught him a thing about grammar i knew it was an orphanage candy said thats all i knew it was clear to them both that no good excuse could be invented for their being gone overnight so wally arranged to borrow seniors cadillac they would have to leave very early in the morning and return in the evening of the same day wally told senior it was the best time of year to explore the coast and maybe drive a little inland the coast would have more tourists as the summer progressed and inland it would get too hot for a comfortable drive i know its a workday wally told olive whats one day matter mom its just to have a little adventure with candyjust a day off olive wondered if wally would ever amount to anything ray kendall had his own work to worry about he knew candy would be happy to take a drive with wally wally was a good driverif a trifle fastand the cadillac ray knew better than anyone was a safe ear ray did all the work on it the night before their trip candy and wally went to bed early but each of them was awake through the night like most truly loving young couples they found themselves worrying about what effect this experience would have on the other wally worried that an abortion would make candy unhappy or even uncomfortable with sex candy wondered if wally would feel the same way about her after all this was over that same night wilbur larch and hornet wells werent sleeping either larch sat at the typewriter in nurse angelas office through the window he saw homer wells walking around outside with an oil lamp in the darkness what is the matter now larch wondered and went to see what homer was doing i couldnt sleep homer told larch what is it this time dr larch asked homer maybe its just an owl said homer wells the oil lamp didnt project very far into the darkness and the wind was strong which was unusual for st clouds when the wind blew out the lamp the doctor and his assistant saw that they were backlit by the light shining from the window of nurse angelas office it was the only light for miles around and it made their shadows gigan tic larchs shadow reached across the stripped implanted plot of ground up the barren hillside all the way into the black woods homer wellss shadow touched the dark sky it was only then that both men noticed homer had grown taller than dr larch ill be damned larch muttered spreading his arms so that his shadow looked like a magician about to reveal something larch flapped his arms like a big bat look he said to homer im a sorcerer homer wells the sorcerers apprentice flapped his arms too the wind was very strong and fresh the usual density in the air above st clouds had lifted the stars shone bright and cold the memory of cigar smoke and sawdust was missing from this new air feel that wind said homer wells maybe the wind was keeping him up its a wind coming from the coast wilbur larch said he sniffed deeply for traces of salt it was a rare sea breeze larch was sure wherever its from its nice homer wells decided both men stood sniffing the wind each man thought what is going to happen to me homer breaks a promise the stationmaster at st clouds was a lonely unattractive mana victim of mailorder catalogues and of an especially crackpot mailorder religion the latter whose publication took an almost comic book form was delivered monthly the last months issue for example had a cover illustration of a skeleton in soldiers clothes flying on a winged zebra over a battlefield that vaguely resembled the trenches of world war i the other mailorder catalogues were of a more standard variety but the stationmaster was such a victim of his superstitions that his dreams frequently confused the images of his mailorder religious material with the household gadgets nursing bras folding chairs and giant zucchinis he saw advertised in the catalogues thus it was not unusual for him to be awakened in a night terror by a vision of coffins levitating from a pictureperfect gardenthe prizewinning vegetables taking flight with the corpses there was one catalogue devoted entirely to fishing equipment the stationmasters cadavers were often seen in waders or carrying rods and nets and then there were the undergarment catalogues advertising bras and girdles the flying dead in bras and girdles especially frightened the stationmaster the most particularly crackpot aspect of the mailorder religion was its insistence on the presence of the growing numbers of the restless homeless unsaved dead in areas of the world more populated than st clouds the stationmaster imagined that these luckless souls were crowding the sky the arrival of dr larchs clara fitted ominously into the stationmasters pattern of night terrors and contributed to his especially stricken appearance upon the arrival of every new train although larch had assured the moron that there would be no new bodies arriving for at least a year or two to the stationmaster the notion of judgment day was as tangible as the weather he hated the first train of the morning the most it was the milk train and in any weather the heavy cans were covered with a cold sweat the empty cans which were put on the train produced a kind of death knell a hollow bonging noise as they tapped the wooden station platform or were handed up the iron stairs the first train of the morning was the mail train too although the stationmaster was eager for new catalogues he never lost his fear of the mailof what might be coming his way if not another cadaver sloshing in embalming fluid then the monthly warning from the mailorder religion that judgment day was at hand always sooner than it was last expected and always with more terrifying verve the stationmaster lived to be shocked a hole in a tomato could cause him to escalate his predawn bouts of feverish prayer dead animals of whatever cause made him tremblehe believed the creatures souls clogged the air he needed to breathe or were capable of invading his body they were certainly capable of contributing to his sleeplessness for the stationmaster was as veteran an insomniac as wilbur larch and homer wells and was without the benefit of ether youth or education this time it was the wind that awakened him he was sure something like a bat was blown offcourse and struck his house he was convinced that a flying animal had died violently against his wall and that its rabid soul was circling around outside seeking entry then the wind made a moaning sound as it funneled through the spokes of the stationmasters bicycle a sudden gust knocked the bicycle off its kickstand it clattered on the brick path its little thumb bell dinging feeblyas if one of the worlds restless souls had failed in an attempt to steal it the stationmaster sat up in bed and screamed he had been advised in the monthly mailorder religious publication that screaming was of some if not certain protection against homeless souls indeed the stationmasters scream was not without effect its shrillness dislodged a pigeon from the eaves of the house and since no pigeon desires to fly at night he bird hopped and scrabbled its way noisily across the stationmasters roof looking for a quieter corner the stationmaster lay on his back staring straight up at his roof he expected the wandering soul to descend at any moment upon him the pigeons coo was the cry of another tortured sinner the stationmaster was sure he got up and stared out of his bedroom window his nightlight weakly illuminating the small plot he had recently tilled for his vegetable garden the freshly turned earth shocked him he mistook it for a ready grave it gave him such a turn that he quickly dressed himself and tramped outside another thing he had learned from his mailorder religion was that the souls of the dead cannot invade an active body you mustnt be caught sleeping or even standing still that was the main thing and so the stationmaster boldly set out for a brisk walk through st clouds he muttered threateningly at the wouldbe ghosts he saw everywhere go away he growledat this building at that sound at every unclear shadow a dog barked in one house the stationmaster surprised a raccoon busy with someones garbage but live animals didnt bother him he hissed at the coon and appeared satisfied when the coon hissed back he chose to stay away from the abandoned buildings where he remembered that fat nightmare of a girl from the orphanage had caused so much damage he knew that in those buildings the lost souls were both numerous and fierce he felt safer around the orphanage though he was frightened of dr larch the stationmaster became fairly aggressive in the presence of children and their imagined souls like most easily frightened people the stationmaster was something of a bully when he perceived that he had the upper hand damn kids he muttered passing the girls division he had trouble thinking of the girls division without imagining doing terrible things with that great big ruffiangirlthe destroyer he called her hed had more than one night terror regarding her she was often the model of the many bras and girdles in his dreams he paused only briefly by the girls division sniffing deeplyhe thought he might catch some scent of melony the building wreckerbut the wind was too strong the wind was everywhere it is a judgment day wind he thought and walked quickly on he was not going to stand still long enough for some terrible soul to enter him he was on the wrong side of the boys division to see the lighted window in nurse angelas office but he could look over the building up the hillside and see the light from the window illuminating the eroded unplanted hill he couldnt see where the light was coming from and this disquieted him it seemed eerie how a light from nowhere was making the stripped hill glow all the way into the black edge of the woods the stationmaster could have wept at his own timidity but he cursed himself instead so much of his sleep was lost to fear and the first train of the morning was such an early train for most of the year the train arrived when it was still dark and those women who were on it sometimesthe stationmaster shuddered those women in the loose clothes always asking where the orphanage wassome of them back the same evening their faces like ash the color of so many of the faces in the stationmasters night terrors very nearly he thought the color of claras face though the stationmaster didnt know her name his one look at clara had been so brief that it was unfair he should be doomed to see her so many times since and each time he saw more of herin his dreams when the stationmaster heard what he thought were voices he looked over the boys division at the lit hillside above st clouds and that was when he saw the towering shadows of wilbur larch and homer wells stretching in the case of one to the woods dark edge and in the case of the other stretching into the sky the two giant figures flapped their huge hillspanning arms whipped by the wind the stationmaster caught the word sorcerer it was then he knew that he could walk or even run all nightbut he would not escape not this time the last thought that the stationmaster had was that the time for him and for all the world had come the next morning the sea breeze still stirred st clouds even melony noticed it her usual grouchiness was suspended she had trouble waking up although shed passed a wakeful night shed had the impression that all night an animal was prowling the grounds of the girls division probably getting into the trash and shed been able to observe the two women walking up the hill from the train station in the predawn glow the women were not speaking to each otherthey probably didnt know each other they had certainly guessed each others circumstances the women walked head down they were both overdressed for the spring melony watched the wind press their baggy winter coats against the womens bodies they dont look pregnant melony observed she reminded herself to be on hand at her favorite window to watch the women heading down the hill for the evening train with what they were giving up melony thought one might expect their returning stepis to be lighter and after all they were heading downhill but every time the women walked more heavily down the hill than they had walked up itit appeared theyd been given something to carry away with them their gait was quite the contrary from what one might expect in the gait of women whod been truly scraped clean scraped not so clean maybe melony thought although homer wells had told her nothing what trouble could exist that melony couldnt see whatever there was that glimmered of wrong that shone of mistakeof loss of hope abandoned of the grim choices that were possiblemelony had an eye expertly trained to see this and more shed not yet set foot outdoors but she could tell something different was in the wind she could not see the body of the stationmaster he had fallen in the weeds by the delivery entrance to the boys divisionwhich was little used there was a separate delivery entrance for the hospital from his windowontheworld from nurse angelas office dr larch could not have seen the weeds where the stationmaster lay stiffening either and it was not the stationmasters departed soul that troubled larch that morning hed had other sleepless nights sea breezes were rare but he had felt them thered been a fight in the girls division that had required some stitching in one girls lip and in another girls eyebrow but wilbur larch wasnt worried about those girls homer wells had done a very neat job with the lip larch had handled the eyebrow which presented more of a problem with permanent scarring and the two women who were waiting for their abortions were very early in their respective pregnancies andin nurse ednas judgmentboth seemed robust and sane and there was an almost cheerful woman from damariscottashed just begun her contractions which appeared perfectly normal shed had one previous delivery very routine and so larch anticipated no difficulty with her he was thinking hed have homer deliver the damariscotta woman because it looked straightforward and because the woman nurse angela had said had taken a particular liking to homer she had talked up a storm to him every second hed been around her so whats wrong thought wilbur larch or if not wrong different so what if the mail was late and the dining hall said thered been no milk delivery larch didnt know and wouldnt have caredthat the train station had been more than usually disorganized in the stationmasters absence he didnt know that the stationmaster was missing wilbur larch had noticed no disturbance among the souls crowding the sky above st clouds with the work he felt was his calling dr larch could not afford too rigorous a contemplation of the soul previous to this morning homer wells had not been presented with an occasion to contemplate the soul a study of the soul had not been a part of his training and since there were no windows in the room where homer conducted his studies of clara it was not the stationmaster or his soulthat suddenly presented itself to homer wells dr larch had asked homer to prepare a fetus for an autopsy a woman from three mile falls had been stabbed or she had stabbed herself this was not unusual in three mile falls but the pregnancy of the woman was nearly fulltermand the possibility of delivering a live baby from the dead woman had been unusual even for dr larch he had attempted to rescue the child but the childor rather the embryo nearly nine months had not escaped one of the stab wounds like its mother the child or the fetus as dr larch preferred had bled to death it would have been a boythat much was clear to homer wells or even to the untrained eye whatever one called it it was very nearly a fully developed baby dr larch had asked homer to help him determine more exactly than bled to death the source of the fetuss bleeding homer wells borrowed dr larchs sternum shears before he realized that a pair of heavy scissors was all he needed to open the fetuss sternum he cut straight up the middle noticing immediately the slashed pulmonary artery to his surprise the wound was less than half an inch away from a wideopen ductusin the fetus the ductus arteriosus is half the size of the aorta but homer had never looked inside a fetus before in the born within ten days the ductus becomes nothing but a fibrous thread this change is initiated not by any mystery but by the first breath which closes the ductus and opens the lungs in the fetus the ductus is a shuntthe blood bypasses the lungs on its way to the aorta it should not have been a shock for homer wells to see the evidence that a fetus has little need for blood in its lungs a fetus doesnt breathe yet homer was shocked the stab wound at the base of the ductus appeared as a second eye alongside the little opening of the ductus itself the facts were straightforward enough the ductus was wide open because this fetus had never taken its first breath what was the life of the embryo but a history of development homer attached a tiny needlenosed clamp to the severed pulmonary artery he turned to the section in grays devoted to the embryo it was another shock for him to remember that grays did not begin with the embryo it ended with it the embyro was the last thing considered homer wells had seen the products of conception in many stages of development in rather whole form on occasion and in such partial form as to be barely recognizable too why the old blackandwhite drawings should have affected him so strongly he could not say in grays there was the profile view of the head of a human embryo estimated at twentyseven days old not quick as dr larch would be quick to point out and not recognizably human either what would be the spine was cocked like a wrist and where the knuckles of the fist above the wrist would be there was the illformed face of a fish the kind that lives below light is never caught could give you nightmares the undersurf ace of the head of the embryo gaped like an eelthe eyes were at the sides of the head as if they could protect the creature from an attack from any direction in eight weeks though still not quick the fetus has a nose and a mouth it has an expression thought homer wells and wiith this discoverythat a fetus as early as eight weeks has an expression homer wells felt in the presence of what others call a soul he displayed the pulmonary artery of the baby from three mile falls in a shallow white enamel examining tray he used two clamps to hold the chest incision open and one more clamp to lift and expose the lacerated artery the babys cheeks appeared deflated someones invisible hands appeared to press its small face at its sides it lay on its back resting on its elbowsits forearms held stiffly perpendicular to its chest the tiny fingers of its hands were slightly openas if the baby were preparing to catch a ball homer wells did not care for the tattered appearance of the stump of the umbilical cord which was also too long he clipped it again and tied it off neatly there wa s a little caked blood on the tiny penis and homer cleaned this away a spot of old blood on the bright white edge of the enamel tray came off easily with just a cotton swab dabbed with alcohol the color of the dead baby especially against the whiteness of the tray was of something sallowgoinggray homer turned to the sink and vomited rather deftly in it when he ran the faucet to clean the sink the old pipes pounded and howled he thought it was thepipes or his dizziness that made the roomthewhole buildingtremble he wasnt thinking about the wind from the coasthow strong it was he wasnt blaming dr larch either homer felt there was nothing as simple as anyones fault involved it was not larchs faultlarch did what he believed in if wilbur larch was a saint to nurse angela and to nurse edna he was both a saint and a father to homer wells larch knew what he was doingand for whom but that quick and notquick stuff it didnt work for homer wells you can call it a fetus or an embryo or the products of conception thought homer wells but whatever you call it its alive and whatever you do to it homer thoughtand whatever you call what you doyoure killing it he looked at the severed pulmonary artery which was so perfectly displayed in the open chest of the baby from three mile falls let larch call it whatever he wants thought homer wells its his choiceif its a fetus to him thats fine its a baby to me thought homer wells if larch has a choice i have a choice too he picked up the spotless tray and carried it into the hall like a proud waiter carrying a special dish to a favorite guest curly day forever snotnosed was cruising in the corridor between the dispensary and nurse angelas office he was not allowed to be playing there but curly day had a boredeveryminute look about him he had the attention span of a rabbit at the moment curly was dragging a cardboard carton through the corridor it was the carton the new enema bags had come in homer recognized the carton because he had unpacked it whatcha got curly day asked homer who held the tray and the dead baby from three mile falls at shoulder level curly day came up to homers waist when homer got close to the carton he saw that it was not empty david copperfield junior was in the bottom of the carton curly day was giving him a ride get out of here curly homer said comer cried david copperfield its homer you idiot curly day said comer david copperfield cried get out of here please homer told them whatcha got curly asked homer he reached upward for the edge of the tray but homer picked off his dirty little hand he grabbed curly at the wrist and twisted curlys arm behind his back homer balanced the tray and its content expertly curly day tried to struggle ow curly cried david copperfield tried to stand up in the bottom of the carton but he lost his balance and sat down homer lifted curly days arm behind his backjust slightly higher than the rightangle markwhich caused curly to bend over and rest his forehead on the edge of the enemabag carton cut it out curly said youre leaving curlyright homer asked yeah yeah curly said and homer let him go tough guy curly said right said homer wells comer david copperfield managed to say curly day wiped his nose on his disheveled sleeve he jerked the carton so suddenly that david copperfield rolled on his side ack little copperfield cried shut up curly said to his cargo he shuffled away from homer wells to whom he gave a look of peevish sorrow of aimless complaintnothing more his body bobbed from side to side as he made his way with the carton containing david copperfield homer noted that curlys shoes were on the wrong feet and one of them was untied but he decided it would be unworthy criticism to mention this to curly who was as buoyant as he was messyand wasnt his buoyancy more important than his carelessness especially since he was an orphan goodbye curly homer said to the boys slouched back curlys untucked shirt hung to his knees see ya homer curly said keeping his face turned away when he passed the dispensary door nurse edna appeared and scolded him youre not supposed to be playing here curly she said yeah yeah curly said im going im going medna david copperfield cried in a muffled voice from the bottom of the enemabag carton its edna you little scum curly said then homer was at the door of nurse angelas office which was open he could see dr larch at the typewriter the doctor wasnt writing there wasnt even any paper in the machine dr larch was just looking out the window in the doctors trancelike expression homer recognized the peaceful distance that ether provided in those moments when homer had found the doctor just resting in the dispensary perhaps the state of mind that ether occasionally allowed dr larch to enjoy was increasingly a state of mind that larch could summon by just looking out a window homer assumed that dr larch used a little ether because he was in some kind of pain he suspected that almost everyone in st clouds was in some kind of pain and that larch as a doctor was especially qualified in remedying it the smell of ether was so cloying and nauseating to homer wells that it was no remedy he would have chosen it hadnt yet occurred to him what an addiction was the state of a dream was so present on wilbur larchs face that homer wells paused in the doorway before continuing his gruesome presentation he almost turned around and took the baby from three mile falls away with him but no one encounters the presence of a soul so casually that one can permit the accompanying sense of mission to pass without remarking upon it and a sense of mission usually requires a gesture more demonstrative than a passing remark in the doorway of nurse angelas office homer hesitated then he stepped forward and clunked the metal tray down on top of the typewriter the dead baby from three mile falls was level with dr larchs throatit was close enough to bite as they say in maine doctor larch homer wells said larch looked away from his dream he stared over the baby at homer the source of the bleeding was the pulmonary artery which was completely severedas you see homer said as larch looked down at the display upon the typewriter he stared at the baby as if it were something hed written come to life and then to death at his bidding outside the hospital someone was screaming but the wind whipped the words to a muddle the screamers message sounded confused goddamn said wilbur larch staring at the severed artery i have to tell you that i wont perform an abortion not ever homer wells said this followed logically from the severed artery in homers mind it followed but dr larch looked confused you wont larch said you what outside the screaming was louder but no more distinct homer wells and dr larch just stared at each otherthe baby from three mile falls occupying the space between them im coming im coming they heard nurse angela say its that curly day nurse edna was explaining to nurse angela i just had to kick him and the copperfield kid out of here not ever homer wells said you disapprove dr larch asked homer i dont disapprove of you homer wells said i disapprove of itits not for me well ive never forced you dr larch said and i never will its all your choice right said homer wells a door opened but what curly day was caterwauling about was no clearer dr larch and homer wells heard the test tubes in the rack by the dispensary doer tinkle over these chimes and for the first time holding its own with the wind the word dead came through to them dead dead dead curly day was screaming his announcement punctuated by the unintelligible monosyllabic utterances of young copperfield whos dead dear nurse angela asked curly sweetly curly day had discovered that the stationmaster was dead curly didnt know it was the stationmaster curly hadnt taken a long enough look a guy is dead curly said to nurse angela and nurse edna wilbur larch who heard this distinctly got up from the desk and walked past homer wells into the hall and if its all the same to you homer wells said to him id like permission to not be there when you do what you have to do i want to be of use in any other way and im not disapproving of you homer said if its okay i just dont want to watch it ill have to think about that homer dr larch said lets see whos dead shall we as homer followed larch down the hall he noted that the door to the delivery room was closed and that the door light was on which meant that nurse edna or nurse angela had prepared the two women who were waiting for their abortions the woman from damariscotta whose contractions were still slow and regular probably wouldnt be needing the delivery room until long after larch was through the two abortions homer agreed with dr larch that it was cruel to make the women waiting for the abortions wait any longer than was necessary especially after theyd been prepared and so homer opened the delivery room door and poked his head inside without really looking at either woman he announced the doctor will be right with youplease dont worry homer wells regretted his timing before he could close the delivery room door curly day began his dead chant all over again curly day possessed the kind of restlessness that would always lead him to unwanted discoveries he had tired of dragging david copperfield around in the enemabag carton and therefore he had conceived of launching young copperfield in the carton off the loading platform at the boys division delivery entrance it had been a struggle to get the carton and copperfield up the ramp but once elevated above the littleused driveway and the tall weeds curly imagined that copperfield nnight be taught how to almost fly surely it wasnt such a high drop in the carton especially it wouldnt be much of a fall and the weedy hill that sloped away from the loading platform would probably allow the enemabag carton to slide curly did foresee the possible damage to the cartonthe destruction of which would leave him in the company of david copperfield all alone and the prospect of copperfield without a carton or another plaything was powerfully boring but curly was already tired of the possible uses of copperfield with or in the carton he had exhausted the safe things there were to do and copperfield was not complaining copperfield didnt know he was on the brink of the loading platform he couldnt see over the sides of the carton when curly pushed the carton and copperfield over the edge he was careful to keep the carton in an upright position thus preventing copperfield from landing on his head the carton landed on one corner which collapsed and young copperfield was propelled down the bank of tall weeds like an unsteady chick staggering out of its shell he came briefly to his feet before he fell and rolled again and again from the platform curly day watched the weeds waving at him if the weeds indicated copperfields whereabouts they were too tall for curly to actually see copperfield copperfield was not injured but he was disoriented he couldnt see curly and he couldnt see the carton which hed grown rather fond of when he stopped rolling he tried to stand but dizziness in combination with the uneven ground unbalanced him and he sat down what he sat on was something hard and round like a stone but when he looked at what it was he saw it was the stationmasters headface up eyes open a strangely accepting terror in the frozen expression an older child or even an adult might have been upset at sitting on the dead stationmasters face but young david copperfield viewed it much as he viewed the rest of the world with more curiosity than surprise however when he touched the face and felt its coldness the correctness of the childs sensibilities was apparent the coldness was surely wrong young copperfield leaped away rolled came to his feet ran fell rolled again finally on his feet he began to yelp like a dog curly day began to track him through the tall weeds hang on hang on dont get excited curly called to the boy but copperfield ran and fell in circles barking strangely stay in one place so i can find you curly yelled he stepped on something that rolled under his shoe it felt like a freshly fallen branch that had not yet settled into the ground it was the stationmasters arm in an attempt to catch his balance curly put his hand on the stationmasters chest the wideeyed unflinching face which the tall weeds sheltered from the wind stared past curly undisturbed and then in the plot of weeds there were two barking dogs who moved as if trapped in a maze it was a testimony to something basically brave and responsible in curly day that the boy did not bolt from the weeds until he found david copperfield melony at her window watched the inexplicable thrashing through the weeds at any time she could have yelled out to curly day and told him the whereabouts of david copperfieldshe could see by the movement of the weeds which yelping animal was where but she let them fend for themselves only when curly day was dragging young copperfield up the driveway around the boys division toward the hospital entrance did melony feel inclined to comment hey curly your shoes are on the wrong feetmelony called you jerk but the wind was too strong curly couldnt hear her she couldnt hear what curly was yelling she spoke just one more word out the window to no one in particular she felt that the wind allowed her to say exactly what she felt from the heart as loudly as she chose although she did not even bother to speak loudly boring she said but things became more interesting to melony when wilbur larch and homer wellsand nurse edna and nurse angelaappeared in the driveway by the boys division delivery entrance they were clearly searching the plot of tall weeds what are you looking for melony yelled out the window but either the noise of the wind or the intentness with which the searchers plunged through the weeds caused her question to be ignored she decided to go see for herself melony felt uneasy about the way this day was developing but at the same time she felt grateful that something seemed to be happeningthat anything at all was happening was vaguely all right with melony this was not a feeling shared by either candy kendall or wally worthington who for the last three hours had maintained an awkward silencetheir sense of anticipation was too keen to conceal with conversation it had still been dark when theyd left the coast at hearts haven and ventured inlandaway from the wind although the wind was still surprisingly strong wally had studied the map so excessively the night before that the white cadillac moved as purposefully away from the sea as an oyster or its pearl washing resolutely ashore it was really too windy even inland for the top to be down but wally preferred the cadillac when it was a proper convertible and alsowith the top down with the rush of the wind so noisy in the carthe absence of conversation between him and candy was less obtrusive candy preferred it too her honeyblond hair was all around her facesuch wild swirls of hair surrounded her face at times that she knew wally couldnt see her expression wally knew what her expression was anyway he knew her very well wally glanced at the unread book in candys lap she picked it up to read every so often but when she returned the book to her lap the same page was dogeared the book was little dorrit by charles dickens it was required summer reading for all the girls in candys wouldbe graduating class candy had begun it four or five times but she had no idea what the book was about or whether she even liked it wally who was no reader didnt bother to notice the name of the book he just watched the same dogeared page and thought about candy he was also thinking about st clouds he was already in his mind through the abortion candy was recovering nicely the doctor was telling jokes all the nurses were laughing there were enough nurses to win a war in wallys imagination all of them were young and pretty and the orphans were amusing little tykes with the appropriate gaps in their toothy smiles in the trunk of senior worthingtons gliding cadillac wally had three apple crates crammed full of goodies for the orphans if it had been the proper season he would have brought them apples and cider in the spring there werent any fresh apples and there wasnt any cider but wally had provided the next best thingin his opinion he had loaded the cadillac with jars and jars of the worthingtons best applecider jelly and crabapple jelly and with halfgallon jugs of ira titcombs best appleblossom honey he imagined arriving for this abortion like santa glaus an unfortunate image if one considered wilbur larchs memory of the abortion place off harrison wally imagined that candy was sitting up after her abortion with that relief on her face of someone who had just had a nasty splinter removed oddly wally populated the abortion room itself with the aura of celebration one associates with the birth of a welcome child the air of wallys wishful thinking was rich with congratulation and through the lighthearted scene traipsed the cute waifs of st clouds each with his or her own jar of jelly little honeycarriers as happy as bear cubs candy closed her book and returned it to her lap again and wally felt he had to say something hows the book he said i dont know candy said and laughed he pinched her thigh something caught in his throat when he tried to laugh with her she pinched his thigh in returna pinch of the exact same passion and pressure as the one hed given her oh how relieved he was that they were so alike through the everpoorer gawking towns as the sun rose and rose they drove like lost royaltythe oysterwhite cadillac with its dazzling passengers was a headturner that scarlet upholstery so curiously mottled by seniors accident with the chemicals was unique everyone who saw them pass would not forget them not much farther wally said this time he knew better than to pinch her thigh he simply let his hand rest in her lap near little dorrit candy put her hand on top of his while melonystalking through the girls division lobby with more than usual purposecaught mrs grogans generous and watchful eye whats going on dear mrs grogan asked melony i dont know melony said shrugging you can bet it aint a new boy in town or nothing which was a mild remark for melony mrs grogan thought how the girl has mellowed she had melloweda little a very little something about the big young womans determination made mrs grogan follow her outside my what a wind mrs grogan exclaimed where have you been melony thought but she didnt utter a word the degree that she had mellowed could be confused with not caring much anymore its the stationmaster said homer wells who was the first to find the body that moron wilbur larch muttered well hes dead anyway homer informed dr larch who was still struggling through the weeds en route to the body dr larch refrained from saying that by dying in this manner the stationmaster was intending a further inconvenience to the orphanage if wilbur larch was mellowing he was also mellowing very little st clouds was not a place that mellowed you homer wells looked over the weeds that concealed the dead stationmaster and saw melony striding toward him oh please he felt his heart say to him oh please let me leave the powerful wind swept his hair away from his face he leaned his chest into the wind as if he stood on the deck of a ship heading into the wind slicing through the waves of an ocean hed not yet seen wilbur larch was thinking about the weak heart he had invented for homer wells larch was wondering how he should tell homer about having a weak heart without frightening the young man or reminding him of the vision frozen upon the face of the stationmaster what in hell had that fool imagined hed seen dr larch wondered as he helped the others lug the stationmasters stiffened body to the hospital entrance curly day who enjoyed being kept busy had already been sent to the railroad station young copperfield had gone with him which slowed curly down considerably yet curly was grateful for the company curly was slightly confused about the message he was sent to deliver and copperfield at least presented curly with a model listener curly practised the message he thought he was supposed to deliver by saying it aloud to david copperfield the message had no visible effect on copperfield but curly found the repetition of the message soothing and the practice helped him to understand it or so he thought the stationmaster is dead curly announced dragging copperfield down the hillcopperfields head either nodding agreement or just bouncing loosely between the boys jerking shoulders the downhill pace was hard for copperfield whose balance wasnt the best and his left hand grasped in curly days hand was pulled high above his left ear doctor larch says he had a heart attack for several hours curly day added which didnt sound quite right to him but after he repeated it a few times it sounded more reasonable what larch had said was that the stationmaster appeared to have had a heart attack several hours ago but curlys version felt more or less correct to curlythe more he said it tell the relatives and friends that theres soon gonna be an automobile said curly day and david copperfield bobbed in agreement this didnt sound right to curly either no matter how many times he repeated it but he was sure hed been told to say something like that the word was autopsy not automobile curly had part of the word right perhaps he thought there was some special car coming to carry the dead it made a little sense and a little sense was sense enough fen curly dayand more sense than curly saw in most things dead david copperfield cried happily as they approached the train station two of the usual oafs were lounging on the bench that faced away from the tracks they were the sort of louts who hung around the station all day as if the station were a house of beautiful women and the women were known to grant favors to all the towns untidy and unemployed they paid no attention to curly day and david copperfield dead david copperfield called out to them with no effect the assistant to the stationmaster was a young man who had modeled his particularly unlikable offieiousness upon the offieiousness of the stationmaster so that he had a completely inappropriate oldfart complaining curmudgeonly aspect to his youthfulnessthis in combination with the meanspiritedness of a dogcatcher who enjoys his work he was a stupid young man who sharec with the stationmaster an aspect of the bully he would holler at children to keep their feet off the benches but he would simper before anyone better dressed than himself and he tolerated any rudeness from anyone who had any advantage over him he was without exception cold and superior to the women who got off the train and asked for directions to the orphanage and he had not once taken the arm of even one of those women and offered his assistance when they mounted the stairs to the return train and that first step was a high onemany of the women whod been scraped clean had obvious trouble with that first step this morning the stationmasters assistant was feeling especially virtuous and disagreeable he had given fifteen cents to one of the louts to go to the stationmasters house and find him but the clod had returned with no more information than that the stationmasters bicycle had fallen over and been left where it had fallen ominous thought the assistant but frustrating he was half irritated at having to do the stationmasters chores which hed done poorly and half thrilled at the prospect of being in charge when he saw those two dirty urchins from the orphanage crossing the main road in front of the station and coming his way the stationmasters assistant felt his authority swell curly day wiping his nose on one arm dragging david copperfield with the other seemed on the verge of speaking but the stationmasters assistant spoke first beat it he said you dont belong here curly halted young copperfield collided with him and staggered from the suddenness of the collision curly fully believed he belonged nowhere but he gathered his confidence and delivered quite loudly his rehearsed message the stationmaster is dead doctor larch says he had a heart attack for several hours tell the relatives and friends that theres soon gonna be an automobile even the oafs took notice the assistant was stricken by a flood of sudden and conflicting feelings that the stationmaster was dead might mean that he the assistant would be the next stationmaster that it was possible for someone to suffer a heart attack lasting several hours was unimaginably painful and what was this promiseor threatabout an automobile what relatives what friends the two louts wondered whats that about an automobile the assistant asked curly day curly suspected that hed made a mistake but decided to bluff it out it was not advisable to display weakness or indecision before a bully and curlys crafty instincts for survival led him to choose confidence over the truth it means theres a car coming for him said curly day the two clods looked mildly impressed they had not thought the stationm aster was important enough to warrant a car to carry him away you mean a hearse asked the assistant there was a hearse in three mile fallshe had seen it once a long black car that moved slowly enough to have been pulled by mules i mean a car said curly day for whom the word hearse meant nothing at all i mean an automobile no one moved no one spoke perhaps the symptoms of the special heart attack reputed to last for several hours were slowly beginning in all of them they were all just waiting for the next event of the day when senior worthingtons oysterwhite cadillac crept into view in the many poor and isolated towns they had driven through wally and candy had drawn more than their share of stares but they were still unprepared for the stunned gaping of the stationmasters assistant and the extremes of gawking they provoked from the two louts who sat on the bench in front of the station house as if theyd been nailed there here we are saint clouds wally said to candy with a clearly false enthusiasm candy could not help herself she reached for his leg and gripped him at midthigh little dorrit plunged from her lap grazing her lockedtogether ankles on its way to the cadillacs floor the faces of curly day and david copperfield were what struck candy with the most force in spite of his grime and dishevelment curly days face was shininghis smile was a lucky beam of sunlight it pierced the garbage and revealed the hidden glitter it was the hugeness of the expectation in curlys dirty face that took candys breath away her eyes swam her vision blurredbut not before the wideopenness of david copperfields mouth astonished her from the teardrop shape of his fat lower lip there hung a clear healthy string of drool suspended nearly to his tight little fists which he clenched against his stomach as if the blinding white cadillac had knocked the wind out of him as solidly as a punch wally wasnt sure but he thought that the stationmasters assistant appeared to be in charge of this strange assemblage of people excuse me wally said to the assistant whose mouth didnt move whose eyes didnt blink could you tell me the way to the orphanage you sure got here in a hurry said the assistant lifelessly a white hearse he was thinking not to mention the beauty of the bodysnatchers the assistant found he was unable to look at the girl his minds eye would never forget its actual brief glimpse of her pardon me wally said the man is deranged wally was thinking i should be talking to someone else a passing look at the oafs upon the bench was enough to tell wally that he should not ask them anything and the littlest child with the crystal string of slobber now winking like an icicle in the sunlight and reaching nearly to the grassstained dimples on the childs knees appeared to be too young for speech hello wally ventured pleasantly dead said david copperfield the drool dancing like tinsel on a christmas tree not him wally thought and sought the eyes of curly day curlys eyes were easy to findthey were riveted on candy hello candy said to him and curly day swallowed visiblyand with apparent pain the wet end of his nose looked raw but he rubbed it vigorously anyway could you tell us the way to the orphanage wally asked curly day who unlike the louts and the assistant knew that this cadillac and these angelic specimens of the living had not been sent to retrieve the unwanted body of the dead stationmaster they want the orphanage thought curly day theyve come here to adopt someone his pounding heart told him oh god thought curly daylet it be me david copperfield in his typical trance reached his hand out to touch the perfect monogram on the cadillacs door senior worthingtons gold monogram on the face of a gleaming red delicious applewith a leaf of springgreen brightness the artless shape of a tear curly batted young copperfields hand away i got to take charge of things curly was thinking if i want them to pick me ill show you the orphanage said curly day give us a ride candy smiled and opened the rear door for them she was a little surprised when curly picked up young copperfield and shoved him in the carnot on the eat but on the floor copperfield seemed content on the floor in fact when he touched the strangely mottled scarlet upholstery of the seat he pulled back his hand with alarmhed never touched leather beforeand he jumped as if he feared the seat might be alive it had been a startling day for young copperfield most of the morning confined in an enemabag carton his first attempt at flight his long fall through the weeds and then sitting on that dead mans face what next young copperfield wondered when the cadillac began to move he screamed hed never been inside a car before he dont know about cars curly day explained to candy curly himself had never felt leather before either but he tried to sit on the luxurious seat as if he were born to ride forever in this fashion he didnt realize that the bleachedout stains that striped the scarlet were the result of an accident with chemicalsit would often be curly days misfortune to mistake an accident for something artistically intended slow down wally candy said the little one is frightened she leaned over the front seat and extended her arms to young copperfield whose howling abruptly ceased he recognized the way her hair fell forward to either side of her facethis together with her outstretched arms and a certain comfort in her smile were familiar to copperfield from nurse angela and nurse edna men copperfield thought picked you up in one arm and carried you over a hip by men he meant homer wells and dr larch curly day sometimes lugged copperfield around in this fashion but curly wasnt quite strong enough and often dropped him come here come here dont be afraid candy said to copperfield swinging him over the seat and putting him in her lap copperfield smiled and touched candys hair he had never felt blond hair before he wasnt quite sure if it was real he had never smelled anyone who smelled this good either he drove his face into the side of her neck and took a great big sniff of her she actually hugged him even kissed him on the blue dent of his temple she looked at wally and almost cried curly day sick with envy gripped the leather seat and wondered what he could say that would make them want him why would anyone want me he began to wonder but he fought off the thought he sought wallys eyes in the cadillacs rearview mirror it was too painful for him to see the way candy held david copperfield youre one of the orphans wally askedhe hoped tactfully you bet curly day said too loudly he sounded too enthusiastic about it he thought im not just one of the orphans he blurted out suddenly im the best one this made candy laugh she turned around in the front seat and smiled at him and curly felt he was losing his grip on the leather upholstery he knew he should say something else but his nose was running so violently he was sure that whatever he said would be grotesque before he could drag his sleeve across his face there was her hand with her handkerchief extended to him and she wasnt just handing the handkerchief to him he realized she was actually pressing the handkerchief to his nose and holding it correctly in place blow candy said only once had anyone done this for curly daynurse edna he thought hehut his eyes and blew his noseat first cautiously come on candy said really blow it he really blew ithe blew his nose so emphatically that his head was instantly clear the delicious scent of her perfume made him giddy he shut his eyes and wet his pants then he lost control and flung himself back in the huge scarlet seat he saw that hed blown his nose all over her hand and she didnt even look angry she looked concerned and that made him pee even harder he couldnt stop himself she looked completely surprised left or right wally asked heartily pausing at the driveway to the boys division delivery entrance left curly shouted then he opened the rear door on candys side and said to her im sorry i dont even wet my bed i never have i aint a bedwetter i just got a cold and i got excited im just having a bad day im really goodl he cried im the best one its all right its all right get back in she said to him but curly was already sprinting through the weeds and around the far corner of the building the poor kid just wet his pants candy said to wally who saw the way candy held david copperfield in her lap and felt himself breaking please he whispered to her you dont have to do this you can have the baby i want the babyi want your baby it would be fine we can just turn around he pleaded with her but she said no wally im all right its not the time for us to have a baby she put her face down on david copperfields damp neck the boy smelled both sweet and mildewed the car stood still are you sure wally whispered to her you dont have to she loved him for saying just the right thing at the right time but candy kendall was more practical than wally worthington and she had her fathers stubbornness when her mind was made up she was no waffler the boy said you go left candy said to wally go left mrs grogan across the road in the girls division entrance observed the cadillacs hesitation she had not seen curly day flee from the car and she did not recognize the small child in the pretty girls lap mrs grogan assumed that the child belonged to the pretty girlshe wondered if shed ever seen a girl that pretty and her young man was certainly handsomealmost too handsome for a husband as they say in maine in mrs grogans opinion they looked too young to be adopting anyonetoo bad she mused because they certainly seemed well off a cadillac meant nothing to mrs grogan it was the people themselves who appeared expensive to her she was puzzled by how charmed she felt to be looking at these lovely people her few glimpses of the very rich had not charmed mrs grogan in the past those glimpses had only made her feel bitteron behalf of the unadopted girls she was all for her girls mrs grogan was there was nothing personal in her bitternessand very little that was personal in her whole life really the car stood still giving mrs grogan a long view oh the poor dears she thought they are not married they have had this child together either he or she is being disinheritedthey have both clearly been disgraced and now they have come to give up their child but they are hesitating she wanted to rush out and tell them keep the child drive away she felt paralyzed by the drama she was imagining dont do it she whispered mustering the strength for an enormous telepathic signal it was the signal wally felt when he told candy that she didnt have to but then the car started up againit was not turning around it was heading straight for the hospital entrance of the boys divisionand mrs grogans heart sank boy or girl she wondered numbly what the fuck is going on wondered melony at her bitter window because of the harsh overhead light in the dormitory melony could see her own face reflected in the window she watched the white cadillac halt on her upper lip curly day escaped across her cheek arid the pretty blond girls arms enclosed david copperfield at m elonys throat it was as close as melony came to looking in a mirror it was not that she was troubled by the heaviness of her face or how close together her eyes were or how her hair rebelled it was her own expression that upset herthe vacantness the absence of energy formerly she imagined she had at least had energy she couldnt remember when shed last looked at herself in a mirror what troubled her now was that shed just seen this familiar vacantness on the face of homer wells when hed lifted the stationmasters bodyit wasnt the absence of strain it was that look of zero surprise melony was afraid of homer how things had changed she thought shed wanted to remind him of his promise you wont leave will you shed almost asked youll take me if you run away shed wanted to say but her familiarity with his new expression because it was her nearly constant expression she was sure had paralyzed her now who are these pretty people she wondered some car she thought shed not seen their faces but even the backs of their heads had discomforted her the mans blond hair had contrasted so perfectly with the smooth tanned back of his neck that it had given her a shiver and how could the back of the girls head be so perfectthe bounce and swing of her hair so accurate was there some trick to aligning the length of the hair so exactly with the girls straight but small shoulders and it was positively graceful how shed picked up young copperfield and held him in her lapthat little runt thought melony she must have said the word runt half aloud because her breath fogged the window at that instant she lost sight of her own mouth and nose when the window cleared she saw the car move on toward the hospital entrance people like that are too perfect to need an abortion melony imagined theyre too perfect to fuck she thought bitterly theyre too clean to do it the pretty girl wonders why she cant get pregnant she doesnt know you have to fuck first theyre considering adopting someone but they wont find anyone here theres no one whos good enough for them thought melonyhating them she spat straight into her own dull reflection and watched her spit run down the pane she hadnt the energy to move there was a time she thought when i would have at least gone outdoors and poked around the cadillac maybe they would leave something in the carsomething good enough to steal but now not even the thought of something to steal could move melony from her window dr larch had performed the first abortion with nurse ednas assistance larch had asked homer to check on the contractions of the expectant mother from damariscotta nurse angela was assisting larch with the second abortion but dr larch had insisted on homers presence too he had supervised homers ether application dr larch had such a light touch with ether that the first abortion patient had been speaking to nurse edna throughout the operation and yet the woman hadnt felt a thing she talked and talked a kind of airy list of non sequiturs to which nurse edna responded with enthusiasm homer had put the second woman out and he was clearly cross with himself for sedating the woman more heavily than hed meant to better safe than sorry nurse angela said encouraginglyher hands on the womans pale temples which she instinctively smoothed with her soft hands larch had asked homer to insert the vaginal speculum and homer now stared darkly at the womans shiny cervix at the puckered opening of the uterus bathed in a clear mucus it had an aura ol morning mist of dew of the pink clouds of a sunrise gathered around it if wally worthington had peered through the speculum he would have imagined that he was viewing an apple in some pale ethereal phase of its development but what is that little opening he might have wondered hows it look larch asked it looks fine said homer wells to his surprise larch handed him the cervical stabilizera simple instrument it was for grabbing the upper lip of the cervix and stabilizing the cervix which was then sounded for depth and dilated didnt you get what i told you homer asked dr larch do you disapprove of touching the cervix homer larch asked homer reached for the lip of the womans cervix and seized it correctly i wont touch a single dilator he thought he wont make me but larch didnt even ask he said thank you thats a help he sounded and dilated the cervix himself when he asked for the curette homer handed it to him you remember that i asked you if it was necessary for me to even be here homer asked quietly i said that if it was all the same to you id just as soon not watch you remember its necessary for you to watch said wilbur larch who listened to the scrape of his curette his breathing was shallow but regular i believe said dr larch that you should participate to the degree of watching of lending some amateur assistance of understanding the process of learning how to perform itwhether you ever choose to perform it or not do i interfere larch asked when absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply cant have an abortion that they simply must go through with having anotherand yet anotherorphan do i interfere do i i do not he said scraping i deliver it goddamn it and do you think there are largely happy histories for the babies born here do you think the futures of these orphans are rosy do you you dont larch said but do i resist i do not i do not even recommend i give them what they want an orphan or an abortion larch said well im an orphan said homer wells do i insist that we have the same ideas i do not dr larch said you wish it said homer wells the women who come to me are not helped by wishes said wilbur larch he put down the mediumsized curette and held out his hand for a smaller one which homer wells had ready for him and handed to him automatically i want to be of use homer began but dr larch wouldnt listen then you are not permitted to hide larch said you are not permitted to look away it was you who told me correctly that if you were going to be of use if you were going to participate at all you had to know everything nothing could be kept from you i learned that from you well youre right larch said you were right he added its alive said homer wells thats the only thing you are involved in the process said dr larch birthon occasion and interrupting iton other occasions your disapproval is noted it is legitimate you are welcome to disapprove but you are not welcome to be ignorant to look the other way to be unable to performshould you change your mind i wont change my mind said homer wells all right then said dr larch should you against your will but for the life of the mother for examjple should you have to perform im not a doctor said homer wells you are not a complete physiciansaid dr larch and you could study with me for another ten years and you still wouldnt be complete but regarding all the known complications arising in the area of the female organs of generation regarding those organsyou can be a complete surgeon period you are already more competent than the most competent midwife damn it said wilbur larch homer had anticipated the extraction of the small curette he handed larch the first of several sterile vulval pads i will never make you do what you disapprove of homer said dr larch but you will watch you will know how to do what i do otherwise what good arn ihe asked arent we put on this earth to work at least to learn at least to watch what do you think it means to be of use he asked do you think you should be left alone do you think i should let you be a melony why dont you teach her how to do it homer wells asked dr larch now theres a question nurse angela thought but the womans head moved slightly in nurse angelas hands the woman moaned and nurse angela touched her lips to the womans ear youre just fine dear she whispered its all over now you just rest do you see what i mean homer dr larch asked right homer said but you dont agree do yoularch asked right again said homer wells you damn sullen selfcentered selfpitying arrogant untested knownothing teenager thought wilbur larch but instead of any of that he said to homer wells perhaps youre having second thoughts about becoming a doctor i never really had a first thought about that homer said i never said i wanted to be a doctor larch looked at the blood on the gauzethe right amount of blood he thoughtand when he held out his hand for a fresh pad homer had one ready you dont want to be a doctor homer dr larch asked right said homer wells i dont think so youve not had much opportunity to look at other things larch said philosophically his heart was aching its my fault i know if ive made medicine so unattractive nurse angela who was much tougher than nurse edna felt that she might cry nothings your fault homer said quickly wilbur larch checked the bleeding again theres not much to do here he said abruptly if you wouldnt mind just staying with her until shes out of the etheryou did give her rather a wallop he added looking under the womans eyelids i can deliver the damariscotta woman when shes ready i didnt realize you didnt like the whole business larch said thats not true homer said can deliver the damariscotta woman id be happy to deliver her but wilbur larch had turned away from the patient and left the operating room nurse angela glanced quickly at homer it was a fairly neutral look certainly not withering or even faintly condemning but it wasnt sympathetic either or even friendly thought homer wells she went after dr larch leaving homer with the patient making her way out of the ether homer looked at the spotting on the pad he felt the womans hand graze his wrist as she said groggily ill wait here while you get the car honey in the boys shower room where there were several toilet stalls wilbur larch put cold water on his face and looked for evidence of his tears in the mirror he was no morea veteran of mirrors than melony was and dr larch was surprised by his appearance how long have i been so old he wondered behind him in the mirror he recognized the pile of sodden clothes upon the floor as belonging to curly day curly he asked hed thought he was alone but curly day was crying tooin one of the toilet stalls im having a very bad day curly announced lets talk about it dr larch suggested which coaxed curly out of the stall he was dressed in more or less fresh clothes but larch recognized that the clothes werent curlys they were some of homers old clothes too small for homer now but still much too large for curly day im trying to look nice for the nice couple curly explained i want them to take me take you curly dr larch asked what nice couple you know said curly who believed that dr larch knew everything the beautiful woman the white car the poor child is having visions thought wilbur larch who picked curly up in his arms and sat him down on the edge of the sink where he could observe the boy more closely or are they here to adopt someone else curly asked miserably i think the woman likes copperfieldbut he cant even talk no ones adopting anyone today curly dr larch said i dont have any appointments today maybe theyve just come to look curly suggested theyre just gonna take the best of us it doesnt work like that curly dr larch said alarmed does the child think i run a pet shop larch wondered does he think i let people come here and browse i dont know how anything works curly said and he started to cry again wilbur larch with his fresh memory of how old he looked to himself in the mirror thought for a moment that his job was too much for him he felt himself slipping he felt himself wishing that someone would adopt himwould just take him away he held curly days wet face against his chest he shut his eyes and saw those spots he saw most regularly when he inhaled the ether only those spots quite harshly reminded him of the spotting he was familiar with from his many viewings of the sterile vulval pads he looked at curly day and wondered if curly ever would be adopted or if curly was in danger of becoming another homer wells nurse angela paused by the door to the boys shower room she listened to dr larch comforting curly day she was more worried about dr larch than she was worried about curly a kind of stubborn goading had developed between dr larch and homer wells that nurse angela had never expected to see existing between two people who so clearly loved and needed each other it distressed her that she was powerless to intervene she heard nurse edna calling her and was grateful for the interruption she decided it would be easier to talk to homer than to dr larch shed not decided what should be said to either of them homer watched the second abortion patient emerge from the ether he moved her from the operating table to a portable bed he put up the safety rails on the bed in case the woman was groggy he looked in another room and saw that the first abortion patient was already sitting up but he decided both women would rather be alone for a moment and so he left the second patient in the operating room it wasnt time to deliver the damariscotta woman anyway he was sure the tiny hospital felt especially cramped and overcrowded to him and he longed for a room of his own but first he knew he had to apologize for hurting dr larchs feelings it had all just slipped out of him and it msde him almost cry to think that he had caused dr larch any suffering he went straight across the hall to the dispensary where he could see what he thought were dr larchs feet extending off the foot of the dispensary bed the dispensary medicine cabinets blocked the rest of the bed from view he spoke to dr larchs feet which to homers surprise were larger than he remembered them he was also surprised that dr larcha neat manhad left his shoes on and that his shoes were muddy doctor larch homer said im sorry when there was no response homer thought crossly to himself that dr larch was under an unusually illtimed ether sedation im sorry and i love you homer added a little louder he held his breath listening for larchs breathing which he couldnt hear alarmed he stepped around the cabinets and saw the lifeless stationm aster stretched out on larchs bed it did not occur to homer that this had been the first time someone had said i love you to the stationmaster thered been no better place to put him nurse edna and nurse angela had moved him out of the operating room it would have been cruel to expect one of the abortion patients to tolerate his presence or to put him alongside the expectant mother and certainly it would have been upsetting to the orphans if the stationmaster had been stretched out on one of the dormitory beds goddamn it homer said whats that larch asked he was carrying curly day and calling to homer from the dispensary door nothing homer wells said nevermind curlys been having a very bad day dr larch explained thats too bad curly homer said someones come here to adopt someone curly said theyre sort of shopping i dont think so curly dr larch said tell them im the best one okay homer curly asked right said homer wells youre the best wilbur nurse edna was calling she and nurse angela were chattering at the hospital entrance door they traipsed out to see what was going on the doctor his unwilling apprentice and the nexttooldest orphan in the boys division there was a small but busy crowd around the cadillac the trunk was open and the handsome young man was dispensing presents to the orphans sorry its not the season for apples kids wally was saying or cider you could all use a little cider he said cheerfully handing out the jars of honey the crabapple and applecider jelly the eager dirty hands were grabbing mary agnes cork the nexttooldest orphan in the girls division was getting more than her share melony had taught her how to dominate the front of a line mary agnes was a popular name with mrs grogan and cork was the county in ireland where mrs grogan had been born thered been a number of little corks in the girls division theres plenty to go around wally said optimistically as mary agnes put two honeys and one crabapple down her blousethen reached for more a boy named smoky fields had opened his jar of applecider jelly and was eating it out of the jar with his hand its really good on toast in the morning wally said cautiously but smoky fields stared at wally as if toast was not a regular item on his diet or reliably available in the morning smoky fields intended to finish the jar of jelly on the spot mary agnes spied a hornrim barrette on the convertibles back seatit was one that candy had put aside mary agnes turned to face candy then dropped a second jar of the crabapple jelly at candys feet oops candy said bending to pick up the jelly for her while mary agnes stole the barrettelittle john walsh observing her deft moves admiringly a trace of blood or maybe rust on mary agness bare shin caught candys eye and made her feel queasy she needed to restrain herself from wetting her finger and trying to rub the streak away when she stood up and handed the girl her jar of jelly candy felt a little dizzy some grownups were coming out of the hospital entrance and their presence helped candy compose herself ive not come here to play with children she thought im doctor larch the old man was saying to wally who seemed transfixed by the determination with which smoky fields was devouring the jarful of applecider jelly wally worthington wally said pumping dr larchs hand handing him a jar of ira titcombs honey fresh from ocean view orchards thats in hearts rock but were very near the coastwere in hearts haven almost hearts haven said wilbur larch examining the honey a sea breeze seemed to spring off the boyas distinctive larch thought as fresh crisp hundreddollar bills whose face was on a hundreddollar bill larch tried to imagine tell her curly day said to homer wells pointing to candy but there was no need to point homer wells had seen her and only her from the moment he emerged from the hospital entrance young copperfield clung to her leg but this didnt seem to impede her gracefulness and nothing could interfere with her radiance tell her im the best one curly said to homer hello candy said to homer because he was the tallest person present he was as tall as wally im candy kendall she said to him i hope were not interrupting anything you are interrupting two abortions one birth one death two autopsies and an argument thought homer wells but all he said was hes the best one too mechanically thought curly day he lacks conviction me curly said stepping between them he means me im the best candy bent over curly and ruffled his sticky hair of course you are she said brightly and straightening up she said to homer and do you work here or are you one of was it polite to say them she wondered not exactly homer mumbled thinking i work here inexactly and i am inexactly one of them his names homer wells curly told candy since homer had failed to introduce himself hes too old to adopt i can see that candy said feelingshy i should be talking to the doctor she thought awkwardly she was irritated with wally for creating such a crowd im in the apple business wally was saying to dr larch its my fathers business actually he added my mothers business what does this fool want thought wilbur larch oh i love apples nurse edna said i would have brought lots of apples wally said but its the wrong time of year you should have your own apples he indicated the barren hillside stretching behind them look at that hill he said its washing away you ought to plant it i could even get you the trees in six or seven years youd have your own apples youd have apples for more than a hundred years what do i want with a hundred years of apples thought wilbur larch wouldnt that be pretty wilbur nurse edna asked and you could get your own cider press wally suggested give the kids fresh apples and fresh cidertheyd have lots to do they dont need things to do thought dr larch they need pi aces to go theyre from some charity thought nurse angela cautiously she put her lips close to dr larchs ear and whispered a sizable donation just so dr larch wouldnt be rude to them theyre too young to give their money away thought wilbur larch bees wally was saying you should keep bees too fascinating for the kids and a lot safer than most people think have your own honey and give the kids an educationbees are a model society a lesson in teamwork oh shut up wally candy was thinking although she understood why he couldnt stop babbling he was unused to an environment he couldnt instantly brighten he was unused to a place so despairing that it ins isted on silence he was unused to absorbing a shock to simply taking it in wallys talkamileaminute style was a goodhearted effort he believed in improving the worldlie had to fix everything to make everything better dr larch looked around at the children stuffing themselves with honey and jelly have they come here to play with the orphans for a day and to make everyone sick he wondered he should have looked at candy then he would have known why they were there he was not good at looking in womens eyes wilbur larch he had seen too much of them under the harsh lights nurse angela at times wondered if dr larch even knew how he tended to overlook women she wondered if this was an occupational hazard among obstetricians or if men with a tendency to overlook women were drawn to the obstetrical field homer wells did not overlook women he looked right into their eyes which might have been why nurse angela thought he seemed to find their position in the stirrups so troubling funny she thought how he has seen everything that dr larch does yet he will not watch me or nurse edna shave anyone he was so ada mant in arguing with dr larch about shaving the women for abortions it wasnt necessary homer always said and the women surely didnt like to be shaved like it dr larch would say am i in the entertainment business candy felt helpless no one seemed to understand why she was standing there children were colliding with her at hip level and this awkward darkly handsome young man who was surely her own age but seemed somehow olderwas she supposed to tell him why shed come to st clouds couldnt anyone tell just by looking at her then homer wells looked at her in that way their eyes met candy thought that he had seen her many times before that hed watched her grow up had seen her naked had even observed the act responsible for the particular trouble she was now presenting for cure it was shattering to homer to recognize in the expression of the beautiful stranger he had fallen in love with something as familiar and pitiable as another unwanted pregnancy i think youd be more comfortable inside he murmured to her yes thank you candy said not able to look in his eyes now larch seeing the girl walk toward the hospital entrancerecognizing that deliberate way of walking that predictably happens to someone whos watching her own feetthought suddenly oh its just another abortion thats all this is about he turned to follow the girl and homer just as smoky fields finished the jar of jelly and began to eat a jar of honey smoky ate with no apparent satisfaction but he ate so methodically that even when he was jostled by a nearby orphan he never took his eyes from his little paw as it scooped its way into the jar when he was severely jostled a kind of growl or gurglecaught in his throat and he hunched his shoulders forward as if to protect the jar from other predators homer led the way to nurse angelas office at the threshold he saw the dead babys hands reaching above the edge of the white enamel examining tray which still rested on nurse angelas typewriter the babys hands were still waiting for the ball but homers reflexes were quick enough he turned full circle in the doorway pushing candy back into the hall this is doctor larch homer said to candy introducing them while he herded them down the hall to the dispensary wilbur larch did not remember that there was a dead baby on top of the typewriter in nurse angelas office he said crossly to homer shouldnt we let miss kendall sit down he didnt remember that the dead stationmaster was in the dispensary either and when he saw the morons muddy shoes he pulled homer aside and whispered harshly to him have you no feeling for this poor girl homer whispered back that he thought the partial view of a dead man was preferable to the whole view of a dead baby ohwilbur larch said ill deliver the woman from damariscotta homer added to dr larch still whispering well dont be in too big a hurry larch whispered i mean i wont have anything to do with this one homer whispered back looking at candy i wont even look at her do you understand dr larch regarded the young woman he thought he understood a little she was a very pretty young woman even dr larch could see that and hed not seen homer so agitated in anyones presence before homer fancies hes in love thought dr larch or he fancies that hed like to be have i been utterly insensitive larch wondered is the boy still enough of a boy to need to romanticize women or is he enough of a man to desire to romance women too wally was introducing himself to homer wells wilbur larch thought heres the one with apples for brains why is he whispering it didnt occur to dr larch that wally thought by his partial view of the stationmaster that the stationmaster was asleep if i could have just a moments peace with miss kendall said wilbur larch we can all meet each other another time edna will assist me with miss kendall please and angelawould you help homer with the damariscotta woman homer dr larch explained to wally and to candy is a very accomplished midwife you are wally said to homer enthusiasically wow homer wells maintained silence nurse angela bristling at the word midwifeat the condescension she quite correctly heard in dr larchs tonetouched homers arm very gently and said to him ill give you a count of the contractions nurse edna whose uncritical love for dr larch beamed forth ever brightly cheerfully pointed out that various people had to be moved both from and to various beds if a room was to be made ready for candy please do it then dr larch said if i could just have a moment alone with miss kendall he repeated but he saw that homer seemed riveted homer was unaware that he was staring at candy the boy has gone gaga on me thought wilbur larch and he saw no indication that apple brains intended to leave the dispensary if i could just explain a little of the process to miss kendall wilbur larch said to wally it appeared hopeless to address homer td like her to know about the bleeding laterfor example larch added intending that the word bleeding would have some effect on wallys applebright complexion it didperhaps in combination with the overpowering atmosphere of ether in the dispensary is someone going to cut her he asked homer pathetically homer caught wallys arm and pulled him abruptly away he pulled him so quickly along the hall and got him outdoors so fast that wally almost escaped being sick at all as it was completely owing to homers good reflexes wally didnt throw up until the two of them were behind the boys divisionon the particular hillside wally had suggested planting with apple trees the very hillside where homer wellss shadow had only recently outdistanced dr larchs the two young men walked up and down and across the hill in straight linesrespecting the rows of trees wally was planting in his imagination homer politely explained the procedure that candy would undergo but wally wanted to talk about apple trees this hill is perfect for your standard fortybyforty plot wally said walking forty feet in one direction then making a perfect rightangle turn if shes in the first three months homer noted there really shouldnt be any work with the forceps just the standard dilatationthat means dilating the opening to the uterusand then curettingthats scraping id recommend four rows of mclntosh then cine row of red delicious wally said half of the trees should be macs id mix up the restmaybe ten percent red delicious another ten or fifteen percent cortlands and baldwins youll want a few northern spies and ill throw in some gravensteinstheyre a great apple for pies and you get to pick them early theres no actual cutting homer told wally although there will be some bleedingwe call it spotting actually because its usually not very heavy bleeding doctor larch has a great touch with ether so dont worryshe wont feel a thing of course shell feel something afterward admitted homer its a special sort of cramp doctor larch says that the other discomfort is psychological you could come back to the coast with us wally told homer we could load a truck full of baby trees and in a day or two we could come back here and plant the orchard together it wouldnt take too long its a deal said homer wells the coast he thought i get to see the coast and the girl i get to ride in that car with that girl a midwife gosh wally said i guess youre probably going to be a doctor i dont think so said homer wells i dont know yet well apples are in my family wally said im going to college but i really dont know why i bother college thought homer wells candys father is a lobsterman wally explained but shes going to go to college too lobster thought homer wells the bottom of the sea from the bottom of the hill nurse angela was waving to them damariscotta is ready she called to homer wells i have to go deliver someones baby homer told wally gosh wally said he seemed reluctant to leave the hill i think ill stay up here i dont think i want to hear anything he added he gave homer a likable and confessional smile oh theres not much noise homer said he wasnt thinking of the damariscotta woman he was thinking of candy he thought of the gritty sound the curette made but hed spare his new friend that detail he left wally on the hill and jogged toward nurse angela he looked back at wally once and waved a boy his own age a boy his own size they were the same height although wally was more muscularfrom sports dr larch had guessed he has the body of a hero dr larch thought remembering the heroes he had tried to help in france in world war i lean but well muscled that was a heros bodyand shot full of holes thought wilbur larch he didnt know why wallys body reminded him of this and wallys face wilbur larch was thinking it was handsome in a finer way than homers face which was also handsome although wallys body was stronger his bones were somewhat sharperand more delicate there wasnt a trace of anger in wallys eyes they were the eyes of good intentions the body of a hero and the facethe face of a benefactor concluded wilbur larch brushing aside a blond curl of pubic hair that had not gone directly into the refuse bag but had clung to candys inner thigh near her raised bent knee he exchanged the mediumsized curette for the smaller one noting that the girls eyelids were fluttering noting nurse ednas gentle thumbsmassaging the girls temples and the girls slightly parted lips she had been remarkably relaxed for such a young girl and under ether she was even more composed the beauty in her face larch thought was that she was still free of guilt it surprised larch how candy looked as if she would always be free of it he was aware of nurse edna observing the scrutiny he was giving to the girl and so he bent once more to the view the speculum afforded him and finished his task with the small curette a benefactor thought wilbur larch homer has met his benefactor homer wells was thinking on parallel lines i have met a prince of maine he was thinking i have seen a king of new englandand i am invited to his castle in all his journeys through david cnpperfield at last he understood young davids first vision of steerforth he was a person of great power in my eyes young copperfield observed no veiled future glanced upon him in the moonbeams there was no shadowy picture of his footsteps in the garden that i dreamed of walking in all night no veiled future thought homer wells i am going to thecoast push he said to the woman from damariscotta is damariscotta on the coast he asked the woman whose neck was taut with strainingwho held nurse angelas hand in a whiteknuckled grip near it the woman cried and shoved her child forth into st cloudsits slick head captured perfectly in the palm of homers confident right hand he slipped the heel of his hand under the babys fragile neck his left hand lifted the babys bottom as he guided the baby outdoors as dr larch would say it was a boy steerforth homer wells would name this onehis second solo delivery homer cut the cord and smiled to hear young steerforths healthy bawling candy coming out of ether heard the babys cries and shuddered if dr larch had seen her face at that moment he might have detected some guilt upon it boy or girl she asked her speech slurred only nurse edna heard her why is it crying candy asked it was nothing dear nurse edna said its all over i would like to have a baby one day candy said i really would why of course dear nurse edna told her you can have as many as you want im sure youd have very beautiful children youd have princes of maine dr larch told candy suddenly youd have kings of new england why the old goat nurse edna thoughthes flirting her love for larch felt momentarily ruffled what a strange idea candy thoughti cant see what they would look like her mind drifted for a while why is the baby crying she wondered wilbur larch cleaning up noticed another curly clump of her pubic hair it was the same tawny tone of candys skin which was doubtlessly why nurse edna had missed it he listened to the cries of the damariscotta womans baby and thought that he mustnt be selfish he must encourage homer to make friends with this young couple he stole a look at the dozing girl opportunity shone from her like light and people will always eat apples he thoughtit must be a nice life the apple enameled on the cadillacs doorand monogrammed in goldwas of special interest to melony who managed to prod herself into action she tried to steal the apple on the door before she realized it wouldnt come off mary agness arrival at the girls division with her scrawny arms hoarding jars of jelly and honeyhad prompted melony to go see foi herself what was going on she thought sourly hov it was typical how nothing had been left for hernot even a glimpse of the beautiful people she wouldnt have minded another look at them there was nothing worth stealing she could see at a glancejust an old hook it was fate she would think later that the title of he book and the name of its author were visible to her the book appeared discarded on the cars floor little dorrit meant nothing to melony but charles dickens was a name she recognizedhe was a kind of hero to homer wells without thinking that this was her lifes first unselfish act she stole the bookfor homer at the time she wasnt even thinking how it might impress him how it might gain for her some favorable light in his eyes she thought only generously oh look a present for sunshine it meant more to her than she could ever admit to herself that homer had promised never to leave st clouds without her then she saw wally he was walking toward the cadillac in the direction of the hospital entrance but he kept turning around to look at the hill in his mind he saw the orchard at harvest timethe long ladders were in the trees the pickers were the orphans themselves the bushel crates were stacked in the rows between the trees in one row a tractor towed a flatbed trailer already heavy with apples it looked like a good crop where will they get a tractor wally wondered he tripped caught his balance looked where he was walking toward the abandoned cadillac melony was gone shed lost her nerve the thought of confronting that handsome young man aloneshe wasnt sure if she could have tolerated his indifference if hed been clearly appalled by her appearance that wouldnt have bothered melony she rather enjoyed her ability to shock people but she could not bear the thought that he might not even notice her and if hed handed her a jar of honey shed have cracked his skull with it nobody honeys me she thoughtlittle dorrit slipped inside her shirt against her thudding heart she crossed the road between the boys and girls divisions just as the stationmasters assistant was climbing the same road toward the hospital at first she didnt recognize himhe was so dressed up to melony he was just a simpleton in overalls a busybody who tried to fashion for himself an air of selfimportance out of what melony imagined was the worlds stupidest job watching for trains to arrive and then watching them leave the loneliness of the railroad station depressed melony she avoided the place you went there for one thing to leave but to stand there all day imagining leaving could there be anything sadder or more stupid than that and now here was this oaf still wearing his yearlong effort to grow a moustache but dressed to kill well no melony realized hes dressed for a funeral that was it the plain but ambitious boy had been impressed by the white cadillac hed conceived that the stationmasters job was his for the taking if he exhibited a proper and adult solemnity regarding the stationmasters passing he was terrified of dr larch and the idea of pregnant women made him feel furtive but he had imagined that paying his respects at the orphanage where the stationmasters body reposed was a grueling but necessary rite of passage the spitup smell he associated with babies made him nauseous too an unusual bravery had guided him to the orphanage giving his silly young face an almost adult countenanceexcept for the silky smudge that marred his upper lip and made all his efforts at manhood ridiculous he had also burdened himself for the uphill climb by carrying all the catalogues the stationmaster wouldnt be needing them now and his assistant imagined that he could ingratiate himself to dr larch by bringing the catalogues as a presenta kind of peace offering he had not bothered to consider what use wilbur larch would have for seeds and lingerie or how the old doctor would respond to declarations regarding the peril of soulshis own and many restless others the two orphans the stationmasters assistant most despised were homer and melony homer because his serenity gave him a confident adult appearance that the assistant felt powerless to achieve and melony because she mocked him now to make a bad day worse here was melonyblocking his way whats that on your lip a fungus melony asked him maybe you should wash it she was bigger than the stationmasters assistant especially now that she stood uphill from him he tried to ignore her ive come to view the body he said with dignityhad he any sense he should have known these words were ill chosen for presentation to melony wanna view my body she asked him im not kidding she added when she saw how lost he was and frightened melony had an instinct for pressing any advantage but she relented when her adversary was too easy she saw that the stationmasters assistant would go on standing in the road until he dropped from fatigue and so she stepped aside for him and said i was kidding he stumbled ahead blushing and had almost turned the corner by the boys division when she called after him youd have to shave before id let you he staggered slightly causing melony to marvel at her power then he turned the corner and felt himself uplifted by the gleaming cadillacby what he mistook for the white hearse if at that moment a choir had erupted into heavenly voice the assistant would have fallen to his knees the catalogues spilling around him the same light that blessed the cadillac seemed to shine fo rth from the blond hair of the powerfullooking young man the driver of the hearse now there was a responsibility that awed the stationmasters assistant he approached wally carefully wally was leaning on the cadillac smoking a cigarette and intently visualizing an apple orchard in st clouds the stationmasters assistant who looked like a morticians ghoulish lackey surprised wally ive come to view the body the assistant said the body wally said what body a fear of embarrassing himself almost paralyzed the stationmasters assistant the world he imagined was brimming with etiquette beyond his grasp obviously it had been tactless to mention the body of the deceased to the very man who was responsible for safely driving the dead away a thousand pardons the assistant blurted it had been something hed read a thousand what wally said growing alarmed how thoughtless of me said the stationmasters assistant bowing unctuously and sliding toward the hospital entrance has someone died wally asked anxiously but the assistant managed to slip inside the hospital entrance where he quickly hid himself in a corner of the wall and wondered what to do next clearly hed upset the highstrung and finetuned feelings of the hearse driver this is a delicate business the assistant thought trying to calm himself what mistake will i make next he cowered in the corner of the hall where he could smell ether wafting from the nearby dispensary he had no idea that the body he wished to view was less than fifteen feet from him he thought he could smell babies toohe heard one bawling he thought that babies were born while women had their legs straight up the soles of their feet facing the ceiling this vision pinned him to the corner of the hall i smell blood he imagined struggling to control his panic he clung to the wall like so much plaster so much so that wally failed to notice him when he came in the hospital entrance worried about who had died wally entered the dispensary as if drawn to the etheralthough he quickly felt his nausea returning he apologized to the feet of the stationmaster oh excuse me wally whispered reeling back into the hall he heard nurse angela talking to candy who was already able to sit up wally barged in on them but the look of relief on his faceto see that candy was not the person rumored to be deadwas so touching to nurse angela that she wasnt even cross with him for intruding please come in she said to wally in her best hospital voice which was firstperson plural were feeling much better now nurse angela said were not quite ready to jump around but were sitting up nicely arent we she asked candy who smiled candy was so clearly glad to see wally that nurse angela felt she should leave them alone st clouds did not have a great and tender history regarding the presence of couples in that operating room and nurse angela was both surprised and happy to see a man and a woman who loved each other i can clean up later she thoughtor ill ask homer to do it homer and dr larch were talking nurse edna had taken the damariscotta woman back to her beet in the maternity ward and dr larch was examining the baby homer wells had deliveredyoung steerforth ai name larch had already criticized there was some villainy in the character of steerforthor had homer forgotten that partand there was also a death by drowning it was more of a brand than a name in dr larchs opinion but they werent talking anymore about steerforth wally said it would take just a couple of days homer wells was saying well have to load a truck i guess theres going to be forty trees and id like to see the coast of course you should go homerits a great opportunity dr larch said he poked steerforth in the belly with a finger then he tempted steerforth into gripping one of his other fingers then he shone a little light in steerforths eyes id be gone just two days homer wells said wilbur larch shook his head at first homer thought there was something wrong with steerforth maybe just two days homer dr larch said you should be prepared to take advantage of the situation you should not let an opportunity pass you byin just two days homer stared at dr larch but larch was peering into steerforths ears if this young couple likes you homer and if you like themwell larch said i think youll be meeting their parents too and if their parents like youwell said dr larch i think you should try to make their parents like you he would not look at homer who was staring at him dr larch examined the tied end of the umbilical while steerforth cried and cried i think we both know it would do you good to get away for more than two days homer dr larch said you understand im not talking about an adoption im talking about the possibility of a summer jobfor a start someone might offer you the means to stay away for more than two daysthats all im sayingif thats an attractive prospect dr larch looked at homer they stared at each other right homer finally said of course you might want to come back in two days larch said heartilybut they looked away from each other as they chose to look away from the likelihood of that in which case larch said washing his hands you know youre always welcome here he left the room and homer with the babytoo quickly again for homer to say how much he loved him the cowering stationmasters assistant watched wilbur larch take nurse angela and nurse edna into the dispensary perhaps despite the stationmasters presence the etherized atmosphere of the dispensary was comforting to wilbur larch and helped him say to his loyal nurses what he needed to say i want to pool our resources said wilbur larch i want the boy to have as much money as we can scrounge together and whatever there is in the way of clothing that looks halfway decent just for two days wilbur nurse edna asked how much money does the boy need for two days nurse angela asked its an opportunity for him dont you see dr larch asked i dont think hell be back here in two days i hope he doesnt come backat least not that soon said wilbur larch whose breaking heart reminded him of what hed forgotten the story of homers weak heart how could he tell him where and when he crossed the hall to see how candy was coming along he knew that she and wally wanted to leave as soon as possible they had a long drive ahead of them and if homer wells is leaving me thought wilbur larch hed better leave me in a hurryalthough twenty years dr larch knew wasnt what most would have called a hurried departure homer had to leave in a hurry now because dr larch needed to see if he would ever get over it i dont think so he thought he checked the spotting on the sterile vulval padwhile wally looked at the ceiling at his hands at the floor youre doing just fine dr larch told candy he was about to tell her that homer could advise her about any cramps she suffered and that homer could also check her for spotting but he wanted to leave homer free of that responsibility also dr larch couldnt at the moment have said homers name theyre taking you curly day asked homer when curly saw homer packing im not being adopted curly said homer wells ill be back in just two days theyre taking you said curly day his face looked so stricken homer had to turn away dr larch was an amateur historian but he nonetheless understood the power of information that is received indirectly for that reason he told candy and wally about homers weak heart it was not only easier for dr larch than lying to homer in the long run larch suspected the story would be more convincing ive never let him go beforenot even for just two dayswithout saying just a little about his condition dr larch told candy and wally a wonderful word condition the effect of the word in a doctors mouth is truly astonishing candy seemed to forget shed just had an abortion the color came back to wallys face its his heart said wilbur larch ive not told him about it because i havent wanted to worry him its the sort of condition that could be made worse by his worrying about it dr larch confided to these two goodhearted innocents who gave him their rapt attention just so hes not exposed to anything too strenuous or to anything too violent in the way of exerciseor to anything too shocking said wilbur larch who had created a perfect history for someone who simply needed to be carefulwho needed to stay out of danger larch had given his favorite orphan a history that he hoped would keep him safe he was aware that it was a history a father would construct for his sonif a father could make his son believe it homer wells at the moment couldnt construct a history or anything else that would be soothing to curly day who buried himself under several pillows and a blanket and sobbed what do you need to be adopted for curly cried youre practically a doctor its just for two days homer wells repeated with each repetition his promise sounded less and less likely theyre taking you i cant believe it cried curly day nurse angela came and sat beside homer on curlys bed together they regarded the sobbing mound under the blanket its just for two days curly nurse angela said lamely doctor larch said homer was here to protect us curly cried some protection nurse angela whispered to homer that if hed go clean up the operating table shed sit with curly until he felt better shed not wanted to clean up the table while the nice young couple needed to be alone your friends seemed to be having a nice moment together nurse angela whispered to homer wells my friends he thought is it possible im going to be having friends youre not the best one homer curly cried under the blanket right homer said he tried to pat curly but curly stiffened and held his breath ill see you curly homer said traitor cried curly day curly seemed to recognize nurse angelas touch his rigid body relaxed and he gave himself over to a steady sobbing nurse edna had finally stopped young steerforth from crying or she had simply outlasted the baby who was now washed and dressed and almost asleep in nurse ednas arms he had taken enough of the formula to satisfy nurse edna and so she put him in his bed and finished cleaning the room where hed been delivered as soon as shed put a fresh sheet on the tableshe was just wiping the gleaming stirrupsdr larch lurched into the room with the stationmasters stiff body a somewhat pliable plank over his shoulder wilbur nurse edna said critically you should let homer help you with that its time to get used to not having homer around dr larch said curtly dropping the stationmasters body on the table oh dear nurse edna thought were in for a ferocious time of it i dont suppose youve seen the sternum shears dr larch asked her the snips she asked theyre call shears he said if youd just undress himill ask homer homer knocked before he entered the operating room where candy had dressed herself with wallys fumbling help and now stood leaning against him in what struck homer as an oddly formal poseas if the couple had just finished a dance competition and were awaiting the judges applause you can relax now said homer wells not quite able to look at candys face maybe youd like some fresh air i wont be long i have to clean the table as an awkward second thought he added to candy youre feeling all right arent you oh yes she said her eyes passing over homer very quickly she smiled reassuringly at wally that was when dr larch came in and asked homer if he knew where the sternum shears were theyre with clara homer admitted im sorry he added quickly i had them there because i thought i might need them for the autopsy on the fetus he added you dont use sternum shears on a fetus dr larch said i knowi used the scissors said homer wells who was aware that the words fetus and autopsy fell like drops of blood on wally and candy ill go get the shears for you homer said to dr larch no finish what youre doing here larch said you two should get some fresh air he said to wally and candy who took his suggestion for a commandwhich it was they left the operating room on their way down the hall to the hospital entrance they would have spotted the stationmasters assistant lurking in his corner had the assistant not been so unnerved by the sight of dr larch carrying the stationmasters body out of the dispensary that he had cautiously attempted to follow this troubling vision in his fear he made a wrong turn and found himself in the dispensary he was staring at the mud on the sheet at the foot of the bed when wally led candy outdoors if youre so sure it was his heart homer wells was asking dr larch why are you in such a hurry to do the autopsy i like to keep busy larch said surprised by the barely restrained anger in his own voice he might have told homer then that he loved him very much and that he needed something very active to occupy himself at this moment of homers departure he might have confessed to honner wells that he wanted very much to lie down on his own bed in the dispensary and administer a little ether to himself but that he couldnt very well have done that while the stationmaster had occupied his bed he wanted to take homer wells in his arms and hug him and kiss him but he could only hope that homeir understood how much dr larchs selfesteem was dependent on his selfcontrol and so he said nothing he left homer alone in the operating room while he went to find the sternum shears homer scrubbed the table with disinfectant he had sealed the refuse bag when he noticed the almost transparent blondness of the clump of pubic hair that clung to his pantlega tight clean curl of candys especially fine hair was caught on his knee he held it up to the light then put it in his pocket nurse edna was crying as she undressed the stationmaster dr larch had told her and nurse angela that there would be no hoopla of heartfelt wellwishing upon the departure of homer wellsnothing that would lead candy and wally to suspect that homer wells was even considering he might be gone more than two days nothing dr larch had said no hugs no kisses thought nurse edna weeping her tears had no influence on the expression of the stationmaster whose face remained seized by fear nurse edna completely ignored the stationmaster she devoted herself to her misery at being forbidden to gush over saying goodbye to homer wells we will all appear casual about his leaving dr larch had said period casual nurse edna thought the stationmaster was down to his socks when dr larch walked in with the sternum shears there will be no crying he said sternly to her do you want to give everything away she yanked off the stationmasters socks and threw them at dr larch then she left him alone with the body homer wells gave the operating table a thorough inspection a final examinationa last look he transferred the cluster of candys pubic hair from his pocket to his wallet he once more counted the money dr larch had given him there was almost fifty dollars he went back to the boys sleeping room nurse angela still sat on the edge of the bed where curly day was still sobbing she kissed homer without altering the motion of her hand which was rubbing curly days back through the blanket homer kissed her and left her without a word i cant believe they took him murmured curly day through his tears hell be back whispered nurse angela soothingly our homer she thoughti know hell be back doesnt he know where he belong nurse edna attempting to compose herself stepped into the dispensary where she encountered the trembling stationmasters assistant may i help you nurse edna asked pulling herself together ive come to view the body mumbled the assistant from across the hall nurse edna heard the familiar crack of the sternum shears splitting the stationmasters chest she doubted that the assistant would care to view the body in its present state what she said to the assistant was doctor larch isnt finished with the autopsy i brought some catalogues for doctor larch the assistant said handing the mess to nurse edna why thank you she said but the young goon in his funeral finery showed no signs of leaving perhaps the ether in the dispensary air was unraveling him would you like to wait nurse edna asked him he stared at her to view the body she reminded him you could wait in nurse angelas office he nodded gratefully as nurse edna pointed the way down the hall the last door on your right she told him just make yourself comfortable unburdened of the stationmasters catalogues the assistant had a lighter more relaxed step as he aimed himself toward nurse angelas office he was pleased to see there was a choice of chairs to sit in naturally he would not choose the desk chair behind the typewriter but there were two lower more comfortablelooking chairs positioned in front of the desk and the typewriter they were the chairs that the prospective foster parents sat in when they were being interviewed they were unmatched paisley easy chairs and the stationmasters assistant chose the lower more overstuffed one he regretted his decision as soon as he felt how very low the chair was everything in the cluttered office seemed to loom over him if dr larch had been sitting at the desk at the typewriter he would have towered over the assistant in his lowsunk chair the assistant saw a white enamel sort of pan or tray upon the typewriter but he was seated so very low that he couldnt view the pans contents two tiny hands reached above the edge of the examining tray but only the fingertips of the dead baby from three mile falls were visible to the stationmasters assistant he h ad never seen a fetus before or even a newborn baby he was unprepared for how small the fingers can be he kept looking around the room from his sunken and glowingly uncomfortable position but his eyes kept coming back to the fingertips sticking above the rim of the examining tray he couldnt believe he was really looking at fingers whatever that is it looks like fingers he thought gradually he stopped looking at other things in the room he stared at the fingertips a part of his mind said get up and see what that is another part of his mind made his body feel sunken into the easy chair and held down there by a great weight it cant be fingers he thought he kept staring he kept sitting nurse edna wanted to tell dr larch that he should for once let his feelings speak for himthat he should tell homer wells what he feltbut she stood quietly listening at the operating room door the stationmasters chest cracked a few more times this didnt discomfort hernurse edna was a professionaland she could tell by the precision of the snaps she heard that dr larch had chosen to occupy his emotions with a task its his decision she told herself she went outside to see how that nice young couple were doing the young man was doing whatever young men do while peering under the hoods of cars and the girl was resting semireclined in the cadillacs spacious back seat the convertible top was still down nurse edna bent over candy and whispered to her youre as pretty as a picture candy smiled warmly nurse edna could see how exhausted the girl was listen dear nurse edna said to her dont be shyif youre worried about your spotting nurse edna said to her confidentially or if you have any peculiar cramps speak to homer about it promise me you wont be shy about it dear and most certainly if you run a feverpromise me nurse edna said i promise candy said blushing melony was struggling to inscribe the copy of littledorrit she had stolen for homer when she heard mary agnes cork throwing up in the bathroom shut up melony called but mary agnes went on retching shed eaten two jars of applecider jelly one jar of honey and another of crabapple jelly she thought it was the honey that did it smoky fields had already thrown up hed eaten all his jars of everything and a jar belonging to one of the little walshes he lay miserably in his bed listening to curly day crying and nurse angela talking on and on to homer sunshine wells for the promise you made me melony wrote she glanced out her window but there was nothing going on it wasnt dark it wasnt time for the two women shed watched arrive in the morning to be heading downhill for their return trainto wherever love melony melony added as mary agnes groaned and heaved again you dumb little bitch pig melony called homer wells walked into the operating room when wilbur larch had successfully exposed the stationmasters heart larch was not surprised to see no evidence of heart disease no deadmuscle tissue no infarction he said to homer without looking up at himin short no damage to the heart of any kind the stationmaster had a healthy heart dr larch announced to homer wells no massive heart attack had dropped the stationmaster as larch had suspected it appeared there had been a very sudden change in the hearts rhythm arrhythmia i think dr larch said to homer wells his heart just stopped right homer asked i think that he suffered some shock or fright said wilbur larch homer wells could believe thatjust by looking at the stationmasters face right he said of course there could be a clot in the brain said wilbur larch where should i look he asked homer familiarly the brain stemsaid homer wells right wilbur larch said good boy when homer wells saw the stationmasters brain stem exposed he felt that dr larch was busy enoughwith both handsfor it to be safe to say what homer wanted to say i love you said homer wells he knew he had to leave the room thenwhile he could still see the doorj and so he started to leave i love you too homer said wilbur larch who for another minute or more could not have seen a blood clot in the brain stem if there had been one to see he heard homer say right before he heard the door close in a while he could make out the brain stem clearly there was no clot arrhythmia wilbur larch repeated to himself then he added right as if he were now speaking for homer wells dr larch put his instruments aside he gripped the operating table for a long time outside homer wells stuck his bag in the cadillacs trunk smiled at candy in the back seat helped wally raise the convertibles top it would be dark soon and especially cold for candy in the back seat if they left the top down see you in two days nurse edna said to homer too loudly two days homer repeated too quietly she pecked his cheek he patted her arm nurse edna then turned and trotted to the hospital entrance both candy and wally appeared impressed that the woman could move so quickly when she was inside the hospital nurse edna went directly to the dispensary and threw herself on the bed if she had a soft heart she had a strong stomach it hardly mattered to her that the stationmasters body had spent much of the day on that bed or that the mud from his boots had soiled the top sheet dr larch was still gripping the operating table when he heard the stationmasters assistant scream there was just one scream followed by a prolonged series of whimpers homer and candy and wally never heard the scream wally had already started the car the assistant had waited the longest time before forcing himself out of the deep low chair he had not wanted to look more closely at the contents of the white enameled examining tray but the little fingers had beckoned to him and he had felt himself drawn to the tray where a full and closeup view of the openedup fetus had caused him like curly day to wet his pants he screamed when he discovered that his legs wouldnt move the only way he could manage to leave nurse angelas office was on all fours he went whimpering down the hall like a beaten dog dr larch blocked his way at the operating room door what is the matter with you larch asked the assistant scathingly i brought you all his catalogues the stationmasters assistant managed to say while still on all fours catalogues said larch with evident distaste stand up man whats wrong with you he seized the quaking assistant under his armpits and drew him trembling to his feet i just wanted to view the body the assistant protested weakly wilbur larch shrugged what is this fascination the world has with death he wondered but he stepped aside ushering the assistant into the operating room where the stationmaster with his heart and his brain stem very well exposed was instantly in view a sudden change in the hearts rhythm wilbuir larch explained something frightened him to death it was not hard for the assistant to imagine being frightened to death although he thought that the stationmaster appeared to have been run over by a trainor else had fallen victim to the same evil responsible for the hideous baby upon the typewriter thank you the assistant whispered to dr larch then ran so fast down the hall and outdoors that the sound of his footsteps roused nurse edna from her weeping her own crying had prevented her from hearing the assistants screams or his whimpers it seemed to nurse angela that nothing would console curly day and so she attempted to make herself comfortable on his narrow bed believing she was in for a long night dr larch sat in his usual place at the typewriter the fetus displayed by homer wells disturbed him not in the slightest perhaps he appreciated that homer had left something behind that would need attentionbusy work busy work give me busy work thought wilbur larch just before night fell he leaned forward in his chair enough to turn on the desk lamp then he settled back in the chair in which he had spent so many evenings he appeared to be waiting for someone it was not yet dark but he could hear an owl outsidevery distinctly he knew the wild wind from the coast must have dropped when it was still light melony looked out her window and saw the cadillac pass the passenger side of the car faced the girls division and melony had no trouble recognizing homer wells in the passenger seathis profile turned to her he sat rigidly as if he were holding his breath he was if he had seen heror worse if he had needed to speak to her in order to finalize his escapehe knew he couldnt have succeeded in saying to her that he would be back in just two days melony knew what a lie was and what a promise was and she knew the instant that a promise was broken she saw a flash of the beautiful girl with the long legs in the back seat of the car and she supposed that the handsome young man was driving she had a longer better look at the profile of homer wells when she slammed the stolen copy of little dorrit shut the ink was still wet and her inscription was smudged she threw the book against the wall which only mrs grogan heardmary agnes was still violently ill and too much surrounded by her own noise melony put herself straight to bed without her dinner mrs grogan worried about her went to melonys bed and felt her forehead which was feverish but mrs grogan could not coax melony to drink anything all melony said was he broke his promise later she said homer wells has left saint clouds you have a little temperature dear said mrs grogan but when homer wells didnt come to read jane eyre aloud that evening mrs grogan started paying closer attention she allowed melony to read to the girls that evening melonys voice was oddly flat and passionless melonys reading from jane eyre depressed mrs grogan especially when she read this part it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them which if unreturned and unknown must devour the life that feeds it why the girl didnt bat an eye mrs grogan observed nurse angela had hardly any more success reading aloud to the boys division from dickens dicikensian description was too strenuous for hershe got lost in the longer passagesand when she had to keep going back to the beginning she saw that the boys were losing interest nurse edna tried her best with the nightly benediction dr larch refused to leave nurse angelas office he said he was listening to an owl and he wanted to keep listening nurse edna felt extremely selfconscious with the benediction which shed never fully understood in the first placeshe took it to be a kind of private joke between dr larch and the universe her voice was too shrill and startled sick little smoky fields out of sleep and produced a long loud wail from curly daybefore curly returned to his more steady sobbing good night you princes of maine you kings of new england nurse edna peeped where is homer several voices whispered while nurse angela continued to rub curly day between his shoulder blades in the darkness nurse edna extremely agitated by dr larchs behavior got up the nerve to march right down to nurse angelas office she was going to walk right in and tell dr larch that he should go give himself a good snort of ether and then get a good nights sleep but nurse edna grew more timid as she approached the solitary light shining from the office nurse edna hadnt known about the fetal autopsy either and when she rather cautiously peered into nurse angelas office she was given quite a turn by the gruesome fetus dr larch just sat at the typewriter unmoving he was composing in his mind the first of many letters he would write to homer wells he was attempting to gentle his anxieties and calm his thoughts please be healthy please be happy please be careful wilbur larch was thinkingthe darkness edging in around him the supplicant hands of the murdered baby from three mile falls reaching out to him ocean view for the first two weeks that homer wells was gone from st clouds wilbur larch let the mail pile up unanswered nurse angela struggled with the longer and denser sentences of charles dickens which had a curious effect on the boys attention they hung on her every word holding their breath for the errors they anticipated and mrs grogan suffered melonys deadpan rendition of charlotte bronte near the end of chapter twentyseven mrs grogan could detect a bare minimum of jane eyres indomitable spirit in melonys voice i care for myself melony read the more solitary the more friendless the more unsustained i am the more i will respect myself good girl thought mrs grogan please be a good girl she told dr larch that although melonys reading voice depressed her melony should be encouraged she should be given more responsibility nurse angela said shed be glad to give up on dickens dr larch surprised them all when homer wells had been gone for three weeks dr larch announced that he didnt give a damn who read what to whom he had ceased to care about the benediction altogether and so nurse ednaalthough it would never feel quite natural to herpersisted with the nightly salutation to the imagined princes of maine the dear little kings of new england mrs grogan became so firmly transfixed by melonys reading voice that she now accompanied melony to the boys division and listened with the nervous boys to melony read dickens melonys voice was too evenpitched for dickens she plodded her wayshe made no mistakes but she never adjusted her cadence she presented bustle and sunshine with the same heavy speech she used for gloom and fog by her stern countenance mrs grogan saw that melony was analyzing as she readbut the subject of her analysis was not charles dickens melony was searching through dickens for specific characteristics she associated with homer wells sometimes by the intense concentration on melonys face melony seemed close to discovering homers whereabouts in the england of another century dr larch had told melony that homers actual whereabouts were not her business never mind that melony murdered every moment of dickensian wit with her ferocity or that the rich and colorful details of character and place were turned uniformly drab by her voice the girl has no lilt nurse edna complained never mind the boys were terrified of melony and their fears made them pay more attention to her than they had ever paid to homer wells sometimes the interest in the literature isnt in the literaturethe boys division was an audience like any other selfinterest personal memories their secret anxieties crept into their perceptions of what they heard regardless of what charles dickens had done and what melony did to him not feeling completely comfortable with leaving the girls division unattended while she trotted to the boys to hear melony read mrs grogan developed the habit of following the excerpt from jane eyre with a short prayer that clung both lovely and ominous to the pale and stained bedspreads on which the moonlight glowed long after melony and mrs grogan had left the girls to themselves even mary agnes cork was struck silentif not exactly rendered well behavedby mrs grogans prayer if mrs grogan had known that the prayer was english in origin she might not have used it she had heard it on the radio and memorized it and she always spoke it to herself before she allowed herself to sleep the jprayer was written by cardinal newman when melony started reading to the boys mrs grogan made her personal prayer public oh lord she said in the hall light in the open doorway while melony stood restlessly beside her oh lord support us all the day long until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes and the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done then in thy mercy grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest and peace at the last amen melony would saynot quite facetiously but certainly not reverentially she said it the way she read from charlotte bronte and from charles dickens it gave mrs grogan a chill although the summer nights were warm and humid and she needed to take two steps for every one of melonys just to keep pace with melony on her determined journey to the boys division the way melony said amen was the way she said everything hers was a voice without a soul mrs grogan thoughther teeth chattering as she sat in a chair in the boys division slightly out of the light behind melony watching her broad back something in mrs grogans transfixed appearance may have been responsible for the rumor begun in the boys division possibly by curly day that mrs grogan had never gone to school was actually illiterate was incapable of reading even a newspaper to herselfand was therefore in melonys control the little boys lying frightened in their beds felt that they were in melonys control too nurse edna was so disquieted by melonys reading that she couldnt wait to launch into her princes of maine and kings of new england refrain even if she didnt know what it meant nurse edna suggested that melony was to blame for an increase in nightmares in the boys division and that she should be removed from her responsibilities as reader nurse angela disagreed if melony persisted in casting an evil presence it was because shed not been given enough responsibility also nurse angela said maybe there werent more nightmares with homer wells gone it had now been a month perhaps it was simply that nurse edna and nurse angela heard those suffering from night terrorsin the past homer heard them first and tended to them mrs grogan was in favor of increasing melonys responsibilities she felt the girl was at the threshold of a changeshe might either rise above her own bitterness or descend more deeply into it it was nurse angela who suggested to dr larch that melony might be of use of more use you mean dr larch asked right nurse angela said but dr larch didnt appreciate anyone imitating the speech habits of homer wells he gave nurse angela such a look that she never said right again he also didnt appreciate the suggestion that melony could be taught to replace homer not even in usefulness i nurse edna took up melonys cause if she were a boy wilbur nurse edna said you would already have given her more to do the hospital is connected to the boys division larch said its impossible to keep whats happening here a secret from the boys but the girls are another matter he concluded weakly melony knows whats happening here nurse angela said wilbur larch knew he was cornered he was also angry at homer wellshe had given the boy permission to extend his time away from st clouds as long as possible but he hadnt expected he wouldnt hear from homer not a word in nearly six weeks i dont know that i have the patience to work with a teenager anymore larch said peevishly i think melony is twentyfour or twentyfive mrs grogan said i how could someone that old still be in an orphanage larch wondered the same way that i can still be here he answered himself who else would take the job who else would take melony all right lets ask her if shes interested larch said he dreaded the meeting with melony he couldnt help himself but he blamed her for whatever sullenness had crept into homers personalityand the rebellion homer had manifested toward him recently larch knew he was being unfair and this made him feel guilty he began to answer the mail there was a long albeit businesslike letter from olive worthington and a checka rather sizable donation to the orphanage mrs worthington said she was happy her son had been so taken by the good work at st clouds that hed seen fit to bring one of dr larchs boys home with him it was fine with the worthingtons that homer stay through the summer they frequently hired schoolboy help and she was frankly grateful that her son wally had the opportunity to mingle with someone his own agebut of less fortunate circumstances olive worthington wanted larch to know that she and her husband thought homer was a fine boy polite and a good worker and that he seemed altogether a sobering influence on wally she concluded that she hoped wally might even learn the value of a days work from his proximity to homer and that homer had clearly profited from a rigorous educationshe based this judgment on homers ability to learn the apple business as if he were used to more demanding studies olive wanted dr larch to know that homer had requested to be paid in the form of a monthly donation to st clouds minus only what she fairly judged were his expenses since he shared a room with wally and could fit into wallys clothes and since he ate his meals with the worthington family olive said the boys expenses were minimal she was delighted that her son had such manly and honorable company for the summer and she was pleased to have the opportunity to contribute what little she could to the wellbeing of the orphans of st clouds the kids olive said it was how she referred to wally and candy tell me you are doing great things there theyre so happy they stumbled upon you wilbur larch could tell that olive worthington didnt know she had an accomplished obstetrician tending to her apple trees and he grumbled to himself about the rigorous education he felt had been quite wasted on homer wellsgiven his present occupationbut dr larch calmed himself sufficiently to compose a cordial albeit formal letter in response to mrs worthington her donation was very gratefully received and he was glad that homer wells was representing his upbringing at st clouds in so positive a mannerhe would expect no less of the boy which mrs worthington might be so kind as to tell him also that it would be nice if homer would write dr larch was happy that there was such healthy summer employment for homer the boy would be missed at st clouds where he had always been of use but larch emphasized his pleasure at homers good fortune he congratulated olive worthington on the good manners and the generosity of her son he said he would welcome those kids back at st clouds anytime what luckfor everyonethat they had stumbled upon the orphanage wilbur larch gritted his teeth and tried to imagine a harder place to stumble upon than st clouds he managed a supreme effort at concentration and proceeded with the part of the letter he had waited more than a month to write there is one thing i must tell you about homer wells wilbur larch wrote there is a problem with his heart the doctor wrote he elaborated he was more careful than hed been when he discussed homers heart defect with wally and candy he tried to be as precise but as elusive as he knew hed eventually have to be when he described the ailment to homer wells his letter to olive worthington about homers heart was a kind ol warmup exercise he was sowing seeds an infuriating phrase but he found himself thinking itever since his inheritance of the stationmasters catalogues he wanted homer treated with kid gloves as they say in maine olive worthington had mentioned that homer was taking driving lessons from wally and swimming lessons from candythe latter in the haven clubs heated pool the latterswimming lessons from that girl made larch growl and he concluded his cautionary advice about homers heart with the suggestion that homer take it easy with the swimming dr larch did not share olive worthingtons opinion that every boy should know how to drive and swim dr larch could do neither here in st clouds he wrote to himself it is imperative to have good obstetrical procedure and to be able to perform a dilatation and curettage in other parts of the world they learn how to drive and swim he showed olive worthingtons letter to nurse angela and nurse edna who both wept over it they were of the opinion that mrs worthington sounded charming and warm and intelligent but larch grumbled how it was strange that mr worthington was so little in view what was the matter with him whats his wife running the farm for larch asked his nurses who both scolded him for his readiness to assume there was something wrong whenever a woman was in charge of anything they reminded him that he had an appointment with melony melony had been working herself into a proper state of mind for her meeting with dr larch she prepared herself by lying in her bed and reading over and over again the inscription she had written in the stolen copy of little dorrit to homer sunshine wells for the promise you made me love melony then she tried again and again to begin the book through her angry tears the image of the staring blazing sun in marseilles the oppressive glarewas both dazzling and mystifying to melony what experience did she have to help her comprehend a sun of that brightness and the coincidence of so much sunshine considering her nickname for homer wells was too much for her she read got lost began again got lost again she grew angrier and angrier then she looked in her canvas bag of toilet articles and saw that the hornrim barrette which mary agnes had stolen from candyand which melony had snatched out of mary agness hair and taken for herselfhad been stolen again she marched to mary agnes corks bed and retrieved the elegant barrette from under mary agness pillow melonys hair was cropped too short for her to be able to use the barrette which she was not exactly sure how to use anyway she jammed it into her jeans pocket this was uncomfortableher jeans were so tight she went into the girls shower room where mary agnes cork was washing her hair and she turned the hot water up so hot that mary agnes was nearly scalded mary agnes flung herself out of the shower she lay red and writhing on the floor where melony twisted her arm behind her back and then stepped with all her weight on mary agness shoulder melony didnt mean to break anything she was repelled by the sound of mary agness collarbone giving way and she stepped quickly away from the younger girlwhose naked body turned from very red to very white she lay on the shower room floor shivering and moaning not daring to move get dressed and ill take you to the hospital melony said you broke something mary agnes trembled i cant move she whispered i didnt mean to melony said but i told you to keep outta my stuff your hairs too short mary agnes said you cant wear it anyway you want me to break something else melony asked the girl mary agnes tried to shake her head but she stopped i cant move she repeated when melony bent over to help her up mary agnes screamed dont touch me suit yourself melony said leaving her there just keep outta my stuff in the lobby of the girls division on her way to her meeting with dr larch melony told mrs grogan that mary agnes had broken something mrs grogan naturally assumed that melony meant that mary agnes had broken a lamp or a window or even a bed how are you liking the book dear mrs grogan asked melony who always carried little dorrit with her shed not been able to get past the first page it starts kinda slow said melony when she got to nurse angelas office where dr larch was waiting for her she was slightly out of breath and sweating whats the book dr larch asked her little dorrit by charles dickens melony said she felt the barrette bite into her leg when she sat down whered you get it dr larch asked her it was a gift melony saidwhich was not exactly a lie thats nice said wilbur larch melony shrugged it starts kinda slow she said they eyed each other for a moment cautiously larch smiled a little melony tried to smile but she was unsure how this looked on her faceso she stopped she shifted in the chair the barrette in her pocket hurt her a little less hes not coming back is he melony asked dr larch who regarded her with the respect and wariness you feel for someone who has read your mind he has a summer job larch said of course some other opportunity might develop melony shrugged he might go to school i suppose she said oh i hope so larch said i suppose you want him to be a doctor melony said larch shrugged it was his turn to feign indifference if he wants to be he said i broke someones arm once melony said or maybe it was something in the chest the chest larch asked when did you do this not too long ago melony said pretty recently i didnt mean to how did it happen dr larch asked her i twisted her arm behind her backshe was on the floorand then i stepped on her shoulder the same shoulder of the arm i twisted ouch said dr larch i i heard it melony said her arm or her chest perhaps her collarbone larch suggested given the position he guessed it would be the collarbone well whatever it was i heard it melony said how did that make you feel wilbur larch asked melony who shrugged i dont know melony said sick i guess but strong she added sick and strong she said perhaps youd like to have more to do larch asked her here melony asked well here yes larch said i could find more things for you to do heremore important things of course i could also inquire for you about jobsoutside i mean away from here you want me to go or do more chores is that it i dont want you to do anything you dont want to do you told me you didnt want to leave onceand ill never force you its just that i thought you might be looking for a change you dont like how i read huh melony asked is that it no dr larch said i want you to keep reading but thats only one of the things you might do here you want me to do what homer wells did homer did a lot of studying dr larch said perhaps you could assist nurse angela and nurse edna and me perhaps youd be interested in just observingto see if you liked it i think its sick melony said you disapprove larch asked but melony looked genuinely puzzled what she asked you dont believe we should perform the abortions is that it larch asked you dont believe in terminating a birth in aborting the fetus melony shrugged i just think it would make me sick she repeated delivering babiesyuck she said and cutting babies out of peopleyuck again larch was confused but its not that you think its wrong he asked whats wrong about it she asked him i think its sick blood people leaking stuff out of their bodies sick melony said it smells bad around here she added meaning the hospital airthe aura of ether the scent of old blood wilbur larch stared at melony and thought why shes just a big child shes a baby thug i dont want to work around the hospital melony said flatly ill rake leaves or somethingstuff like that is okay if you want me to work more for my food or something i want you to be happier than you are melony dr larch said cautiously he felt miserable for how neglected the creature before him was happier said melony she gave a little jump in her chair and the stolen barrette dug into her you must be stupid or crazy dr larch wasnt shocked he nodded considering the possibilities he heard mrs grogan calling him from the hall outside the dispensary doctor larch doctor larch she called wilbur she added which gave nurse edna a tremor because she felt a certain possessiveness regarding the use of that name mary agnes has broken her arm larch stared at melony who for the first time managed to smile you said this happened not too long ago larch asked her i said pretty recently melony admitted larch went into the dispensary where he examined mary agness collarbone which was broken then he instructed nurse angela to prepare the child for xray i slipped on the shower room floor mary agnes moaned it was real wet melony dr larch called melony was hanging around in the hall melony would you like to observe how we set a broken bone melony walked into the dispensary which was a small crowded areaespecially with nurse edna and mrs grogan standing there and with nurse angela leading mary agnes away for her xray seeing everyone together larch realized how old and frail he and his colleagues looked alongside melony would you like to participate in the setting of a broken bone melony larch asked the sturdy and imposing young woman nope melony said i got things to doshe waved the copy of little dorrit a trifle threateningly and i gotta look at what im gonna read tonight she added she went back to the girls division to her window there while dr larch set mary agness collarbone melony tried again to comprehend the power of the sun in marseilles the very dust was scorched brown she read to herself and something quivered in the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting oh sunshine she thought why didnt you take me anywhere it wouldnt have to have been to france although that would have been nice she daydreamed as she read and therefore she missed the transition between the universal stare of the sun in marseilles and the atmosphere of the prison in the same town suddenly she discovered she was in the prison a prison taint was on everything she read like a well like a vault like a tomb the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside she stopped reading she left little dorrit on her pillow she stripped a pillowcase off a bed neater than her own and into the pillowcase she stuffed her canvas bag of toilet articles and some clothes she also put jane eyre in the bag in mrs grogans rather spartan room melony had no difficulty locating mrs grogans purseshe robbed mrs grogan of her money there wasnt much and also took mrs grogans heavy winter coat in the summer the coat would be useful if she had to sleep on the ground mrs grogan was still at the hospital worrying about mary agnes corks collarbone melony would have liked to say goodbye to mrs grogan even after robbing her but she knew the train schedule by heart actually she knew it by ear the sound of every arrival and departure reached her window at the train station she bought a ticket only as far as livermore falls she knew that even the new and stupid young stationmaster would be able to remember that and he would tell dr larch and mrs grogan that melony had gone to livermore falls she also knew that once she was on the train she could purchase a ticket to some place much farther away than livermore falls can i afford portland she wondered it was the coast that she would need to explore eventuallybecause below the cadillacs gold monogram on that red delicious apple inscribed also in gold against the vivid green background of the apple leaf she had been able to read ocean view orchards that had to be within sight of the coast and the cadillac had a maine license plate it mattered not to melony that there were thousands of miles of coastline in the state of maine as her train pulled away from st clouds melony said to herself so vehemently that her breath fogged the window and obscured the abandoned buildings in that forsaken town from her viewim gonna find you sunshine dr larch tried to comfort mrs grogan who said she wished only that shed had more money for melony to steal and my coats not waterproof mrs grogan complained she should have a real raincoat in this state dr larch tried to reassure mrs grogan he asserted that melony was not a little girl shes twentyfour or twentyfive larch reminded mrs grogan i think her heart is broken said mrs grogan miserably dr larch pointed out that melony had taken jane eyre with her he accepted this as a hopeful sign wherever melony went she would not be without guidance she would not be without love without faith she had a good book with her if only shell keep reading it and reading it larch thought the book that melony had left behind was a puzzle to both mrs grogan and dr larch they read the dedication to homer sunshine wells which touched mrs grogan deeply neither of them had any luck reading little dorrit either mrs grogan never would get to the villainous prison the staring sun in marseilles outstared her it was too powerfully blinding dr larch whoin the absence of homer wells and melonyresumed his responsibilities as the nightly reader to both the boys and the girls divisions attempted to read little dorrii to the girls wasnt the main character a girl but the contrast between the scorched air in the marseilles sun and the tainted air in the marseilles prison created such a powerful sleeplessness among the girls that larch was relieved to give up on the book in chapter three which had an unfortunate title for orphans home he began the description of london on a sunday eveninghounded by church bells melancholy streets in a penitential garb of soot read dr larch and then he stopped we need no more melancholy here he thought wouldnt we rather wait and read jane eyre again dr larch asked the girls nodded eagerly knowing that the beautiful boy with the face of a benefactor must have a mother with the heart for benefiting those who existed in as she had written herself less fortunate circumstances dr larch wrote olive worthington my dear mrs worthington here in st clouds we depend on our few luxuries and imagine and pray they will last forever if you would be so kind please tell homer that his friend melony has left usher whereabouts are unknown and that she took with her our only copy oljane eyre the orphans in the girls division were accustomed to hearing this book read aloudin fact homer used to read to them if homer could discover a replacement copy the little girls and i would remain in his debt in other parts of the world there are bookshops thus larch knew he had accomplished two things olive worthington herself would send him a replacement jane eyre he doubted very much that it would be a secondhand copy and homer would receive the important message melony was out she was loose in the world larch thought that homer should know this that he might want to keep an eye open for her as for little dorrit nurse edna read melonys inscription and wept she was not a big reader edna she penetrated no farther than the inscription nurse angela had already been defeated by dickens she blinked once briefly at the sun in marseilles and failed to turn the page for years candys unread copy would rest in nurse angelas office those nervously awaiting interviews with dr larch would pick up little dorrit as they would pick up a magazinerestlessly inattentively larch rarely kept anyone waiting past the first glare of the sun and most preferred to scan the odd assortment of catalogues the seeds the fishing equipment the stupendous undergarments the latter modeled in an otherworldly way on those headless legless armless stumps that were the periods version of the standard dressmakers dummy in other parts of the world dr larch began oncethey have nursing bras but this thought led him nowhere it fell as a fragment into the many many pages of a brief history of st clouds little dorrit seemed condemned to an unread life even candy who replaced her stolen copy and always wondered what happened to it would never finish the book although it was required reading for her class she too could not navigate past the suns initial assault on her senses she suspected her difficulty with the book arose from its power to remind her of her discomfort on the long journey to and from st cloudsand of what had happened to her there she would especially remember the ride back to the coasthow shed stretched out in the back seat with only the dash lights of the cadillac and the glowing ash end of wallys cigarette shining bright but small in the surrounding darkness the tires of the big car hummed soothingly she was grateful for homers presence because she didnt have to talk toor listen towally she couldnt even hear what wally and homer were saying to each other life stories wally would say to her later that kids had quite a life but i should let him tell you the drone of their conversation was as rhythmic as the tire song butas weary as she wasshe couldnt sleep she thought about how much she was bleeding maybe more than she should be she worried between st clouds and the coast she asked wally three limes to stop the car she kept checking her bleeding and changing the pad dr larch had given her quite a few pads but would there be enough and how much bleeding was too much she looked at the back of homers head if its worse tomorrow or as bad the next day she thought ill have to ask him when wally went to the mens room and left them alone in the car homer spoke to her but he didnt turn around youre probably having cramps about as bad as you get with your period he said youre probably bleeding but not like you bleed during your period nothing near what it is at your heaviest time if the stains on the pad are only two or three inches in diameter thats okay its expected thank you candy whispered the bleeding should taper off tomorrow and get much lighter the next day if youre worried you should ask me he said okay candy said she felt so strange that a boy her own age should know this much about her ive never seen a lobster said homer wells to change the subjectto allow her to be the authority then youve never eaten one either candy said cheerfully i dont know if i want to eat something ive never seen homer said and candy laughed she was laughing when wally got back in the car were talking about lobsters homer explained oh theyre hilarious wally said and all three of them laughed wait till you see one candy said to homer hes never seen one she told wally theyre even funnier when you see them wally said candys laughter hurt her she stopped very suddenly but homer laughed more and wait till they try to talk to you wally added lobsters really break me up every time they try to talk when he and wally stopped laughing homer said tve never seen the ocean you know candy did you hear that wally asked but candy had released herself with her brief laughter she was sound asleep youve never seen the ocean wally asked homer thats right said homer wells thats not funny said wally seriously righthomer said a little later wally said you want to drive for a while i dont know how to drive homer said really wally asked and later stillit was almost midnightwally asked uh have you ever been with a girlmade love to one you know but homer wells had also felt released he had laughed out loud with his new friends the young but veteran insomniac had fallen asleep would wally have been surprised to know that homer hadnt laughed out loud with friends before either and possibly homer would have had difficulty characterizing his relationship with melony as a relationship based on making love what a new sense of security homer had felt in that moment of laughter with friends in the enclosed dark of the moving car and what a sense of freedom the car itself gave to himits seemingly effortless journeying was a wonder to homer wells for whom the idea of motion not to mention the sense of change was accomplished only rarely and only with enormous strife candy wally whispered and a little later he whispered homer he rather liked the idea of steering these two through the blackened world of being their guide through the night and their protector from whatever lay just beyond the headlights reach well buddy wally said to the sleeping homer wells its high time you had some fun wilbur larch almost a month laterstill waiting to hear from homer wells and too proud to write the first letterwondered about the fun homer was having swimming lessons he thought what does one wear for swimming in a heated pool how do they heat the pool and how much do they heat it in the pool at the haven club was the first heated swimming pool in maine although raymond kendall thought it was ridiculous to heat water for purposes other than cooking and bathing he had invented the heating system for the haven club pool it was just an exercise in mechanics for ray if you learn to swim in the ocean ray told homer youll learn the proper response for a body to make to all that water but you dont know how to swim daddy candy said thats what i mean ray said winking at homer wells you set foot in the ocean or fall in youll have enough sense never to set foot in it againits too cold homer liked candys father perhaps because surgery is the mechanics of medicine and homers early training had been surgical he made instant identification with the machinery with which ray kendall worked both the apple farm equipment and the mechanisms for hauling the lobsters and keeping them alive contrary to wallys promise to him regarding the humor of lobsters homer was unamused by his first look at the creatures they crammed the tank in ray kendalls lobster pound crawling over each other their claws pegged shut so that they wielded them underwater like ineffective clubs homer knew he had seen a good reason for learning how to swim if one ever fell in the sea one wouldnt want to fall to the bottom where these creatures lived it was some while before homer learned that the lobsters did not cover the oceans floor in such density as they occupied the tank the first question that leaped to his mind did not concern how a lobster ate or how it multipliedbut why it lived at all theres got to be something that picks up whats lying around ray kendall advised homer its the garbage monster of the oceans floor wally said laughinghe always laughed when he discussed lobsters the sea gull cleans up the shore ray kendall said the lobster cleans up the bottom lobsters and sea gulls candy said they take whats left over wilbur larch might have observed that they were given the orphans share this occurred to homer wells who discovered he could spend time watching lobsters with dread and sea gulls with pleasurewhile watch ing both with awe and respect years later when she became the proud owner of the first tv set in hearts rock olive worthington would say that homer wells was the only person who ever pulled up a chair and sat down in front of the tank in ray kendalls lobster pound as if he were watching the news on television homer pulled lobster pots with candys father on sun daysnot for money but to be out on the water and to be around ray six days a week homer worked with wally in the orchards the ocean was visible from only one of ocean views several orchards but the presence of the sea was felt throughout the farm especially in the early morning fog and when a sea breeze freshened the summer heatand because of the sea gulls who circled inland and occasionally perched in the trees they were more partial to blueberries than to apples but their presence was an irritation to olive who from her early years among the clams had no love for the raucous birds and who fought with the gulls over the small plot of blueberries she was cultivatingthe blueberries were protected with lowhung nets but the gulls and the crows were smart enough to walk under the nets among orphans thought homer wells sea gulls are superior to crowsnot in intelligence or in personality he observed but in the freedom they possess and cherish it was in looking at sea gulls that it first occurred to homer wells that he was free wilbur larch knew that freedom was an orphans most dangerous illusion and when he finally heard from homer he scanned the oddly formal letter which was disappointing in its lack of detail regarding illusions and all the rest there was simply no evidence i am learning to swim wrote homer wells i know i know tell me about it thought wilbur larch i do better at driving homer added mrs worthirigton is very nice i could have guessed that thought wilbur larch she knows everything about apples candys father is very nice too homer wells wrote to dr larch he takes me out on his lobster boat and he is teaching rne how an engine works do you wear a life jacket on the lobster boat wilbur larch wanted to know you think an engine is so special i could teach you how the heart works thought wilbur larchhis own heart teaching him about itself and much more than its function as a muscle candy and wally are wonderful homer wrote i go everywhere with them i sleep in wallys room i wear his clothes its great that were the same size although he is stronger candy and wally are getting married one day and they want to have lots of children tell me about the swimming lessons thought wilbur larch watch out for the swimming lessons poor mr worthingtoneveryone calls him senior homer wrote ahha thought wilbur larch so something isnt perfect is it whats poor about mr worthington he asked nurse angela and nurse edna what they thought of the name senior they agreed it was different it sounds stupid to me said wilbur larch nurse angela and nurse edna told him he wasnt being fair the boy had departed with his blessings more with his encouragement they agreed homer could have written something and sent it sooner than six weeks but they argued that this indicated only how happy he washow busy and how glad to be busy too and what experience did homer wells have with writing letters or with writing of any kind they wanted to know you want him to be a doctor wilbur nurse edna said but its his life do you expect him to be a writer too nurse angela chimed in and never get married nurse edna asked dangerously i expect him to be of use thought wilbur larch tiredly and i want him with me this last wish he knew was unfair in the dispensary he rested from the summer heat all that glass and steel were somehow cooling and the ether fumes evaporated more slowly in the humidity he seemed to be traveling both farther away and for longer in his ether dreams now when he came out of the ether he seemed to come out of it more slowly im getting older he repeated to himself a beautiful and untouched copy of jane eyre arrived from mrs worthington and wilbur larch read more spiritedly to the girlsthe newness of the story refreshed him it even enlivened his weary approach to the sad conclusion to great expectations he never believed the part about pip and estella being happy ever after he never believed that about anyone a pattern of correspondence slowly developed between wilbur larch and homer wells homer would sketch the barest facts of his life in hearts rock and hearts haven he would give dr larch a glimpse like the faroff visibility of the ocean from the one orchard at ocean view where sighting the sea was possible he would send dr larch a page maybe two pages once a i week or every other week to this speck on the horizon dr larch would respond with the full orchestration of the written word questions which would never be answered regarding the specificity that was lacking in homers last letter what precisely is the matter with mr worthington and a flood of details concerning the daily grimness of st clouds as much as dr larch disdained the gossipy instinct of snowy meadows for keeping up with the orphanage dr larch provided homer wells with a virtual alumni newsletter and with a calendar of hospital and social events his letters to homer wells were longer than his longest entries in a brief history of st clouds and they were written and mailed the day following dr larchs receipt of the most minimal scrawl from homer you cant expect the boy to keep up with you wilbur nurse edna advised dr larch you cant expect him to compete with you nurse angela said what the hell is wrong with this senior worthington character dr larch asked homer said it was a drinking problem wilbur nurse edna reminded him what do you want to knowthe brand of hooch nurse angela asked but what wilbur larch expected from his young apprentice was only what he thought he had taught him clinical analysis the exact definition of characteristics associated with light medium or heavy drinking are we talking about a guy who makes a fool out of himself at parties wilbur larch wondered or is this something severe and chronic because homer wells had never seen a drunk before he wasat firsteven more easily deceived by senior worthingtons appearance than seniors immediate family and friends were and homer was as ready as they were to accept seniors deterioration in cognition as the natural result of alcoholism a man long admired in hearts rock and hearts haven especially for the sweetness of his disposition senior had become shorttempered irritable and even aggressive on occasion following the incident with the grasshopper pie olive wouldnt allow him to go to the haven club without her senior had plastered an entire grasshopper pie against the chest of a nice young lifeguard and needed to be restrained then from further smearing the palegreen ingredients on the rump of a nice young waitress he was showing off senior said of the lifeguard he was just standing there he explained and the waitress olive asked senior appeared confused and began to cry i thought she was someone else he said faintly olive had taken him home wally had made up to the waitress it was candy who had charmed and reassured the lifeguard senior became lost driving to other than routine places olive never allowed him to have the car unless wally or homer went with him eventually he became lost trying to get to familiar places homer had to lead him back to ocean view from ray kendalls lobster poundeven homer who was unfamiliar with the network of small roads to and from the coast could tell that senior had made a wrong turn senior made terrible mistakes in any complex motor task while cleaning the carburetor for the cadillaca simple job which ray kendall had demonstrated for him many timessenior inhaled the gas and little carbon particles in the tubes he sucked in instead of blowing out seniors recent memory was so severely impaired that he wandered for an hour through his own bedroom unable to dress himself he constantly confused his sock drawer with the drawer for olives underwear one morning he became so enraged at his mistake that he appeared at the breakfast table with each foot tightly tied up in a bra normally friendly to homer and tender to wally and olive he shouted an accusation at wallythat his own son was wearing his fathers socks which he had taken without his fathers permission and he ranted at olive for turning his domicile into a foundling home without asking his permission regarding that youd be better off at saint clouds than in this house of thieves he told homer upon saying this senior worthington burst into tears and begged homers forgiveness he put his head on homers shoulder and wept my brain is sending poison to my heart he told homer who thought it strange that senior didnt seem to drink before the late afternoonyet he appeared to be drunk nearly all the time sometimes it went like this senior would not drink for three daysa part of him able to observe that his silliness flourished no less ardently yet he would forget to make this point to olive or to anyone else until hed broken down and had a drink by the time he remembered to say he had not been drinking he was drunk why do i forget everything he wondered and then forgot it yet his longrange memory was quite intact he sang college songs to olive the lines of which she herself was unable to remember and he sweetly recalled for her the romantic evenings of their courtship he told wall y stories of wally as a baby he entertained homer by cheerfully recounting the planting of some of the oldertree orchards including the lone orchard from which the sea was visible it was where i wanted to build the house homer senior said it was lunchtime wally and homer had been suckering in the orchard stripping the inner limbs off the tree or any new sprouting branches or suckers that are turned inwardthe ones not reaching out to the sun wally had heard the story he was distracted he poured some cocacola on an anthill suckering exposes as many of the limbs as possible to the light it lets the light come through the tree you dont allow an apple tree to grow every which way wally had explained to homer like a boy senior had shouted laughing olive thought it was too windy for a house here senior told homer women are disturbed by the wind more than men are disturbed by it senior confided thats a fact anywayhe paused he gestured to the sea as if it were a faroff audience and he meant to include it by the sweep of his hand he turned to the apple trees around themthey were a slightly more intimate audience paying closer attention the wind he started to say and paused again perhaps waiting for the wind to contribute something the househe started to say you can see this orchard from the second floor of our house did you know that he asked homer right homer said wallys room was on the second floor from wallys window he could see the orchard from which the sea was visible but the sea wasnt visible from wallys windowor from any other window in the house i called the whole place ocean view senior explained because i thought the house was going to be here right here he repeated he looked down at the foaming cocacola that wally was slowly pouring onto the anthill you use poison oats and poison corn to kill the mice senior said it stinks wally looked up at him homer nodded you scatter the stuff for the field mice but you i have to find the holes and put it in the tunnels if you want to kill the pine micehe said we know pop wally said softly field mice are the same as meadow mice senior explained to homer who had already been told this right homer said meadow mice girdle a tree and pine mice eat the roots senior recited from his distant memory wally stopped pouring the coke on the anthill he and homer didnt know why senior had joined them for their lunch break theyd been suckering in the ocean orchard all morning and senior had just shown up he was driving the old jeep that didnt have any license plates it was strictly for driving around the orchards pop wally asked him what are you doing out here senior stared blankly at his son he looked at homer he hoped homer might tell him the answer he regarded his audiencethe apple trees the faroff ocean i wanted to build the house here right here he said to wally but your bossy bitch of a haveitallherownway mother wouldnt let meshe wouldnt let me the cunt he cried clamdigger cunt welldigger pussy he shouted he stood up he looked disoriented wally stood up with him come on pop he said ill drive you home they took wallys pickup homer followed them in the old jeep it was the vehicle he had learned to drive in after wally had assured him that he couldnt hurt it alcohol thought homer wells it sure can destroy you senior had all the other symptoms too he was fiftyfive he looked seventy he had periods of paranoia of grandiosity of confabulation his few obnoxious traitswhich hed always hadwere exaggerated in his case nosepicking for example he could explore a nostril for an hour he put boogers on his pants or on the furniture olives vulgar brother bucky bean claimed that senior could have been a welldigger the way he roots into his snoot bucky said i could use him to dig a well the haven clubs lifeguard whose chest had received the full force of the grasshopper pie turned out to be not completely mollified he objected to candy giving homer swimming lessons in the shallow end of the pool in the late afternoon the pool was crowded then he complained swimming lessons were regularly scheduled in the early morningand hethe lifeguardregularly administered themfor a fee he was not convinced that he should be flexible about the matter homer worked at ocean view all day candy argued in the late afternoon when wally played tennis after work was the ideal time for candy to give homer instructions ideal for you the lifeguard argued with candy he had a crush on her it was plain it was one thing to be jealous of wally worthingtoneveryone wasbut quite another to have to suffer the attentions candy kendall gave to the hardluck case from st clouds at the haven clubnever in candys presence or in the presence of any of the worthingtonshomer was referred to not as the foundling or as the orphan but as the hardluck case from st cloudssometimes the worthingtons hardluck case was the way it was put homer said he wouldnt mind practising in the worthingtons private pool at ocean view but it was nice that he and candy could be at the haven club when wally finished playing tennis they could then go off together to the beach to ray kendalls dock to wherever also at the worthingtons pool there would be senior to deal with more and more olive tried to keep senior home away from the haven club she found she could pacify him best by feeding him gin and tonics and keeping him in the poolfloating on a rubber raft but the real reason it was a bad idea everyone felt for homer to learn to swim in the worthingtons wnheated pool was that the cool water might be a shock to his heart olive decided that she would take over homers lessons from candy she knew that the lifeguard at the haven club wouldnt dare to complain to her she and candy and wally agreed that the unheated experience might be too severe for homer i dont want to be any trouble for you homer said puzzled and doubtlessly disappointed that the hands under his stomach as he paddled back and forth were olives and not candys its not too cold for me in your pool wally homer said its harder to learn when its cold candy said yes thats right olive said well i want to swim in the ocean as soon as i learn how homer told them its a lot colder in the ocean than it is in your pool oh my olive worried she wrote dr larch about the heart problem which made larch feel guilty and slightly trapped actually he wrote to her cold water doesnt provide the kind of shock he was anxious about the kind of shock associated with an accidentfor example a neardrowningwas more the kind of shock he felt that homer must try to avoid what lies larch thought but he mailed the letter to mrs worthington anyway and olive found that homer learned to swim very rapidly he must have been right on the verge of picking it up when i took over from you she told candy but in truth homer learned more quickly from olive because the lessons themselves were not as pleasurable with candy he might have never learned to swim at least he could have prolonged it and made the lessons last the rest of the summer homer wells would have made that summer last the rest of his life if he could have there was so much about his life at ocean view that made him happy he was not ashamed that he loved the worthingtons walltowall carpeting hed come from bare wood walls and many layers of linoleum between which one could feel the sawdust shift underfoot one couldnt claim that the worthingtons walls were hung with art but homer had not seen pictures on walls before except the portrait of the pony woman even the crowning cuteness of the oil painting of the cat in the flower bed in w allys bathroom appealed to homerand the flowerbed wallpaper behind the painting appealed to him too what did he know about wallpaper or art he thought all wallpaper was wonderful he felt he would never stop loving wallys room what did he know about varsity letters and footballs dipped in liquid gold and inscribed with the score of an important game and tennis trophies and old yearbooks and the ticket stubs tucked into the molding of the mirror from the first movie wally took candy to what did he know about movies wally and candy took him to one of maines first drivein movies how could he ever have imagined that and what did he know about people who came together every day and worked together by apparent choice his fellow workers at ocean view were a marvel to homer wells at first he loved them all he loved meany hyde the most because meany was so friendly and had such a fondness for explaining how everything was doneeven things that homeror anyone elsecould have seen how to do without being told homer especially loved listening to meany explain the obvious he loved meany hydes wife florenceand the other women who spent the summer making the apple mart and the cider house ready for the harvest he loved big dot taft although the jiggle in the backs of her arms reminded him of melony whom he never thought about not even when he heard that she had left st clouds he liked big dot tafts kid sister debra pettigrew who was his own age and pretty although there was something determined about her chubbiness that suggested she had the capacity for one day becoming as big as big dot big dots husband everett taft showed homer all about mowing you mowed the rows between the trees twice a summer then you raked and hayed the rows then you baled the hay and sold it to the dairy farm in kenneth corners you used the loose hay for mulch around the younger trees at ocean view everything was used homer liked ira titcomb the beekeeper and the husband of irene of the wondrous burn scar it was ira who explained to homer about the bees they like at least sixtyfive degrees no wind no hail no frost ira said a bee lives about thirty days and does more work than some men do all their lives aint sayin who all honey is said ira titcomb is fuel for bees homer learned that bees prefer dandelions to apple blossoms which was why you mowed the dandelions down just before you brought the bees into the orchard he learned why there had to be more than one kind of tree in an orchard for crosspollinatingthe bees had to carry the pollen from one kind of tree to another he learned it should be nighttime when you put the hives out in the orchard at night the bees were asleep and you could close the little screen door at the slat at the bottom of the box that contained the hive when you carried the hives the bees woke up but they couldnt get out the hives were light when they were carried off the flatbed trailer and distributed through the orchards but they were heavy with honey when they had to be picked up and loaded back on the trailer a week later sometimes a hive could be too heavy to lift alone if the hives were jostled the bees inside began to hum you could feel them stirring through the wood if honey had leaked through the slats a lone bee might get gobbed up in the leaking honey and that was the only way you could get stung once when homer hugged a hive to his chest and carefully walked it to the flatbeds edge he felt a vibration against the taut boards containing the hive even in the cool night air the boards were warm the activity of the hive generated heatlike an infection homer thought suddenly he recalled the taut belly of the woman he had saved from convulsions he thought of the activity in the uterus as producing both a heat and a hardness to the abdomen how many abdomens had homer wells put his hand on before he was twenty i prefer apple farming he thought at st clouds growth was unwanted even when it was deliveredand the process of birth was often interrupted now he was engaged in the business of growing things what he loved about the life at ocean view was how everything was of use and that everything was wanted he even thought he loved vernon lynch although hed been told how vernon beat his wife and grace lynch had a way of looking at homer that did alarm him he could not tell from her look if it was need or suspicion or simply curiosity that he sawgrace gave out the kind of look you go on feeling after youve stopped looking back vernon lynch showed homer how to spray it was appropriate that vernon lynch was in charge of the pesticides of extermination as soon as theres leaves theres trouble vernon told him thats in april you start sprayin in april and you dont stop till the end of august when youre ready to start pickin you spray every week or ten days you spray for scab and you spray for insects we got two sprayers here ones a hardie and ones a bean and both of them hold five hundred gallons you wear the respirator because you dont want to breathe the shit and the respirator dont do you no good if it dont fit tight saying this vernon lynch tightened the respirator around homers head homer could feel his temples pound if you dont keep washin out the cloth in the mask you could choke vernon said he cupped his hand over homers mouth and nose homer experienced airlessness and keep your hair covered if you dont want to go bald vernons hand remained clamped over homers mouth and nose and keep the goggles on if you dont want to go blind he added homer considered struggling decided to conserve his strength contemplated fainting wondered if it was true or just an expression that lungs exploded if you got what they call an open wound like a cut and the shit gets in there you could get sterile said vernon lynch that means no more nasty hardons homer tapped his shoulder and waved to vernon as if he were signaling something too complicated to be communicated by normal means i cant breathe hello i cant breathe hello out there when homers knees started to wobble vernon ripped the mask off his facethe head strap raking his ears upward and tangling his hair got the picture vernon asked right homer called out his lungs screaming he even liked herb fowler hed been with herb less than two minutes when the prophylactic sailed his way and struck him in the forehead all meany hyde had said was hi herb this here is homer wellshes wallys pal from saint clouds and herb had flipped the rubber at homer wouldnt be so many orphans if more people put these on their joints herb said homer wells had never seen a prophylactic in a commercial wrapper the ones that dr larch kepi at the hospital and distributed to many of the women in handfuls were sealed in something plain and seethrough like wax paper no brand names adorned them dr larch was always complaining that he didnt know where all the rubbers were going but homer knew that melony had helped herself on many occasions it had been melony of course who had introduced homer to prophylactics herb fowlers girlfriend louise tobey was doubtlessly professional in handling herbs prophylactics when homer touched himself he thought about squeeze louisehe imagined her dexterity with a prophylactic her fast and nimble fingers the way she held a paint brush and clenched her teeth slapping the paint on thick on the applemart shelves blowing a lock of her hair off her forehead with a puff of breath that was bitter with cigarettes homer didnt allow himself to masturbate when candy was on his mind he lay not touching himself in wallys room with wally breathing deeply and sleeping peacefully beside him whenever homer did imagine that candy was sleeping beside him they were never touching each other intimatelythey were just holding tightly to each other in a grip of chaste affection nothing genital as melony used to say candy smoked but she was so mannered and exaggerated that she often dropped her cigarette in her lap jumping up and furiously brushing away the sparks always laughing oh what a clod shed cry if so thought homer wells only when youre smoking louise tobey wolfed in a cigarette she sucked in a cloud of smoke and blew so little back homer wondered where it went the older applemart women were constant smokers all except grace lynch who had resolved not to part her lipsnot for any reason but florence and irene and big dot taft had been smoking so long they appeared offhanded about it only debra pettigrew dots kid sister smoked with candys infrequency and awkwardness squeeze louise smoked with a quick sure violence that homer imagined must have been inspired by herb fowlers roughandready use of rubbers in all of hearts rock and hearts havenfrom the briny gurgle of lobstering life to the chlorine security of the haven club pool from the bustle of the making ready in the apple mart to the work in the fieldsthere was nothing that caused homer a single sharp reminder of st clouds nothing until the first rainy day when they sent him with a small crew of scrubbers and painters to the cider house nothing about the building from the outside prepared him on or in various farm vehicles he had lumbered past it oftena long thin onestory shedroofed building in the shape of an arm held at a right angle in the elbow of the building where there was a doubledoor entrance were the cider mill and the press the grinder the pump the pump engine and the grinder engine and the thousandgallon tank one wing of the building was studded with refrigeration units it was a coldstorage room for the cider in the other wing was a small kitchen beyond which were extended two long rows of iron hospitalstyle beds each with its own blanket and pillow mattresses were rolled neatly on each of the more than twenty beds sometimes a blanket on wire runners enclosed a bed or a section of beds in the semiprivacy that homer wells associated with a hospital ward unpainted plywood shelves between the beds formed primitive but stable wardrobe closets which contained those twisted goosesnecked reading lamps wherever there was the occasional electrical outlet the furniture was shabby but neat as if rescued or rejected from hospitals and offices where it had been exposed to relentless but considerate use this wing of the cider house had the functional economy of a military barracks but it had too many personal touches to be institutional there were curtains for example and homer could tell that they would have been adequate if faded at the worthingtons diningroom windowswhich was where theyd come from homer also recognized a particularly exaggerated peacefulness in a few of the flowery landscape paintings and animal portraits that were hung on the plasterboard wallsin such unlikely places at times too high at times too low that homer was sure theyd been hung to hide holes maybe boot holes maybe fist holes perhaps wholehead holes there seemed to homer wells to radiate from the room a kind of dormitory anger and apprehension he recognized from his nearly twenty years in the boys division at st clouds what is this place he asked meany hyde the rain pelting on the tin roof above them the cider house said meany but who sleeps herewho stays here do people live here homer asked it was remarkably clean yet the atmosphere of use was so prevalent homer was reminded of the old bunkrooms in st clouds where the woodsmen and sawyers had dreamed out their exhausted lives its crew quarters for the pickers meany hyde said durin the harvest the pickers stay herethe migrants its for the colored folks said big dot taft plopping down the mops and pails every year we make it nice for them we wash everythin and we give everythin a fresh coat of paint i gotta wax the press boards meany hyde said sliding away from what he thought was the womens work although homer and wally would perform it regularly most rainy days of the summer negroes homer wells asked the pickers are negroes black as night some of them said florence hyde theyre okay theyre nice called meany hyde some of them are nicer than others said big dot taft like other people i know irene titcomb said giggling hiding her scar theyre nice because mrs worthington is nice to them meany hyde yelled from the spattered vicinity of the cider press the building smelled like vinegarold cider that had turned it was a strong smell but there was nothing stifling or unclean about it debra pettigrew smiled at homer over the bucket they were sharing he cautiously returned her smile while wondering where wally was working today in the rain and imagining ray kendall at work ray would either be out on the choppy sea in his glistening souwester or else working on the wiring of the international harvester in the building called number two grace lynch was scrubbing the linoleum counters in the kitchen of the cider house homer marveled that he had not noticed her there before that he hadnt even known she was part of their crew louise tobey sucking a cigarette down to its nub and flicking the butt out the picking crewquarters door remarked that her mop wringer was out of joint its jammed or somethin squeeze louise said crossly louises mop wringer is out of joint big dot taft said mockingly poor louisejammed your mop wringer huh said florence hyde who laughed which caused big dot taft to roar oh cut it out louise said she kicked her mop wringer whats going on out there called meany hyde louise has got an overworked wringer said big dot taft homer looked at louise who was cross then he looked at debra pettigrew who blushed are you overusin your poor wringer louise irene titcomb asked louise you must be stickin too many mops in your wringer darlin said florence hyde be nice all of you cried meany hyde too much of one mop thats for sure said big dot taft elven louise found that funny when she looked at homer wells he looked away debra pettigrew was watching him so he looked away from her too when herb fowler came by at the lunch break he walked into the cider house and said whew you can smell niggers in here a whole year later i think its just vinegar meany hyde said you tellin me you cant smell niggers herb fowler asked you smell em herb asked louise she shrugged how about you herb asked homer cant you smell em i can smell vinegar old apples old cider homer said he saw the rubber sailing toward him in time to catch it you know what niggers do with those herb asked him he flipped another rubber to louise tobey who caught it without the slightest effortshe expected prophylactics to be flying in her direction hourly show him what a nigger does with it louise herb said the other women were bored theyd seen this demonstration all their lives debra pettigrew looked nervously at homer wells and deliberately away from louise louise herself seemed nervous and bored at the same time she ripped the rubber out of its wrapper and stuck her index finger in ither fingernail poked out the rubber her nails fine edge next to the nipplelike end one year i told the niggers that they should just stick their joints into these rubbers if they didnt want to be catchin diseases or havin any new babies herb said he grabbed louises finger in the rubber sheath and held it out for everyone to see and the next year all the niggers told me that the rubbers didnt work they said they stuck their fingers in there like i showed em and they still got diseases and new babies every time they turned around no one laughed no one believed it it was an old joke to all of them except to homer wells and the idea of people having babies every time they turned around was not especially funny to homer when herb fowler offered to drive them all to the diner on drinkwater road for a hot lunch homer said he didnt want to go mrs worthington made his lunch and wallys every morning and homer felt obliged to eat hishe always enjoyed it he also knew the crew was not supposed to leave the orchards for a lunch break especially not in any of the ocean view vehicles and herb fowler was driving the green van that olive used most often it wasnt a hard rule but homer knew that if wally had been working in the cider house herb wouldnt have suggested it homer ate his lunch appropriately in the cider house kitchen when he glanced into the long room with the two rows of narrow beds he thought how much the rolled mattresses and blankets resembled people sleeping thereexcept the shapes upon the iron beds were too still to be sleepers they are like bodies waiting to be identified thought homer wells even though it was raining he went outside to look at the collection of dead cars and junked tractorandtrailer parts that festooned the dirt driveway in front of the cider house in the back was a churnedup area of discolored weeds where the mash or the pornace was flung after the press a pig farmer from waldoboro drove all the way just to have it meany hyde had told homer the mash was great for pigs some of the dead cars had south carolina plates homer wells had never looked at a map of the united states he had seen a globe but it was crude onethe states werent marked he knew south carolina was a long way south the negroes came from there in trucks meany hyde had said or they drove their own oars but some of their cars were so old and beaten up that they died here meany wasnt sure how all the negroes got back to south carolina they pick grapefruits down in florida i think meany said and peaches when its peach time somewhere else and apples here they travel around just pickinthings homer watched a sea gull that was watching him from the roof of the cider house the gull was so drawn in upon itself that homer was reminded it was raining arid went back inside he rolled down one of the mattresses and stretched out on it placing both the pillow and the blanket under his head something invited him to smell the blanket and the pillow but he could detect nothing more than the aura of vinegar and a scent he categorized as simply old the blanket and pillow felt more human than theymelled but the deeper he pushed his face into them the more human their smell became he thought about the strain on louise tobeys face and how her finger had stretched itself out in the rubber and the way her nail had looked ready to slice through he recalled the mattress in the sawyers lodge in st clouds where melony had introduced him to the way he felt now he took himself out of his work jeans and masturbated quickly the springs of the old iron bed creaking sharply something in his vision seemed clearer after he had finished when he sat up on the bed he spotted the other body that had taken the liberty of resting in the cider house even with her body curled so tightly in upon itselflike the gull in the rain or like a fetus or like a woman with crampshomer had no trouble recognizing grace lynch even if she hadnt been watching him even if shed never been turned in his direction she surely could not have mistaken the rhythm of the old bed springsor even homer thought the detectable sharpness of the odor of the semen he cupped in his hand he stepped quietly outdoors and held his hand out in the rain the sea gull still huddled on the cider house roof took a sudden interest in himthere was a history of successful scavenging associated with this place when homer went back in the cider house he saw that grace lynch had fixed her mattress the way it had been and was standing by the window with her face pressed into the curtain you had to look twice to see grace lynch he wouldnt have seen her standing there if he hadnt already known she was in the room i been there grace lynch said softly without looking at homer where you come from she explained i been therei dont know how you managed a nights sleep her thinness was especially sharp even knifelike in what dead gray light the rainy day provided at that window she drew the faded curtain around her narrow shoulders like a shawl she wouldnt look at homer wells and nothing in her brittle shivering stance could have been interpreted as beckoning yet homer felt himself drawn to herin the way we are urged especially in gloomy weather to seek the familiar in st clouds one grew accustomed to victims and the attitude of a victim shone stronger than reflected sunlight from grace lynch homer felt such a contradictory glow shining forth from her that he was impelled to go to her and hold her limp damp hands funny she whispered still not looking at him it was so awful there i felt real safe she put her head on his chest and stuck her sharp knee between his legs twisting her bony hip into him not like here she whispered its dangerous here her thin bony hand slipped into his pants as skittish as a lizard the noisy arrival of the green van containing the escapeesto a hot lunchsaved him like a startled cat grace sprang crazily away from him when they all came through the door she was digging the grit from a seam in the linoleum on the kitchen counterusing a wire brush that homer hadnt noticed shed had in her hip pocket like so much of grace lynch it had been concealed but the tension in the look she gave him at quitting timewhen he rode back to the apple mart on big dot tafts jolly lapwas enough to tell homer wells that whatever was dangerous had not deserted grace lynch and that he could travel far but never so far that the victims of st clouds would ever desert him the night after grace lynch attacked him homer had his first date with debra pettigrew it was also the first time he went to the drivein movie with candy and wally they all went in seniors cadillac homer and debra pettigrew sat in the splotched back seat where only a couple of months ago poor curly day had lost control of himself homer was unaware that the purpose of drivein movies was ultimately for losing control of oneself in the back seats of cars homers never been to a drivein before wally announced to debra pettigrew when they picked her up the pettigrews were a large family who kept dogsmany dogs mostly chained some were chained to the bumpers of the several undriven believedtobedead cars that so permanently occupied the front lawn that the grass grew through the drive shafts and the axle bearings as homer stepped gingerly around the snapping dogs en route to debras front door the dogs lunged against the unbudging cars the pettigrews were a large family in both numbers and in flesh debras fetching chubbiness was but a slight reminder of the familys potential for girth at the door debras mother greeted homer massivelyshe of the monstrous genes responsible for the likes of debras sister big dot taft debra shrieked debras mother its your beau hi sweetiepie she said to homer ive heard all about how nice you are and what good manners youve got please excuse the mess debra blushing beside her tried to hurry homer outside as forcefully as her mother wished to usher him in he glimpsed several huge people some with remarkably swollen faces as if theyd lived half their lives underwater or had survived incredible beatings all with wide friendly smiles which contradicted the untold viciousness of the dogs barking in such a frenzy at homers back we have to go mom debra whined shoving homer out the door we cant be late late for what someone cackled from the house which shook with heavy laughter coughs followed which were followed by labored sighing before the dogs erupted in such force that homer thought the noise of them would be sufficient to keep him and debra from ever reaching the cadillac shut up debra yelled at the dogs they all stopped but only for a second when wally said homers never been to a drivein before he had to shout to be heard over the dogs ive never been to a movie before homer admitted gosh said debra pettigrew she smelled nice she was much neater and cleaner than she looked in her applemart clothes debra dressed with a certain pert orderliness for working too her chubbiness was restrained and as they drove to cape kenneth her usual good nature emerged so warmly that even her shyness disappearedshe was a fun girl as they say in maine she was nicelooking relaxed goodhumored hardworking and not very smart her prospects at best included marriage to someone pleasant and not a great deal older or smarter than herself in the summers the pettigrews occupied one of the new houses on the overcrowded mucky shore of drinkwater lake theyd managed to make the new place look livedinon its rapid way to ramshacklealmost instantly the lawn had appeared to grow its dead cars overnight and the dogs had survived the move from the pettigrews winter house in kenneth corners without losing a bit of their territorial savagery like all the cottages around drinkwater lake the pettigrews had been namedas if the houses themselves were orphans delivered incomplete and in need of further creation the pettigrews house was named all of us the exclamation point is what kills me wally had said to homer when they pulled up at the caranddog lot as if theyre proud of their overpopulation but wally was very respectful once debra joined them in the car this mannerism of what hed seen of society struck homer wells quite forcefully people even nice people because surely wally was nicewould say a host of critical things about someone to whom they would then be perfectly pleasant at st clouds criticism was plainerand harder if not impossible to conceal the drivein movie in cape kenneth was nearly as new to maine as the haven clubs heated pool and was a lot less practical drivein movies would never be a great idea for maine the night fog along the coast lent to many a joyful film the inappropriately ghoulish atmosphere of a horror movie in later years people groping for rest rooms and the snack bar would fail to find their cars when they attempted to return to them the other problem was mosquitoes in when homer wells went to his first drivein movie the hum of the mosquitoes in the night air of cape kenneth was far more audible than the sound track wally was relatively successful in preventing the mosquitoes from taking over the car because he always brought with him an aerosol pump sprayer with which he frequently doused the car and the air surrounding the cars the pump can was loaded with the insecticide they sprayed the apples with thus the air in and surrounding the cadillac was rendered poisonous and foul but fairly free of mosquitoes the hiss and stench of the spray aroused frequent complaints from wallys fellow moviegoers in the cars nearest the cadillacuntil they were being bitten so badly by mosquitoes that they stopped protesting some of them politely asked if they could borrow the device for the purpose of poisoning their own cars there was no snack bar at the cape kenneth drivein in and there were no rest rooms the men and boys took turns urinating against a dank cement wall at the rear of the drivein pit atop the wall were perched several small and uncouth boys cape kenneth locals too young or too poor for cars who used the wall to watch the movie even though they were well beyond the possibility of hearing it occasionally when the movie was dissatisfying they peed from the top of the wall onto the luckless people who were peeing against it girls and women were not expected to pee at the drivein and consequently were better behaved than the men and boysthe women drank less for example although their behavior inside the cars could not be monitored it was wondrousthis whole experiencefor homer wells he was especially acute at noticing what human beings did for pleasurewhat there could be no mistake about it they chose to dobecause he had come from a place where choice was not so evident and examples of people performing for pleasure were not plentiful it amazed him that people suffered drivein movies by choice and for pleasure but he believed that if he failed to see the fun in it it was entirely his failure what he was most unprepared for was the movie itself after people honked their horns and blinked their headlights and exhibited other less endearing forms of impatience heard what was unmistakably the sound of someone vomiting against a fendera gigantic image filled the sky it is somethings mouth thought homer wells the camera backed or rather lurched away somethings heada kind of horse thought homer wells it was a camel actually but homer wells had never seen a camel or a picture of one he thought it was a horribly deformed horsea mutant horse perhaps some ghastly fetusphase of a horse the camera staggered back farther mounted by the camels grotesque hump was a blackskinned man almost entirely concealed in white wrappingbandages thought homer wells the ferocious black arab nomad brandished a frightening curved sword whacking the lumbering camel with the flat of the blade he drove the beast into a faulty staggering gallop across such endless sand dunes that the animal and its rider were soon only a speck on the vast horizon suddenly music homer jumped words the titles the names of the actors were written in the sand by an invisible hand what was that homer asked wally he meant the animal its rider the desert the creditseverything some dumb bedouin i think wally said a bedouin thought homer wells its a kind of horse he asked what horse asked debra pettigrew the animal homer said sensing his mistake candy turned around in the front seat and looked at homer with heartbreaking affection thats a camel homer she said youve never seen a camel wally shouted well where would he see a camel candy snapped at him i was just surprised wally said defensively ive never seen a negro either homer said that was one wasnt iton the camel a negro bedouin i guess wally said gosh said debra pettigrew who looked at homer a little fearfully as if she suspected him of simultaneously existing on another planet in another lifeform then the credits were over the black man on the camel was gone and would never be seen again the desert was also gone apparently it had served its uncertain functionit would never be seen again either it was a pirate movie great ships were blasting each other with cannons swarthy men with uncut hair and baggy pants were doing terrible things to nicerlooking men who were betterdressed none of the men was black perhaps the camels rider had been a kind of omen thought homer wells his exposure to storytelling through charles dickens and charlotte bronte had ill prepared him for characters who came from and traveled nowhereor for stories that made no sense the pirates stole a chest of coins and a blond woman from the ship of pleasanter aspect before they sank the ship and sailed away in their own foul vessel on which they coarsely attempted to make merry with drunkenness and song they appeared to enjoy leering at the woman and taunting her but some mysterious and totally unseen force kept them from actually harming herfor a whole hour during which they harmed nearly everyone else and many of themselves the woman however was reserved for more teasing yet she protested her fate bitterly and homer had the feeling that he was supposed to lament for her a man who apparently adored the complaining woman pursued her across the ocean through burning harbor towns and charmless inns of suggested but never visualized lewdness as the fog rolled in there was much of the movie that was never visualized although homer remained riveted to the image in the sky he was only partially aware that wally and candy were uninterested in the movie they had slumped from sight in the front seat and only occasionally did candys hand appear grippingor lolling onthe back of the seat twice homer heard her say no wally once with a firmness he had never heard in her voice before w allys frequent laughter continued at intervals and he whispered and murmured and gurgled in his throat homer was occasionally aware of debra pettigrew being less interested in the pirate movie than he was when he looked at her he was surprised to find her looking at him not critically but not very affectionately either she appeared to be more and more amazed to see him as the picture went on and on once she touched his hand he thought she wanted something and regarded her politely she just stared at him he looked back at the movie the blond woman was forever barring her door against her captors and they were always breaking into her room despite her efforts they seemed to break into her room for the single purpose of demonstrating to her that she couldnt bar them out once in the room they taunted her in the usual fashion and then retreatedwhereupon she attempted to bar their way again i think ive missed something homer wells announced after more than an hour had passed candy sat up in the front seat and looked at him her genuine concern quite apparent despite the wild tangle her hair was in what have you missed wally askedsleepily homer thought debra pettigrew prettily leaned close to homer and whispered in his ear i think youve missed me she said i think youve forgotten im here homer had meant hed missed something in the story he stared at debra in a particularly uncomprehending way debra kissed him very neatlyvery drylyon his mouth she sat back in the seat and smiled at him your turn she said wally at this moment opened the front door and sprayed lethal fumes all around the cadillacmuch of the stuff drifting back through the open door candy and wally and debra too coughed in a very dramatic fashion but homer stared at debra pettigrewthe idea of the drivein movie slowly coming to him he cautiously kissed debra on her dry little mouth she kissed him back he settled himself more comfortably beside her and she put her head on his shoulder one hand on his chest he put one hand on her chest but she pushed it away he knew he was still missing something but he proceeded tentatively to discover the rules he kissed her neck this was acceptableshe snuggled against his neck and something new and daring and wet licked him at the throat her tongue homer permitted his tongue to venture into the poisoned air he took a moment contemplating the uses of his tongue he decided to kiss her on her mouth and to suggest gently the application of his tongue there but this was somewhat tensely rejectedher own tongue pushed his away her teeth blocked further entry he was beginning to see it was a yesno set of rules he had encountered he was permitted to rub her tummy but not to touch her breasts the hand on her hips was allowed to remain there the hand on her thigh in her lap was moved on she put her arms around him and hugged him her kisses were friendly and sweet he began to feel like a welltreated petcertainly better treated than most of the pettigrew dogs no candy said so loudly that both homer and debra pettigrew flinched then debra giggled and cuddled against him by straining his neck and rolling his eyes toward the back of his head homer wells could manage to see the movie at last the tireless lover had tracked the blond woman to yet another place of bondage the stupid woman had barred herself in again but this time she was attempting to keep herself untouched by her rescuer it was quite frustrating to watch him hack and flail at her door from one of the cars in the hazardous fog around them someone yelled leave her another person cried kill her all homer felt sure of was that no one would ever fuck hershe seemed protected from both sex and death by something as shifty as the cape kenneth fog nor would any of them in the cadillac pursue much adventure beyond the pleasure afforded to cherished household pets this feeling caused homer to remember the affection dr larch had for himand nurse edna and nurse angela had for him too when the movie was over he realized he was crying he realized that although he loved where he was he loved dr larch more than anyone elseat this point in his life he still loved larch more than he loved candyand he realized that he missed larch toowhile at the same time he hoped he would never again set foot in st clouds it was an overwhelming confusion that inspired his weeping but debra pettigrew mistook the cause she thought the movie had moved him to tears there there she said in a mothering tone hugging him candy and wally leaned over the front seat candy touched his head its okay you can cry i cry at lots of movies she said even wally was deeply respectful hey buddy he said we know this must all be a shock to you his poor heart sweet wally was thinking you dear boy candy thought please watch out for your heart she put her cheek against homers cheek and kissed him near his ear it was a very sudden surprise to her how much she enjoyed that kiss of friendship it surprised homer wells too despite the little dry kisses that debra pettigrew gave him in abundance he felt a remarkable difference surge through him at the instant of candys kissing him it was a feeling that rushed him from nowhereand he knew looking at wallys fond and handsome face that it was a feeling with nowhere to go was that what love was and how it came to youleaving you no options for its use like the blackskinned nomad on the camel where did he belong in a movie about pirates i am that blackskinned rider on that camel thought the orphan homer wells what was he called later after hed taken debra pettigrew home and had nearly been eaten by her dogs he asked wally homer sat up front in the cadillaccandy in the middle of the seat between them a bedouin wally said im a bedouin thought homer wells when candy fell asleep she slumped against wallys shoulder but this bothered his driving he pushed her very gently in homers direction the rest of the way to hearts haven she slept with her head on homers shoulder her hair lightly touching his face when they got to ray kendalls lobster pound wally shut off the car and whispered hey sleepy he kissed candy on the lips which woke her up she sat bolt upright for a second disoriented and she looked accusingly at both wally and homer as if she werent sure which one of them had kissed her easy wally said to her laughing youre home home thought homer wells he knew that for the bedouincome from nowhere going nowherethere was no home in august of that same summer another bedouin left what had been home for him curly day departed st clouds for boothbay where a young druggist and his wife had recently moved and had plunged into a life of community service dr larch had his doubts about the young couple but he had more doubts regarding curly days resilience to another winter in st clouds the end of the summer was the last good time for visits from adoptive families the good weather in the early fall was brief and curlys general positivism had been in decline since the departure of homer wells curly could never be convinced that homer had not somehow stolen the beautiful couple who a kinder fate had intended for him the druggist and his wife were not a beautiful couple they were well off and goodhearted but they had not been born to a life of ease and it seemed unlikely that they would ever adjust to anything resembling gracious living they had striven to their station in life and their idea of helping their fellow man seemed rooted in the notion that their fellow man should be taught how to strive they had requested an older orphan they wanted someone capable of doing a few hours work in the drugstore after school they saw their childlessness as entirely gods decision and agreed that god had meant for them to find a foundling and educate him in the methods of selfsupport and selfimprovement for which the foundling would be broadly rewarded by inheriting the young couples pharmacy and with it the means to care for them in their apparently eagerly anticipated old age they were practical and christian peoplealbeit grim when they reviewed for larch their earlier efforts to have a child of their own before he met the couple at a time when he had only corresponded with them by maillarch had hoped he might persuade them to allow curly to keep his first name when an orphan gets to be as old as curly larch argued the name has more than casual significance but larchs hopes sank when he saw the couple the young man was prematurely bald so perfectly bald that larch wondered if the fellow had not suffered from the application of an untested pharmaceutical productand the young wifes hair was fine and lank the couple seemed shocked at the wealth of curly days curly hair and larch imagined that their first family trip would probably include a visit to the barber curly himself seemed as unenthusiastic about the couple as the couple were unenthusiastic about his name yet he wanted to leave st cloudsbadly larch saw that the boy still hoped for an adoption as dazzling as the one hed imagined for a couple as glittering with the promise of another life as candy and wally were of the very plain young couple from boothbay curly day said to dr larch theyre okay theyre nice i guess and boothbay is on the coast i think id like the ocean larch did not say to the boy that the couple adopting him did not appear to be a boating couple or a beach couple or even a fishingoffadock couple he suspected them of thinking that a life of playing with on or in the sea was frivolous something for tourists larch thought that way himself larch expected that the drugstore remained open every daylight hour of the summer and that the hardworking young couple remained in the store every minuteselling tanning oil to summer people while they themselves stayed as pale as the winter and were proud of it you cant be too choosy wilbur nurse edna said if the boy gets sick therell be lots of pills and cough medicines around hell still be curly to me nurse angela said defiantly worse larch imagined hell always be curly to curly but larch let him go it was high time for him to be gonethat was the main reason the couples name was rinfret they called curly roy and so roy curly rinfret took up residence in boothbay rinfrets pharmacy was a harborfront store the family lived several miles inland where the sea was out of sight but not out of scent mrs rinfret had maintained she declared that when the wind was right the ocean could be smelled from the house not with curlys nose dr larch imagined curlys nose was such a constant streamer dr larch suspected that curly had no sense of smell at all let us be happy for curly day dr larch announced to the boys division one evening in august in over david copperfields steady sobs curly day has found a family dr larch said good night curly gnight burly young copperfield cried when homer wells received the letter telling him the news of curlys adoption he read it again and againin the moonlight streaming through wallys window while wally slept a druggist thought homer wells hed been upset enough by the news to talk about it with wally and candy theyd sat in the moonlight earlier that evening throwing snails off ray kendalls dock ploinkploink went the periwinkles homer wells talked and talked ke told them about the litanylet us be happy for curly day and so forth he tried to explain how it had felt to be addressed as a prince of maine as a king of new england i guess i imagined someone who looked like you homer said to wally candy remembered that dr larch had said this to her too that hed told her that her babies would be these princes these kings but i didnt know what he meant she said i mean he was nicebut it was unimaginable it still is unimaginable to me wally said i mean what you saw he said to homer what all of you imagined it must have been different for each of you wally was unwilling to accept the notion that someone who looked like himself would ever be adequate to the expression it sounds a little mocking candy said i just cant see what he meant yeah wally agreed it sounds a little cynical maybe it was said homer wells maybe he said it for himself and not for us he told them about melony but not everything about her he took a deep breath and told them about fuzzy stone he imitated the breathing contraption admirably he had them both so roaring with laughter at the racket he was making that they drowned out the insignificant ploink of the snails dropping into the sea wally and candy didnt know they were at the end of the story until homer simply arrived at it fuzzy stone has found a new family he repeated to them good night fuzzy he concluded hollowly there wasnt a sound then not even a snail the sea lapped at the dock posts the boats moored around them rocked on the water when a line was pulled taut and yanked out of the water you could hear the water drip off the line when the thicker ropes were stretched they made a noise like grinding teeth curly day was the first boy i circumcised homer wells announcedjust to change the subject from fuzzy stone doctor larch was there when i did it homer said and a circumcision is no big dealits really easy wally felt his own penis inch toward itself like a snail candy felt a cramp knot in her calf and she stopped swinging her legs off the edge of the dock she drew her heels up to her buttocks and hugged her knees curly was the first one homer said i made it a little lopsidedhe confessed we could drive up to boothbay and see how hes doing wally suggested what would we see candy wondered she imagined curly peeing all over the cadillac again and telling them again that he was the best one i dont think that would be a good idea homer said he went with wally back to ocean view and wrote dr larch a long letterhis longest so far he tried to tell larch about the drivein movie but the letter degenerated into a critique of the movie itself and so he tried to change the subject should he tell him about herb fowler carrying all the prophylactics although dr larch approved of everyone using prophylactics he would hardly have approved of herb fowler should he tell larch that he had learned the real purpose of the drivein wasnt it to tease oneself and ones date into a state of sexual frenzy which neither of you were allowed to act upon dr larch would certainly not think highly of that should he tell dr larch what grace lynch had said and done or how he dreamed about heror how he imagined he was falling in love or already had fallen in love with candy which he knew was forbidden and how do i say i miss you he wonderedwhen i dont mean i want to come back and so he ended the letter in his fashion he ended it inexactly i remember when you kissed me he wrote to dr larch i wasnt really asleep yes thought dr larch i remember that too he rested in the dispensary why didnt i kiss him more why not all the time in other parts of the world he dreamed they have drivein movies he always used more ether than he should have before the annual meeting of st clouds board of trustees hed never quite understood what a board of trustees was for and his impatience with the routine inquiries was growing in the old days thered been the maine state board of medical examiners theyd never asked him any questionsthey never wanted to hear from hinn now it appeared to wilbur larch that there was a board of trustees for everything this year there were two new board members whod never before seen the orphanage and so the meeting had been scheduled to take place in st cloudsthe board usually met in portland the new members wanted to see the place the old members agreed they should refresh themselves with the atmosphere it was a perfect august morning with more indications of september in the airs crispness than there were indications of the stifling carryover of julys humidity and hazy heat but larch was irritable i dont know exactly what a drivein movie is he said crossly to nurse angela homer doesnt say exactly nurse angela looked frustrated no he doesnt she agreed going over the letter again and again what do you do with your cars when youre watching the movie nurse edna asked i dont know dr larch said i assume that if you drive into something to see the movie you must stay in your cars but what do you drive into wilbur nurse edna asked thats what i dont know larch shouted well arent we in a lovely mood nurse angela said why would you want to bring your car to a movie in the first place nurse edna asked i dont know the answer to that either dr larch said tiredly unfortunately he looked tired during the trustees meeting too nurse angela tried to present some of the orphanages priorities for him she didnt want him to get badtempered with anyone on the board the two new members seemed in an awful hurry to demonstrate that they already understood everythingand nurse angela detected dr larch looking at these younger members with something of the look he had formerly reserved for clara in the days when larch would discover that homers cadaver hadnt been put away properly the new woman on the board had been appointed for her abilities at fundraising she was especially aggressive shed been married to a congregationalist missionary whod committed suicide in japan and she had returned to her home state of maine with a zeal for putting her considerable energies to work for something doable japan had not been at all doable sbe kept saying maines problems by comparison were entirely surmountable she believed that all maine neededor lackedwas organization and she believed every solution began with new blooda phrase nurse angela observed that caused dr larch to pale as if his own blood were trickling away from him thats an unfortunate expression for those of us familiar with hospital work dr larch snapped once but the womanmrs goodhalldid not look sufficiently bitten mrs goodhall expressed albeit coldly her admiration for the severity and the duration of dr larchs undertaking and her respect for how much experience larch and his assistants had with administering st clouds perhaps they all could be invigorated by a younger assistant a young interna willing toiler and with some new ideas in the obstetrical field mrs goodhall suggested i keep up with the field dr larch said and i keep up with the number of babies born here well then how about a new administrative assistant mrs goodhall suggested leave the medical practice to youim talking about someone with a grasp of some of the newer adoption procedures or just someone who could handle the correspondence and the interviewing for you i could use a new typewriter dr larch said just get me a new typewriter and you can keep the assistant or give the assistant to someone whos really doddering around the new man on the board was a psychiatrist he was rather new at psychiatry which was rather new in maine in his name was gingrich even with people he had just met he had a way of assuming he understood what pressure they were underhe was quite sure that everyone was under some pressure even if he was correct about the particular pressure you were under and even if you agreed with him that there indeed was a certain pressure and indeed you were under it he had a way of assuming he knew other pressures that preyed upon you which were always unseen by you for example had he seen the movie that began with the bedouin on the camel dr gingrich might have assumed that the captive woman was under great pressure to marry someone although it was clearly her opinion that all she wanted was to get free his eyes and introductory smile communicated a cloying sympathy that you perhaps did not deserveas if he were imparting by the imposed gentleness of his voice and the slowness with which he spoke the assurance that everything is much more subtle than we can suppose the older members of the boardall men all as elderly as larchwere intimidated by this new man who spoke in whispers and by this new woman who was so loud in tandem they seemed so sure of themselves they viewed their new roles on the board not as learning experiences or even as an introduction to orphanage life but as opportunities for taking charge oh dear nurse edna thought theres going to be trouble as if we need any nurse angela thought it wouldnt have hurt to have a young intern around or an administrative assistant either but she knew that wilbur larch was protecting his ability to perform the abortions how could he accept new appointees without knowing the persons beliefs now doctor larch dr gingrich said softly surely you know we dont think of you as doddering sometimes i think of myself as doddering larch said defensively i suppose you might think so too the pressure you must be under dr gingrich said someone with all your responsibilities should have all the help he can get someone with my responsibility should stay responsible larch said with the pressure you must be under said dr gingrich its no wonder you find it hard to delegate even a little of that responsibility i have more use for a typewriter than for a delegate wilbur larch said but when he blinked his eyes he saw those bright stars that populated both a clear maine night and the firmament of ether and he wasnt sure which stars they were he rubbed his face with his hand and caught mrs goodhall scribbling something on the impressively thick pad before her lets see she saidsharply by comparison to dr gingrichs wispy voice youre in your seventies nowis that correct arent you seventysomething she asked dr larch right said wilbur larch seventysomething and how old is missus grogan mrs goodhall asked suddenly as if mrs grogan werent presentor as if she were so old that she was incapable of answering for herself im sixtytwo mrs grogan said pertly and im as lively as a spring chicken oh no one doubts you re not lively said dr gingrich and nurse angela mrs goodhall asked not looking up at anyone the scrutiny of her own writing on the pad before her required every ounce of her exhaustive attention im fiftyeight nurse angela said angela is as strong as an ox mrs grogan said we dont doubt it said dr gingrich cheerfully im fiftyfive or fiftysix nurse edna offered before the question was raised you dont know how old you are dr gingrich asked meaningfully actually said wilbur larch were all so senile we cant rememberwere just guessing but look at you he said suddenly to mrs goodhall which did get mrs goodhall to raise her eyes from her pad i guess you have such trouble remembering things larch said that you have to write everything down im just trying to get the picture of whats going on here mrs goodhall said evenly well larch said i suggest you listen to me ive been here long enough to have the picture pretty clearly in mind its very clear what a wonderful job youre doing dr gingrich told dr larch its also clear how hard a job it is such a warm washcloth kind of sympathy was leaking from dr gingrich that larch felt wetand grateful that he wasnt sitting near enough to dr gingrich for dr gingrich to touch him gingrich was clearly a toucher if its not asking too much in the way of your support dr larch said id not only like a new typewriter id like permission to keep the old one i think we can arrange that mrs goodhall said nurse edna who was not accustomed to sudden insightsor despite her years hot flashesand was completely inexperienced with the world of omens and signs or even forewarnings felt a totally foreign and breathtaking violence rise from her stomach she found herself staring at mrs goodhall with a hatred nurse edna couldnt conceive of feeling for another human being oh dear the enemy she thought she had to excuse herselfshe was sure she was going to be ill she was but discreetly out of sight in the boys shower room only david copperfield still mourning the departure of curly day and still struggling with the language spotted her medna young copperfield asked im fine david she told him but she was not fine i have seen the end she thought with an unfamiliar bitterness larch had seen it too someone will replace me he realized and it wont be long he looked at his calendar he had two abortions to perform the next day and three probables near the end of the week there were always those who just showed up too and what if they get someone who wont perform one he thought when the new typewriter arrived it fittedjust in timeinto his plans for fuzzy stone thank you for the new typewriter larch wrote to the board of trustees it had arrived just in time he added because the old typewriter which if they remembered he wanted to keep had completely broken down this was not true he had the keys replaced on the old typewriter and it now typed a story with a different face what it typed were letters from young fuzzy stone fuzzy began by wanting dr larch to know how much he was looking forward to being a doctor when he grew up and how much dr larch had inspired him to make this decision i doubt that i will ever come to feel as you do regarding abortion young fuzzy wrote to dr larch certainly it is obstetrics that interests me and certainly your example is responsible for my interest but i expect we shall never agree about abortion although i know you perform abortions out of the most genuine beliefs and out of the best intentions you must permit me to honor my beliefs accordingly and on and on larch covered the years he wrote into the future leaving a few convenient blanks larch completed dr f stones training he put him through medical school he gave him fine obstetrical procedure even a few variances from dr larchs procedure which dr larch had dr stone describe and always fuzzy stone remained faithful to his beliefs im sorry but i believe there is a soul and that it exists from the moment of conception fuzzy stone wrote he was slightly pompoussounding as he grew up close to unctuous in his graciousness toward larch even capable of condescension at timesthe kind of patronizing a young man will indulge in when he think he ha developed beyond his teacher larch gave fuzzy stone an unmistakable selfrighteousness which he imagined all supporters of the existing law against abortion would feel at home with he even had young dr stone propose that he replace dr larchbut not until youre ready to retire of courseand that by this replacement it might be demonstrated to dr larch that the law should be observed that abortions should not be performed and that a safe and informative view of family planning birth control and so forth could in time achieve the desired effect without breaking the laws of god or man wrote a convincingly creepy fuzzy stone the desired effectboth dr larch and dr stone agreedwould be a minimum of unwanted children brought forth into the world i for one am happy to be here crowed young dr stone he sounds like a missionary thought wilbur larch the idea of making a missionary out of fuzzy appealed to dr larch for several reasonsamong them fuzzy wouldnt need a license to practice medicine if he took his magic to some remote and primitive place it exhausted larch but he got it all downone typewriter for fuzzy that was used for nothing else and the new one for himself he made carbons of his own letters and referred to his dialogue with young dr stone in various fragments which he contributed to a brief history of st clouds he imagined that their correspondence ended quite abruptly when larch refused to accept the idea that anyone should replace him who was unwilling to perform abortions i will go until i drop he wrote to fuzzy here in st clouds i will never allow myself to be replaced by some reactionary religious moron who cares more for the misgivings suffered in his own frail soul than for the actual suffering of countless unwanted and mistreated children i am sorry youre a doctor larch ranted to poor fuzzy i am sorry such training was wasted on someone who refuses to help the living because of a presumptuous point of view taken toward the unborn you are not the proper doctor for this orphanage and over my dead body will you ever get my job what he heard from dr stone after that was a rather curt note in which fuzzy said he needed to search his soul regarding his personal debt to dr larch and his perhaps larger debt to society and to all the murdered unborn of the future it was hard fuzzy implied to listen to his conscience and not turn in dr larch to the authorities he added ominously what a good story thought wilbur larch it had taken him the rest of august of he wanted to leave the matter all set upall arrangedwhen homer wells returned to st clouds from his summer job wilbur larch had created a replacement for himself one who would be acceptable to the authoritieswhoever they were he had created someone with qualified obstetrical procedure andwhat betteran orphan familiar with the place from birth he had also created a perfect lie because the dr f stone whom wilbur larch had in mind would perform abortions of course while at the same timewhat betterhe would be on record for claiming he was against performing them when larch retired or he knew if he was ever caught he would already have available his most perfect replacement of course larch was not through with fuzzy such an important replacement might require some revision wilbur larch lay in the dispensary with both the stars of maine and the stars of ether circling around him he had given fuzzy stone a role in life that was much more strenuous than fuzzy ever could have been capable of how could poor fuzzy even have imagined it as he succumbed to the failure of his breathing contraption only one problem thought wilbur larch dreaming with the stars how do i get homer to play the part homer wells gazing at the actual stars of maine and at the orchards visible in the waning moonlight out wallys window saw something glintsomething beyond the orchard from which he knew the ocean could be viewed homer moved his head up and down in wallys window and the glint flashed tohim thefeeblesignal remindedhim of the night when the deep maine woods had not returned his voice to himwhen he had yelled his echoless good night to fuzzy stone then he realized where the glint was coming from there must be one small polished spot on the tin roof of the cider house he was seeing the waning moon bounce off the roof of the cider houseoff a spot no bigger than a knife blade this little glint in the night was one of those things thateven after you identify ityou cant leave alone it was no help to him to listen to wallys peaceful breathing the problem is homer wells knew i am in love with candy it was candy who suggested he not go back to st clouds my father likes you so much shed told homer i know hell give you a job on the boat or in the pound my mother likes you so much wally had added i know shell keep you on in the orchards especially through harvest and she gets lonely whenever i go back to college ill bet shed be delighted to have you stay right where you arein my room out in the orchards the roof of the cider house flashed to him the flash was as small and as quick as the one glimpse of an eyetooth grace lynch had revealedher mouth had parted only that much when shed last looked at him how could i not be in love with candy he wondered and if i stay here he asked himself what can i do the roof of the cider house flashed then it stood dark and still he had seen the wink of the curette before it went to work he had seen it at rest in the examining tray dull with blood in need of cleaning and if i go back to st clouds he asked himself what can i do in nurse angelas office on the new typewriter dr larch began a letter to homer wells i remember nothing so vividly as kissing you dr larch began but he stopped he knew he couldnt say that he pulled the page from the typewriter then he hid it deep within a brief history of st clouds as if it were another particle of history without an audience david copperfield had a fever when hed gone to bed and larch went to check on the boy dr larch was relieved to feel that young copperfields fever had broken the boys forehead was cool and a slight sweat chilled the boys neck which larch carefully rubbed dry with a towel there was not much moonlight therefore larch felt unobserved he bent over copperfield and kissed him much in the manner that he remembered kissing homer wells larch moved to the next bed and kissed smoky fields who tasted vaguely like hot dogs yet the experience was soothing to larch how he wished he had kissed homer more when hed had the chance he went from bed to bed kissing the boys it occurred to him he didnt know all their names but fie kissed them anyway he kissed all of them when he left the room smoky fields asked the darkness what was that all about but no one else was awake or else no one wanted to answer him i wish he would kiss me thought nurse edna who had a very alert ear for unusual goingson i think its nice mrs grogan said to nurse angela when nurse angela told her about it i think its senile nurse angela said but homer wells at wallys window did not know that dr larchs kisses were out in the world in search of him he didnt know eitherhe could never have imagined itthat candy was also awake and also worried if he does stay if he doesnt go back to st clouds she was thinking what will i do the sea tugged all around her both the darkness and the moon were failing there came that time when homer wells could make out the boundaries of the cider house but the roof did not wink to him no matter how he moved his head with no signal flashing to him homer may have thought he was speaking to the dead when he whispered good night fuzzy he did not know that fuzzy stone like melony was looking for him before the war one day that august a hazy sun hung over the coastal road between york harbor and ogunquit it was not the staring sun of marseilles and not the cool crisp sun that blinks on much of the coast of maine at that time of year it was a st clouds sunlight steamy and flat and meloriy was irritated by it and sweating when she accepted a ride in a milk truck that was heading inland she knew she was south of portland and that there was relatively little of the maine coast that lay south of portland yet it had taken her these months to search the apple orchards in this limited vicinity she avas not discouraged she knew shed had some bad luck and that her luck was due to improve shed managed to pick the pockets of several citizens of portland this tided her over for a while shed gotten in trouble with some navy men whose pockets shed tried to pick in kitteiy shed managed not to have sex with the men but they had broken her nose which had healed crookedly and they had chipped her two front teeththe big uppers not that she tended to smile a lot anyway but she had since adopted a rather closemouthed and tightlipped expression the first two orchards shed visited were within view of the ocean but they were not called ocean view and no one in either orchard had heard of the ocean view orchards she then found an inland orchard where someone told her he had heard of an ocean viiew but that he was sure it was just a name that the place wasnt anywhere near the coast she took a job washing bottles in a dairy in biddeford but she quit it as soon as shed made some traveling money the orchard between york harbour and ogunquit turned out to be called york farm which looked as plain as its name but melony told the milk truck driver to let her out there anyway it was at least an apple orchard someone might have heard of ocean view the foreman at york farm took one look at melony and assumed she was a wouldbe picker trying to get work ahead of the migrants youre about three weeks early he told her were only pickin the gravensteins this month and i dont need help pickin themthere aint that many you heard of an orchard called ocean view melony asked the foreman you used to pick there the foreman asked no im just looking for it melony said it sounds like a rest home the foreman said but when melony didnt even smile he stopped being friendly you any idea how many places there must be in maine called ocean view he asked melony shrugged if they were hiring at york farm in three weeks she thought she wouldnt mind staying some of the other pickers might have heard of the place where homer wells had gone you got anything for me to do melony asked the foreman in three weeksif you know how to pick he added there cant be much to picking apples melony said you think its easy the foreman asked come here he said and walked her through the dingy apple mart two older women were handlettering a wooden price list in the first orchard behind the apple mart the foreman proceeded to lecture melony on the art of apple picking you take an apple with its stem the foreman said but just above the stem is the bud for next years apple thats the spur he said you pull the spur you pull two years in one he demonstrated to melony how to twist the apple twist dont pull he told her melony reached into the tree and twisted an apple free she did it correctly she looked at the foreman and shrugged she took a bite of the apple which wasnt ripe she spit out the bite and threw the apple away thats a northern spy the foreman explained we pick them lasttheyre not ready before october melony was bored she started back toward the apple mart ill give you ten cents a bushel the foreman called after her only a nickel a bushel for drops or if you bruise the fruit you look pretty strong he said following after her if you get the hang of it you might pick ninety bushels a day ive had guys here loin a hundred bushels thats ten bucks a day he said come back in three weeks he added stopping next to the women working on the sign in the apple mart melony was already back on the road ill be somewhere else in three weeks she said to the foreman too bad the foreman said he watched her walk down the road headed back toward the coast she looks strong he said to one of the women in the mart ill bet she weighs about onesixty shes just a tramp the woman said about a mile away from the apple mart melony walked by an orchard where two workers were picking gravensteins one of the men waved to her melony started to wave back but thought better oif it she was not more than a hundred yards past the men when she heard their pickup truck coming after her the truck pulled up next to her off to the side of the road and the driver said to her you look like you lost your sweetheart good thing you found me the man in the passenger side of the truck opened the door before the truck stopped rolling you better leave me alone buster melony said to the driver but the other man was already around the truck and coming closer melony hopped over the road ditch and ran into the orchard the man pursued her whooping the driver killed the truck motor and joined the chasehe left his door open he was in such a hurry there was nowhere to hide but the orchards seemed endless melony ran down one row between the trees then up another the first man to chase her was gaining on her but she noticed that the driver lagged farther and farther behind he was a big slow man and he was huffing and puffing after hed passed five or six trees melony was huffing and puffing herself but she ran with a certain even strength and although the first smaller man was gaining on her she could hear him breathing harder and harder she crossed a dirt road into another orchard way behind her maybe two to three hundred yards she saw that the heavy driver had slowed to a determined walk get her charley he called to the faster man to charleys surprise melony stopped and turned to face him she caught her breath fairly quickly then she ran at charleyshe moved low to the ground a kind of animal whine in her throat and the man called charley did not have time to stop and catch his breath before she flung herself upon him they fell togetherwhen she felt her knee against his throat she jounced on him he made a choking sound and rolled on his side melony jumped up to her feet she stamped twice on his face and when charley managed to turn over on all fours she jumped up as high as she could and landed with both feet in the small of his back he was already unconscious when she pinned his arms behind him and bit his ear she felt her teeth meet she let him go and knelt beside him she caught her breath again then she spit on him when she stood up she saw that the heavy man had managed only to cross the dirt road into the second orchard charley get up he said wheezing but charley didnt move melony rolled charley over on his back and undid his belt she tugged it roughly through the loops until she had the belt off him the big man the driver was now only three or four apple trees away frdm her she wound one end of the belt twice around her wrist and fist when she let her arm hang at her side the buckle end of the belt touched the top of her foot the big man stopped only two trees away from her whatd you do to charley he asked her but melony started swinging the belt she swung it around and around her head faster and faster the square brass belt buckle began to whistle melony advanced on the heavy driver a man in his late forties or early fifties his hair was gray and thin and he had quite a paunch thrust ahead of himself he stood his ground for a moment and watched melony come nearer to him the belt was a broad strap of sweatandoilstained leather the brass buckle was the size of a mans palm with its square edges it hummed through the air like the north windit made a sound like a scythe hey the fat man said hey what buster melony said she suddenly lowered the belt and cracked the buckle across one of the mans shins where it lifted up a flap of blue jeans and skin that looked like a torn dollar bill when the man bent over to grab his legs she swiped the belt buckle across the side of his face he sat down suddenly and put his hand to his cheek where he discovered a gouge the approximate length and thickness of a cigarette he hadnt the time to contemplate this wound before the belt buckle smacked him squarely across the bridge of his nosethe force of the blow and his pain temporarily blinded him he tried to cover his head with one arm while he groped for melony with the other but she found it easy to hit him everywhere and he quickly drew up his knees to his chest and covered his face and head with both arms the buckle raked and nicked his spine for a while then she stopped using the buckle end to himshe just strapped him with the flat end of the belt across the backs of his legs and his ass it seemed she would never stop are the keys in that truck buster she asked him between blows yes he cried but she hit him some more before she left him she took the belt with her walking back through the first orchard occasionally taking a swipe at an apple with the tip of the belt with which she had developed some skill the man called charley regained consciousness but he didnt move or open his eyes is she gone charley the fat man asked after a while because he hadnt moved or opened his eyes either i hope so charley said but neither of the men moved until they heard melony start the truck it crossed her mind that she was in debt to dr larch for once getting her a job where she had learned to drive but it was a passing thought she turned the truck around and drove back to the apple mart where the foreman was surprised to see her she told the foreman in front of the women who were working on the sign that two of his men had tried to rape her one of the men the fat one was married to the woman who was handlettering the sign melony said to the foreman that he could fire those two men and give her their jobs i can do whatever the two of them do and better than they do it melony said or else she said to the foreman he could call the police and shed tell the police how shed been attacked the woman whose husband had assaulted melony was pale and silent but the other woman said to the foreman what shed said earlier shes just a tramp what do you want to listen to her for i can do everything you do too melony said to the woman especially everything you do on your back you look like youre shit on your back melony said and she flicked the flat end of the belt toward the woman who jumped away as if the belt were a snake hey thats charleys belt the foreman said right said melony this echo of homer wells nearly brought tears to her eyes charley lost it she added she went to the truck and took out her bundleher few things which were all wrapped in mrs grogans coat she used the belt to cinch the coat and its contents more securely together i cant fire those guys the foreman told her theyve worked here all their lives so call the police then melony said shes threatening you the fat mans wife said to the foreman no shit melony said the foreman got melony settled comfortably in the cider house you can stay here at least until the pickin crew comes he said i dont know if you want to stay here when theyre here sometimes theres women with them and sometimes theres kids but if its just men i dont think you want to stay here theyre negroes itll do for now anyway melony said looking around there were fewer beds than there were in the worthingtons cider house and it was a lot less neat and clean york farm was a much smaller poorer orchard than ocean view and there was no one there who cared very much about the style and shape of the quarters for the migrants york farm was without an olive worthing ton the vinegar smell was stronger in the york farm cider house and behind the press were dried clots of pomace that clung to the wall like apple scab there was no stove in the kitchen sectionjust a hot plate which tended to blow the old fuses there was one fuse box for the pump and grinder and the lowwatt overhead bulbs the light in the refrigerator was out but this at least made the mold less visible it was fine for melony who had contributed lastingly to the history of the many wrecked rooms in both the abandoned and the livedin buildings of st clouds this ocean viewthe one youre lookin for the foreman asked how come youre lookin for it im looking for my boyfriend melony told him she has a boyfriend the foreman wondered he went to see how the men were doing the fat man whose wife had accompanied him to the hospital although she had not spoken to him and wouldnt for more than three months sat rather placidly through his stitches but he grew quite excited when the foreman told him that hed fixed melony up in the cider house and had given her a jobat least through the harvest you gave her a job the fat man cried shes a killer then you better keep the fuck out of her way the foreman told him if you get in her way ill have to fire youshe damn near made me already the fat man had a broken nose and needed a total of fortyone stitches thirtyseven in his face and four in his tongue where he had bitten himself the man called charley was better off in the stitches department he required only fourto close the wound in his ear but melony had cracked two of his ribs by jumping on him he had received a concussion from having his head stamped on and his lower back would suffer such repeated muscle spasms that he would be kept off a ladder through the harvest holy cow charley said to the foreman id hate to meet the sonofabitch whos her boyfriend just keep out of her way the foreman advised him has she still got my belt charley asked the foreman if you ask her for your belt back ill have to fire you get yourself a new belt the foreman said you wont see me askin her for nothin charley said she didnt say her boyfriend was coming here did she he asked the foreman but the foreman said that if melony was looking for her boyfriend the boyfriend must not have given her any directions he must have left her and god help him if he left her the foreman said over and over again well said the woman in the apple mart who had called melony a tramp if you had a woman like that wouldnt you try to leave her in the first place the foreman said i wouldnt ever have a woman like that and in the second place if i did have her id never leave heri wouldnt dare in the cider house at york farmsomewhere inland from york harbor somewhere west of ogunquit with several hundred miles of coastline between her and homer wellsmelony lay listening to the mice sometimes they scurried sometimes they gnawed the first mouse bold enough to race across the foot of her mattress was swatted so hard with the buckle end of charleys belt that it flew across four beds all in a row and struck the wall with a soft thud melony promptly retrieved itit was quite dead its back broken with the aid of a pencil without a point melony was able to prop the dead mouse into a sitting position on her night table an inverted apple crate which she then moved to the foot of her bed it was her belief that the dead mouse might function as a kind of totem to warn other mice away and indeed no mouse bothered melony for several hours she lay in the weak light reading jane eyrethe empty dark orchard ripening all around her she reread twice that passage near the end of chapter twentyseven that concludes preconceived opinions foregone determinations are all i haive at this hour to stand by there i plant my foot with that she closed the book and turned out the light melony lay bravely on her back her broacl nostrils full of the sharp cidervinegar airthe same air homer wells is smelling she thought just before she fell asleep she whisperedalthough there were only the mice to hear hergood night sunshine the next day it rained it rained from kennebunkport to christmas cove there was such a strong northeast wind that the flags on the boats moored at the haven club even though they were saturated with rain pointed to shore and made a brisk snapping sound as constant as the chafe of ray kendalls lobster boat against the old wornrubber tires that padded his dock ray would spend the day under the john deere in building number two he was alternately replacing the tractors manifold and sleeping it was the place he slept best under a large familiar machine he was never detected his legs at times extended from under the vehicle in a posture of such extreme sprawl that he looked deadrun over or crushed one of the apple workers startled to see him would speak out ray is that you whereupon like dr larch brought back from ether ray kendall would wake up and say right here im right here some job huh the worried party would inquire yup ray would say some job all right the rain came pelting down the wind so strongly onshore that the gulls moved inland at york farm they huddled against the cider house and woke up melony with their fretting at ocean view they squatted together on the tin roof of the cider house where a crew of scrubbers and painters were at work again grace lynch as usual had the worst job scouring the thousandgallon cider tank she was kneeling inside the vat and the sound of her movements in there impressed the others with a kind of furtive energy as if an animal were scrounging for a nest or for its dinner meany hyde had left the cider house on what his wife florence called another bullshit errand meany had determined that the fan belt on the conveyor was loose and so he removed it and said he was taking it to ray kendall to see what ray could do about it so whats ray gonna do with a loose fan belt florence asked meany order a new one or take a piece out of that oneright i suppose meany said warily and what do you need the conveyor for today florence asked im just takin it to ray meany said peevishly you dont wanna work too much do you florence said and meany shuffled out into the rain he smiled and winked at homer wells as he was climbing into the pickup i got a lazy husband florence said happily thats better than some other kinds said irene titcomband everyone automatically looked in the direction of the thousandgallon vat where grace lynch was feverishly scrubbing irene and florence who had patient steady hands were painting the sashes and the window trim in the bedroom wing of the cider house homer wells and big dot taft and big dots kid sister debra pettigrew were painting the kitchen with broader more carefree strokes i hope you dont feel im crampin you big dot said to debra and homer i aint your chaperone or nothin if you want to make out just go right ahead debra pettigrew looked embarrassed and cross and homer smiled shyly it was funny he thought how you have two or three dates with someoneand just kiss them and touch them in a few odd placesand everyone starts talking to you as if youve got doing it on your mind every minute homers mind was much more on grace lynch in the vat than it was on debra pettigrew who stood right beside him painting the same wall when homer encountered the light switch by the kitchen door he asked big dot taft if he should just paint all around it or let florence and irene with their smaller brushes trim it more neatly just paint right over it said big dot taft we do this every year we just make it look new and fresh were not tryin to win no neatness contest by the light switch there was a tack that pinned a piece of typing paper to the wallthe type itself was very faint from long exposure to the sunlight that came through the kitchens curtainless windows it was some kind of list the bottom quarter of the page had been torn away whatever it was it was incomplete homer pulled the tack out of the wall and would have crumpled the paper and tossed it toward the trash barrel if the top line of type hadnt caught his attention cider house rules the top line said what rules he wondered reading down the page the rules were numbered please dont operate the grinder or the press if youve been drinking please dont smoke in bed or use candles please dont go up on the roof if youve been drinking especially at night please wash out the press cloths the same day or night they are used please remove the rotary screen immediately after youve finished pressing and hose it clean when the pomace is still wet on it please dont take bottles with you when you go up on the roof pleaseeven if you are very hot or if youve been drinkingdont go into the coldstorage room to sleep please give your shopping list to the crew boss by seven oclock in the morning there should be no more than half a dozen people on the roof at any one time if there were a few more rules homer couldnt read them because the page had been ripped off homer handed the torn paper to big dot taft whats all this about the roof he asked debra pettigrew you can see the ocean from the roof debra said that aint it said big dot taft at night you can see the ferris wheel and the carnival lights in cape kenneth big deal said homer wells its no big deal to me either big dot taft said but those darkies really like it they sit up on the roof all night some nights debra pettigrew said they get drunk up there and fall off some nights florence hyde announced from the bedroom wing they break bottles up there and cut themselves all up said irene titcomb well not every night they dont said big dot taft and one night one of them got so drunk and sweaty running the press that he passed out in the cold storage and woke up with pneumonia debra pettigrew said you dont exactly wake up with pneumonia said homer weils its more complicated than that excuse me debra said sulkily anyway nobody pays no attention to them rules big dot taft said every year olive writes them up and every year nobody pays no attention all the pickin crews weve ever had are just children said florence hyde if olive didnt go shoppin for them everyday theyd starve they never get themselves organized irene titcomb said one of them got his whole arm caught in the grinder big dot taft recalled not just his fool handhis whole arm yuck said debra pettigrew yuck is what his arm was all right said florence hyde how many stitches asked homer wells youre really curious you know that debra pettigrew asked him well they dont do no harm except to themselves said irene titcomb philosophically whats it matter if they want to drink too much and roll off the roof wasnt nobody ever killed here was there not yet said grace lynchs tight thin voice her words strangely amplified because she was speaking from the bottom of the thousandgallon vat the combination of the strangeness of her voice and the rareness of her making a contribution of any kind to their conversation made them all silent everyone was just working away when wally drove up in the green van with louise tobey he dropped louise off with her own bucket and brush and asked the rest of them if they needed anythingmore brushes more paint just give me a kiss honey said florence hyde just take us to the movies said big dot taft just propose to me just propose cried irene titcomb everyone was laughing when wally left it was almost lunchtime and everyone knew that squeeze louise had come to work particularly late she usually arrived with herb fowler more or less on time louise looked especially pouty this morning and no one spoke to her for a while well you can be havin your period or somethin and still say good mornin said big dot taft after a while good mornin said louise tobey ladeda said irene titcomb debra pettigrew bumped homer in the side when he looked at her she winked nothing else happened until herb fowler drove by and offered to take everyone to the drinkwater road diner for lunch homer looked at the vat but grace lynch made no appearance over its rim she just continued her scratching and hissing noises in the vats bottom she wouldnt have accepted the invitation anyway homer was thinking he probably should accept it to get away from grace lynch but he had promised himself to investigate the roof of the cider househe wanted to find the spot that had glinted to him so mysteriously in the moonlight and now that hed heard about the cider house rules and that you could see the oceanand the cape kenneth ferris wheelfrom the roof he wanted to climb up there even in the rain he went outside with all the others thinking that grace lynch might assume hed gone with them and then he told herb fowler out in the driveway that he was going to stay he felt a finger hook him in his blue jeans pocket one of the front ones and when herb and the others had gone he looked in his pocket and discovered the rubber the prophylactics presence in his pocket urged him up on the cider house roof in a hurry his appearance there surprised the gulls whose sudden and raucous flight surprised him he had not noticed them huddled on the slope of the roof that faced away from himand away from the wind the roof was slippery in the rain he had to grip the corrugated grooves with both hands and place his feet very close to each other as he climbed the pitch of the roof was not too steep or he wouldnt have been able to climb it at all to his surprise he found a number of planksold twobyfours nailed to the seaward side of the roofs apex benches he thought even at an angle they were at least more comfortable to sit on than the tin he sat there in the rain and tried to imagine the pleasure of the view but the weather was much too stormy for him to be able to see the farthest orchards the ocean was completely obscured and he had to imagine where on a clear night the ferris wheel and the carnival lights in cape kenneth would be he was getting soaked and was about to climb down when he saw the knife it was a big switchblade the blade end stuck into the twobyfour at the top of the roof alongside him the handle which was fake horn was cracked in two places and when homer wells tried to extract the blade from the wood the handle broke in two in his hands that was why it had been left there apparently with the handle broken the knife wouldnt close properly it wasnt safe to carry that wayand besides the blade was rusted the whole roof was rusted homer noticed there was no single spot shiny enough to have reflected the moonlight back to wallys window then he noticed the broken glass some larger pieces were caught in the corrugated grooves in the tin it must have been one of those pieces of glass that caught the moon homer thought beer bottle glass and rum bottle glass whiskey bottle glass and gin bottle glass he supposed he tried to imagine the black men drinking at night on the roof but the rain had soaked him through and the wind now thoroughly chilled him inching his way back down the roof to the edge where the ground was the safest jumphe cut his hand just a small cut on a piece of glass he didnt see by the time he went back inside the cider house the cut was bleeding freelyquite a lot of blood for such a small cut he thought and he wondered if perhaps there was a tiny piece of glass still inside the cut grace lynch must have heard him rinsing the wound in the kitchen sink if she hadnt heard him on the roof to homers surprise grace was still in the thousandgallon vat help me she called to him i cant get out it was a lie she was just trying to draw him to the edge of the tank but orphans have a gullible nature orphanage life is plain by comparison every lie is sophisticated homer wells although he approached the rim of the cider vat with trepidation approached steadily the quickness of her thin hands and the wiry strength with which they gripped his wrists surprised him he nearly lost his balancehe was almost pulled into the tank on top of her grace lynch had taken all her clothes off but the extreme definition of her bones struck homer more powerfully than anything forbidden in her nakedness she looked like a starved animal contained in a more or less humane trap humane except that it was evident from her bruises that her captor beat her regularly and hard the bruises on her hips and thighs were the largest the thumbprint bruises on the backs of her arms were the deepest purple hue and there was a yellowtogreen bruise on one of her small breasts that looked especially angry let me go said homer wells i know what they do where you come from grace lynch cried tugging on his wrists right said homer wells systematically he began to peel back her fingers but she scrambled nimbly up the side of the vat and bit him sharply on the back of his hand he had to push her then and he might have hurt her if they both hadnt heard the splashy arrival of wally in the green van grace lynch let homer go and scurried to put on her clothes wally sat in the van in the drenching rain and pumped the horn homer ran outside to see what he wanted get in wally shouted weve got to go rescue my stupid fatherhes in some kind of trouble at sanborns for homer wells whod grown up in a world without fathers it was a shock to hear that anyone who had a father would call his father stupid even if it was true there was a peck bag of gravensteins in the passenger seat of the van homer held the apples in his lap as wally drove down drinkwater road to sanborns general store the proprietors mildred and bert sanborn were among seniors oldest friends hed been a schoolboy with both of them and had once dated milly before hed met olive and before milly had married bert titus hardware and plumbing was next door to sanborns warren titus the plumber was standing on the porch of the general store not letting anyone inside when wally and homer drove into hearts rock its a good thing youre here wally warren said when the boys ran up to the porch your dads got some wild hair across his ass in the store homer and wally saw that mildred and bert sanborn hadfor the momentcornered senior in a niche of shelves reserved for baking goods senior appeared to have littered the floor and much of himself with all the flour and sugar within his reach his trapped appearance reminded homer of grace lynch whats the trouble pop wally asked his father mildred sanborn gave a sigh of relief to see wally but bert wouldnt take his eyes off senior trouble pop senior said he got in a rage when he couldnt find the dog food bert said to wally without looking away from senior bert thoroughly expected senior to bolt at any moment to another part of the store and destroy it what did you want with dog food pop wally asked his father dog food pop senior repeated its like he dont remember wally bert sanborn said we told him he didnt have a dog mildred said i remember doing it to you milly senior shouted there he goes again bert said senior senior he said gently were all your friends here i have to feed blinky senior said blinky was his dog when he was a boy milly sanborn told wally if blinky was still alive senior bert sanborn said hed be older than we are older than we are senior said lets go home pop wally said home pop senior said but he let homer and wally lead him to the van i tell you wally its not booze said warren titus who opened the side door of the van for them its not on his breath not this time its something else wally bert sanborn said who are you senior asked homer im homer wells mister worthington homer said mister worthington senior said when theyd driven for almost five minutes in silence senior shouted everyone just shut up when they got to ocean view olive met the van in the driveway she ignored senior and spoke to wally i dont know what hes had this morning unless its vodka it wasnt on his breath when he left i wouldnt have let him take the van if i thought hed been drinking i think its something else mom wally said with homers help he led senior to the bedroom got his shoes off and coaxed him to lie down on the bed you know i drilled milly once senior told his son sure you did pop said wally i drilled milly i drilled milly senior said wally tried to humor senior with a limerick senior had taught wally a lot of limericks but senior had difficulty remembering a limerick now even if wally talked him through it line by line remember the duchess of kent pop w rally asked his father sure senior said but he didnt say anything more oh pity the duchess of kent wally began but senior just listened her cunt is so dreadfully bent wally said bent senior said wally tried again two lines at a time oh pity the duchess of kent her cunt is so dreadfully bent dreadfully bent senior sang out oh pity the duchess of kent her cunt is so dreadfully bent the poor wench doth stammer i need a sledgehammer to pound a man into my vent my god thought homer wells but senior appeared to be baffled he said nothing wally and homer left him when they thought hed fallen asleep downstairs homer wells told olive and wally that he thought it was something neurological neurological olive said whats that mean wally said they heard senior cry out from upstairs vent he shouted homer wells who had a habit of repeating the pigtails of sentences knew that seniors repetitions were insane that habit was the first symptom he described in his letter about senior worthington to dr larch he repeats everything he wrote to dr larch homer also noted that senior appeared to forget the names of the most common things he recalled how the man had become stuck asking wally for a cigarettehe had just kept pointing at wallys breast pocket i think the word for cigarette had escaped him wrote homer wells homer had also observed that senior could not operate the latch on the glove compartment the last time that homer had driven him to sanborns for some simple shopping and the man had the oddest habit of picking at his clothes all the time its as if he thinks hes got dirt or hair or lint on his clothes wrote homer wells but theres nothing there olive worthington assured homer that the family doctor a geezer even older than dr larch was quite certain that seniors problem were entirely alcoholrelated doc perkins is too old to be a doctor anymore mom wally said doc perkins delivered youi guess he knows what hes doing olive said i bet i was easy to deliver wally said cheerfully ill bet you were imagined homer wells who thought that wally took everything in the world for granted not in a selfish or spoiled way but like a prince of maine like a king of new england wally was just born to be in charge dr larchs letter to homer wells was so impressive that homer immediately showed it to mrs worthington what you have described to me homer sounds like some kind of evolving organic brain syndrome dr larch wrote in a man of this age there arent a lot of diagnoses to choose from id say your best bet is alzheimers presenile dementia its pretty rare i looked it up in one of my bound volumes of the new england journal of medicine ticking imaginary lint off ones clothes is what neurologists call carphologia in the progress of deterioration common to alzheimers disease a patient will frequently echo back what is said to him this is called echolalia the inability to name even familiar objects such as a cigarette is due to a failure to recognize the objects this is called anomia and the loss of the ability to do any type of skilled or learned movement such as opening the glove compartment is also typical it is called apraxia you should prevail upon mrs worthington to have her husband examined by a neurologist i know there is at least one in maine its only my guess that its alzheimers disease alzheimers disease asked olive worthington you mean its a diseasewhats wrong with him wally asked homer wally cried in the car on the way to the neurologist im sorry pop he said but senior seemed delighted when the neurologist confirmed dr larchs diagnosis senior worthington was exuberant i have a disease he yelled proudlyeven happily it was almost as if someone had announced that he was cured what he had was quite incurable i have a disease he was euphoric about it what a relief it must have been to himfor a moment anywayto learn that he wasnt simply a drunk it was such an enormous relief to olive that she wept on wallys shoulder she hugged and kissed htomer with an energy homer had not known since he left the arms of nurse angela and nurse edna mrs worthington thanked homer over and over again it meant a great deal to olive although she had long ago fallen out of love with senior if she had ever truly loved him to know that this new information permitted her to renew her respect for senior she was overwhelmingly grateful to homer and to dr larch for restoring seniors selfesteemand for restoring some of her esteem for senior too all this contributed to the special atmosphere that surrounded seniors death at the end of the summer shortly before the harvest a sense of relief was far more prevalent than was a sense of grief that senior worthington was on his way to death had been certain for some time that in the nick of time he had managed to die with some honorof a bona fide disease bert sanborn saidwas a welcome surprise of course the residents of hearts rock and hearts haven had some difficulty with the termalzheimer was not a name familiar to the coast of maine in the workers at ocean view had particular trouble with it ray kendall one day made it easier for everyone to understand senior got als hammer disease he announced als hammer now there was a disease anyone could understand i just hope it aint catchin said big dot taft maybe you got to be rich to get it wondered meany hyde no its neurological homer wells insisted but that didnt mean anything to anyone except homer and so the men and women at ocean view developed a new saying as they got ready for the harvest that year you better watch out herb fowler would say or youll get als hammer and when louise tobey would show up late florence hyde or irene titcomb or big dot taft would ask her whats the matter you got your period or als hammer and when grace lynch would show up with a limp or with a noticeable bruise everyone would think but never say out loud she caught old als hammer last night for sure it seems to me wally said to homer wells that you ought to be a doctoryou obviously have an instinct for it doctor larch is the doctor said homer wells im the bedouin just before the harvestwhen olive worthington had put fresh flowers in the bedroom wing of the cider house and had typed a clean page of rules almost exactly the same rules from the previous years and had tacked them next to the light switch by the kitchen doorshe offered the bedouin a home i always hate it when wally goes back to college olive told homer and this year with senior gone im going to hate it more i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here homeryou could stay in wallys room i like having someone in the house at night ancl someone to talk to in the morning olive was keeping her back to homer while she looked out the bay window in the worthingtons kitchen the rubber raft that senior used to ride was bobbing in the water within her view but homer couldnt be sure if olive was looking at the raft im not sure how doctor larch would feel about it homer said doctor larch would like you to go to college one day olive said and so would i i would be happy to inquire at the high school in cape kenneth if theyd work with youif theyd try to evaluate what you know and what you need to learn youve had a veryodd education i know that doctor larch is interested in having you take all the sciences homer understood that her mind must have been recalling this from a letter from dr larch and latin said olive worthington latin said homer wells this was surely dr larchs work cutaneus maximus thought homer wells duramater not to mention good old umbilicus doctor larch wants me to be a doctor homer said to mrs worthington but i dont want to be i think he wants you to have the option of becoming a doctor should you change your mind olive said i think he said latin or greek they must have had quite some correspondence thought homer wells but all he said was i really like working on the farm well i certainly want you to keep working here olive told him i need your helpthrough the harvest especially i dont imagine youd be a fulltime student i have to talk to the high school but im sure theyd view you as something of an experiment an experiment said homer wells wasnt everything an experiment for a bedouin he thought about the broken knife hed found on the cider house roof was it there because he was supposed to find it and the broken glass a piece of which had signaled to him in his insomnia at wallys window was the glass on the roof in order to provide him with some message he wrote to dr larch requesting larchs permission to stay at ocean view ill take biology homer wells wrote and anything scientific but do i have to take latin nobody even speaks it anymore where did he get to be such a knowitall wondered wilbur larch who nevertheless saw certain advantages to homer wells not knowing latin or greek both the root of so many medical terms like coarctation of the aorta dr larch was thinking it can be a relatively mild form of a congenital heart disorder that could decrease as the patient grew older bythe time the patient was homers age the patient might have no murmur at all and only a trained eye could detect in an xray the slight enlargement of the aorta in a mild case the only symtoms might be a hypertension in the upper extremities so dont learn latin if you dont want to thought wilbur larch as for the best congenital heart defect for homer wells dr larch was leaning toward pulmonary valve stenosis from infancy and throughout his early childhood homer wells had a loud heart murmur dr larch wrotefor the record just to hear how it sounded at twentyone he noted elsewhere homers old heart murmur is difficult to detect however i find that the stenosis of the pulmonary valve is still apparent in an xray it might be barely detectable he knew homers heart defect was not for everyone to seethat was the point what was necessary was that it just be there dont take latin or greek if you dont want to dr larch wrote to homer wells its a free country isnt it homer wells was beginning to wonder in the same envelope with dr larchs letter was a letter dr larch had forwarded to him from good old snowy meadows in wilbur larchs opinion snowy was a fool but a persistent one hi homer its mesnowy snowy meadows began he explained that his name was now robert marshof the bangor marshes were the big furniture family snowy wrote the furniture family thought homer wells snowy went on and on about how hed met and married the girl of his dreams and how hed chosen the furniture business over going to college and how happy he was that hed gotten out of st clouds snowy added that he hoped homer had gotten out too and what do you hear from fuzzy stone snowy meadows wanted to know old larch says fuzzy is doing well id like to write fuzzy if you know his address fuzzy stones address thought homer wells and what did old larch mean that fuzzy is doing well doing well at what wondered homer wells but he wrote to snowy meadows that fuzzy was indeed doing well that he had misplaced fuzzys address for the moment and that he found apple farming to be healthy and satisfying work homer added that he had no immediate plans to visit bangor he would surely look up the furniture marshes if he was ever in town and no he concluded he didnt agree with snowy that a kind of reunion in st clouds was such a hot idea he said he was sure that dr larch would never approve of such a plan he confessed that he did miss nurse angela and nurse edna and of course dr larch himself but wasnt the place better left behind isnt that what its for homer wells asked snowy meadows isnt an orphanage supposed to be left behind then homer wrote to dr larch whats this about fuzzy stone doing welldoing well at what i know that snowy meadows is an idiot but if youre going to tell him some stuff about fuzzy stone dont you think you better tell me too in time in time thought wilbur larch wearily he was feeling harassed dr gingrich and mrs goodhall had prevailed upon the board of trustees the board had requested that larch comply with dr gingrichs recommendation of a followup report on the status of each orphans success or failure in each foster home if this added paperwork was too tedious for dr larch the board recommended that larch take mrs goodhalls suggestion and accept an administrative assistant dont i have enough history to attend to as is larch wondered he rested in the dispensary he sniffed a little ether and composed himself gingrich and goodhall he said to himself ginghall and goodrich he muttered richhall and ginggood goodging and hallrich he woke himself giggling what are you so merry about nurse angela said sharply to him from the hall outside the dispensary goodballs and ding dong wilbur larch said to her he went to nurse angelas office with a vengeance he had plans for fuzzy stone he called bowdoin college where fuzzy stone would successfully complete his undergraduate studies and harvard medical school where larch intended fuzzy to do very very well he told the registrars office at bowdoin that a sum of money had been donated to the orphanage at st clouds for the express purpose of paying the medical school expenses of an exceptional young man or woman who would be willing more than willing even dedicatedto serve st clouds could dr larch have access to the transcripts of bowdoins recent graduates who had gone on to medical school he told a slightly different story to harvard medical school he wanted access to transcripts of course but in this case the sum of money had been donated to establish a training fellowship in obsttstrics it was the first traveling wilbur larch had done since hed chased after clara the first time hed slept in a place other than the dispensary since world war i but he needed to familiarize himself with the transcript forms at bowdoin and at harvard medical school only in this way could he create a transcript for f stone he begged the use of a typewriter and some paperone of your blank transcript forms will make it easier for meand pretended to type out the names and credentials of a few interesting candidates i see so many whod be perfect he told them at bowdoin and harvard but its impossible to know if any of them could tolerate saint clouds were very isolated he confessed thanking them for their help handing them back their transcripts fuzzys in the proper place among the ss when he had returned to st clouds dr larch wrote to bowdoin and harvard requesting copies of the transcripts of a few outstanding graduates he had narrowed the choices down to these few he told them a copy of fuzzys transcript came in the mail with the others when larch had visited harvard medical school hed taken a cambridge post office box in fuzzys name now he wrote to the postmaster there requesting the mail for f stone be forwarded to st clouds the pobox address would be useful too if young dr stone were to pursue his zealous instincts to a mission abroad then he sent an empty envelope to the cambridge address and waited for its return when the letter came back to himwhen he was sure the system workedhe composed the rest of the history regarding f stone and his adoptive family named eames and sent it along to the board of trustees together with fuzzys address he did not have to invent anything regarding curly day he cringed to write the name roy rinfret and he told the truth regarding snowy meadows and most of the others although he had difficulty typing the furniture marshes without laughing out loud and when he came to the case of homer wells he thought very carefully about how to word the matter of homers heart among the members of the board there wasnt a heart specialist or a radiologist or even a surgeon there was a very old gp who dr larch felt sure never read anything at all larch didnt count dr gingrich as a doctor he counted psychiatrists as nothing at all and he felt confident that he could bully mrs goodhall with the slightest terminology he confessed to the board isnt everyone flattered by a confidence that he had refrained from mentioning the matter of homers heart to homer he admitted to stalling but argued that worrying the boy might contribute to his problem and he wanted the boy to gain confidence in the outside world before burdening him with this dangerous knowledgeyet he intended to burden homer with it shortly larch said he had informed the worthingtons of the heart defect they might therefore be more than usually protective of homer he had not bothered to explain the presence of the actual murmur to them or to detail the exact characteristics of pulmonary valve stenosis he would be happy to provide the board with such details should they request them he had fun imagining mrs goodhall scrutinizing an xray he concluded that he thought the boards request for the followup reports had been a good idea and that he had enjoyed himself immensely in preparing them contrary to needing an administrative assistant to perform such a service dr larch said he had felt positively energized by the welcome tasksince he added following up on his orphans adoptive lives was always on his mind and sometimes right off the top of my head he thought he was exhausted and forgot to circumcise a newborn baby boy whom nurse angela had prepared for the operation he mistook a woman awaiting an abortion for a woman hed delivered the previous day and therefore told her that her baby was very healthy and doing fine he spilled a small amount of ether on his face and needed to irrigate his eye he became cross because he had over ordered prophylactics he had far too many rubbers around since melony had left no one was stealing the rubbers anymore when he thought of melony he became worried which also made him cross he returned to nurse angelas office and wrote a report which was real concerning david copperfields lisp he neglected to mention that david copperfield had been delivered and named by homer wells he wrote a slightly fictitious report on the orphan called steerforth remarking that his delivery was so straightforward that nurse edna and nurse angela had been able to handle it entirely without a doctors assistance he wrote the truth about smoky fields the boy hoarded food a trait that was more common in the girls division than in the boys and smoky was beginning to exhibit a pattern of insomnia that larch had not witnessed at st clouds since the days of homer wells the memory of those days brought instant tears to his eyes but he recovered himself sufficiently to write that both and he and mrs grogan were worried about mary agnes cork she had exhibited frequent depressions since melonys departure he also told the truth about melony although he chose not to include any acts of vandalism larch wrote of mary agnes perhaps she sees herself as inheriting melonys former position but she hasnt the dominating character that usually attends any powerful or leadership role that idiot dr gingrich is going to like that larch imagined role larch said aloud scornfully as if orphans have the luxury of imagining that they have roles impulsively he went to the dispensary and inflated two prophylactics got to use these things up in some way he thought he used a laundrymarking pen to write the name gingrich on one prophylactic and the name goodhall on the other then he took these jolly balloons and went in search of nurse angela and nurse edna they were in the girls division having tea with mrs grogan when dr larch found them aha larch said surprising the ladies who were unused to see him making an appearance in the girls division except for the evening dose of jane eyreand even more unused to see him waving marked prophylactics in their faces doctor gingrich and missus goodhall i presume larch said bowing to everyone whereupon he took a scalpel and popped the prophylactics on the floor above them mary agnes cork heard the noise and sat up in her bed where she had been lying in a sullen depression mrs grogan was too stunned to speak when dr larch left the ladies with their tea and returned to the hospital nurse edna was the first to say something wilbur works so hard she said cautiously isnt it a wonder that he can find the time to be playful mrs grogan was still struck speechless but nurse angela said i think the old man is losing his marbles nurse edna appeared to be personally wounded by this remark she returned her teacup to her saucer very steadily before she spoke i think its the ether she said quietly yes and no said nurse angela do you think its homer wells too mrs grogan asked yes nurse angela said its ether and its homer wells and its old age and its those new members on the board its just everything its saint clouds its what happened to melony too mrs grogan said but she burst into tears when she said melonys name upstair mary agnes cork heard melonys name and cried homer wells will be back i just know it nurse angela said but this so dissolved her in tears that nurse edna was obliged to comfort both her and mrs grogan there there nurse edna said to them but she wondered where is the young man or the young woman whos going to take care of us all oh lord began mrs grogan upstairs mary agnes cork bowed her head and clasped her hands by pressing the heels of her hands together at a certain angle she could revive a little of the pain from her old collarbone injury oh lord mrs grogan prayed support us all day long until the shadows lengthen arid the evening comes and the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done that night in the darkness in keeping with the moan of an owl nurse edna whispered amen to herself while she listened to dr larch making his rounds kissing each of the boyseven smoky fields who hoarded his food and hid it in his bed which smelled and who only pretended to be asleep on the ferris wheel high above the carnival grounds and the beach at cape kenneth homer wells was trying to spot the roof of the cider house but it was dark and there were no lights on in the cider houseand even if the cider house had been lit or there had been the clearest daylight imaginable the house was too far away only the brightest carnival lights especially the distinctive lights of the ferris wheel were visible from the cider house roof the visibility didnt exist the other way around i want to be a pilot wally said i want to fly i really do if i had my pilots licence and my own plane i could do all the spraying at the orchardsid get a crop duster but id paint it like a fighter its so clumsy driving those dumb sprayers around behind those dumb tractors up and down those dumb hills it was what candys father ray was doing at the moment meany hyde was sick and everett taft the foreman had asked ray if hed mind driving a night sprayray knew the equipment so well it was the last spray before harvest and somewhere in the blackened inland greenery that lay below the ferris wheel raymond kendall and vernon lynch were spraying their way through ocean view sometimes wally sprayed homer was learning how and sometimes herb fowler sprayed but herb protested against night spraying i have better things to do at night hed say it was better to spray at night because the wind dropped in the evenings especially along the coast wally wasnt spraying tonight because it was his last night home he was going back to college in the morning youll look after candy for me wont you homer wally asked as they loomed above the rocky coast and cape kenneths crowded beach the scarce bonfires from the summersend beach parties winked the wheel descended candy would finish her senior year at the girls academy in camden shed get home most weekends but wally would stay in orono except for thanksgiving and christmas and the longer vacations right said homer wells if i were flyingin the war wally said if i joined and if i flew i mean if i were in a bomber id rather be in the b than the b id rather be strategic than tactical bomb things not people and i wouldnt want to fly a fighter in the war thats shooting people too homer wells didnt know what wally was talking about homer didnt follow the warhe didnt know the news a b was a fourengine heavy bomber that was used for strategic bombingbridges oil refineries fuel depots railroad tracks it hit industry it didnt drop its bombs on armies that was the work of the ba medium tactical bomber wally had studied the war with more interest than he pursued his botany or his other course at the university of maine but the war which was calledin maine in those daysthe war in europe was very far from homers mind people with families are the people who worry about wars do bedouins have wars wondered homer wells and if they do do they much care he was eager for the harvest to start he was curious about meeting the migrants about seeing the negroes he didnt know why were they like orphans did they not quite belong were they not quite of sufficient use because he loved wally he resolved to keep his mind off candy it was the kind of bold resolve that his sense of elevation on the ferris wheel enhanced and this evening there was a plan homer wellsan orphan attached to routineliked for every evening to have a plan even if he was not that excited about this one he drove wally in seniors cadillac to kendalls lobster pound where candy was waiting fie left candy and wally there ray would be out spraying for several hours and candy and wally wanted a private goodbye together before ray came home homer would go pick up debra pettigrew and take her to the drivein in cape kenneth it would be their first drivein without candy and wally and homer wondered if the touchthisbutnotthat rules would vary when he and debra were alone as he navigated an exact path through the pettigrews violent dogs he was disappointed in himself that he wasnt dying to find out whether debra would or wouldnt a particularly athletic dog snapped very loudly near his face but the chain around the dogs neck appeared to strangle the beast in midair it landed solidly on its rib cage with a sharp groan and was slow getting to its feet why do people want to keep dogs homer wondered it was a western movie from which homer could only conclude that crossing the country in a wagon train was an exercise in lunacy and sorrow at the very least he thought one should make some arrangements with the indians before starting out the film was void of arrangements and homer was unable to arrange for the use of herb fowlers rubbers which he kept in his pocketin case debra pettigrew was substantially freer than she had ever been before but her ultimate restraint was no less firm no she yelled once theres no need to shout said homer wells removing his hand from the forbidden place well thats the second time you did that particular thing debra pointed outa mathematical certainty and other certainties apparent in her voice in maine in homer wells was forced to accept that what they called necking was permitted what they called making out was within the rules but that what he had done with melonywhat grace lynch appeared to be offering him and what candy and wally did or had done at least onceto all of that the answer was no but how did candy ever get pregnant homer wells wondered with debra pettigrews damp little face pressed to his chest her hair tickled his nose but he could just manage to see over herhe could witness the indian massacre with herb fowler dispensing prophylactics even faster than dr larch passed them out to the women at st clouds how could wally have let her get pregnant wally was so provided for homer wells couldnt understand why wally was even interested in war but would an orphan ever worry that he was spoiled or untested is an orphan ever bored or restless or are those luxurious states of mind he remembered that curly day had been bored are you asleep homer debra pettigrew asked him no he said i was just thinking thinking what debra asked how come wally and candy do it and we dont homer asked her debra pettigrew appeared to be wary of the question or at least she was surprised by its bluntness she was cautious in composing an answer well she began philosophically theyre in lovewally and candy arent they right said homer wells well you never said you were in lovewith me debra added and i never said i waswith you thats right homer said so its against the rules to do it if you arent in love look at it this way said debra pettigrew she bit her lower lip it was absolutely as hard as she had ever thought if youre in love and theres an accidentif somebody gets pregnant is what i mean then if youre in love you get married wally and candy are in love and if they have an accident theyll get married maybe thought homer wells maybe the next time but what he said was i see what he thought was so those are the rules its about accidents its about getting pregnant arid not wanting to have a baby my god is everything about that he considered taking the rubber out of his pocket and presenting it to debra pettigrew if the argument was that an accidental pregnancy was really the only reason for not doing it what did she think of the alternative that herb fowler so repeatedly presented but by arguing in this fashion wouldnt he be suggesting that all intimacy could be crudely accounted foror was crude itself or was intimacy crude only for him in the movie several human scalps were dangling from a spear for reasons unfathomable to homer wells the indians carried on and on about the spear as if such a spear were a treasure suddenly a cavalry officer had his hand pinned to a tree by an arrow the man went to great lengths using his teeth and his other hand to free the arrow from the tree but the arrow still stuck very prominently through his hand an indian with a tomahawk approached the cavalry officer it looked like the end of him especially since he insisted on trying to cock his pistol with the thumb of the hand that had the arrow stuck through it why doesnt he use his good hand homer wells wondered but the thumb worked the pistolfinallywas cocked homer wells concluded from this demonstration that the arrow had managed to pass through the hand without damaging the branch of the median nerve that goes to the muscles of the thumb lucky man thought homer wells as the cavalry officer shot the approaching indian in the heart it must be the heart thought homer wells because the indian died instantly it was funny how he could see the pictures of the hand in grays anatomy more clearly than he could see the movie he took debra home begging her forgiveness for not offering to walk her to her door one of the dogs was loose it had broken its chain and it pawed furiously at the driversside window which homer had rolled up just in time it breathed and slobbered and clicked its teeth against the glass which became so fogged and smeared that homer had difficulty seeing when he turned the cadillac around cut it out eddy debra pettigrew was screaming at the dog as homer drove away would you just cut it out eddy please but the dog chased the cadillac for nearly a mile eddy thought homer wells didnt nurse angela name someone eddy once he thought so but it must have been someone who was adopted quicklythe way it was supposed to be done by the time he got to kendalls lobster pound ray was home he was making tea and warming his deeply lined cracked hands on the potunder his ragged nails was the mechanics permanent oilblack grime well look who survived the drivein ray said you better sit a while and have some tea with me homer could see that candy and wally were out on the dock huddled together lovebirds dont feel the cold i guess ray said to homer it dont look like theyre finished saying goodbye homer was happy to have the tea and to sit with ray he liked ray and he knew ray liked him whatd you learn today ray asked him homer was going to say something about the drivein rules but he guessed that wasnt what ray meant nothing said homer wells no ill bet you learned somethin ray said youre a learner i know because i was one once you see how somethin is done you know how to do it yourself thats all i mean ray had taught homer oil changes and lubrications plugs and points and engine timing fuelline maintenance and frontend alignment hed shown the boy how to tighten a clutch andto rays astonishment homer had remembered hed also shown him a valve job and how to replace the universal in one summer homer wells had learned more about mechanics than wally knew but it wasnt just homers manual dexterity that ray was fond of ray respected loneliness and an orphan he imagined had a fair share of that shoot said ray ill bet theres nothin you couldnt learnnothin your hands wouldnt remember if your hands ever got to hold it whatever it was right said homer wells smiling he remembered the perfect balance in the set of dilators with the douglass points how you could hold one steadily between your thumb and index finger just by resting the shaft against the pad of your middle finger it would move only and exactly when and where you moved it and how wonderfully precise it was homer thought that the vaginal speculum comes in more than one size that there was always a size that was just right and how sensitive an adjustment could be accomplished by just a half turn of the little thumbscrew how the duckbilled speculum could hold the lips of the vagina open exactly wide enough homer wells twentyone breathing in the steam from the hot tea sat waiting for his life to begin in the cadillac with wally driving back to ocean viewthe rockandwater prettiness of hearts haven giving way to the scruffier more tangled land of hearts rockhomer said i was wonderingbut dont tell me if youd rather not talk about iti was just wondering how it happened that candy got pregnant i mean werent you using anything sure i was wally said i was using one of herb fowlers rubbers but it had a hole in it it had a hole in it not a big one wally said but i could tell it had a holeyou know it leaked any hole is big enough homer said sure is wally said the way he carries the things around with him it probably got poked by something in his pocket i guess you dont use the rubbers herb throws at you anymore said homer wells thats right wally said when wally was asleepas peacefully as a prince as outtotheworld as a kinghomer wells slipped out of bed found his pants found the rubbers in the pocket and took one to the bathroom where he filled it up with water from the cold water tap the hole was tiny but precisea fine but uninterrupted needle of water streamed out of the end of the rubber the hole was bigger than a pinprick but not nearly so large as a nail would make maybe herb fowler used a thumbtack or the point of a compass thought homer wells it was a deliberate sort of hole perfectly placed dead center the thought of herb fowler making the holes made homer wells shiver he remembered the first fetus hed seen on his way back from the incineratorhow it appeared to have fallen from the sky he recalled the extended arms of the murdered fetus from three mile falls and the bruise that was greengoingtoyellow on grace lynchs breast had graces journey to st clouds originated with one of herb fowlers prophylactics in st clouds he had seen anguish and the plainer forms of unhappinessand depression and destructiveness he was familiar with meanspiritedness and with injustice too but this is evil isnt it wondered homer wells have i seen evil before he thought of the woman with the ponys penis in her mouth what do you do when you recognize evil he wondered he looked out wallys windowbut in the darkness in his minds eye he saw the eroded still unplanted hillside behind the hospital and the boys division at st clouds he saw the thick but damaged soundabsorbing forest beyond the river that carried away his grief for fuzzy stone if he had known mrs grogans prayer he would have tried it but the prayer that homer used to calm himself was the end of chapter of david copperfield there being twenty more chapters to go these words were perhaps too uncertain for a prayer and homer spoke them to himself uncertainlynot as if he believed the words were true but as if he were trying to force them to be true by repeating and repeating the words he might make the words true for him for homer wells i have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me they are gone and i resume the journey of my story but all that night he lay awake because the phantoms of those days were not gone like the tiny terrible holes in the prophylactics the phantoms of those days were not easy to detectand their meaning was unknownbut they were there in the morning wally left halfheartedly for the university in orono the next day candy left for camden academy the day before the picking crew arrived at ocean view homer wellsthe tallest and oldest boy at cape kenneth high schoolattended the first class meeting of senior biology his friend debra pettigrew had to lead him to the laboratory homer got lost en route and wandered into a class called wood shop the textbook for senior biology was b a bensleys practical anatomy of the rabbit the text and illustrations were intimidating to the other students but the book filled homer wells with longing it was a shock for him to realize how much he missed dr larchs wellworn copy of grays homer at first glance was critical of bensley whereas grays began with the skeleton bensley began with the tissues but the teacher of the class was no fool a cadaverous man was mr hood but he pleased homer wells by announcing that he did not intend to follow the text exactlythe class like grays would begin with the bones comforted by what for him was routine homer relished his first look at the ancient yellowed skeleton of a rabbit the class was hushed some students were repulsed wait till they get to the urogenital system thought homer wells his eyes skimming over the perct bones but this thought shocked him too he realized he was looking forward to getting to the poor rabbits urogenital system he had a lateral view of the rabbits skull he tested himself with the naming of partsit was so easy for him cranial orbital nasal frontal mandible maxilla premaxilla how well he remembered clara and the others who had taught him so much as for clara she was finally put to rest in a place she might not have chosen for herselfthe cemetery in st clouds was in the abandoned part of town perhaps this was appropriate thought dr larch who supervised claras burial because clara herself had been abandoned and surely she had been more explored and examined than she had ever been loved nurse edna was shocked to see the departing coffin but nurse angela assured her that none of the orphans had passed away in the night mrs grogan accompanied dr larch to the cemetery larch had asked her to come with him because he knew that mrs grogan enjoyed every opportunity to say her prayer there was no minister or priest or rabbi in st clouds if holy words were in order someone from three mile falls came and said them it was a testimony to wilbur larchs increasing isolationism that he refused to send to three mile falls for anything and that he preferred mrs grogan if he was forced to listen to holy words at all it was the first burial that wilbur larch had wept over mrs grogan knew that his tears were not for clara larch wouldnt have buried clara if hed thought that homer wells would ever be corning back well hes wrong nurse angela said even a saint can make a mistake homer wells will be back he belongs here like it or not is it the ether dr larch wondered he meant was it the ether that gave him the sense increasingly that he knew everything that was going to happen for example he had anticipated the letter that arrived for f stoneforwarded from fuzzys pobox address is this some sick joke nurse angela asked turning the envelope around and around ill take that please dr larch said it was from the board of trustees as he had expected that was why theyd wanted those followup reports from him and why theyd requested the addresses of the orphans they were checking up on him larch knew the letter to fuzzy began with cordial good wishes it said that the board knew a great deal about fuzzy from dr larch but they wished to know anything further about fuzzys st clouds experienceanything naturally that he wanted to share with them the st clouds experience sounded to wilbur larch like a mystical happening the attached questionnaire made him furious although he did amuse himself by trying to imagine which of the questions had been conceived by the tedious dr gingrich and which of them had flowed from the chilling mind of mrs goodhall dr larch also had fun imagining how homer wells and snowy meadows and curly dayand all the otherswould answer the silly questionnaire but he took the immediate business very seriously he wanted fuzzy stones answers to the questionnaire to be perfect he wanted to be sure that the board of trustees would never forget fuzzy stone there were five questions every single one of them was based upon the incorrect assumption that every child must have been at least five or six years old before heor she was adopted this and other stupidities convinced wilbur larch that dr gingrich and mrs goodhall were going to be easy adversaries was your life at st clouds properly supervised please include in your answer if you ever felt that your treatment was especially affectionate or especially instructive we would certainly want to hear if you felt your treatment was ever abusive did you receive adequate medical attention at st clouds were you adequately prepared for your new life in a foster home and do you feel your foster home was carefully and correctly chosen would you suggest any possible improvements in the methods and management of st clouds specifically would you feel things might have gone more smoothly for you if there had been a more youthful energetic staff in residenceor perhaps simply a larger staff was any attempt made to integrate the daily life of the orphanage with the life of the surrounding community what community screamed wilbur larch he stood at the window in nurse angelas office and stared at the bleak hillside where wally had wanted to plant apple trees why hadnt they come back and planted the stupid trees even if all that business was just to pleaise me larch wondered what community he howled oh yes he thought i could have asked the stationmaster to offer them religious instructionto speak to them about the terrifying chaos of homeless souls hovering in every niche of the sky i could have asked that worthy gentleman to display his underwear catalogues too i could have asked the family of child beaters from three mile falls to come once a week and give lessons could have detained a few of the women having abortions and asked them to reveal to all of us why they didnt want to have children at that particular moment in their lives or i could have invited a few of the mothers back they could have explained to the children why they were left here that would have been instructive oh god thought wilbur larch what a community we could have beenif only id been more youthful more energetic oh yes i have made some mistakes he thought and for a black hour or two he remembered some of them if only i knew how to build a breathing machine he thoughtif only i could have come up with a different set of lungs for fuzzy and maybe homer wells will tell them that he was not adequately prepared for his first view of the fetus on the hill and had there been a way to prepare homer for three mile falls for the drapers of waterville or for the winkles being swept away what was my choice wondered wilbur larch i suppose that i could have not apprenticed him we are put on this earth to be of use wilbur larch as fuzzy stone wrote to the board of trustees it is better to do than to criticize wrote that young idealist fuzzy stone it is better to do anything than to stand idly by you tell em fuzzy thought dr larch and so fuzzy stone told the board of trustees that the hospital at st clouds was a model of the form it was larch who made me want to be a doctor fuzzy wrote that old guy larchhes an inspiration you talk about energy the guy is as full of pep as a teenager you better be careful about sending young people to st cloudsold larch will work them so hard theyll get sick theyll get so tired out theyll retire in a month and you think those old nurses dont do a days work let me tell you when nurse angela is pitching for stickball youd think you were competing in an olympic event you talk about affectionatethats them all right theyre always hugging and kissing you but they know how to shake some sense into you too you talk about supervised fuzzy stone wrote did you ever find out that you were being watched by owls thats nurse edna and nurse angelatheyre owls they dont miss a thing and some of the girls used to say that mrs grogan knew what they did before they did it before they even knew they were going to do it and you talk about community wrote fuzzy stone st clouds was something special why i remember people would get off the train and walk up the hill just to look the place overit must have been because we were such a model community for that area i just remember these people coming and going coming and going they were just there to look us over as if we were one of the marvels of maine one of the marvels of maine thought wilbur larch struggling to get control of himself a stray puff of wind blew in the open window in nurse angelas office carrying some of the black smoke from the incinerator with it the smoke brought larch nearer to his senses id better stop he thought i dont want to get carried away he rested in the dispensary after his historical effort nurse edna looked in on him once wilbur larch was one of the marvels of maine to her and she was worried about him larch was a little worried himself when he woke where had the time gone the problem is that i have to last he thought he could rewrite history but he couldnt touch time dates were fixed time marched at its own pace even if he could convince homer wells to go to a real medical school it would take time it would take a few years for fuzzy stone to complete his training i have to last until fuzzy is qualified to replace me thought wilbur larch he felt like hearing mrs grogans prayer again and so he went to the girls division a little early for his usual delivery of jane eyre he eavesdropped in the hall on mrs grogans prayer i must ask her if shed mind saying it to the boys he thought then wondered if it would confuse the boys coming so quickly on the heels of or just before the princes of maine kings of new england benediction i get confused myself sometimes dr larch knew grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest mrs grogan was saying and peace at the last amen thought wilbur larch the saint of st clouds who was seventysomething and an ether addict and who felt that hed come a long way and still had a long way to go when homer wells read the questionnaire sent him by the st clouds board of trustees he did not know exactly what made him anxious of course dr larch and the others were getting older but they were always older to him it did occur to him to wonder what might happen to st clouds when dr larch was too old but this thought was so troubling that he tucked the questionnaire and the return envelope to the board into his copy of practicalanatomy of the rabbit besides it was the day the migrants arrived it was harvest time at ocean view and homer wells was busy he and mrs worthington met the picking crew at the apple mart and led them to their quarters in the cider housemore than half the crew had picked at ocean view before and knew the way and the crew boss was what mrs worthington called an old hand he looked very young to homer it was the first year that mrs worthington dealt directly with the picking crew and their boss the hiring relationship by mail had been one of senior worthingtons responsibilities and senior had always maintained that if you kept a good crew boss year after year all the hiringand the necessary takingcharge of the crew during the harvestwould be conducted by the boss his name was arthur rose and he looked about wallys agejust barely older than homeralthough he must have been older hed been the crew boss for five or six years one year senior worthington had written to the old man whod been his crew boss for as long as olive could remember and arthur rose had written back to senior saying he was going to be the crew boss nowthe old boss arthur rose had written hes dead tired of traveling as it turned out the old boss was just dead but arthur rose had done a good job he brought the right number of pickers and very few of them ever quit or ran off or lost more than a day or two of good work because of too much drinking there seemed to be a firm control over the degree of fighting among themeven when they were accompanied by a woman or two and when there was an occasional child among them the child behaved there were always pickers who fell off ladders but thered been no serious injuries there were always small accidents around the cider pressbut that was fast often latenight work when the men were tired or drinking a little and there was the predictable clumsiness or drinking that led to the infrequent accidents involved in the almost ritualistic use of the cider house roof running a farm had given olive worthington a warm feeling for the daylight hours and a grave suspicion of the night the most trouble that people got into in olives opinion was trouble that they encountered because they stayed up too late olive had written arthur rose of seniors death and told hirn that the pickingcrew responsibility of ocean view had now fallen to her she wrote him at the usual addressa po box in a town called green south carolinaand arthur rose responded promptly both with his condolences and with his assurance that the crew would arrive as always on time and in correct numbers he was true to his word except when writing his first name on an envelope or when she annually noted it in his christmas card happy holidays arthur olive worthington never called him arthur no one else called him arthur either for reasons that were never explained to homer wells but perhaps for a presence of authority that was necessary for a good crew boss to maintain he was mister rose to everybody when olive introduced him to homer wells that measure of respect was made clear homer olive said this is mister rose and this is homer wells olive added glad to know you homer said mr rose homer has become my good right hand olive said afffectionately glad to hear that homer said mr rose he shook homers hand strongly although he let go of the hand with unusual quickness he was no better dressed than the rest of thepickingcrew and he was slender like most of them yet he managed a certain style with shabbiness if his jacket was dirty and torn it was a pinstriped suit jacket a doubledbreasted model that had in its history given someone a degree of sharpness and mr rose wore a real silk necktie for a belt his shoes were also good and good shoes were vital for farm work they were old but well oiled resoled comfortablelooking and in good condition his socks matched his suit jacket had a watch pocket and in it was a gold watch that worked he regarded the watch naturally and often as if time were very important to him he was so cleanshaven helooked as if he might never have needed a shave his face was a smooth brick of the darkest unsweetened bitter chocolate and in his mouth he expertly moved around a small brightwhite mint which always surrounded him with a fresh and alert fragrance he spoke and moved slowlymodestly yet deliberately in both speech and gesture he gave the impression of being humble and contained yet when one observed him standing still and not speaking he looked extraordinarily fast and sure of himself it was a hot indiansummer day and the apple mart was inland enough to miss what little sea breeze there was mr rose and mrs worthington stood talking among the parked and movingf arm vehicles in the applemart lot the rest of the picking crew waited in their carsthe windows rolled down an orchestra of black fingers strumming the sides of the cars there were seventeen pickers and a cookno women or children this year to olives relief very nicemr rose said about the flowers in the cider house mrs worthington touched the rules shed tacked to the wall by the kitchen light switch as she was leaving and youll point out these to everyone wont you please olive asked oh yes im good at rules said mr rose smiling you all come back and watch the first press homer mr rose said as homer held open the van door for olive im sure you got better things to watchmovies and stuffbut if you ever got some time on your hands you come watch us make a little cider about a thousand gallons he added shyly he scuffed his feet as if he were ashamed that he might be bragging all we need is eight hours and about three hundred bushels of apples said mr rose a thousand gallons he repeated proudly on the way back to the apple mart olive worthington said to homer mister rose is a real worker if the rest of them were like him they could improve themselves homer didnt understand her tone certainly he had heard in her voice admiration sympathyand even affectionbut there was also in her voice the ice that encases a longago and immovable point of view fortunately for melony the picking crew at york farm included two women and a child melony felt safe to stay in the cider house one of the women was a wiife and the other woman was the first womans mother and the cook the wife picked with the crew while the old lady looked after the food and the childwho was silent to the point of nonexistence there was only one shower and it was outdoorsinstalled behind the cider house on a cinderblock platform under a former grape arbor whose trellises were rotted by the weather the women showered first every evening and they permitted no peeking the york farm crew boss was a mild manit was his wife who came alongand he raised no objections to melonys sharing the cider house with his crew his name was rather it was a nickname stemming from the mans laconic habit of remarking during each activity that hed rather be doing something else his authority seemed less certain or at least less electrical than the authority commanded by mr rose no one called him mister rather he was a steady but not an exceptionally fast picker yet he always accounted for over a hundred bushels a day it took melony just one day to observe that his fellow workers paid rather a commission they gave him one bushel for every twenty bushels they picked after all rather explained to melony i get them the job he was fond of saying that his commission under the circumstances was rather small but rather never suggested that melony owed him anything after all i didnt get you your job he told her cheerfully by her third day in the field she was managing eighty bushels she also assisted as a bottler with the first cider press yet melony was disappointed shed found the time to ask if anyone had heard of ocean view and no one had perhaps because he viewed everything with slightly less cynicism than melony brought to each of her experiences homer wells needed a few days to notice the commission mr rose exacted from his crew he was the fastest picker among them without ever appearing to rushand he never dropped fruit he never bruised the apples by bumping his canvas picking bucket against the ladder rungs mr rose could have managed a hundred and ten bushels a day on his own buteven with his speed homer realized that his regular hundred and fifty or hundred and sixty bushels a day were very high he took as his commission only one bushel out of every forty but he had a crew of fifteen and no one picked fewer than eighty bushels a day mr rose would pick a very fast half dozen bushels then hed just rest for a while or else hed supervise the picking technique of his crew a little slower georgehed say you bruise that fruit whats it gonna be good for just cider george would say thats right mr rose would say cider apples is only a nickel a bushel okay george would say suremr rose wouldsay everything gonna be okay the third day it rained and no one picked both apples and pickers slip in the rain and the fruit is more sensitive to bruising homer went to watch meany hyde and mr rose conduct the first cider press which they directed out of range of the splatter they put two men on the press and two bottling and they shifted fresh men into the rotation almost every hour meany watched only one thing whether the racks were stacked crookedly or whether they were right when the press boards are stacked crookedly you can lose the pressthree bushels of apples in one rness eight or ten gallons of cider and the pomace flying everywhere the men at the press won rubber aprons the bottlers wore rubber boots the whine of the grinder reminded homer wells of the sounds he had only imagined at st cloudsthe sawmill blades that were earsplitting in his dreams and in his insomnia the pump sucked the spout disgorged a pulp of seeds and skin and mashed apples and even worms if there were worms it looked like what nurse angela calmly called upchuck from the big tub under the press the cider whirred through a rotary screen which strained it into the thousandgallon vat where only recently grace lynch had exposed herself to homer in eight hours of no nonsense they had a thousand gallons the conveyor tracks rattled the jugs along straight into cold storage a man named branches was assigned to hose out the vat and rinse off the rotary screen his name stemmed from his dexterity in the big treesand his scorn for using a ladder a man named hero washed the press cloths meany hyde told homer that the man had been a kind of hero once thats all heard hes been comin here for years but he was a hero just once meany added as if there might be more shame attached to the rarity of the mans heroism than there was glory to be sung for his moment in the sun ill bet you was bored mr rose said to homer who liedwho said it had been interesting eight hours of hanging around a cider mill are several hours in excess of interesting you got to come at night to get the real feel of it mr rose confided this was just a rainyday press when you pick all day and press all night then you get the feel of it he winked at homer assuming hed managed to make some secret life instantly clear then he handed homer a cup of cider homer had been sipping cider all day but the cup was offered solemnlysome pledge about pressing cider at night was being made on the spotand so homer took the cup and drank his eyes watered instantly the cider was so strongly laced with rum that homer felt his face flush and his stomach glow without further acknowledgment mr rose took back the cup and offered the remaining swallows to the man called branches who bolted it down without needing to make the slightest adjustment on the spray nozzle of his hose when homer wells was loading some cider jugs into the van he saw the cup make its way between meany hyde and the man called heroall of it under the calm supervision of mr rose who had not revealed the source of the rum to anyone the phrase a gift for concealment occurred to homer wells in regard to mr rose homer had no idea where such a phrase had come from unless it was charles dickens or charlotte brontehe doubted he had encountered it in grays anatomy or in bensleys practical anatomy of the rabbit there were no movements wasted in what movement there was to be seen by mr rosea quality that homer wells had formerly associated only with dr larch surely dr larch had other quite different qualities as did mr rose back at the apple mart the harvest appeared at a momentary standstill held up by the rain which big dot taft and the mart women watched sourly from their assemblyline positions along the conveyor tracks in the packing line no one seemed very excited by the cider homer brought it was very bland as the first cider usually is and too waterycomposed typically of early macs and gravensteins you dont get a good cider until october meany hyde had told homer and mr rose had confirmed this with a solemn nod a good cider needs some of those lastpicked applesgolden delicious and winter banana and the baldwins or russets too ciders got no smoke before october said big dot taft inhaling her cigarette listlessly homer wells listening to big dot taft felt like her voicedulled wally was away candy was away and the anatomy of a rabbit was after clara no challenge the migrants whom hed so eagerly anticipated were just plain hard workers life was just a job he had grown up without noticing when was there nothing remarkable in the transition they had four days of good picking weather at ocean view before meany hyde said there would be a night press and mr rose again invited homer to come to the cider house and get the feel of it homer had a quiet dinner with mrs worthington and only after hed helped her wash the dishes did he say he thought hed go to the cider house and see if he could help with the pressing he knew they would have been hard at work for two or three hours what a good worker you are homer olive told him appreciatively homer wells shrugged it was a cold clear night the very best weather for mclntosh appleswarm sunny days and cold nights it was not so cold that homer couldnt smell the apples as he walked to the cider house arid it was not so dark that he needed to keep on the dirt road he could go overland because he was not on the road he was able to approach the cider house unobserved for a while he stood outside the range of the lights blazing in the mill room and listened to the sounds of the men working the press and talking and laughing and the murmur of the men who were talking and laughing on the cider house roof homer wells listened for a long time but he realized that when the men were not making an effort to be understood by a white person he couldnt understand them at allnot even mr rose whose clear voice appeared to punctuate the other voices with calm but emphatic interjections they were also pressing cider at york farm that night but melony wasnt interested she wasnt trying to understand either the process or the lingo the crew boss rather had made it clear to her that the men resented her working the press or even bottling it cut into their extra pay melony was tired from the picking anyway she lay on her bed in the bunkroom of the cider house reading jane eyre there was a man asleep at the far end of the bunkroom but melonys reading light didnt disturb himhe had drunk too much beer which was all that rather allowed the men to drink the beer was kept in the coldstorage room right next to the mill and the men were drinking and talking together while they ran the press the friendly woman named sandra who was rathers wife was sitting on a bed not far from melony trying to mend a zipper on a pair of one of the mens trousers the mans name was sammy and he had only one pair of trousers every so often hed wander in from the mill room to see how sandras work was progressingan overlarge ballooning pair of undershorts hanging almost to his knobby knees his legs below the knees like tough little vines sandras mother whom everyone called ma and who cooked plain but large meals for the crew lay in a big lump on the bed next to sandra more than her share of blankets piled on top of hershe was always cold but it was the only thing she complained about sammy came into the bunkroom sipping a beer and bringing with him the applemash odor of the mill room the splatter from the press dotted his bare legs legs like that no wonder you want your pants back sandra said what are my chances sammy asked one your zipper is jammed two you tore it off your pants sandra said what you in such a hurry with your zipper for ma asked without moving from her lumped position shit sammy said he went back to the press every once in a while the grinder caught on somethinga thick stem or a congestion of seedsand it made a noise like a circular saw gagging on a knot when that happened ma would say there goes somebodys hand or there goes somebodys whole head drunk too much beer and fell in over it all melony managed to read she wasnt being antisocial in her view the two women were nice to her once they realized she was not after any of the men the men were respectful of her workand of the mark upon her that was made by the missing boyfriend although they teased her they meant her no harm she had lied successfully to one of the men and the lie as she knew it would had gotten around the man was named wednesday for no reason that was ever explained to melonyand she wasnt interested enough to ask wednesday had asked her too many questions about the particular ocean view she was looking for and the boyfriend she was trying to find she had snagged her ladder in a loaded tree and was trying to ease it free without shaking any apples to the ground wednesday was helping her when melony said pretty tight pants im wearing wouldnt you say wednesday looked at her and said yeah i would you can see everything in the pockets right melony asked wednesday looked again and saw only the odd sickle shape of the partially opened hornrim barrette tight and hard against the worn denim it dug into melonys thigh it was the barrette that mary agnes cork had stolen from candy and melony had stolen for herself one day she imagined her hair might be long enough for the barrette to be of use until such a time she carried it like a pocket knife in her rightthigh pocket whats that wednesday asked thats a penis knife melony said a what knife wednesday said you heard me melony said its real small and its real sharpits good for just one thing whats that wednesday asked it cuts off the end of a penis melony said real fast real easyjust the end if the picking crew at york farm had been a knifecarrying crew someone might have asked melony to display the penis knifejust as an object of general appreciation among knifecarrying friends but no one asked the story appeared to hold it allied itself with the other stories attached to melony and solidified the underlying uneasy feeling among the workers at york farm that melony was no one to mess with around melony even the beer drinkers behaved the only ill effect of the york farm picking crew drinking beer while they pressed cider was the frequency of their urinating which melony objected to only when they peed too near the cider house hey i dont want to hear that shed holler out the window when she could hear anyone pissing i dont want to smell it later either get away from the building whats the matteryou afraid of the dark sandra and ma liked melony for that and they enjoyed the refrain whenever they heard someone peeing they would not fail to holler in unison whats the matter you afraid of the dark but if everyone tolerated melonys hardness or even appreciated her for it no one liked her reading at night she was the only one who read anything and it took a while for her to realize how unfriendly they thought reading was how insulted they felt when she did it when they finished pressing that night and everyone settled into bed melony asked as usual if her reading light was going to bother anyone the light dont bother nobody wednesday said there were murmurs of consent and rather said you all remember cameron there was laughter and rather explained to melony that cameron who had worked at york farm for years had been such a baby that he needed a light on all night just to sleep he thought animals was gonna eat him if he shut out the light sammy said what animals melony asked cameron didnt know somebody said melony kept reading jane eyre and after a while sandra said its not the light that bothers us melony yeah someone said melony didnt get it for a while but gradually she became aware that they had all rolled toward her in their beds and were watching her sullenly okay she said so what bothers you what you readin about anyway wednesday asked yeah sammy said whats so special bout that book its just a book melony said pretty big deal that you can read it huh wednesday asked what said melony maybe if you like it so much rather said we might like it too you want me to read to you melony asked somebody read to me once sandra said it wasnt me ma said it wasnt your father either i never said it was sandra said i never heard nobody read to nobody sammy said yeah somebody said melony saw that some of the men were propped on their elbows in their beds waiting even ma turned her great lump around and faced melonys bed quiet everybody rather said for the first time in her life melony was afraid after all her efforts and her hard traveling she felt she had been returned to the girls division without being aware of it but it wasnt only that it was the first time anyone had expected something of her she knew what jane eyre meant to her but what could it mean to them shed read it to children too young to understand half the words too young to pay attention until the end of a sentence but they were orphansprisoners of the routine of being read to aloud it was the routine that mattered melony was more than halfway in her third or fourth journey through jane eyre she said im on page two hundred and eight theres a lot thats happened before just read it sammy said maybe i should start at the beginning melony suggested just read what you readin to yourself rather said gently her voice had never trembled before but melony began the wind roared high in the great tree which embowered the gates she read whats embowered wednesday asked her like a bower melony said like a thing hanging over you like for grapes or roses its a kind of bower where the shower is sandra said oh someone said but the road as far as i could see melony continued to the right hand and left was all still and solitary whats that sammy asked solitary is alone melony said like solitaire you know solitaire rather said and there was an aproving murmur shut up your interruptin sandra said well we got to understand wednesday said just shut up ma said read rather said to melony and she tried to go on the roadall still and solitary save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out it was but a long pale line unvaried by one moving speck melony read unwhat someone asked unvaried means unchanged not changed melony said i know that wednesday said i got that one shut up sandra said a puerile tear melony began but she stopped i dont know what puerile means she said its not important that you know what every word means okay someone said a puerile tear dimmed my eye while i lookeda tear of disappointment and impatience ashamed of it wiped it away there we know what it is anyway wednesday said i lingered melony read you what sammy asked hung around to linger means to hang around melony said sharply she began again the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber and drew close her curtain of dense cloud the night grew dark its gettin scary now wednesday observed rain came driving fast on the wind melony had changed gale to wind without their knowing it i wish he would come i wish he would come exclaimed seized with hypochondriac foreboding melony stopped with that tears filled her eyes and she couldnt see the words there was a long silence before anyone spoke what was she seized with sammy asked frightened i dont know melony said sobbing some kind of fear i think they were respectful of melonys sobs for a while and then sammy said i guess its some kind of horror story what you want to read that before you try to sleep rather asked melony with friendly concern but melony lay down on her bed and turned off her reading light when all the lights were out melony felt sandra sit on her bed beside her if it had been ma she knew her bed would have sagged more heavily you ask me you better forget that boyfriend sandra said if he didnt tell you how to find him he aint no good anyway melony had not felt anyone stroke her temples since mrs grogan in the girls division at st clouds she realized she missed mrs grogan very much and for a while this took her mind off homer wells when everyone else was asleep melony turned her reading light back on whatever failure jane eyre might be for someone else it had always worked for melonyit had helped herand she felt in need of its help now she read another twenty pages or so but homer wells would not leave her mind i must part with you for my whole life she read with horror i must begin a new existence amongst strange faces and strange scenes the truth of that closed the book for her forever she slid the book under her bed in the bunkroom in the cider house at york farm where she would leave it had she just read the passage from david copperfield that homer wells so loved and repeated to himself as if it were a hopeful prayer she would have discarded david copperfield too i have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me fat chance melony would have thought she knew that all the phantoms of those days were attached to her and homer more securely than their shadows and so melony cried herself to sleepshe was not hopeful yet she was determined her minds eye searching the darkness for homer wells she could not have seen him that nighthe was so well hidden beyond the range of the lights shining from the mill room at ocean view even if hed sneezed or fallen down the sound of the grinder and the pump would have concealed his presence he watched the redeyed glow of the cigarettes that darted and paused above the roof of the cider house when he got cold he went to watch them pressing and to have a little cider and rum mr rose seemed glad to see him he gave homer a drink with very little cider in it and together they watched the orchestra of the pump and grinder a man named jack who had a terrible scar across his throat a hardtosurvive kind of scaraimed the spout a man named orange slapped the racks in place and received the splatter with a wild kind of pride his name was orange because he had tried to dye his hair once and orange was how it turned outthere was no evidence of that color on him now the rum had made jack and orange both savage about their business and defiantly unwary of the flying mess yet homer felt that mr rose who seemed sober was still in controlthe conductor of both the men and the machinery and operating them both at full throttle lets try to get out of here by midnight mr rose said calmly jack choked the flow of pomace to the top rack orange levered the press into place in the other corner of the mill room two men whom homer wells didnt know were bottling at high speed one of the men began to laugh and his partner started to laugh with him so loudly that mr rose called out to them whats so funny one of the men explained that his cigarette had fallen out of his mouth into the vat at this announcement even jack and orange began to laugh and homer wells smiled but mr rose said quietly then you better fish it out nobody wants that muckin up the cider the men were quiet now just the machinery went on with its sluicing and screaming go on mr rose repeated go fish the man with the lost cigarette stared into the thousandgallon vat it was only half full but it was still a swimming pool he took off his rubber boots but mr rose said not just the boots take off all your clothes and then go take a showerand be quick about it we got work to do what the man said i aint gonna strip and go wash just to go swimmin in there youre filthy all over said mr rose be quick about it hey you can be quick about it the man said to mr rose you want that butt out of there you can fish it out yourself it was orange who spoke to the man what business you in orange asked him hey what the man asked what business you in man orange asked say you in the apple business man jack advised the man say what the man asked just say you in the apple business man orange said it was at that moment that mr rose took homers arm and said to him you got to see the view from the roof my friend the tug at his elbow was firm but gentle mr rose very gracefully led homer out of the mill room then outside by the kitchen door you know what business mistuh rose is in man homer heard orange asking he in the knife business man he heard jack say you dont wanna go in the knife business with mistuh rose homer heard orange say you just stay in the apple business you do fine man jack said homer was following mr rose up the ladder to the roof when he heard the shower turn on it was an inside showermore private than the shower at york farm except for their cigarettes the men on the roof were hard to see but homer held mr roses hand and followed him along the plank on the rooftop until they found two good seats you all know homer mr rose said to the men on the roof there was a blur of greetings the man called hero was up there and the man called branches there was someone named willy and two or three people homer didnt know and the old cook whose name was black pan the cook was the shape of a stew pot it had required some effort for him to gain his perch on the roof someone handed homer a bottle of beer but the bottle was warm and full of rum its stopped again branches said and everyone stared toward the sea the nightlife lights of cape kenneth were so low along the horizon that some of the lights themselves were not visibleonly the reflections from them especially when the lights were cast out over the oceanbut the high ferris wheel blazed brightly it was holding still loading new riders letting off the old maybe it stop to breathe branches said and everyone laughed at that someone suggested that it stopped to fart and everyone laughed louder then willy said when it gets too close to the ground it has to stop i think and everyone appeared to consider this seriously then the ferris wheel started again and the men on the roof of the cider house released a reverential rnoan there it go again hero said it like a star black pan the old cook said it look real cool but you get too close it burn youit hotter than aflame its a ferris wheel said homer wells it a what willy said a what wheel branches asked a ferris wheel said homer wells thats the cape kenneth carnival and thats the ferris wheel mr rose nudged him in the ribs but homer didnt understand no one spoke for a long time and when homer looked at mr rose mr rose softly shook his head i heard of somethin like that black pan said i think they had one in charleston its stopped again hero observed its letting off passengersriders said homer wells its taking on new riders people ride that fuckin thing branches asked dont shit me homer hero said again homer felt the nudge in his ribs and mr rose said mildly you all so uneducatedhomers havin a little fun with you when the bottle of rum passed from man to man mr rose just passed it along dont the name homer mean nothin to you mr rose asked the men i think i heard of it the cook black pan said homer was the worlds first storyteller mr rose announced the nudge at homers ribs was back and mr rose said our homer knows a good story too shit someone said after a while what kind of wheel you call it homer branches asked a ferris wheel said homer wells yeah someone said everyone laughed a fuckin ferris wheel hero said thats pretty good one of the men homer didnt know rolled off the roof everyone waited until he was on the ground before they called down to him you all right asshole black pan asked yeah the man said and everyone laughed when mr rose heard the shower start up again he knew that his bottle man had found the cigarette and was washing the cider off himself willy and hero youre bottlin now said mr rose i bottled last time hero said then you gettin real good at it said mr rose ill press for a while someone said jack and orange are goin good mr rose said well just let them go for a while homer sensed that he should leave the roof with mr rose they helped each other with the ladder on the ground mr rose spoke very seriously to homer you got to understand mr rose whispered they dont want to know what that thing is what good it do them to know okay said homer wells who stood a long while out of the range of the lights blazing in the mill room now that he was more familiar with their dialect he could occasionally understand the voices from the roof its stopped again he heard branches say yeah it takin on riders someone said and everyone laughed you know maybe its an army place black pan said what army someone asked we almost at war black pan said i heard that shit someone said its somethin for the airplanes to see black pan said whose airplanes hero asked there it go again branches said homer wells walked back through the orchards to the worthington house he was touched that mrs worthington had left the light over the stairs on for him and when he saw the light under her bedroom door he said quietly good night missus worthington im back good night homer she said he looked out wallys window for a while there was no way at that distance that he could witness the reaction on the cider house roof when the ferris wheel in cape kenneth was shut off for the nightwhen all the lights went out with a blink what did the men on the roof have to say about that he wondered maybe they thought that the ferris wheel came from another planet and when all the lights went out that it had returned there and wouldnt fuzzy stone have loved to see it thought homer wells and curly day and young copperfield and it would have been fun to ride it with melonyjust once to see what she would have said about it dr larch wouldnt be impressed was anything a mystery to dr larch in the morning mr rose chose to rest his magic hands between trees he came up to homer who was working as a checker in the orchard called frying pan counting the onebushel crates before they were loaded on the flatbed trailer and giving every picker credit for each bushel picked i want you to show me that wheel mr rose said smiling the ferris wheel said homer wells if you dont mind showin me said mr rose there just cant be no talk about it right homer said we better go soon before it gets any colder and they close it for the season ill bet its pretty cold riding it now i dont know if i want to ride it until i see it said mr rose sure said homer mrs worthington let him take the van but when he picked up mr rose at the cider house everyone was curious weve got to check somethin in the far orchard mr rose told the men what far orchard he talkin about black pan asked hero when homer and mr rose got in the van homer wells remembered his ride on the ferris wheel with wally it was much colder now and mr rose was subdued all the way to cape kenneth and uncharacteristically drawn into himself as they walked through the carnival together the summer crowd was gone some of the carnival events were already closed up tight dont be nervous homer said to mr rose the ferris wheel is perfectly safe im not nervous about no wheel said mr rose you see a lot of people my color around here homer had detected nothing hostile in the looks from the people as an orphan he always suspected that people singled him out to stare atand so he had not felt especially singled out in the company of mr rose but now he noticed more of the looks and realised that the looks an orphan might detect were only imagined by comparison when they got to the ferris wheel there was no line but they had to wait for the ride in progress to be over when the wheel stopped homer and mr rose got on and sat together in one chair we could each sit in our own chairs if you prefer said homer wells keep it like it is said mr rose when the wheel began its ascent he sat very still and straight and held his breath until they were nearly at the top of the rise over theres the orchard pointed homer wells but mr rose stared straight ahead as if the stability of the entire ferris wheel relied on each riders maintaining perfect balance whats so special about doin this asked mr rose rigidly its just for the ride and the view i guess said homer wells i like the view from the roof mr rose said when they started the descent of the wheel turn mr rose said its a good thing i didnt eat much today by the time they passed ground level and began their ascent again a substantial crowd had formedbut they didnt appear to be standing in line for the next ride there were only two couples and one boy by himself sharing the wheel with homer and mr rose and when they were at the top of the wheel turn again homer realized that the crowd below them had formed to stare at mr rose they come to see if niggers fly mr rose said but aint goin nowherenot for no ones entertainment they come to see if the machine is gonna break down tryin to carry a niggeror maybe they wanna see me throw up just dont do anything homer wells said thats the advice i been hearin all my life boy mr rose said as they started their descent mr rose leaned out of the chairquite dangerously farther than was necessaryand vomited in a splendid arc over the crowd below them the crowd moved as one but not everyone moved in time when their chair was at the bottom of the descent again the ferris wheel was stopped so that the sick man could get off the crowd had retreated except for a young man who was especially splattered as homer wells and mr rose were leaving the ferris wheel grounds the young man came forward and said to mr rose you looked like you meant to do that who means to get sick said mr rose he kept walking and homer kept up with him the young man was about homers age he should have homework thought homer wellsif hes still in school its a school night i think you meant to the young man said to mr rose who stopped walking away then what business you in mr rose asked the boy what the young man asked but homer wells stepped between them my friend is sick homer wells said please just leave him alone your friend the boy said ask me what business im in mr rose said to the boy what fuckin business are you in mister the young man shouted at mr rose homer felt himself neatly shoved out of the way he saw that mr rose was standing very suddenly chest to chest with the boy there was no sour smell of vomit on mr roses breath however somehow mr rose had slipped one of those mints in his mouth the alertness that had been missing when mr rose felt ill was back in his eyes the boy seemed surprised that he was standing so close to mr rose and so suddenly he was a little taller and quite a bit heavier than mr rose yet he looked unsure of himself i said what fuckin business are you in mister the boy repeated and mr rose smiled im in the throwinup business mr rose said in a humble manner someone in the crowd laughed homer wells felt a surge of vast relief mr rose smiled in such a way that allowed the boy to smile too sorry if any of it got on you mr rose said nicely no problem said the young man turning to leave after taking a few steps the boy turned inquisitively in mr roses direction but mr rose had grasped homer wells by the arm and was already walking on homer saw shock on the boys face the young mans flannel jacket which was still zipped shut was flapping wide opena single crisp slash had slit it from the collar to the waistevery button on the boys shirt was gone the boy gaped at himself and then at mr rose who did not look back and then the boy allowed himself to be pulled into the comfort of the crowd howd you do that homer asked mr rose when they reached the van your hands got to be fast mr rose said your knife got to be sharp but you do it with your eyes your eyes keep their eyes off your hands the wideopen jacket of the boy made homer remember clara and how a scalpel made no mistakes only a hand makes mistakes his chest was cold and he was driving too fast when homer turned off drinkwater road and drove through the orchards to the cider house mr rose said you see i was right wasnt i what good is itto apple pickersto know about that wheel it does no good to know about it thought homer wells and what good would it do melony to know about it or curly day or fuzzyor any bedouin am i right mr rose demanded right said homer wells opportunity knocks after the harvest at york farm the foreman asked melony to stay on to help with the mousing we have to get the mice before the ground freezes or else theyll have the run of the orchards all winter the foreman explained the men used poison oats and poison corn scattering the poison around the trees and putting it in the pine mice tunnels poor mice thought melony but she tried mousing for a few days when she saw a pine mouse tunnel she tried to conceal it she never put any poison in it and she only pretended to scatter the oats and corn around the trees she didnt like the way the poison smelled she would dump it into the dirt road and fill her bag with sand and gravel and scatter that instead have a nice winter mice she whispered to them it began to get very cold in the cider house they gave her a woodburning stove which melony vented through a window in the bunkroom the stove kept the toilet from freezing the morning the outdoor shower was frozen was the morning melony decided to move on she only briefly regretted not being able to stay and save more mice if youre lookin for another orchard the foreman warned her you wont find any thats hirin in the winter id like a city job for the winter melony told him what city the foreman asked melony shrugged she had securely strapped up her small bundle of things in charleys belt the sleeves of mrs grogans coat reached only halfway down her forearms and the coat was an especially tight fit across the shoulders and the hips even so melony managed to look comfortable in it theres no real cities in maine the foreman told her it wont take much of a city to be a city for me melony said he watched her walk to the same part of the road where hed called goodbye to her before it was that time of year when the trees are bare and the sky looks like lead and underfoot the ground feels more unyielding every dayyet its too early for snow or else theres a freak storm and the snow doesnt last for some reason the foreman felt a strong desire to leave with melony he surprised himself by muttering out loud i hope it snows soon what one of the applemart women said so long the foreman called to melony but she didnt answer him good riddance said one of the women in the mart the slut another one said what makes her a slut the foreman asked sharply who you seen her sleepin with shes just a tramp one of them said at least shes interesting the foreman snapped the women regarded him for a moment before one of them spoke up got a crush on her do you she asked ill bet you wish you was that boyfriend shes lookin for another woman said which drew a teasing sort of laughter from all the mart women its not that the foreman snapped i hope she never finds that boyfriendfor his sake the foreman said and for hers he added the woman whose fat husband had tried to rape melony turned away from this conversation she opened the large communal thermos on the table next to the cash register but when she tried to pour herself some coffee none came out what came out instead was poison oats and poison corn if melony had actually meant to poison any of them she would have been more restrained in the proportions it was clearly just a message and the applemart women regarded it as silently as if they were trying to read bones you see what i mean the foreman asked them he picked up an apple from a display basket on the counter and took a healthy chomp the apple had been left out in the cold so long that it was partially frozen and so mealy in the foremans mouth that he instantly spat it out it was very cold on the road to the coast but the walking warmed melony up also since there was no traffic she had no choice about walking when she reached the coastal highway she didnt have to wait long for a ride a pale but jolly boy driving a panel truck stopped for her yarmouth paint and shellac at your service the boy said to melony he was a little younger than homer wells andin melonys opinionnot nearly so worldlylooking the truck reeked of woodstain smells and of varnish and creosote im a woodtreatment expert the boy said to her proudly at best a salesman melony thought more likely a delivery boy she smiled tightly not showing her chipped teeth the boy fidgeted awaiting some form of greeting from her i can make anyone nervous in less than a minute melony thought uh where you goin the boy asked herthe panel truck sloshing along the city melony said what city the boy said now melony allowed her lips to part with her smile the worried boy now staring at the troubled history of her mouth you tell me melony said i gotta go to bath the boy said nervously melony stared at him as if hed said he had to have a bath bath she repeated its a city sort of the woodtreatment expert told her it was claras city dr larch or homer wells could have told melonyold clara had come to st clouds from bath but melony didnt know that and wouldnt have cared her relationship to clara had been unpleasantly envious homer wells knew clara more intimately than he knew melony it might have interested melony that bath would put her much closer to ocean view than shed been at york farmthat there might even be residents of bath who would have heard of an ocean view orchards there were certainly many bath residents who could have directed her to hearts haven or to hearts rock you wanna go to bath the boy asked her cautiously again melony showed him her damaged teeth she was displaying less of a smile than of the manner in which a dog might show its hackles right she said wally came home for thanksgiving candy had been home for several weekends in the early fall but homer had not known how to initiate seeing her without wally wally was surprised that homer and candy hadnt seen each other and from candys embarrassment with wallys surprise homer detected that she had been equally troubled about initiating a meeting with him but the turkey had to be basted every fifteen minutes the table had to be set and olive was too obviously enjoying having a full house againthere was no time to feel awkward raymond kendall had shared a thanksgiving dinner with the worthingtons before but never without seniors semipresence ray went through a few minutes of struggling to be overly polite before he relaxed and talked shop with olive dad acts like hes having a date candy said to olive in the kitchen im flattered olive said squeezing candys arm and laughing but that was the end of any further nonsense homer volunteered to carve the turkey he did such a good job that olive said you should be a surgeon homer wally laughed candy looked at her plate or at her hands in her lap and ray kendall said the boys just good with his hands if youve got good hands once you do a thing your hands wont forget how thats like you ray olive said which moved the attention away from homers work with the knife he carved every bit of meat off the bones as quickly as possible wally talked about the war he said hed thought about dropping out of college to go to flying school so if there is a warif we get into it i meanthen ill already know how to fly youll do no such thing olive said to him why would you want to do such a thing candy asked him i think youre being selfish what do you mean selfish wally asked a war is for your country its serving your country to you its an adventure candy said thats whats selfish about it youll do no such thing anyway olive repeated i was too young to go to the last war ray said and if theres another one ill be too old lucky you olive said thats right candy said ray shrugged i dont know he said i wanted to go to the last one i tried to lie about my age but someone told on me now you know betterolive said im not so sure of that ray said if theres a new one therell be lots of new weaponstheyre buildin stuff you cant even imagine i try to imagine it wally said i imagine the war all the time except the dying wally olive worthington said carrying the turkey carcass out to the kitchen i dont think youve imagined the dying right said homer wells who imagined the dying all the time candy looked at him and smiled you should have called me on the weekends homer she said yeah why didnt you wally asked him too busy with debra pettigrew thats why homer just shook his head too busy with the practical anatomy of the rabbit olive called from the kitchen the what wally said but olive was wrong it had taken homer only about three weeks of senior biology to realize that he knew more about the particular animal under scrutiny and its relation to human anatomy than did his cadaverous teacher mr hood it was as wilbur larch could have guessed the urogenital system that revealed mr hoods deficiencies in comparison to the experience of young dr wells in discussing the three stages of specialization of the uterus mr hood became confused the intrauterine life of the rabbit embryo is only thirty days between five to eight young are born in keeping with the primitive nature of the little animal the rabbit has two complete uteri the structure of the organ at this stage is called uterusduplex the structure of the organ in the human female which homer wells knew very wellwherein two uterine tubes open into a single uterine cavityis called uterus simplex the third stage of uterine structure falls between the twoa partially fused condition existing in some mammals sheep for example it is called uterusbicornis poor mr hood attempting to reveal the secrets of the uterus upon the chalky blackboard confused his duplex with his bicornis he called a sheep a rabbit and vice versa it was a smaller error than if hed imagined the human female had two complete uteri and had spread this misinformation to the class but it was an error homer wells caught it it was the first time he had been put in a position of correcting an authority an orphan is especially uncomfortable and insecure in such a position wrote dr wilbur larch excuse me sirsaid homer wells yes homer said mr hood his gauntness in a certain light made him appear as exposed as the many rabbit cadavers lying open on the students laboratory tables he looked skinned almost ready for labeling a kind but weary patience was in his eyes they were the mans only alert features its the other way around sir said homer wells pardon me said mr hood the rabbit has two complete uteri the rabbit is uterusduplexnot the sheep sir homer said the sheeps uterus is partially fused together its almost onethe sheep is uterus bicornis the class waited mr hood blinked for a moment he looked like a lizard regarding a fly but he suddenly retreated isnt that what i said he asked smiling no the class murmured you said it the other way around well its my mistake then mr hood said almost cheerfully i meant it just the way you said it homer he said maybe i misunderstood you sir homer said but the class murmured no you got it right the short boy named bucky with whom homer had to share his rabbit cadaver nudged homer in the ribs how come you know all about cunts he asked homer search me said homer wells he had learned that phrase from debra pettigrew it was the one game they played he would ask her something she couldnt answer she would say search me and homer wells saying okay would begin to search her not therel debra would cry pushing his hand away but laughing always laughing but always pushing his hand away there was no way homer wells would gain admittance to the uterus simplex of debra pettigrew not unless i ask her to marry me he told wally when they were back together in w allys bedroom thanksgiving night i wouldnt go that far old boy wally said homer didnt tell wally about embarrassing mr hood or how the man seemed changed by the incident if mr hood had always been cadaverous now there was an insomnia about his presence tooas if he were not only dead but also working too hard staying up late boning up on his rabbit anatomy trying to keep all the uteri straight his tiredness made him slightly less cadaverous but only because exhaustion is a lifesign it is at least a form of being human mr hood began to look as if he were waiting for his retirement hoping that he could get there where have i seen that look before wondered homer wells nurse angela or nurse edna or even mrs grogan could have reminded him they were all familiar with that lookthat strained combination of exhaustion and expectation that fierce contradiction between grim anxiety and childlike faith for years that look had penetrated even the most innocent expressions of wilbur larch lately nurse angela and nurse edna and even mrs grogan had recognized the look in their own expressions what are we waiting for nurse edna asked nurse angela one morning there was an aura of something pending some form of inevitable change these good women were as insulted by the nowfamous goodhallgingrich questionnaire as they felt sure dr larch had been larch did seem unusually cheered by the remarks of the former snowy meadows the board had thought snowys response was so praiseworthy that theyd sent it along for dr larch to see to the question of being properly supervised snowy said that dr larch and the nurses never let him out of their sight to the question regarding whether or not the medical attention was adequate snowy meadows advised the board to just ask fuzzy stone in snowys opinion dr larch had breathed for fuzzy you never heard a worse set of lungs said snowy meadows but old larch just hooked the kid up to a real lifesaver and to the question of whether or not the foster home was carefully and correctly chosen snowy meadows claimed that dr larch was a genius at this delicate guesswork how could the guy have known that i was going to fit right in with a furniture family well im telling you he did know snowy meadows now robert marsh wrote to the board you know private property the world of personal possessionsthat doesnt mean the world to everybody but let me tell you snowy meadows said furniture means the world to an orphan one of you must have dropped that boy on his head wilbur larch said to nurse edna and to nurse angela although they could tell he was very pleased by snowys remarks but just to be fair the board sent larch curly days slightly less enthusiastic response to the questionnaire roy rinfret of boothbay was seething with resentment i was no more prepared to be adopted by druggists than was prepared to have my bellycord cut wrote roy curly rinfret the most beautiful couple in the world walked off with someone who didnt even need or want to be adopted and i got nabbed by druggists curly complained you call it being supervised when little children are stumbling over dead bodies curly day asked the board imagine this on the day i find a dead man in the grass the couple of my dreams adopts someone else dr larch tells me that an orphanage is not a pet store and shortly thereafter two druggists hire me to work in their drugstore for freeand you call that being adopted why that ungrateful little snot said nurse angela why curly day arent you ashamed nurse edna asked the indifferent air if that boy were here nurse angela said id take him over my knee i would and why hasnt our homer wells filled out the questionnaire the women wondered speaking of ungrateful thought wilbur larch although he held his tongue nurse angela did not hold hers she wrote directly to homer wells which would have irritated dr larch if hed known nurse angela came right to the point that questionnaire is the least you can do she wrote homer we all could use a little support just because youre having the time of your life i suppose dont you dare forget how to be of usedont you forget where you belong and if you happen to run into any young doctors or nurses who would be sympathetic to our situation think you know that youd better recommend us to themand them to us were not getting any younger you know my dear homer wrote dr larch in the next days mail its come to my attention that the board of trustees is attempting to communicate with several former residents of st clouds in the form of a ridiculous questionnaire answer it as you see fit but please do answer it and you must be prepared for some other more troubling correspondence from them it was necessary for me to be frank with them regarding the health of the orphans although i saw no reason to tell them i had lost fuzzy stone to a respiratory ailment what good would that admission do fuzzy i did tell the board about your heart i felt that if anything ever happened to me there should be someone who knew i do apologize for not telling you about your condition i am telling you now because reconsidering the matter i would never want you to hear about your heart from someone else first now doni be alarmed i would not even describe your heart as a condition the condition is so slight you had a fairly substantial heart murmur as a small child but this had almost entirely disappeared when i last checked youin your sleep you wouldnt rememberand i have delayed even mentioning your heart to you for fear of worrying you needlessly such worrying might aggravate the condition you have or had a pulmonary valve stenosis but please doni worry it is nothing or next to nothing if youre interested in more details i can provide them for now i just didnt want you being upset by some fool thing you might hear from that fool board of trustees aside from avoiding any situation of extreme stress or extreme exertion i want you to know that you can almost certainly lead a normal life a normal life thought homer wells i am a bedouin with a heart condition and dr larch is telling me i can lead a normal life i am in love with my bestand onlyfriends girlfriend but is that what larch would call extreme stress and what was melony to me if not extreme exertion whenever homer wells thought of melony which was not often he missed her then he was angry at himself why should i miss her he wondered he tried not to think about st clouds the longer he stayed away the more extreme life there appeared to himyet when he thought of it he missed it too and nurse angela and nurse edna and mrs grogan and dr larch he missed them all he was angry at himself for that too there were absolutely no signals from his heart to tell him that the life at st clouds was the life he wanted he liked the life at ocean view he wanted candy and some life with her when she went back to camden he tried not to think about her and since he could not think of wally without thinking of candy he was relieved when wally went back to oronoalthough he had missed wally all that fall when an orphan is depressed wrote wilbur larch he is attracted to telling lies a lie is at least a vigorous enterprise it keeps you on your toes by making you suddenly responsible for what happens because of it you must be alert to lie and stay alert to keep your lie a secret orphans are not the masters of their fates they are the last to believe you if you tell them that other people are also not in charge of theirs when you lie it makes you feel in charge of your life telling lies is very seductive to orphans i know dr larch wrote i know because i tell them too i love to lie when you lie you feel as if you have cheated fateyour own and everybody elses and so homer wells answered the questionnaire he sang a hymn of praise to st clouds he mentioned the restoration of the abandoned buildings of st clouds as one of the many attempts made to integrate the daily life of the orphanage with the life of the surrounding community he also lied to nurse angela but it was just a little lie one of those that are intended to make other people feel better he wrote to her that he had lost the original questionnairewhich was the only reason he had been so tardy in returning it perhaps the board would be kind enough to send him another when he received the second questionnaire from the board he would know it was time to send the one he had so arduously filled outthat way he would appear to have filled it out spontaneously off the top of his head he wrote with feigned calmness to dr larch he would appreciate further details regarding his pulmonary valve stenosis did dr larch think it necessary for example for homer to have monthly checkups dr larch would think it unnecessary of course and were there signs of trouble that homer himself might detect were there ways that he could listen for his perhapsreturning murmur calm yourself dr larch would advise that was the best thingstaying calm in an effort to calm himself homer tacked the extra questionnairewhich he did not fill outto the wall of wallys room right by the light switch so that the questions regarding life at st clouds occupied a position of ignored authority quite similar to the page of rules that were yearly tacked up in the cider house as homer came and went he regarded those questions he had answered with such able liesfor example it was quite a kick for him to contemplate any possible improvements in the methods and management of st clouds each time he entered and left wallys room at night now homers insomnia kept time to a new music the winter branches of the picked apple trees rattling against each other in the early december wind made a brittle clickclack sound lying in his beda moonlight the color of bone starkly outlining his hands folded on his chesthomer wells thought the trees might be trying to shake the snow off their branches in advance of the snow itself perhaps the trees knew that a war was coming too but olive worthington didnt think about it she had heard the orchards winter rattle for many years she had seen the winter branches bare then lacy with snow and then bare again the coastal winds gave the brittle orchard such a shaking that the clashing trees resembled frozen soldiers in all the postures of saberrattling but olive had heard so many years of this season that she never knew a war was coming if the trees seemed especially naked to her that december she thought it was because she faced her first winter without senior grownups dont look for signs in the familiar noted dr wilbur larch in a brief history of st clouds but an orphan is always looking for signs homer wells at wallys window searched the skeletal orchard for the futurehis own mainly but candys too and wallys dr larchs future was certainly out there in those winter brancheseven melonys future and what future would there be for the lords work wondered homer wells the war that was about to be did not announce itself in signs at st clouds both the familiar and the unfamiliar were muted there by ritual and by custom a pregnancy terminated in a birth or in an abortion an orphan was adopted or was waiting to be adopted when there was a dry and snowless cold the loose sawdust irritated the eyes and the noses and the throats of st clouds only briefly when the snow lay newly fallen was the sawdust gone from the air when there was a thaw the snow melted down and the matted sawdust srnelled like wet fur when there was a freeze the sawdust reappeared dry again somehow on top of the old snowand again the eyes itched the noses ran and the throats could never quite clear themselves of it let us be happy for smoky fields dr larch announced in the boys division smoky fields has found a family good night smoky good night thmoky said david copperfield gnight young steerforth cried good night you little food hoarder nurse angela thought whoever took him she knew would soon learn to lock the refrigerator in the december morning at the window where melony once allowed the world to pass both with and without comment mary agnes cork watched the women walking uphill from the train station they dont look pregnant mary agnes thought on the bleak hill where wally worthington once imagined apple trees young copperfield attempted to steer a cardboard carton through the first wet snow the carton had once contained four hundred sterile vulval pads copperfield knew this because he had unpacked the cartonand he had placed young steerforth in the carton at the bottom of the hill near the top he was beginning to realize his mistake not only had dragging steerforth uphill been difficult but also the boys weightin addition to the wetness of the snowhad turned the bottom of the carton soggy copperfield won dered if his makedo sled would even slideif he ever managed to get the mess to the top good night smoky steerforth was singing thut up thupid david copperfield said dr larch was very tired he was resting in the dispensary the gray winter light turned the white walls gray and for a moment larch wondered what time of day it wasand what time of year from now on he was thinking let everything i do be for a reason let me make no wasted moves in his minds eye he saw the correct angle at which the vaginal speculum allowed him a perfect view of the cervix whose cervix he wondered even in his ether sleep the thumb and index finger of his right hand tightened the screw that held the jaws of the speculum in place and he saw the astonishing blondness of the little clump of pubic hair caught in the hairs of his own wrist it was so blond he had nearly missed seeing it against his own pale skin when he shook his wrist the little clump was so light that it floated in the air in his ether swoon his left hand reached for it just missing it oh yesher cervix thought wilbur larch what was her name she has a toy name larch said aloud candy he remembered then he laughed nurse edna passing the dispensary held her breath and listened to the laughter but even when she didnt breathe the fumes made her old eyes water that and the sawdust that and the orphanssome of them made her eyes water too she opened the door at the hospital entrance to let some fresh air into the hall on the hill she watched a cardboard carton make an unsteady descent she knew that sterile vulval pads had been in the carton but she wasnt sure what was in the carton now something heavy because the cartons descent was clumsy and irregular at times it picked up speed sliding almost smoothly but always some rock or bare patch in the slushy snow would jar it offcourse and slow it down the first small body to roll out of the carton and make its way downhill was steerforths she recognized his overlarge mittens and the ski hat that always covered his eyes for a while he tumbled almost as fast as the carton but a large patch of bare frozen ground finally stopped him nurse edna watched him climb back uphill for one of his mittens the second larger body to be propelled from the carton was obviously david copperfields he rolled free with a large soggy piece of the carton in both his hands the carton appeared to disintegrate in flight thit copperfield cried at least nurse edna thought young copperfields profanities were improved by his lisp close that door said dr larch in the hall behind nurse edna i was just trying to get some fresh air nurse edna said pointedly you could have fooled me said wilbur larch i thought you were trying to freeze the unborn maybe that will be the way of the future nurse edna thoughtwondering what future ways there would be in the december swimming pool the raft that senior worthington used to ride still floated windblown from one end of the pool to the other breaking up the lacy fringes of ice that formed and reformed around the edges olive and homer had drained out a third of the pools water to leave room for rainfall ancl snow melt seniors cold raft only partially deflated by the falling temperature still charged around the swimming pool like a riderless horse it galloped wherever the wind urged it every day olive watched the raft out the kitchen window and homer wondered when she would suggest getting rid of it one weekend candy came home from camden and homers confusion regarding what he should do about her mounted friday was a bad indecisive day he went early to senior biology hoping to persuade mr hood either to let him have his own rabbit for dissection or to assign him a lab partner other than that boy bucky bucky managed to mangle the rabbits innards whenever he handled them and homer found the oafs constant fixation with everythings reproductive system both silly and maddening bucky had lately seized on the fact that marsupials have paired vaginas twin twats can you believe it bucky asked homer right said homer wells is that all you can say bucky asked dont you get it if you was a hamster you could fuck another hamster with your buddy why would i want to do that homer asked two cunts bucky said enthusiastically you got no imagination i doubt that even the hamsters are interested in what you suggest said homer wells thats what i mean stupid bucky said what a wasteto give two twats to a hamster you ever seen em run on them little wheels theyre crazy wouldnt you be crazy if you knew the girl of your dreams had two twats and she still wasnt interested the girl of my dreams said homer wells it was crazy enough in homers opinion that the girl of his dreams had two people who loved her and so he went early to senior biology to request either a fresh rabbit or a replacement for the obsessed boy named bucky there was a geography class in progress when he got there and when the class was released homer saw that the large maps of the world were still pulled down covering the blackboard may i just look at the maps for a moment before my next class homer asked the geography teacher ill roll them back up for you and so he was left alone with his first accurate view of the worldthe whole world albeit unrealistically flat against a blackboard after a while he found maine he regarded how small it was after a while he found south carolina he stared into south carolina for a long time as if the exact whereabouts of mr rose and the other migrants would materialize he had heard all the talk about germany which was easier to find than maine he was surprised at the size of england charles dickens had given him the impression of something much bigger and the ocean that seemed so vast when you looked at it off ray kendalls dockwhy the oceans of the world were even more vast than hed imagined yet st clouds which loomed so large in homers life could not be located on the map of maine he was using the geography teachers magnifying glass when he suddenly realized that the entire class of senior biology had filled the seats behind him mr hood was regarding him strangely looking for your rabbit homer mr hood asked the class enjoyed this joke enormously and homer realized he hadat least for that daylost the opportunity to rid himself of bucky look at it this way bucky whispered to him near the end of class if debra pettigrew had two twats she might let you in one of them you see the advantages unfortunately the idea of paired vaginas troubled homer throughout his friday evening date with debra pettigrew there was a fred astaire movie in bath but that was almost an hourlong drive each way and what did homer wells know or care about dancing he had declined several invitations to attend debras dancing class with her if she wanted to see the fred astaire movie homer thought she could go with someone who was in her dancing class and it was getting too cold simply to drive to the beach and park there olive was generous about letting homer use the van soon there would be gas rationing and a welcome end in homers opinion to all this restless driving he drove debra pettigrew out to the carnival site at cape kenneth in the moonlight the abandoned unlighted ferris wheel stood out like scaffolding for the worlds first rocket launch or like the bones of some species from dinosaur times homer tried to tell debra about the knife work of mr rose but she had her heart set on fred astaire he knew better than to waste a good story on her when she was sulking they drove to the cape kenneth drivein which was closed for the season they appeared to be reviewing the scenes of a romance that had happened to other peopleand not just last summer but to another generation i dont know what youve got against dancing debra said i dont know either said homer wells it was still early when he drove debra to her winter home in kenneth corners the same ferocious dogs of the summer were there with their coats grown thicker with their hot breath icing on their muzzles there had been talk between debra and homer earlier about using the summer house on drinkwater lake for some kind of party the house would be unheated and they would have to keep the lights off or someone might report a breaking and entering but despite these discomforts surely there was a thrill in being unchaperoned why wondered homer wells he knew he still wouldnt get to debra pettigreweven if she had two vaginas with the dull friday evening they had spent together and with the dogs breath crystallizing on the driversside window of the van there was no talk about such a tempting party this night so what are we doing tomorrow night debra asked sighing homer watched a dog gnaw at his sideview mirror well i was going to see candyshes home from camden homer said i havent seen her on a weekend all fall and wally did ask me to look after her youre going to see her without wally debra asked right homer said the van was so snubnosed that the dogs could hurl themselves directly against the windshield without having to clamber over the hood a big dogs paws raked one of the windshield wipers away from the windshield releasing it with a crack it looked bent it wouldnt quite touch the surface of the glass anymore youre going to see her alone debra said or with her dad homer said sure said debra pettigrew getting out of the van she left the door open a little too long a dog with the spadeshaped head of a doberman charged the open door it was half in the van its heavy chest heaving against the passengerside seat its frosty muzzle drooling on the gearshift box when debra grabbed it by the ear and yanked it back yelping out of the van so long said homer wells softlyafter the door had slammed after he had wiped the dogs frothy slobber off the gearshift knob he drove by kendalls lobster pound twice but there was nothing to tell him whether candy was home on the weekends when she came home she took the train then ray drove her back on sunday ill call her tomorrowsaturdayhomer thought when candy said that she wanted to see the fred astaire movie homer had no objections i always wanted to see him he said bath after all was less than an hour away on the bridge across the kennebec river they could see several big ships in the water and several more in dry dock the bath shipyards were sprawled along the shorea rhythmic hammering and other metal sounds audible even on a saturday they were much too early for the movie they were looking for an italian restaurant that ray had told them aboutif it was still there raymond kendall hadnt been in bath in years in especially to an outsider the city seemed dominated by the shipyards and by the ships that stood taller than the shipyard buildings and by the bridge that spanned the kennebec river bath was a workingmans town as melony soon discovered she found a job in the shipyards and began her winter employment on an assembly line working with other womenand with an occasional handicapped man on the second floor of a factory specializing in movable parts the movable part to which melony would devote her energies for the first month of her employment was a hexagonalshaped sprocket that looked like half a ham split open lengthwise melony did not know the whereabouts of the assembly line that dealt with the other half of the ham the sprocket arrived on the conveyor belt in front of her pausing there for exactly fortyfive seconds before it was moved on and replaced by a new sprocket the joint of the sprocket was packed with grease you could stick your finger in the grease past the second knuckle the job was to insert six ball bearings into the greasepacked joint you pushed each ball bearing into the grease until you felt it hit the bottom all six fit perfectly the trick was to get only one hand greasy a clean hand had an easier time handling the clean ball bearings which were the size of marbles the other part of the job was making sure that the six ball bearings were perfect perfectly round perfectly smooth no dents no jagged metal scraps stuck to them the odds were that one out of every two hundred ball bearings had something wrong with it at the end of the day you turned in the bad ball bearings if you had a day with no bad ball bearings the foreman told you that you werent looking each ball bearing over carefully enough you could sit or stand and melony tried both positions alternating them through the day the belt was too high to make sitting comfortable and too low to make standing any better your back hurt in one place when you stood and in another place when you sat not only did melony not know who did what where to the other half of the sprocket she also didnt know what the sprocket was for whats more she didnt care after two weeks she had the routine down pat between twentysix and twentyeight seconds to insert the ball bearings and never more than ten seconds to pick six perfect ball bearings she learned to keep a nest of ball bearings in her lap when she sat and in an ashtray she didnt srnoke when she stood that way she always had a ball bearing handy in case she dropped one she had a twelvetofourteensecond rest between sprockets during which time she could look at the person on her left and at the person on her right and shut her eyes and count to three or sometimes five she observed that there were two styles of labor on the line some of the workers picked their six perfect ball bearings immediately upon finishing a sprocket the others waited for the new sprocket to arrive first melony found faults with both styles the woman next to melony put it this way some of us are pickers some are stickers she said im not either or im both melony said well i think youll have an easier time of it dearie if you make up your mind the woman said her name was doris she had three children one side of her face was still pretty but the other was marred by a mole with whiskers in it in the twelve or fourteen seconds that doris had between sprockets she smoked on the other side of melony was an elderly man in a wheelchair his problem was that he could not pick up the ball bearings that he dropped and some of them got caught in his lap blanket or in the wheelchair apparatus which caused him to rattle when he wheeled himself off for his coffee break or for lunch his name was walter three or four times a day walter would shout fucking ball bearings some days when someone was sick the assembly line was reassembled and melony was not pinned between walter and doris sometimes she got to be next to troy who was blind he felt the ball bearings for perfection and daintily poked them into the thick and unseen grease he was a little older than melony but he had always worked in the shipyards hed been blinded in a welding accident and the shipyards owed him a job for life at least ive got security he would say three or four times a day some days melony was put next to a girl about her age a feisty little chick called lorna theres worse jobs lorna said one day name one said melony blowing bulldogs lorna said i dont know about that melony said ill bet every bulldog is different then how come every man is the same lorna asked melony decided that she liked lorna lorna had been married when she was seventeento an older man shed saidbut it hadnt worked out he was a garage mechanic about twentyone lorna said he just married me cause i was the first person he slept with lorna told melony melony told lorna that shed been separated from her boyfriend by a rich girl who came between us lorna agreed that this was the worst but i figure one of two things has happened melony said either he still hasnt fucked her because she hasnt let him and so hes figured out what hes missing or else shes let him fuck herin which case hes figured out what hes missing ha thats right lorna said she appeared to like melony i got some friends she told melony we eat pizza go to movies you know melony nodded she had done none of those things lorna was as thin as melony was thick she showed as much bone as melony showed flesh lorna was pale and blond whereas melony was dark and darker lorna looked frail and she coughed a lot whereas melony looked almost as strong as she was and her lungs were a set of engines yet the women felt they belonged together when they requested that they be put next to each other on the assembly line their request was denied friendships especially talkative ones were considered counterproductive on the line thus melony was allowed to work alongside lorna only when the line was reassembled on a sick day melony was made to endure the crackpot homilies of doris and the lost ball bearings of wheelchair walter as everyone called him but the enforced separation from lorna on the work line only made melony feel stronger in her attachment the attachment was mutual that saturday they put in for overtime together and they worked side by side through the afternoon at about the time that candy and homer wells were crossing the bridge over the kennebec and driving into downtown bath lorna dropped a ball bearing down the cleavage of melonys work shirt it was their way of getting each others attention theres a fred astaire movie in town lorna said snapping her chewing gum you wanna see it although her voice lacked the studied heartiness of dr larchs mrs grogan did her best to inspire a welcome response to her announcement to the girls division let us be happy for mary agnes cork she said there was general sniveling but mrs grogan pressed on mary agnes cork has found a family good night mary agnes there were stifled moans the sound of someone gagging in her pillow and a few of the usual wracking sobs let us be happy for mary agnes cork mrs grogan pleaded fuck you someone said in the darkness it hurts me to hear you say that mrs grogan said how that hurts us all good night mary agnes mrs grogan called good night mary agnes one of the smaller ones said be careful agnes someone blubbered goodness yes thought mrs grogan the tears running down her cheeks yes be careful larch had assured mrs grogan that the adoptive family was especially good for an older girl like mary agnes they were a young couple who bought and sold and restored antiques they were too active in their business to look after a small child but they had lots of energy to share with an older child on the weekends and in the evenings the young wife had been very close to a kid sister she was devoted to girl talk she told dr larch apparently the kid sister had married a foreigner and was now living abroad and wilbur larch had a good feeling for bath hed always maintained a friendly correspondence with the pathologist at bath hospital good old clara had come from there and so it seemed perfectly fine to him that mary agnes cork had gone to bath mary agnes was attached to her own name and so they allowed her to keep it not just the mary agnes but the cork too after all they were callahans a cork went with a callahan didnt it it sounded a little modern for mrs grogans tastes although she allowed herself to be pleased at the thought that shed named someone for keeps ted and patty callahan wanted mary agnes cork to view them as friends the first friendly thing the young couple did was to take mary agnes to her first movie they were a robust couple and in their opinion they lived near enough to the movie theater in bath to walk it was a long walk during which ted and patty demonstrated some of the basic differences between a foxtrot and a waltz the december sidewalk was sloppy but ted and patty wanted to prepare mary agnes for some of the dazzle of fred astaire off the kennebec a damp chilling wind was blowing and mary agnes felt her collarbone ache when she tried to join the callahans at dancing the old injury felt loose then it throbbed then it grew numb the sidewalk was so slippery she nearly fellcatching her balance on the fender of a dirty green van patty brushed her coat off for her people were outside the movie house buying tickets in the failing light on the sliding panel door of the van mary agnes cork recognized the apple monogramthe ww and the ocean view she had first seen this emblem on a cadillacthere had been a kind of hunger line she remembered that beautiful girl standing aloof and that beautiful boy passing out the food theyre here mary agnes thought the beautiful people who took homer wells away maybe homer was still with them mary agnes began to look around homer and candy had not had much luck finding the italian restaurant that ray had recommended theyd found two or three italian restaurants each one serving pizza and submarine sandwiches and beer and each one so overrun with workers from the shipyards that there was no place to sit theyd eaten some pizza in the van and had arrived at the movie early when homer wells opened his wallet in front of the ticket booth he realized that hed never opened his wallet outdoorsin a winter windbefore he put his back to the wind but still the loose bills flapped candy cupped her hands on either side of his wallet as if she were protecting a flame in danger of going out and that was how she was in a position to catch her own treasured clump of pubic hair when it blew free from homers wallet and caught on the cuff of her coat they both grabbed for it homer letting the wallet fall but candy was quicker some of the fine blond hairs may have escaped in the wind but candy seized the clump tightlyhomers hand closing immediately on hers they stepped away from the ticket booth a small line moved into the theater past them candy continued to hold her pubic hair tightly and homer would not let her hand gohe would not let her open her hand to examine what she held there was no need for that candy knew what she held in her hand she knew it as much from homers expression as from the clump of pubic hair itself id like to take a walk she whispered right said homer wells not letting go of her hand they turned away from the theater and walked downhill to the kennebec candy faced the river and leaned against homer wells perhaps youre a collector she said as quietly as she could speak and still be heard over the river perhaps youre a pubic hair collector she said you certainly were in a position to be nohe said this is pubic hair she said wriggling her tightly clenched fist in his hand and its mine right right said homer wells only mine candy asked you kept only mine right homer said why candy asked dont lie he had never said the words i am in love with you he was unprepared for the struggle involved in saying them no doubt he misunderstood the unfamiliar weight he felt upon his hearthe must have associated the constriction of that big muscle in his chest with dr larchs recent news what he felt was only love but what he thought he felt was his pulmonary valve stenosis he let go of candys hand and put both his hands to his chest he had seen the sternum shears at workhe knew the autopsy procedurebut never had it been so hard and painful to breathe when candy turned to him and saw his face she couldnt help itboth her hands opened and grasped his hands the blond wisp of pubic hair flying free a current of rough air carried it out over the river and into the darkness is it your heart candy asked him oh god you dont have to say anythingplease dont even think about it my heart he said you know about my heart you know she asked dont worry she added fiercely i love you homer wells croaked as if he were saying his last words yes i knowdont think about it candy said dont worry about anything i love you too you do he asked yes yes and wally too she said i love you and i love wallydont worry about it dont even think about it how do you know about my heart asked homer wells we all know about it candy said olive knows and wally knows hearing this was more convincing to homer wells than even the offhand remarks in dr larchs letter he felt his heart race out of control again dont think about your heart homer candy said hugging him tightly dont worry about me or wally or any of it what am i supposed to think about asked homer wells only good things candy told him when she looked into his eyes she said suddenly i cant believe that you kept my hair but when she saw the intensity of his frown she said i mean its okayi understand guess dont worry about it either it may be peculiar but its certainly romantic romantic said homer wells holding the girl of his dreamsbut only holding her to touch her more must surely be forbiddenby all the rulesand so he tried to accept the ache in his heart as what dr larch would call the common symptoms of a normal life this is a normal life he tried to think holding candy as both the night fog off the river and the darkness reached over them it was not a night that put them in the mood for a musical we can see fred astaire dance another time candy said philosophically the safety of the familiar drew them toward raymond kendalls dockwhen they got cold sitting out there they could always have some tea with ray they drove the van back to hearts haven nobody who knew them saw them come or go in the fred astaire movie mary agnes cork ate too much popcorn her foster family thought that the poor girl was simply overstimulated by her first movie she could not sit still she watched the audience more than she watched the dancing she searched every face in the flickering darkness it was that pretty girl and that pretty boy she was looking forand maybe homer wells and so she was unprepared to spot the face in the crowd of the one person she missed most in her narrow world the sight of that dark heavy countenance shot such a stab of pain through her old collarbone injury that the popcorn container flew from her hands melony loomed over the sassy blond girl named lorna hulking in her seat with the authority of a chronic and cynical moviegoer looking like a sour critic born to be displeased although this was her first movie even in the projectors gray light mary agnes cork could not fail to recognize her old brutalizer the exqueen and former hitwoman of the girls division i think youve had enough of that popcorn sweetheart patty callahan told mary agnes who appeared to have a kernel of the stuff caught in her throat and for the rest of the evenings frivolous entertainment mary agnes could not keep her eyes off that most dominant member of the audience in mary agnes corks opinion melony could have wiped up a dance floor with fred astaire she could have broken every bone in freds slender bodyshe could have paralyzed him after just one waltz do you see someone you know dear ted callahan asked mary agnes he thought the poor girl was so stuffed with popcorn that she couldnt talk in the lobby in the sickly neon light mary agnes walked up to melony as if a dream led her feetas if she were captured in the old violent trance of melonys authority hishe said you talking to me kid lorna asked but mary agnes was smiling just at melony hi its me mary agnes said so you got out melony said ive been adopted said mary agnes cork ted and patty stood a little nervously near her not wanting to intrude but not wanting to let her very far from their sight either this is ted and patty mary agnes said this is rny friend melony melony appeared not to know what to make of the hands extended to her the tough little broad named lorna batted her eyessome of her mascara sticking one of her eyelids in a frozenopen position this is my friend lorna melony said awkwardly everyone said hi and then stood around what does the little creep want melony was thinking and that was when mary agnes said wheres homer what melony said homer wells said mary agnes isnt he with you why melony asked those pretty people with the car mary agnes began what car melony asked well it wasnt the same car it wasnt the pretty car but there was the apple on the doorill never forget that apple mary agnes said melony put her big hands heavily on mary agness shoulders mary agnes felt the weight pressing her into the floor what are you talking about melony asked i saw an old car but it had that apple on it mary agnes said i thought they was at the movie those pretty peopleand homer too and when i saw you i thought he would be here for sure where was the car melony asked her strong thumbs bearing down on both of mary agness collarbones show me the car is something wrong ted callahan asked mind your own business melony said but the van was gone in the damp cold on the slushy sidewalk staring at the empty curbstone melony said are you sure it was that apple it had a double w and it said ocean view thats it mary agnes said it just wasnt the same car it was an old van but id know that apple anywhere you dont forget a thing like that oh shut up melony said tiredly she stood on the curb her hands on her hips her nostrils flared she was trying to pick up a scent the way a dog guesses in the air for the history of intrusions upon its territory what is it lorna asked melony was your fella here with his rich cunt ted and patty callahan were anxious to take mary agnes home but melony stopped them as they were leaving she reached into her tight pocket and produced the hornrimmed barrette that mary agnes had stolen from candy which melony had taken for herself melony gave the barrette to mary agnes keep it melony said you took it its yours mary agnes clutched the barrette as if it were a medal for bravery for valorous conduct in the only arena that melony respected i hope i see ya mary agnes called after melony who was stalking awaythe escaping homer wells might be around the next corner what color was the van melony called green said mary agnes i hope i see ya she repeated you ever hear of an ocean view melony yelled back at the callahans they hadnt what are apples to antiques dealers can i see ya sometime mary agnes asked melony im at the shipyards melony told the girl if you ever hear of an ocean view you can see me you dont know it was him lorna said to melony later they were drinking beer melony wasnt talking and you dont know if the rich cunt is still with him they stood on the bank of the foggy kennebec near the boardinghouse where lorna lived when theyd finish a beer theyd throw the bottle into the river melony was good at throwing things into rivers she kept her face turned up she was still smelling the windas if even that wisp of candys pubic hair could not escape her powers of detection homer wells was also making a deposit in the water ploink said the snails he threw off ray kendalls dock the sea made just the smallest sound in swallowing snails ploink ploink candy and homer sat with their backs against opposite corner posts at the end of the dock if theyd both stretched out their legs to each other the soles of their feet could have touched but candy sat with her knees slightly bentin a position familiar to homer wells from his many views of women in stirrups is it okay candy asked quietly is what okay he asked tour heart she whispered how could he tell i guess so he said itll be okay she said what will be okay asked homer wells everything candy said hurriedly everything repeated homer wells me loving you thats okay and you loving me and wallythats okay too right he said you have to wait and see candy said for everything you have to wait and see right i dont know what to do either said candy helplessly we have to do the right thing homer wells said wally would want to do the right thing and dr larch was doing what he thought was the right thing too if you could be patient enough to wait and see the right thing must present itselfmustnt it what else does an orphan do anyway but wait and see i can be patient said homer wells melony could be patient too and ray kendall at his window above his dockhe could be patient too a mechanic is also patient a mechanic has to wait for something to break before he can fix it ray stared at the distance between his daughters feet and the feet of homer wells it was not much of a distance and he had observed his daughter on his dock many times in wallys arms and before that when candy and wally had also sat on that dock with their feet not touching they were three good kids ray was thinking but he was a mechanic he knew better than to interfere when it breaks then he would fix it he felt sorry for them all i can drive you back to school tomorrow homer said my dad can drive me back candy said i think he likes to olive worthington looked at the clock on her night table and turned out her reading lamp homer never stayed out this late with debra pettigrew she was thinking olive had no trouble imagining candys attraction to homer wells olive had the greatest respect for homers diligence she had seen him be a better student and of the rabbit of all thingsthan wally had ever been and she knew he was a reliable and friendly companion too olive fumed to herself she felt that typical contradiction a parent so often feels completely on her sons sideshe even wanted to warn him to help his causebut at the same time wally could stand to be taught a lesson just maybe not this lesson olive thought well thank goodness they are three nice people she said aloud her own voice in the empty house surprising her and thoroughly waking her up some hot chocolate would be soothing she thought and when homer comes home he can have some with me but in the kitchen olive was struck by how the fog shot through with a cloudy moonlight made the raft in the swimming pool look quite ghostly the raft was poised at the side of the pool half in the water and half out like a very gray and shadowy photograph of itself the image disturbed her and olive decided shed had enough of that raft she put on a pair of boots and a long winter coat over her nightgown it bothered her that the outdoor patio light was not working only the underwater lights would turn on and she was surprised to see that the water in the pool had finally frozen that was the reason for the rafts arrested position it was trapped as rigidly as a statue like a ship seized in an ice floe being careful to hold tight to the pool curb she kicked tentatively at the ice with the heel of her boot but when she tugged the raft it would not come free if i walk out there ill fall right through she thought that was when homer came home she heard the van in the driveway and she called to him what do you want done with it homer asked olive about the raft just get it out olive said to him and then what he asked throw it away she said meanwhile ill make you some hot chocolate homer struggled with the raft the ice which would not support all his weight was hard enough to have a firm grip on the raft very cleverly he eased himself onto the raft hoping it still had enough air in it so that it wouldnt sink once he broke the bond with the ice he rocked back and forth on his knees on the raft until he could feel the ice breaking then he rocked his way through more of the ice and climbed up on the pool curb and pulled the raft out of the pool after him ice still clung to it it was so heavy he had to drag it when he got to the trash barrels he needed to deflate the raft in order to stuff it in a barrel the nozzle was rusted shut and even by jumping with both feet he couldnt break the tough canvas hide he went into the garden shed and found a pair of hedge shears with the thinner blade he stabbed a gash in the raft and snipped upwardthe stale rubbery air blasting into his face it was moist and fetid and when he tore the hole wider the smell washed over him strangely warm in the cold night air and strangely foul it was not only the smell of someones old sneakers left out in the rain there was also something putrid about it and he couldnt help viewing the slashed object as he might have viewed a ripped intestine he stuffed the raft into a trash barrel but when he went into the house for his hotchocolate reward the smell remained on his hands even after he had washed them he stuck his nose into the hollow in the palm of his handthe smell was still there then he recognized the smell it was what was left on his hands after he removed the rubber gloves hows candy olive asked fine said homer wells they sipped their hot chocolatelike mother and son both of them were thinking and at the same time not like mother and son they both thought and how are you olive asked him after a while just fine said homer wells but what he thought was im going to wait and see wilbur larch inhaling and seeing the stars race across the ceiling of the dispensary knew what a luxury it was to be able to wait and see even if i last he thought might get caught an abortionist believes in odds he had been in the business too long what are the odds that someone will blow the whistle before im through the old man wondered only yesterday he had made a new enemya woman in her eighth month who said it was only her fourth he had to refuse her when the women were hysterical he usually could wait them out if they required firmness he gave them nurse angela nurse edna was better at handholding in time they calmed down if in his opinion a woman was simply too lateif he felt he had to refuse to perform the abortionhe usually could convince the woman she would be safe at st clouds that he would deliver the baby and find it a home and that this was preferable to the risk involved in a late abortion but not this woman there had been no hysterics the peacefuiness of a longstanding hatred made the woman almost serene so thats ityou wont do it she said im sorry dr larch said how much do you want the woman asked him i can get it whatever you can afford to donate to the orpihanage would be appreciated larch said if you cant afford anything then everything is free an abortion is free delivery is free a donation is appreciated if you have nowhere to go youre welcome to stay here you dont have long to wait just tell me what i have to do the woman said do fuck you okay ill fuck you i want you to have this baby and let me find it a home wilbur larch said thats all i want you to do but the woman had stared right through him she struggled out of the overstuffed chair in nurse angelas office she regarded the paperweight on larchs desk it was a weighted vaginal speculum but it held down a lot of paper and most of the wouldbe foster families didnt know what it was the woman who wanted the late abortion clearly knew what it was she stared at it as if the sight of it gave her cramps then she looked out the window where dr larch imagined she intended to hurl the paperweight she picked up the weighted speculum and pointed the jaw of the thing at larch as if it were a gun youll be sorry the woman said in his ether haze wilbur larch saw the woman point the speculum at him again how will i be sorry he wondered im sorry he said aloud nurse edna passing in the hallever passingthought youre forgiven i forgive you it was sunday and overcastas usual the same fred astaire movie that was entertaining the residents of bath was playing in orono and the students at the university of maine in were not yet so cynical that they failed to enjoy it wally went to the movie with some of his friends during the afternoon matinee they didnt interrupt the show with the news that interrupted the rest of the world they allowed fred astaire to dance on and on and the moviegoers heard the news after the show when they stepped out of the comforting dark of the theater into the lateafternoon daylight of downtown orono candy was returning to camden with her father raymond kendall was especially proud of the radio reception he had engineered for his chevrolet it was much clearer reception than was possible at the time in a standard car radio and ray had made the whiplash antenna himself candy and her father heard the news as soon as anyone in maine heard it and they heard it loud and clear olive always had the radio on and so she was one of those people who needed to hear things several times before she really heard them at all she was baking an apple pie and simmering applesauce and only the unusual urgency in the announcers voice caused her to pay attention to the radio at all homer wells was in wallys room reading davidcopperfield and thinking about heaventhat sky above me where in the mystery to come i might yet love her with a love unknown on earth and tell her what the strife had been within me when i loved her here think i would prefer to love candy here on earth homer wells was thinkingwhen olive interrupted him homer olive called upstairs where is pearl harbor he was the wrong person to ask homer wells had seen the whole world only once and brieflyand flat against the blackboard hed had difficulty locating south carolina not only did he not know where pearl harbor was he also didnt know what it was i dont know he called downstairs well the japanese have just bombed it olive called to him you mean with planes asked homer wells from the sky of course from the sky olive shouted you better come listen to this where is pearl harbor candy asked her father ssshh said raymond kendall if we just listen maybe theyll say how could they get away with an attack candy asked because someone wasnt doing his job ray said the first reports were garbled there was mention of california falling under attack or even being invaded many listeners were confused from the beginning they thought pearl harbor was in california where is hawaii mrs grogan asked they were having tea and cookies and listening to the radio for music when theyd heard the news hawaii is in the pacific said wilbur larch oh thats very far away nurse edna said not far enough away dr larch said theres going to be another war isnt there nurse angela asked i guess its already started said wilbur larch while wallyto whom this war would mean the most watched fred astaire fred just kept dancing and dancing and wally thought he could go on watching such a display of grace for hours melony and lorna were listening to the radio in the parlor of the boardinghouse where lorna lived it was a womenonly boardinghouse the women were either quite old or like lorna only recently separated from their husbands on this sunday afternoon most of the women listening to the radio were old we should just bomb japan melony said no messing aroundjust blow up the whole country you know how come japs got squinty eyes lorna asked melony and all the old women listened intently because they masturbate all the timeboth the men and the women they just do it all the time there was either a polite or a stunned silence or both in melonys case her silence was polite is this a joke she asked her friend respectfully of course its a joke lorna cried i dont get it i guess melony admitted how come japs got squinty eyes lorna asked because they masturbate all the time she paused thats what i thought you said melony said because they shut their eyes every time they come lorna said their eyes get tired from all that opening and closing thats why they cant open their eyes all the way get it lorna asked triumphantly still selfconscious about her teeth melony managed a tightlipped smile anyone seeing the old women in the boardinghouse parlor would not have known exactly what filled them with fear and trembling the news of the attack on pearl harbor or lorna and melony and young wally worthington who was so itchy to be a hero danced out on the streets of orono where he heard the news president roosevelt would call it a day of infamy but that day meant more than infamy to wally whose noble and adventurous heart longed to fly a b liberator a heavy bomber four engines used for bombing bridges oil refineries fuel depots railroad tracks and so forth somewhere on that day of infamy there was a b liberator bomber waiting for young wally worthington to learn how to fly it people in hearts haven and in hearts rock always said that wally had everything money looks goodness charm the girl of his dreamsbut he had courage too and he had in abundance youths most dangerous qualities optimism and restlessness he would risk everything he had to fly the plane that could carry the bomb within him wally enlisted in the army air corps before christmas but they allowed him to spend christmas at home it would take the army air corps more than a year to teach wally the grim arts of aerial warfare by that time he told olive and candy in the kitchen at ocean view all the fighting will probably be over that would be just my luck that would be lucky olive said candy nodded her head right said homer wells from the other room he was still thinking about being excused from his physical dr larchs account of homers heart history had sufficed physical examinations were given only to people who were class i homer wells was class iv according to his family physician homer had congenital pulmonic stenosis homers family physician was dr larch whose letter to the local medical advisory board had been accepted as evidence enough for homers deferment larch was also a member of the local board i asked her to marry me but she wouldnt wally told homer in their shared bedroom she said shed wait for me but she wouldnt marry rne she said shed be my wife but not my widow is that what you call waiting and seeing homer asked candy the next day yes candy said for years ive expected to be married to wally you came along second i have to wait and see about you and now conies the war i have to wait and see about the war too but you made him a promise said homer wells yes candy said isnt a promise like waiting and seeing did you ever make a promise and mean itand break it homer wellss reaction was an involuntary cringe as sudden and uncontrollable as if candy had called him sunshine during christmas dinner raymond kendall trying to relieve the silence said i would have chosen submarines youd end up feeding lobsters wally said thats okay said ray they been feeding me you got a better chance in a plane wally said yes a chance candy said scornfully why would you want to be anywhere where all you get is a chance good question olive said crossly she let the silver serving fork fall to the meat platter with such force that the goose appeared to flinch a chance is enough said homer wells who did not immediately recognize the tone in his own voice a chance is all we get right in the air or underwater or right here from the minute were born or from the minute were not born he thought now he recognized his tone of voiceit was dr larchs thats a rather grim philosophy olive said i thought you were studying anatomy wally said to homer who looked at candy who looked away they sent wally to fort meade maryland for the month of january he was a faithful but terrible letter writer he wrote his mother he wrote to homer and to candy and even to ray but he never explained anything if there was a plan to what they were teaching him wally either didnt know it or couldnt describe it he simply wrote in tedious detail about the last thing that had occupied his mind before beginning the letter this included the pouch he had devised to hang from his bunk bed to separate his shoe polish from his toothpaste and the bestnameforaplane competition that dominated the imaginative life of company a he was also delighted that a cook sergeant had taught him more limericks than senior in his last years had been able to remember every letter wally wrote to anyone included a limerick ray liked them and homer liked them but they made candy angry and olive was appalled candy and homer showed each other the limericks wally sent them until homer realized that this made candy even angrier the limericks wally chose to send candy were very mildmannered compared to the ones wally sent to homer for example he sent this to candy there was a young lady of exeter so pretty that men craned their necks at her one was even so brave as to take out and wave the distinguishing mark of his sex at her he sent this to homer wells there was a young lady named brent with a cunt of enormous extent and so deep and so wide the acoustics inside were so good you could hear when you spent wally sent ray limericks of a similar kind theres an unbroken babe from toronto exceedingly hard to get onto rut when you get there and have parted the hair you can fuck her as much as you want to god knows what limericks wally sent to olive where does wally find ones that are decent enough wondered homer who in the evening after wally had gone and candy had gone back to school lay listening to his heart it would help he thought if he knew what to listen for wally was sent to st louisthe jefferson barracks flight th school squadron it struck homer wells that the army air corps might have modeled itself on grays anatomymanifesting a steadfast belief in categories and in everything having a name it was reassuring to homer wells in his mind this endless categorizing made wally safer but homer couldnt convince candy of this hes safe one minute and in another minute hes not safe she said shrugging look after homer look after his heart wally had written her and whos looking after my heart yes im still angry she wrote him although he hadnt asked but if she was angry with wally she was also loyal she was keeping her promise about the waiting and seeing she kissed homer when she saw him and when they said goodbye but she wouldnt encourage him were just good pals she told her father ray hadnt asked i can see that ray said the work in the orchards was light that winter pruning was the main job the men took turns teaching homer how to prune you make your big cuts in the subfreezing weather meany hyde told him a tree dont bleed so much when its cold was how vernon lynch put it hacking away theres less chance of an infection when its cold said herb fowler who was not so free with the prophylactics in the winter months perhaps because he would have needed to take his gloves off to get at them but homer felt sure that herb was being wary ever since homer had asked him about the holes are there holes herb had replied manufacturers defect i suppose but later hed come up to homer and whispered to him not all of thems got holes you have a system homer asked which ones have holes and which dont its not my system herb fowler said some got holes some dont manufacturers defect right said homer wells but rubbers were rarely flung his way now meany hydes wife florence was pregnant again and all winter big dot taft and irene titcomb made jokes about meanys potency you keep away from me meany big dot would say im not even lettin you sip my coffee i think all you gotta do is breathe on somebody and theyre pregnant well thats all he did to me florence would say and big dot taft would roar dontcha go givin the men any breathin lessons meany irene titcomb said meany can knock you up just by kissin your ears florence hyde said proudly glorying in her pregnancy gimme some earmuffs said squeeze louise tobey gimme one of them ski hats gimme a dozen of herbs rubbers said irene titcomb no dont take any thought homer wells thats probably how she got that way homer was staring at florence hyde it was riveting to him to see someone enjoying her pregnancy honestly homer said big dot taft aint you ever seen anyone about to have a baby before yes said homer wells who looked away grace lynch was staring at him and he looked away from her too if i was your age vernon lynch told homer when they were pruning in an orchard called cock hill id enlist id do what wallys doing i cant said homer wells they dont take orphans vernon asked no homer said i have a heart defect something was born with vernon lynch was not a gossip but that was all that homer needed to say the workers at ocean view not only forgave homer for not enlisting they even began to take care of him they treated him the way dr larch would have liked to see him treated you know i didnt mean anything herb fowler told homer about the manufacturers defect i wouldnt have said that if id known about your heart thats okay homer said and in the early spring when it was time to mend the boxes for the beehives ira titcomb rushed to assist homer who was struggling with a particularly heavy pallet dont strain yourself jesus ira said i can manage ira im stronger than you are homer said not understandingat firstiras concern i heard your hearts not as strong as the rest of you ira said on mothers day vernon lynch taught him how to operate the sprayers by himself he insisted on giving homer another lecture on the use of the respirator you of all people vernon told him better keep this thing on and keep it clean me of all people said homer wells even debra pettigrew forgave him for his seemingly undefined friendship with candy as the weather warmed up they went parking again and one night they managed some lingering kisses in the pettigrews unoccupied summer house on drinkwater lake the shutup cold smell of the house reminded homer of his first days in the cider house when his kisses seemed to calm debra grew restless when his kisses seemed too passionate debra said careful dont get too excited he was a young man with unusual kindness or else he might have suggested to debra that nothing she allowed him to do would ever endanger his heart it was spring wally was sent to kelly fieldsan antonio texasfor air corps cadet training squadron flight c and melony thought that the time was right for her to hit the road again youre crazy lorna told her the more of a war there is the more good jobs there are for us the country needs to build stuffit dont need to eat more apples so will i see you next winter lorna asked her friend if i dont find ocean view or homer wells melony said so ill see you next winter lorna said youre lettin a man make an asshole out of you thats just what im not lettin him do melony said mrs grogans coat had seen better days but the bundle of belongings contained within the grasp of charleys belt had grown substantially melony had made money in the shipyards and shed treated herself to a few sturdy articles of a workingmans clothing including a good pair of boots lorna gave her a present as she was leaving i used to knit lorna explained it was a childs woolen mitten just the lefthand mitten and too small for melony but the colors were very pretty it was gonna be for a baby i never had cause i didnt stay married long enough i never got the right hand finished melony stared at the mitten which she held in her hand the mitten was very heavy it was full of ball bearings that lorna had swiped from the shipyards its a super weapon lorria explained in case you meet anyone whos a bigger asshole than you are the gift brought tears to melonys eyes and the women hugged each other goodbye melony left ejath without saying goodbye to young mary agnes cork who would have done anything to please her who asked all her school friends and everyone who appeared at ted and patty callahans to browse the antiques if any of them had ever heard of an apple orchard called ocean view if this knowledge might make melony her friend mary agnes cork would never stop inquiring after melony left bath lorna realized how much she missed her friend lorna discovered that she was asking about ocean view all the timeas if this inquiry was as necessary and loyal a part of her friendship with melony as the gift of that woolen weapon this meant that now there were three of them all looking for homer wells that summer they moved wally from san antonio to coleman texas i wish someone would declare war on texas he wrote homer that might be some justification for being here he claimed he was flying in his undershorts and socksthat was all any of them could stand to wear in such unrelenting heat where does he think hes going candy complained to homer does he expect a perfect climate hes going to a if or homer sat opposite her on ray kendalls dock the snail population forever influenced by their conversation in the cool cementfloor classroom at cape kenneth high homer would unroll the map of the world there would rarely be anyone present besides the janitor who was no better informed about geography than homer wells homer used the summer solitude to study the places of the world where he thought it would be likely that wally would go once mr hood surprised him in his studies perhaps mr hood was visiting his old classroom out of nostalgia or perhaps it was time to place an order for the next years rabbits i suppose youll be enlisting mr hood said to homer no sir homer said ive got a bad heartpulmonaryvalve stenosis mr hood stared at homers chest homer knew that the man had eyes for rabbits onlyand not very sharp eyes at that you had a heart murmur from birth mr hood asked yes sir homer said and do you still have a murmur mr hood asked not much of one not anymore homer said thats not such a bad heart then mr hood said encouragingly but why would homer wells feel that mr hood was an authority he couldnt keep his uteri straight he didnt know rabbits from sheep even the migrants were different that harvestthey were both older and younger the men in their prime had enlisted except for mr rose slim pickins for pickers this year he told olive theres too many fools think the wars more interestin than pickin apples yes i know olive said you dont have to tell me about it that harvest there was a woman mr rose called mama although she wasnt old enough to be any of their mothers her allegiance seemed quite exclusively assigned to mr rose homer knew this because the woman did what she wanted to doshe picked a little when she felt like it or when mr rose suggested it she cooked a little but she was not the cook every night and she was not everyones cook some nights she even sat on the roof but only when mr rose sat there with her she was a tall heavy young woman with a deliberate slowness that made her movements seem copied from mr rose and she wore a nearly constant smile that was not quite relaxed and not quite smirkingalso copied from mr rose it surprised homer that no special sleeping arrangements w ere made regarding the woman she had her own bed next to mr rose but no attempt was made to curtainoff their beds or otherwise construct a little privacy there was only this every once in a while when homer would drive by the cider house he would note that everyone except mr rose and his woman was either standing outside the house or sitting on the roof that must have been their time together and mr rose must have orchestrated those meetings as deliberately as he appeared to direct everything else there was a ban on shore lights by the end of that summer there was no ferris wheel to watch at night no magic lights to call by other names but these blackout conditions didnt keep the pickers off the roof they would sit in the dark looking at the dark and mr rose would say it used to be over thereit was much higher than this roof and brighter than all the stars if you hitched the stars all together it wentround androundmr rose would say the tall heavy woman leaning against him the dark heads above the roofline nodding now theres stuff out there under the oceanstuff with bombs underwater guns that stuff knows when theres a light on and the bombs get drawn to the lightslike metal to them magnets it happens automatically theres no people holding no triggers someone asked theres no triggers said mr rose everything automatic but theres people they just there to look the stuff over make sure it work right theres people out there under the ocean someone asked sure said mr rose lots of people they real smart they got this stuff so they can see you on land sure said mr rose they can see you anywhere a kind of communal sighing made the sitters on the roof resemble a chorus resting between numbers in wallys bedroom homer marveled how the world was simultaneously being invented and destroyed nothing marvelous about that dr larch would have assured him at st clouds except for the irritation about sugar stamps and other aspects of the rationing very little was changed by the war or by what other people once singled out as the depression thought wilbur larch we are an orphanage we provide these services we stay the sameif were allowed to stay the same he thought when he would almost despair when the ether was too overpowering when his own age seemed like the last obstacle and the vulnerability of his illegal enterprise was as apparent to him as the silhouettes of the br trees against the sharp night skies of autumn wilbur larch would save himself with this one thought i love homer wells and i have saved him from the war homer wells did not feel saved did anyone who was in love and was unsatisfied with how he was loved in return ever feel saved on the contrary homer w ells felt that hed been singled out for special persecution what young maneven an orphanis patient enough to wait and see about love and if wilbur larch had saved homer wells from the war even dr larch was powerless to interfere with melony during the harvest that year wally moved again to perrin field in sherman texas basic training company dbut melony moved five times she had enough money she didnt need to work she took a job in one orchard after another leaving as soon as she discovered that no one working there had ever heard of an ocean view she worked in an orchard in harpswell and in another in arrowsic she worked as far north as rockport and as far inland as appleton and lisbon she took a side trip to wiscasset because someone told her there was an ocean view there there was but it was a rooming house an icecream vendor told her hed seen an ocean view in friendship it turned out to be the name of a resident sailboat melony got in a fistfight with a head waiter in a seafood restaurant in south thomaston because she insisted on asking each of the patrons about ocean view she won the fight but she was fined for creating a disturbance she was a little low on money when she passed through boothbay harbor in early november the sea was slate gray and whitecapped the pretty boats of summer were in dry dock the wind had plenty of the coming winter in it melonys own pores as well as the earths were closing as tightly as her disappointed heart she did not recognize the sallowfaced sulky juvenile who served the icecream sodas to the candycounter customers in rinfrets pharmacy but young roy rinfret the former and deeply disappointed curly day recognized melony in an instant i used to be curly day remember me curly asked melony excitedly he thrust a lot of free candy and chewing gum at her and insisted on treating her to an icecream soda a double scooper on me curly said his adoptive parents would have disapproved boy you didnt turn out so good melony told him she meant nothing insulting by this remark it was a reference to his color which was pasty and to his sizehe hadnt grown very much she meant nothing more but the remark triggered everything that was morose and waiting to be fired in curly day youre not kidding i didnt turn out so good he said angrily i got ditched homer wells stole the people i was meant for melonys teeth were too weak for chewing gum but she pocketed it anyway it would make a nice gift for lorna melonys cavities howled when she sucked hard candy but she liked it occasionally in spite of this pain or perhaps because of itand she had never had an icecream soda before to demonstrate his loathing for his environment curly day squirted a runny glob of strawberry syrup on the floorchecking first to be sure that only melony could see he did this as if he were exercising the nozzle before he squirted the stuff on melonys soda it draws ants he explained melony doubted there were many ants left in november thats what theyre always telling me curly said dont spill it draws ants he squirted the floor a few more times im tryin to get the ants to carry this place away you still pissed at homer wells melony asked him slyly she explained that curly should simply inquireof every customerabout ocean view curly had never thought concretely about what he would do or say to homer wells if he ever encountered him again he was resentful but he was not a vengeful boy and he had a sudden clear memory of melonys violence he became suspicious what do you want to find homer for curly asked what for melony asked sweetly it wasnt clear if she had considered it well what would you like to find him for curly she asked well curly said struggling i guess id just like to see him and tell him that i was really fucked up by his going off and leaving me therewhen i thought i was the one who should be going instead of him when curly thought about it he realized hed just like to see homer wellsmaybe be his friend maybe do stuff together hed always admired homer if he felt a little deserted by him that was all he felt he started to cry melony used the paper napkin that went with her icecream soda to wipe curlys tears for him hey i know what you mean she said nicely i know how you feel i got left too you know really i just miss the guy i just want to see him curlys weeping attracted the attention of one of his adoptive parents mr rinfret the pharmacist who was stationed in that end of the store where the serious drugs were dispensed im from saint clouds melony explained to mr rinfret we were all so close therewhenever we run into each other it takes a little gettin used to she hugged curly in a motherly if somewhat burly way and mr rinfret allowed them their privacy try to remember curly melony whispered rocking the boy in her arms as if she were telling him a bedtime story ocean view just keep asking about ocean view when she had calmed him down she gave him lornas address in bath on her way back to bath melony hoped that the shipyards would hire her back and that the socalled war effort would keep the stuff on the assembly line changing that she might look forward to a task somewhat different from the insertion of those ball bearings into that hamlike sprocket with that thought she removed lornas gift mitten from the pocket of mrs grogans overcoat she had not yet needed it as a weapon but many nights its presence had comforted her and its not been a thoroughly wasted year melony reflected warmly socking the heavy mitten with a painful smack into the palm of her big hand now there are four of us looking for you sunshine they kept wally in texas yet they moved him once moreto lubbock flying school barracks d he would spend november and most of december there but the army air corps had promised to send him home for christmas soon to be in the bosom of my family he wrote to candy and homer and oliveand even to ray who had contributed to the war effort by joining the force of mechanics at the navy yard in kittery ray was building torpedoes he had hired some local boys who were still in school to help him keep his lobster business from sinking and he worked on the vehicles at ocean view on the weekends he enthusiastically demonstrated the gyroscope on olives kitchen table to olive and homer wells before a fella can fathom the torpedo ray liked to say he has to understand the gyroscope homer was interested olive was politeand whats more thoroughly dependent on ray if he didnt fix all the machinery at ocean view olive was convinced that the apples would stop growing candy was cross much of the timeeveryones war effort seened to depress her although she had volunteered to pitch in herself and had worked some very long hours at cape kenneth hospital as a nurses aide she agreed it would be indulgent to go to college and shed had no trouble convincing homer that he should pitch in toowith his background he could be a more useful nurses aide than most right homer said but if homer had returned to a semihospital life against his will he soon found he felt comfortable there however it was at times difficult to withhold his expert opinion on certain subjects and to play the beginner in a role he was disquietingly born to even the nurses were condescending to the nurses aides and homer was irritated to see that the doctors were condescending to everyone most of all to their patients candy and homer were not allowed to give shots or medication but they had more to do than make beds empty bedpans give back rubs and baths and run those errands of friendliness that gave the modern hospital such a constant scuff of feet they were given deliveryroom duties for example homer was unimpressed with the obstetrical procedure he witnessed it could not hold a candle to dr larchs work and in some cases it could not hold a candle to his own if dr larch had often criticized homer for his heavy touch with ether homer could not imagine how the old man would react to the heavyhandedness that was applied to that inhalation at cape kenneth hospital in st clouds homer had seen many patients who were so lightly etherized that they could converse throughout their own operations in cape kenneths recovery rooms the patients struggling to emerge from their ether doses looked bludgeonedthey snored gapmouthed with their hands hanging deadweight and the muscles in their cheeks so slack that at times their eyes were pulled half open it especially angered homer to see how they dosed the childrenas if the doctors or the anesthetists were so uninformed that they didnt pause to consider the patients body weight one day he sat with candy on either side of a fiveyearold boy who was recovering from a tonsillectomy that was nursesaide work you sat with the patient coming out of ether especially the children especially the tonsillectomiesthey were often frightened and in pain and nauseous when they woke homer claimed they wouldnt be nearly so nauseous if theyd been given a little less ether one of the nurses was in the recovery room with them it was the one they likeda young homely girl about their age her name was caroline and she was nice to the patients and tough to the doctors you know a lot about ether homer nurse caroline said it seems overused to me in certain cases homer mumbled hospitals arent perfect theyre just expected to be nurse caroline said and doctors arent perfect either they just think they are right said homer wells the fiveyearolds throat was very sore when he finally woke up and he went on retching for quite some time before any ice cream would slide down his throat and stay down one of the things the nurses aides did was to be sure that the children in such condition didnt choke on their own vomit homer explained to candy that it was very important that the child in a semietherized state not aspirate or inhale any fluid such as vomit into the lungs aspirate nurse caroline said was your father a doctor homer not exactly said homer wells it was nurse caroline who introduced homer to young dr harlow who was in the throes of growing out his bangs a cowlick persisted in making his forehead look meager a floppy shelf of strawcolored hair gave dr harlows eyes the constant anxiousness of someone peering from under the brim of a hat oh yes wellsour ether expert dr efarlow said snidely i grew up in an orphanage said homer wells i did a lot of helping out around the hospital but surely you never administered any ether said dr harlow surely not lied homer wells as dr larch had discovered with the board of trustees it was especially gratifying to lie to unlikeable people dont show off candy told homer when they were driving back to hearts haven together it doesnt become you and it could get your doctor larch in trouble when did i show off homer asked you really havent yet candy said just dont okay homer sulked and dont sulk candy told him that doesnt become you either im just waiting and seeing said homer wells you know how that is he let her out at the lobster pound he usually came in with her and chatted with ray but homer was mistaken to confuse candys irritability either with coldness toward him or with anything but the profoundest confusion of her own she slammed the door and walked around to his side of the van before he could drive away she indicated he should roll down his window then she leaned inside and kissed him on the mouth she yanked his hair hardwith both hands tilting his head backand then she bit him quite sharply in the throat she banged her head on the window frame when she pulled herself back from him her eyes were watery but no tears spilled to her face do you think im having a good time she asked him do you think im teasing you do you think i know whether i want you or wally he drove back to cape kenneth hospital he needed work more substantial than mousing it was the goddamn mousing season againhow he hated handling the poison he arrived simultaneously with a sailor slashed up in a knife fight it had happened where ray workedin kittery navy yardand the sailors buddies had driven him around in a makeshift tourniquet running out of gas coupons and getting lost on the way to several hospitals much nearer to the scene of the fight than the one in cape kenneth the gash into the fleshy web between the sailors thumb and forefinger extended nearly to the sailors wrist homer helped nurse caroline wash the wound with ordinary white soap and sterile water homer could not help himselfhe was accustomed to speaking to nurse angela and to nurse edna in the voice of an authority take his blood pressure opposite arm he said to nurse caroline and put the bloodpressure cuff on over a bandageto protect the skin he added because nurse caroline was staring at him curiously the cuff might have to be on there for a half hour or more said homer wells i think i can give instructions to nurse caroline if you dont mind dr harlow said to homer both the doctor and his nurse stared at homer wells as if they had witnessed an ordinary animal touched with divine powers as if they half expected homer to pass his hand over the profusely bleeding sailor and stop the flow of blood as quickly as the tourniquet stopped it very neat job wells dr harlow said homer observed the injection of the percent procaine into the wound and the subsequent probing of dr harlow the knife had entered on the palmar side of the hand observed homer wells he remembered his grays and he remembered the movie he had seen with debra pettigrew the cavalry officer with the arrow in his hand the arrow that fortunately missed the branch of the median nerve that goes to the muscles of the thumb he watched the sailor move his thumb dr harlow was looking theres a rather important branch of the median nerve dr harlow said slowly to the cutup sailor youre lucky if thats not cut the knife missed it said homer wells yes it did said dr harlow looking up from the wound how do you know he asked homer wells who held up the thumb of his right hand and wiggled it not only an ether expert i see said dr harlow still snidely knows all about muscles too just about that one said homer wells i used to read grays anatomyfor fun he added for fun said dr harlow i suppose you know all about blood vessels then why not tell me where all this blood is coming from homer wells felt nurse caroline brush his hand with her hip it was surely sympathetic contactnurse caroline didnt care for dr harlow either despite candys certain disapproval homer couldnt help himself the blood vessel is a branch of the palmar arch he said very good said dr harlow disappointed and what would you recommend i do about it tie it said homer wells threeo chromic precisely said dr harlow you didnt get that from grays he pointed out to homer wells that the knife had also cut the tendons of the flexor digitorumprofundus and the flexor digitorum sublimis and where might they go he asked homer wells to the index finger homer said is it necessary to repair both tendons asked dr harlow i dont know said homer wells i dont know a lot about tendons he added how surprising said dr harlow it is only necessary to repair the profundus he explained im going to use twoo silk ill need something finer to bring the edges of the tendon together fouro silk recommended homer wells very good said dr harlow and something to close the palmar fascia threeo chromic said homer wells this boy knows his stitches dr harlow said to nurse caroline who was staring intently at homer wells close the skin with fouro silk homer said and then id recommend a pressure dressing on the palmyoull want to curve the fingers a little bit around the dressing thats called the position of function dr harlow said i dont know what its called homer said were you ever in medical school wells dr harlow asked him not exactly said homer wells do you plan to go dr harlow asked its not likely homer said he tried to leave the operating room then but dr harlow called after him why arent you in the service he called ive got a heart problem homer said i dont suppose you know what its called said dr harlow right said homer wells he might have found out about his pulmonary valve stenosis on the spot if he had only asked he might have had an xray and an expert readinghe could have learned the truth but who seeks the truth from unlikable sources he went and read some stories to the tonsillectomy patients they were all dumb storieschildrens books didnt impress homer wells but the tonsillectomy patients were not likely to be around long enough to hear david copperfield or great expectations nurse caroline asked him if he would give a bath and a back rub to the large man recovering from the prostate operation dont ever underestimate the pleasure of pissing the big man told homer wells no sir homer said rubbing the mountain of flesh until the big man shone a healthy pink olive was not home when homer returned to ocean view it was her time for plane spotting they used what was called the yachtwatching tower at the haven club but homer didnt think any planes had been spotted all the men spottersmost of them seniors former drinking companionshad the silhouettes of the enemy planes tacked on their lockers the women brought the silhouettes home and stuck them on places like the refrigerator door olive was a plane spotter for two hours every day homer studied the silhouettes that olive had on the refrigerator i could learn all those he was thinking and i can learn everything there is to know about apple farming but what he already knew he knew was nearperfect obstetrical procedure and the far easier procedurethe one that was against the rules he thought about rules that sailor with the slashed hand had not been in a knife fight that was according to anyones rules in a fight with mr rose there would be mr roses own rules whatever they were a knife fight with mr rose would be like being pecked to death by a small bird thought homer wells mr rose was an artist he would take just the tip of a nose just a button or a nipple the real cider house rules were mr roses and what were the rules at st clouds what were larchs rules which rules did dr larch observe which ones did he break or replaceand with what confidence clearly candy was observing some rules but whose and did wally know what the rules were and melonydid melony obey any rules wondered homer wells look said lorna theres a war have you noticed so what said melony because hes probably in it thats so what lorna said because he either enlisted or hes gonna get drafted melony shook her head i cant see him in a war not him he just doesnt belong there for christs sake lorna said you think everyone in a war belongs there if he goes then hell come back melony said the ice on the kennebec in december was not secure it was a tidal river it was brackish and there was open water gray and choppy in the middle but not even melony could throw a beer bottle as far as the middle of that river in bath her bottle bouncing off the creaky ice made a hollow sound and rolled toward the open water it couldnt reach it disturbed a gull who got up and walked a short way along the ice like an old woman holding up a number of cumbersome petticoats above a puddle not everyones comin back from this warthats all im sayin lorna replied wally had trouble coming back from texas there were a series of delays and bad weather the landing field was closedwhen homer and candy picked him up in boston the first thing he told them was that he had only fortyeight hours he was still happy howeverhe was still wally candy would say laterand especially pleased that hed received his commission second lieutenant worthington wally announced to olive everyone cried even ray with the gas rationing they couldnt manage the usual driving around and around homer wondered when wally would want to be alone with candy and how they would manage it surely he wants to manage it homer thought does she want to too he wondered for christmas eve everyone was together and christmas day there was nowhere to go olive was home and ray wasnt building torpedoes or pulling lobster traps and the day after christmas candy and homer would have to take wally back to boston oh candy and wally did plenty of hugging and kissing everyone could see that on christmas night in wallys bedroom homer realized that hed been so glad to see wally that hed forgotten to notice very much about his second christmas away from st clouds he also realized hed forgotten to send dr larch anything not even a christmas card ive got more flying school to get through wally was saying but i think its going to be india for me india said homer wells the burma run said wally to go from india to china you got to go over burma the japs are in burma homer wells had studied the maps at cape kenneth high he knew that burma was mountains that burma was jungles when they shot your plane down there would be quite a wide range of possible things to land on how are things with candy homer asked great wally said well ill see tomorrow he added ray went early to build the torpedoes and homer observed that wally left ocean view at about the same time ray would be leaving for kittery homer spent the early morning being of little comfort to olive fortyeight hours is not what id call coming home she said he hasnt been here for a yeardoes he call this a proper visit does the army call it a proper visit candy and wally came to pick up homer before noon homer imagined that they had managed it but how does one know such things short of asking do you want me to drive homer asked he had the window seat and candy sat between them whywally asked maybe you want to hold hands homer said candy looked at him weve already held hands wally said laughing but thank you anyway candy did not look amused homer thought so youve done it you mean homer wells asked them both candy stared straight ahead and wally didnt laugh this time whats that old boy he asked i said so youve done ithad sex i mean said homer wells jesus homer said wally thats a fine thing to ask yes weve done ithad sex candy said still looking straight ahead i hope you were careful homer said to both of them i hope you took some precautions jesus homer wally said yes we were careful candy said now she stared at him her look as neutral as possible well im glad you were careful homer said speaking directly to candy you should be carefulhaving sex with someone whos about to fly over burma burma candy turned to wally you didnt say where you were going she said is it burma i dont know where im going wally said irritably jesus homer whats the matter with you i love you both said homer wells if i love you ive got a right to ask anything i wantive got a right to know anything i want to know it was as they say in maine a real conversation stopper they rode almost all the way to boston in silence except that wally saidtrying to be funnyi dont know about you homer youre becoming very philosophical it was a rough goodbye i love you both tooyou know wally said in parting i know you do homer said on the way home candy said to homer wells i wouldnt say philosophical i would say eccentric youre becoming very eccentric in my opinion and you dont have a right to know everything about me whether you love me or not all youve got to know is do you really love him homer said do you love wally ive grown up loving wally candy said i have always loved wally and i always will fine homer said thats all there is to it then but i dont even know wally anymore candy said i know you better and i love you too homer wells sighed so were in for more waiting and seeing he thought his feelings were hurt wally hadnt once asked him about his heart what would he have answered anyway wilbur larch who knew that there was absolutely nothing wrong with homers heart wondered where homers heart was not in st clouds he feared and wally went to victorville californiaadvanced flying school us army air forcesthat is what his stationery said wally spent several months in victorville all the pruning months as homer wells would remember them shortly after apple blossom time when ira titcombs bees had spread their marvelous life energies through the orchards of ocean view wally was sent to india the japanese held mandalay wally dropped his first bombs on the railroad bridge in myitnge tracks and the embankment of the south approach were badly smashed and the south span of the bridge was destroyed all aircraft and crews returned safely wally also dropped his bombs on the industrial area of myingyan but heavy clouds prevented adequate observation of the destruction in that summer when homer wells was painting the cider house white again wally bombed the jetty at akyab and the shweli bridge in northern burma later he hit the railroad yards at prome he contributed to the ten tons of bombs that were dropped on the railroad yards at shwebo and to the fires that were left burning in the warehouses at kawlin and thanbyuzayat the most spectacular hits he would remember were in the oil fields in yenangyatthe sight of those oil derricks ablaze would stay with wally on his return flight across the jungles across the mountains all aircraft and crews returned safely they made him a captain and gave him what he called easy work always be suspicious of easy work dr wilbur larch once said to homer wells wally had won the bestnamefora plane competition at fort meade now he finally got to use it he got to name his own plane opportunity knocks he called it the painted fist under the inscription looked very authoritative it would later puzzle candy and homer wells that thename was not knocks once or twice but just knocks he flew the indiachina route over the himalayas over burma he carried gasoline and bombs and artillery and rifles and ammunition and clothing and aircraft engines and spare parts and food to china he brought military personnel back to india it was a sevenhour roundtrip flightabout five hundred miles for six of the hours he wore an oxygen maskthey had to fly so high over the mountains they flew high because of the mountains over the jungles they flew high because of the japanese the himalayas have the most vicious air currents in the world when he left assam the temperature was a hundred and ten degrees fahrenheit it was like texas wally would think they wore just their shorts and socks the heavily loaded transports needed to climb to fifteen thousand feet in thirtyfive minutes that was when they reached the first mountain pass at nine thousand feet wally put on his pants at fourteen thousand he put on the fleecelined suit it was twenty degrees below zero up there in the monsoon weather they flew mostly on instruments they called that aerial route the lifeline they called it flying over the hump here were the headlines on the fourth of july yanks wreck rail bridge in burma chinese rout japs in hupeh province here is what wally wrote to candy and to homer wally was getting lazy he sent the same limerick to both there was a young man of bombay who fashioned a cunt out of clay but the heat of his prick turned it into a brick and chafed all his foreskin away that summer of the public interest in keeping use of the shore lights to a minimum forced the temporary closing of the cape kenneth drivein theater which homer wells did not feel as a tragic loss since he would have had no choice but to attend the movies with candy and debra pettigrew he was grateful to the war effort for sparing him that awkwardness mr rose informed olive that he would be unable to provide a worthwhile picking crew for the harvest considering the men who are gone he wrote and the travel i mean the gas rationing then weve spruced up the cider house for nothing homer said to olive nothing is ever improved for nothing homer she said the yankee justification for hard work in the summer months is both desperate and undone by the rare pleasure of that fleeting season homer wellsnurses aide and orchardmanwas mowing in the rows between the trees when the news came to him on a sweltering june day he was driving the international harvester and he had his eye on the sickle bar he didnt want to snag a stump or a fallen branch for that reason he didnt see the green van which was trying to head him off he almost ran into it because the tractor was runningand the mower blades toohe didnt hear what candy was yelling when she jumped out of the van and ran to him olive was driving her face a stone shot down candy was screaming when homer finally shut off the ignition he was shot downover burma over burma said homer wells he dismounted from the tractor and held the sobbing girl in his arms the tractor was shut off but the engine still knocked and then shuddered and then throbbed its heat made the air shimmer maybe thought homer wells the air is always shimmering over burma over burma two weeks after wallys plane was shot down captain worthington and the crew of opportunity knocks were still listed as missing a plane making the same run had noted that approximately one square mile of the burmese jungle roughly halfway between india and china had been consumed by firepresumably caused by the exploding plane the cargo was identified as jeep engines spare parts and gasoline there was no evidence of the crew the jungle was dense in that area and believed to be unpopulated a spokesman for the us army air forces paid a personal visit to olive and told her that there was some reason to be optimistic that the plane obviouslj had not exploded in the air meant that the crew rniight have had time to bail out what would have happened afterward was anyones guess that would have been a better name for the plane thought homer wells anyones guess but homer was supportive of olive and candys view that wally was not dead that he was just missing privately homer and ray kendall agreed that there wasnt much hope for wally just suppose he didnt go down with the plane ray said to homer when they were pulling lobster pots so then hes in the middle of the jungle and what does he do there he cant let the japs find him and theres got to be japs aroundthey shot down the plane didnt they there could be natives said homer wells friendly burmese villagers he suggested or nobody at all ray kendall said some tigers and lots of snakes he added aw shit he shoulda been in a submarine if your friend survived all the rest wrote wilbur larch to homer wells hes got all the diseases of asia to worry aboutlots of diseases it was horrible to imagine wally suffering and not even homers longing for candy could allow him any comfort with the idea that wally was already dead in that case homer knew candy would always imagine that she loved wally best reality for orphans is so often outdistanced by their ideals if homer wanted candy he wanted her ideally in order for candy to choose homer wally had to be alive and because homer loved wally he also wanted wallys blessing wouldnt any other way be compromising to them all wilbur larch was flattered that homer asked his adviceand on a matter of romantic love of all things how should i behave with candy homer had asked the old man was used to being such an authority that he found it natural to assume an authoritative voiceeven regarding a subject he knows nothing about nurse angela said to nurse edna indignantly larch was so proud of what he had written homer that he showed his letter to his old nurses before sending it along have you forgotten what life is like at st clouds dr larch asked homer have you drifted so far away from us that you find a life of compromise to be unacceptable and you an orphanof all people have you forgotten how to be of use dont think so badly of compromises we dont always get to choose the ways we can be of use you say you love herthen lether use you it may not be the way you had in mind but if you love her you have to give her what she needsand when she needs it not necessarily when you think the time is right and what can she give you of herself only what she has leftand if thats not everything you had in mind whose fault is that are you not going to accept her because she hasnt got percent of herself to give some of her is over burmaare you going to reject the rest are you going to hold out for all or nothing and do you call that being of use its not very romantic nurse angela said to nurse edna when was wilbur ever romantic nurse edna asked your advice is awfully utilitarian nurse angela said to dr larch well i should hope so dr larch said sealing the letter now homer had a companion in sleeplessness he and candy preferred the night shift at cape kenneth hospital when there was a lull in their work they were allowed to doze on the beds in the childrens noncommunicable ward homer found that the music of the restless children soothed himtheir troubles and pains familiar their whimpers and outcries and night terrors transporting him beyond his own anxieties and candy felt that the drawn black curtains in the nighttime hospital were suitable for mourning the prevailing blackout conditionswhich she and homer had to observe in driving to and from the hospital if it was after dark were also to candys liking they used wallys cadillac for these occasionsthey were permitted to travel with only parking lights on and the cadillacs parking lights were the brightest even so the dark coastal roads seemed barely lit they drove at funeral speed if the stationmaster at st clouds formerly the stationmasters assistant had ever seen them passing he would have thought again that they were driving a white hearse meany hyde whose wife florence was expecting told homer that he was sure his new baby would share something of wallys soul if wally was truly dead and if wally was alive meany said the appearance of the new baby would signify wallys escape from burma everett taft told homer that his wife big dot had been plagued by dreams that could only mean that wally was struggling to communicate with ocean view even ray kendall dividing his underwater attention between his lobsters and his torpedoes said that he was reading his lobster pots by which he meant that he found the content of the traps hauled from the deep to be worthy of interpretation untouched bait was a special sign if the lobsters which prefer food thats truly dead wouldnt take the bait it must mean that the bait was manifesting a living spirit and you know i aint religious ray said to homer right homer said because homer wells had spent many years wondering if his mother would ever return to claim him if she even thought about him if she was alive or dead he was better at accepting wallys undefined status than the rest of them were an orphan understands what it means that someone important is just missing olive and candy mistaking homers composure for indifference were occasionally shorttempered with him im only doing what we all have to do he saidreserving special emphasis for candy im just waiting and seeing there were few fireworks that fourth of july for one thing they would have violated the blackout conditions and for another any simulation of bombs and gunfire would have been disrespectful to those among our boys who were facing the real music in the nighttime hospital at cape kenneth the nurses aides conducted a quiet independence day celebration which was interrupted by the hysterics of a woman who demanded an abortion from the young and imperious dr harlow who believed in obeying the law but there is a war the woman countered her husband was dead hed been killed in the pacific she had the wire from the war department to prove it she was nineteen and not quite three months pregnant ill be glad to speak with her again when shes behaving reasonably dr harlow told nurse caroline why should she behave reasonably nurse caroline asked him homer wells had to trust his instincts regardi ng nurse caroline besides she had told him and candy that she was a socialist and im not pretty she added truthfully therefore im not interested in marriage in my case id be expected to appear gratefulor at least to consider myself lucky the hysterical woman would not be calmed perhaps because nurse carolines heart wasnt in it im not asking for anything secrety the woman shouted why should have to have this baby homer wells found a piece of paper with columns for laboratory analysis he wrote the following across the columns you go to st clouds you ask for the orphanage he gave the piece of paper to candy who gave it to nurse carolinewho looked at it before she gave it to the woman who instantly stopped protesting when the woman had gone nurse caroline made homer and candy accompany her to the dispensary ill tell you what i usually do nurse caroline said as if she were furious with them i perform a perfectly safe dilatation without the curettage i just dilate the cervix do this in my kitchen and im very careful they have to come to the hospital for a completion of course someone might think they tried to do it themselves but theres no infection and nothings damaged theyve just miscarried theyve had the d without the c all they need is a good scraping and the bastards have to be accommodating theres all the bleeding and its clear the womans already lost it she paused and glared at homer wells youre an expert about this too arent you righthomer said and you know a better way than my way she asked not that much better he said its a complete d and c and the doctor is a gentleman a gentleman nurse caroline said doubtfully whats the gentleman cost hes free homer said im free too nurse caroline said he asks you to make a donation to the orphanage if you can afford it said homer wells why hasnt he been caught nurse caroline asked i dont know homer said maybe people are grateful people are people nurse caroline said in her socialist voice you took a stupid chance telling me and a more stupid chance telling that womanyou dont even know her yes homer agreed your doctor isnt going to last if you keep that up nurse caroline said right homer said dr harlow found them all in the dispensary only candy looked guilty and therefore he stared at her what are these two experts telling you dr harlow asked he spent a lot of time looking at candy when he thought no one saw him but homer wells saw him and nurse caroline was very sensitive to the longings other women inspired candy was tonguetied which made her seem more guilty and dr harlow turned to nurse caroline you got rid of the hysteric he asked her no problem nurse caroline said i know that you disapprove dr harlow told her but rules exist for reasons rules exist for reasons said homer wells uncontrollably it was such a stupid thing to say he felt compelled to repeat it dr harlow stared at him no doubt youre an abortion expert too wells dr harlow said its not very hard to be an abortion expert homer wells said its a pretty easy thing to do you think so dr harlow asked aggressively well what do i know homer wells said shrugging yes what do you know dr harlow said not much nurse caroline said gruffly even dr harlow appreciated this even candy smiled homer wells smiled sheepishly too you see im getting smarter that is what he smiled to nurse caroline who viewed him with an expression of condescension that was proper for nurses to exhibit only to nurses aides dr harlow seemed to feel that the pecking order he revered was being treated with the reverence that was mandatory from them all a kind of glaze appeared to coat his face a texture composed of righteousness and adrenaline homer wells gave himself a brief sensation of pleasure by imagining something that could wake up dr harlow and humble him mr roses knife work might have that effect on dr harlowhomer imagined mr rose undressing dr harlow with his knife eveiy article of clothing would be gathered around the doctors ankles in strips and tatters yet on the doctors naked body there wouldnt be a scratch a month after wallys plane was shot down they heard from the crew of opportunity knocks we were halfway to china the copilot wrote when the nips took some potshots captain worthington ordered the crew to bail out the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together the copilot jumped third the roof of the jungle was so dense that when the first man crashed through it he could not see the other parachutes the jungle itself was so thick that the crew had to search for the others it took him seven hours to find the radioman the rain was so heavyit made such a din against the broad palm leavesnone of the men heard the plane explode the atmosphere was so rich with its own scents that the smell of the burning gasoline and the smoke from the fire never reached them they wondered if the plane had not miraculously recovered itself and flown on when they looked up they could not see through the treetops which everywhere glittered with bright green pigeons in seven hours the crew chief contacted thirteen leeches of various sizeswhich the radioman thoughtfully removed the crew chief plucked fifteen leeches off the radioman they found that the best way to remove the leeches was to touch the lighted end of a cigarette to their posterior ends that way they would release their contact with the flesh if you just pulled them they kept breaking their strong sucking mouths would remain attached the radioman and the crew chief ate nothing for five days when it rainedwhich it did most of the time they drank the rainwater that gathered in puddles in the big palm leaves they were afraid to drink the other water they encountered in some of the water they thought they saw crocodiles because the radioman was afraid of snakes the crew chief did not point out the snakes he saw the crew chief was afraid of tigers and he thought he saw one once but the radioman maintained that they only heard a tiger or several tigersor the same tiger several times the crew chief said that the same tiger followed them for five days the leeches tired them out they said although the roof of the jungle made the pelting rain louder it did keep the rain from falling directly on the two men yet the jungle was so saturated that the rain almost constantly dripped on themand when for brief intervals the rain stopped the roof of the jungle allowed no sunlight to penetrate to the jungle floor and the raucous birds silent in the rain were louder than the rain when they had their opportunities to protest the monsoon the radioman and the crew chief had no idea where wally and the copilot were on the fifth day they met up with the copilot who reached a native village only a day ahead of them he was quite badly drained by the leechessince hed been traveling alone hed had no one to burn off the leeches he couldnt reach in the middle of his back there had been quite a gathering of them which the natives were skillful at removing they used a lighted stalk of bamboo like a cigar the natives were burmese and friendly although they spoke no english they made it clear that they had no fondness for the japanese invasion and also that they knew the way to china but where was wally the copilot had landed in a grove of ironwood and the canes of bamboo that he had to hack his way through were as stout as a mans thigh the edge of his machete was as dull and round as the back of the blade the burmese let them know they were not safe to stay and wait for wally where they were some of the villagers would lead the copilot the crew chief and the radioman into china for that trip they darkened their skin with mashed peepul berries and tied orchids in their hair they didnt want to look like white men the trip took twenty days walking they traveled two hundred twentyfive miles they cooked no food at the end of the journey their rice was moldythere was so much rain the crew chief claimed he was terminally constipated the copilot claimed he was dying of diarrhea the radioman shat rabbit pellets and carried a lowgrade fever for fifteen of the twenty days he grew a helmet of ringworm each man lost about forty pounds when they reached their base in china they were hospitalized for a week then they were flown back to india where the copilot was retained in the hospital for diagnosis and treatment of an amoebano one could say what amoeba it was the crew chief had a colon problem he was also retained the radioman and his ringworm went back to work they took all our gear when they put us in the hospital in china he wrote to olive when they gave it back to us it was all lumped together there was four compasses there was just three of us but there was four compasses one of us jumped out of the plane with captain worthingtons compass in the radiomans opinion it was better to have crashed with the plane than to have landed in that part of burma without a compass in august of burma officially declared war against great britain and the united states candy told homer that she needed a new place to sit to be left alone the dock made her want to jump off shed sat too many times on that dock with wally it didnt help that homer would sit there with her now i know a place homer told her maybe olive was right he thought maybe they hadnt cleaned the cider house for nothing when it rained candy sat inside and listened to the drops on the tin roof she wondered if the jungle sounded as loud as that or louder and if the sweet rot smell of the cider apples was anything like the stifling decayinprogress smell of the jungle floor when the weather was clear candy sat on the roof some nights she allowed homer wells to tell her stories there perhaps it was the absence of the ferris wheel and of mr roses interpretations of the darkness that prompted homer wells to tell candy everything that summer wilbur larch wrote to the roosevelts again he had written to them both so many times under the constellations of ether that he was unsure whether he had actually written to them or had only imagined doing it he never wrote to one without writing to the other he usually began dear mr president and dear mrs roosevelt but occasionally he felt more informal and began dear franklin delano roosevelt once he even began dear eleanor that summer he addressed the president quite plainly mr roosevelt he wrote dispensing with the endearment i know that you must be terribly busy with the war yet i feel such confidence in your humanitarianism and in your commitment to the poor to the forgotten and especially to childrento mrs roosevelt he wrote i know your husband must be very busy but perhaps you could point out to him a matter of the utmost urgencyfor it concerns the rights of women and the plight of the unwanted child the confusing configurations of light that dazzled the dispensary ceiling contributed to the strident and incomprehensible manner of the letter these same people who tell us we must defend the lives of the unbornthey are the same people who seem not so interested in defending anyone but themselves after the accident of birth is complete these same people who profess their love of the unborns soulthey dont care to make much of a contribution to the poor they dont care to offer much assistance to the unwanted or the oppressed how do they justify such a concern for the fetus and such a lack of concern for unwanted and abused children they condemn others for the accident of conception they condemn the pooras if the poor can help being poor one way the poor could help themselves would be to be in control of the size of their families thought that freedom of choice was obviously democratic was obviously american you roosevelts are national heroes you are my heroes anyway how can you tolerate this countrys antiamerican antidemocratic abortion laws by now dr larch had stopped writing and was ranting in the dispensary nurse edna went to the dispensary door and rattled the frostedglass panels is it a democratic society that condemns people to the accident of conception roared wilbur larch what are wemonkeys if you expect people to be responsible for their children you have to give them the right to choose whether or not to have children what are you people thinking of youre not only crazy youre ogres wilbur larch was yelling so loudly that nurse edna went into the dispensary and shook him wilbur the children can hear you she told him and the mothers everyone can hear you no one hears me said dr larch nurse edna recognized the involuntary twitching in wilbur larchs cheeks and the slackness in his lower lip the doctor was just emerging from ether the president doesnt answer my letters larch complained to nurse edna hes very busy nurse edna said he may not even get to read your letters what about eleanor wilbur larch asked what about eleanor nurse edna asked doesnt she get to read her letters wilbur larchs tone of voice was whiny like a childs and nurse edna patted the back of his hand which was spotted with brown freckles missus roosevelt is very busy too nurse edna said but im sure shell get around to answering you its been years dr larch said quietly turning his face to the wall nurse edna let him doze in that position for a while she restrained herself from touching him she was inclined to brush his hair back from his forehead in the manner that she often soothed any number of the little ones were they all becoming children again and were they as nurse angela claimed all becoming the same all resembling each other even physically anyone visiting st clouds for the first time might suspect that they were all members of the same family suddenly nurse angela surprised her in the dispensary well are we out of it she asked nurse edna whats the trouble i was sure i ordered a whole case a case of what nurse edna asked merthiolatered nurse angela said crossly i asked you to get me some red merthiolatetheres not a drop left in the delivery room oh i forgot said nurse edna bursting into tears wilbur larch woke up i know how busy you both are he said to the roosevelts although he gradually recognized nurse edna and nurse angelatheir tired arms held out to him my faithful friends he said as if he were addressing a vast audience of wellwishers my fellow laborers said wilbur larch as if he were running for reelection a little tiredly but no less earnestly seeking the support of his companions who also honored the lords work olive worthington sat in wallys room with the lights off that way if homer looked into the house from the outside he wouldnt see her sitting there she knew that homer and candy were at the cider house and she tried to tell herself that she did not resent the apparent comfort homer could give to candy he was powerless to comfort olive in the slightest in truth homers presence given wallys absenceirritated olive and it was testimony to her strength of character that she was able to criticize herself for this irritation only rarely did she allow her irritation to show and she would never have considered candy unfaithfulnot even if candy had announced to everyone that she was giving wally up and marrying homer wells it was only that olive knew candy olive realized that candy could not give wally up without giving him up for dead and olive would have resented that he doesnt feel dead olive thought and it isnt homers fault that he is here and wally is there she reminded herself a mosquito was in the room and its needlelike whine so disturbed olive that she forgot why she was keeping wallys room in darkness she turned on the lights to hunt for the mosquito wouldnt there be terrible mosquitoes where wally was the burmese mosquitoes were speckled and much larger than the maine variety ray kendall was also alone but he was only mildly bothered by the mosquitoes it was a still night and ray watched the silent heat lightning violate the blackout conditions along the coast he was worried about candy raymond kendall knew how someone elses death could arrest your own life and he regretted in advance how the forward motion of candys life might be halted by her losing wally if it was me ray said aloud td take the other fella the other fella ray knew was more like ray it wasnt that ray preferred homer wells to wallyit was that ray understood homer better yet ray did not disrupt a single snail while he sat on his dock he knew that it took a snail too long to get where it was going every time you throw a snail off the dock ray teased homer wells youre making someone start his whole life over maybe im doing him a favor said homer wells the orphan ray had to admit that he liked that boy the heat lightning was less spectacular from the cider house roofthe sea was not visible even in the brightest flashes yet the lightning was more disquieting there both its distance and its silence reminded candy and homer wells of a war they could not feel or hear for them it was a war of faroff flashes i think hes alive candy said to homer when they sat together on the roof they held hands i think hes dead said homer wells that was when they both saw the lights go on in wallys room that night in august the trees were full the boughs bent and heavy and the applesall but the bright waxygreen gravensteinswere a pale greengoingtopink the grass in the rows between the trees was kneehigh there would be one more mowing before the harvest that night there was an owl hooting from the orchard called cock hill candy and homer also heard a fox bark from the orchard called frying pan foxes can climb trees said homer wells no they cant candy said apple trees anyway homer said wally told me hes alive candy whispered in the flash of heat lightning that illuminated her face homer saw her tears sparkle her face was wet and salty when he kissed her it was a trembling awkward proposition kissing on the cider house roof i love you said homer wells i love you too candy said but hes alive he isnthomer said i love him candy said i know you do said homer wells i love him too candy lowered her shoulder and put her head against homers chest so that he couldnt kiss her he held her with one arm while his other hand strayed to her breast where it stayed this is so hard she whispered but she let his hand stay where it was there were those distant flashes of light out to sea and a warm breeze so faint it barely stirred the apple leaves or candys hair olive in wallys room followed the mosquito from a lampshade against which she was unable to strike it to a spot on the white wall above homers bed when she mashed the mosquito with the heel of her hand the dimesized spot of blood left on the wall surprised herthe filthy little creature had been gorging itself olive wet her index finger and dabbed at the blood spot which only made the mess worse angry at herself she got up from homers bed unnecessarily smoothing his untouched pillow she smoothed wallys untouched pillow too then she turned off the nighttable lamp she paused in the doorway of the empty room to look things over and turned off the overhead light homer wells held candy around her hipsto help her off the roof they must have known it was precarious to kiss on top of the cider house it was more dangerous for them on the ground they were standing together arms loosely around each others waistshis chin touching her forehead she was shaking her head no no but just a littlewhen they both became aware that the lights from wallys room were out they leaned against each other as they walked to the cider house the tall grass clutching at their legs they were careful not to let the screen door bang who could have heard it they preferred the darkness because they did not reach for the light switch in the kitchen they never came in contact with the cider house rules that were tacked next to it only the palest flashes of the heat lightning showed them the way to the sleeping quarters where the twin rows of iron beds stood with their harsh springs exposedthe old mattresses rolled in army barracks fashion at the foot of each bed they unrolled one it was a bed that had held many transients the history of the dreams encountered upon that bed was rich the small moan that caught in the back of candys throat was soft and difficult to hear above the iron screeching of the beds rusted springs the moan was as delicate in that fermented air as the fluttery touch of candys hands lighting like butterflies upon homers shoulders before he felt her hands grip him hardher fingers sinking in as she held him tight the moan that escaped her then was sharper than the grinding bed springs and nearly as loud as homers own sound oh this boy whose crying had once been a legend upriver in three mile falls oh how he could sound olive worthington rigid in her bed listened to what she thought was an owl on cock hill what is it hooting about she thought she thought of anything that would distract her from her vision of the mosquitoes in the jungles of burma mrs grogan lay wide awake momentarily frightened for her soul the good woman had absolutely nothing to fear it was an owl she heardit made such a mournful sound wilbur larch who seemed always to be wide awake passed his skillful careful fingers across the keyboard of the typewriter in nurse angelas office oh please mr president he wrote young steerforth who suffered allergies to dust and to mold found the night oppressive it seemed to him that he couldnt breathe he was lazy about getting out of bed and therefore blew his nose on his pillowcase nurse edna rushed to him at the sound of such thick and troubled trumpeting although steerforths allergies were not severe the last orphan who was allergic to dust and mold was fuzzy stone you have done so much good already wilbur larch wrote to franklin d roosevelt and your voice on the radio gives me hope as a member of the medical profession i am aware of the insidiousness of the disease you have personally triumphed over after you anyone who holds your office will be ashamed if he fails to serve the poor and the neglectedor should be ashamed ray kendall stretched out upon his dock as if the sea had cast him up there could not make himself get up go inside and go to bed it was rare for the coastal air to be so torpid the air was simply airasusual at st clouds i saw a picture of you and your wifeyou were attending a church service i think it was episcopal wrote wilbur larch to the president i dont know what they tell you in that church about abortion but here is something you should know thirtyfive to fortyfive percent of our countrys population growth can be attributed to unplanned unwanted births couples who are welltodo usually want their babies only seventeen percent of the babies born to welltodo parents are unwanted but what about the poor fortytwo percent of the babies born to parents living in poverty are unwanted mr president that is almost half and these are not the times of ben franklin who as you probably know was so keen to increase the population it has been the goal of your administration to find enough things for the present population to do and to better provide for the present population those who plead for the lives of the unborn should consider the lives of the living mr rooseveltyou of all peopleyou should know that the unborn are not as wretched or as in need of our assistance as the born please take pity on the born olive worthington tossed and turned oh take pity on my son she prayed and prayed medium high in an apple tree in the orchard called frying pancrouched warily in the crotch between the trees largest branchesa red fox its ears and nose alert its tail poised as lightly as a feather surveyed the orchard with a predatory eye to the fox the ground below twitched with rodents although the fox had not climbed the tree for the viewit had run up the tree to eat a bird a feather of which was thrust through the foxs whiskers and into the rustcolored goatee on the fierce little animals pointed chin candy kendall clung to homer wellsoh how she clungas the breath left them both and stirred the otherwise unmoving air and the trembling mice beneath the floor of the cider house stopped in their tracks between the cider house walls to listen to the lovers the mice knew there was the owl to worry about and the fox but what animal was this whose sound was petrifying them the owl does not hoot when it hunts and the fox does not bark when it pounces but what is this new animal wondered the cider house micewhat new beast has charged and disturbed the air and is it safe in wilbur larchs opinion love was certainly not safenot ever for his own advancing frailty since homer wells had departed st clouds he would have said love was to blame how tentative he had become concerning some things and how suddenly irritable concerning others nurse angela might have suggested to him that his more recent bouts of gloom and anger were as much the result of his fiftyyearold addiction to ether and of his advanced age as they were the result of his anxious love for homer wells mrs grogan had she been asked would have told him that he suffered more from what she called st clouds syndrome than from love nurse edna would never have held love to blame for anything but wilbur larch viewed love as a disease even more insidious than the polio that president roosevelt had stood up to so courageously and could anyone blame larch if he occasionally referred to the socalled products of conception as the results of lovealthough his dear nurses were upset with him when he spoke like this did he not have a right to judge love harshly after all there was much evidencein both the products of conception and their attendant pain and in the injured lives of many of dr larchs orphansto justify his view that there was no more safety to be found in love than there was to be found in a virus had he felt the force of the collision between candy kendall and homer wellshad he tasted their sweat and touched the tension in the muscles of their shining backs had he heard the agony and the release from agony that could be detected in their voiceswilbur larch would not have changed his mind a passing glimpse of such passion would have confirmed his opinion of the danger of love he would have been as petrified as the mice in dr larchs opinion even when he could prevail on his patients to practise some method of birth control love was never safe consider the socalled rhythm method wrote wilbur larch here in st clouds we see many results of the rhythm method he had a pamphlet printed in the plainest block letters common misuses of the prophylactic he wrote as if he were writing for children in some cases he was some men put the prophylactic on just the tip of the penis this is a mistake because the prophylactic will come off it must be put over the whole penis and it must be put on when the penis is erect some men try to use the prophylactic a second time this is also a mistake once you remove a prophylactic throw it away and wash your genital area thoroughly before allowing yourself further contact with your partnersperm are living things at least for a short time and they can swim some men take the prophylactic out of its wrapper they expose the rubber to light and air for too long a time before using it consequently the rubber dries out and it develops cracks and holes this is a mistake sperm are very tinythey can swim through cracks and holes some men stay inside their partners for a long time after they have ejaculated what a mistake this is the penis shrinks when the penis is no longer erect and when the man finally pulls his penis out of his partner the prophylactic can slide completely off most men cani even feel this happening but what a mess inside the woman you have just deposited a whole prophylactic and all those sperm and some men homer wells could have added thinking of herb fowlerdistribute prophylactics with holes in them to their fellow man in the cider house at ocean view huddled with the huddled mice homer wells and candy kendall could not move from their embrace for one thing the mattress was so narrowit was only possible to share that mattress if they remained joined togetherand for another they had waited so long they had anticipated so much and to both of them so much was meant by having allowed themselves to come together they shared both a love and a grief for neither of them would have permitted each other this moment if there were not at least parts of each of them that had accepted wallys death and after lovemaking those parts of them that felt wallys loss were forced to acknowledge the moment with reverence and with solemnity therefore their expressions were not so full of rapture and not so void of worry as the expressions of most lovers after lovemaking homer wells with his face pressed into candys hair lay dreaming that he was only now arriving at the white cadillacs original destination he felt as if wally were still driving him and candy away from st cloudsas if wally were still in charge surely wally was a true benefactor to have driven him safely to this resting place the pulse in candys temple which lightly touched his own pulse was as soothing to homer as the tire hum when the great white cadillac had rescued him from the prison into which he was born there was a tear on homers face he would have thanked wally if he could and if in the darkness he could have seen candys face he would have known that a part of her was still over burma they lay still for so longthe first mouse bold enough to run across their bare legs surprised them homer wells jerked up to a kneeling position a moment passed before he realized that he had left a whole prophylactic and allthose sperm inside candy it was number on wilbur larchs list of the common misuses of the prophylactic ohoh said homer wells whose fingers were quick and sensitive and trained he needed only the index and middle fingers of his right hand to retrieve the lost rubber although he was very fast he doubted hed been fast enough despite the careful detail of homers instructions to candy she cut him off i think i know how to douche myself homer she said and so their first night of passion which had been so slowly building between them ended in the haste typical of the measures taken to avoid an unwanted pregnancy the possible cause of which was fairly typical too i love you homer repeated kissing her good night there were both fervor and anger in candys goodnight kiss both ferocity and resignation in the way she clutched his hands homer stood for a while in the parking lot behind the lobster pound the only sound was the aeration device that circulated fresh oxygen through the water tank that kept the lobsters alive the quality of the air in the parking lot was divided between brine and motor oil the nights heat was gone a cool damp fog rolled in from the sea there was no more heat lightning to illuminate however slightly the view across the atlantic it seemed to homer wells that there had been so much waiting and seeing to his life and now there was something else to wait and see about wilbur larch who was seventysomething and the grand master of maine in the field of waiting and seeing gazed once again upon the starry ceiling of the dispensary one of ethers pleasures was its occasional transportation of the inhaler to a position that afforded him a birds eye view of himself wilbur larch was thus permitted to smile from afar upon a vision of himself it was the night that he blessed the adoption of young copperfield the lisper let us be happy for young copperfield dr larch had said young copperfield has found a family good night copperfield only this time in ethers memory it was a joyous occasion there was even unison in the responses as if larch conducted a choir of angelsall singing copperfield merrily on his way it hadnt been like that copperfield had been especially popular with the littlest orphans he was what nurse angela called a binderin his goodnatured lisping presence the spirits of the other orphans rose and held together that night no one had joined larch in wishing copperfield good night and goodbye but copperfields departure had been especially hard for dr larch because with copperfields passing there went from st clouds not only the last orphan to be named by homer wells but also the last orphan to have known homer with copperfields leaving a little more of homer wells left too little steerforthsecondborn and secondnamedhad been adopted first but good for ether how it allowed dr larch to revise his history perhaps it had been the ether all along that had provided dr larch with the impulse to be a revisionist with fuzzy stone and in larchs ether dreams he had many times rescued wally worthingtonthe exploding plane had reassembled itself and returned to the sky the parachute had opened and the gentle currents of the burmese air had borne wally all the way to china safely above the japanese above the tigers and the snakes and above the dread diseases of asiahow peacefully wilbur larch had seen wally fly and how the chinese had been impressed with w allys noble good lookswith those patrician bones in that handsome face in time the chinese would help wally to find his base and he would come home to his girlfriendthis was what wilbur larch wanted most he wanted wally back with candy for only then would there be any hope of homer wells returning to st clouds nearly three months after wallys plane was shot down the harvest at ocean view began and candy kendall knew she was pregnant after all she was familiar with the symptoms so was homer wells a ragtag crew of pickers mauled the orchards that year there were housewives and war brides falling out of trees and students dismissed from the local schools so that they might contribute to the harvest even the apple harvest in was considered a part of the war effort olive made homer a crew boss of the high school kids whose methods of bruising the fruit were so various that homer was kept very busy candy worked in the mart she told olive that her frequent bouts of nausea were probably caused by the smell of diesel fuel and exhaust that was constant around the farm vehicles olive remarked that she thought the daughter of a mechanic and lobsterman would be less sensitive to strong odors and when she suggested that candy might be more comfortable working in the fields candy admitted that climbing trees also made her feel queasy i never knew you were so delicate olive said olive had never been more active in a harvest or more grateful for there being one but the harvest that year reminded homer wells of learning to tread water both candy and olive had taught him how swimming in place olive had called it im just swimming in place homer told candy we cant leave olive during the harvest if i work as hard as i can candy told him its possible that ill miscarry it was not very possible homer wells knew what if i dont want you to miscarry homer asked her what if candy asked what if i want you to marry me and to have the baby homer asked they stood at one end of the conveyor belt in the packinghouse candy was at the head of the line of women who sized and sorted the appleswho either packaged them or banished them to cider candy was retching even though she had chosen the head of the line because that put her nearest the open door we have to wait and see candy said between retches we dont have long to wait said homer wells we dont have long to see i shouldnt marry you for a year or more candy said i really want to marry you but what about olive we have to wait the baby wont wait homer said we both know where to goto not have the baby candy said or to have itsaid homer wells its my baby too how do i have a baby without anyone knowing ive had it candy asked she retched again and big dot taft came up the packing line to see what was the matter homer aint you got no better manners than to watch a young lady puke big dot asked him she put her huge arm around candys shoulder you get away from the door darlin big dot taft said to candy you come on and work down the linetheres only apples to smell down there the tractor exhaust comes in the door ill see you soon homer mumbled to both candy and big dot no one likes to be sick around the opposite sex homer big dot informed him right said homer wells orphan and wouldbe father in maine it is considered wiser just to know something than to talk about it that no one said candy kendall was pregnant didnt necessarily mean that they didnt know she was in maine it is a given that any boy can get any girl in trouble what they do about it is their business if they want advice they should ask if you were an orphan what would you have wilbur larch once wrote in a brief history oj stclouds an orphan or an abortion an abortion definitely melony had said once when homer wells had asked her how about you id have the orphan homer had said youre just a dreamer sunshine melony had told him now he supposed it was true he was just a dreamer he confused the high school kids with each other and gave some of them credit for picking bushels that other kids had picked he stopped two of the boys from throwing apples at each other and felt that he had to make an example of themin order to protect the fruit and establish his authority but while he was driving the boys back to the apple mart where he forced them to wait without getting in anytroubleand to miss a mornings pickinga fullscale apple fight broke out among the other high school kids and when homer returned to the field he interrupted a war the crates that were already loaded on the flatbed were splattered with apple seeds and the hot parts of the tractor gave off a burnedapple stench someone must have tried to use the tractor for cover perhaps vernon lynch would have made a better foreman for the high school kids homer thought all homer wanted to do was to make things right with candy when they sat on ray kendalls dock now they sat close together and they didnt sit for long it was getting cold they sat huddled against one of the posts at the docks end where ray had seen candy sit with wallyso many timesand in somewhat the same position although ray noted wally had always sat up straighter as if he were already fastened to the pilots seat ray kendall understood why it was necessary for them to brood about the process of falling in love but he felt sorry for them he knew that falling in love was never meant to be such a morose moment yet ray had every respect for olive and it was for olive he knew that homer and candy were forced to be mourners at their own love story you should just go away ray said out the window to homer and candy he spoke very softly and the window was closed homer was afraid that if he insisted to candy that she marry himinsisted that she have their babythat he would force her to reject him completely he also knew that candy was afraid of olive it was not that candy was so eager to have a second abortionhomer knew that candy would marry him and have their baby on the same day if she thought she could avoid telling olive the truth candy was not ashamed that olive would judge her harshly for her insufficient feelings for wally candys faith in wally being alive had not been as strong as olives it is not unusual for the mother of an only son and the young woman who is the sons lover to envision themselves as competitors more shocking to homers mind was what he could gather of his own feelings he already knew that he loved candy and wanted her now he discovered thatmore than wanting herhe wanted her child they were just another trapped couple more comfortable with their illusions than they were with the reality of their situation after the harvest homer said to candy well go to saint clouds ill say that they need me there its probably true anyway and because of the war no one else is paying attention to them you could tell your dad its just another kind of war effort we could both tell olive that we feel an obligationto be where were really needed to be of more use you want me to have the baby candy asked him i want you to have our baby said homer wells and after the babys born and youre both recovered well come back here well tell your dad and oliveor well write themthat weve fallen in love and that weve gotten married and that we conceived a child before we did any of that candy asked homer wells who saw the real stars above the blackened coast of mainebright and coldenvisioned the whole story very clearly well say the baby is adopted he said well say we felt a further obligationto the orphanage i do feel that in a way anyway he added our baby is adopted candy asked so we have a baby who thinks its an orphan no homer said we have our own baby and it knows its all ours we just say its adoptedjust for olives sake and just for a while thats lying candy said right said homer wells thats lying for a while maybewhen we came back with the babymaybe we wouldnt have to say it was adopted maybe we could tell the truth then candy said maybe homer said maybe everything is waiting and seeing he thought he put his mouth on the back of her neck he nuzzled into her hair if we thought that olive could accept it if we thought that she could acceptabout wally candy added then we wouldnt have to lie about the baby being adopted would we right said homer wells what is all this worrying about lying he wondered holding candy tightly as she softly cried was it true that wilbur larch had no memory of homers mother was it true that nurse angela and nurse edna had no memory of his mother either maybe it was true but homer wells would never have blamed them if they had lied they would have lied only to protect him and if theyd remembered his mother and his mother was a monster wasnt it better that theyd lied to orphans not every truth is wanted and if homer had discovered that wally had died in terrible pain or with prolonged sufferingif wally had been tortured or had burned to death or had been eaten by an animalhomer certainly would have lied about that if homer wells had been an amateur historian he would have been as much of a revisionist as wilbur larchhe would have tried to make everything come out all right in the end homer wells who always said to wilbur larch that he larch was the doctor was more of a doctor than he knew the first night of cider making he shared the work of the press and grinder with meany hyde and everett taft big dot and her kid sister debra pettigrew were the bottlers debra was sullen at the prospect of messy work she complained about the slopping and the spilling and her irritation was further enhanced by the presence of homer wells to whom she had not been speaking debras understanding that candy and homer had become partners in a certain grief was markedly colored by her suspicion that candy and homer had become partners in a certain pleasure too at least debra had not reacted generously to homers suggestion that they just be friends homer was puzzled by debras hostility and assumed that his years in the orphanage had deprived him of some perfectly sensible explanation for her behavior it seemed to homer that debra had always denied him access to anything more than her friendship why was she now incensed that he asked no more of her than that meany hyde announced to homer and everett taft that this would be his first and last night press of the harvest because he wanted to stay home with florence now that her time is approachin meany said when mr rose pressed cider there was a very different feeling in the fermented air for one thing everything went more quickly the pressing was a kind of contest for another there was a tension that mr roses authority createdand the knowledge of those tired men asleep or trying to sleep in the next room lent to the working of the grinder and the press a sense of hurry and of perfection that one feels only on the edge of exhaustion debra pettigrews future heaviness grew more and more apparent the wetter she got there was a matching slope in the sisters shoulders and even a slackness in the backs of debras arms that would one day yield the massive jiggles that shivered through big dot in sisterly imitation they wiped the sweat from their eyes with their bicepsnot wanting to touch their faces with their cidersweet and sticky hands after midnight olive brought them cold beer and hot coffee when she had gone meany hyde said that missus worthington is a thoughtful womanhere she is not only bringin us somethin but givin us a choice and her with wally gone said everett taft its a wonder she even thought of us whatever is brought to me whatever is coming homer thought i will not move out of its way life was finally about to happen to himthe journey he proposed making back to st clouds was actually going to give him his freedom from st clouds he would have a baby if not a wife too he would need a job of course ill take the baby trees and plant them he was thinkingas if apple trees would satisfy st clouds as if his planting them would satisfy what wilbur larch wanted from him by the end of the harvest the light grew grayer and the orchards were darker in the daytime although more light passed through the empty trees the picking crews inexperience was visible in the shriveled apples still clinging to the hardtoreach limbs the ground was already frozen in st clouds homer would have to make a special trip for the baby trees he would plant them in the spring it would be a spring baby homer and candy worked only the night shifts at cape kenneth hospital now the days when ray was building the torpedoes were the days homer could spend with candy in her room above the lobster pound there was a freedom about their lovemaking now that candy was already pregnant although she could not tell himnot yetcandy loved making love to homer wells she enjoyed herself much more than she had been able to with wally but she could not bring herself to say aloud that anything was better than withwally although making love was better with homer she doubted that this was wallys fault she arid wally had never had the time to feel so free the girl and i are coming homer wrote to dr larch shes going to have my babyneither an abortion nor an orphan a wanted baby nurse angela said were going to have a wanted baby if not a planned one said wilbur larch who stared out the window of nurse angelas office as if the hill that rose outside the window had personally risen against him and i suppose hes going to plant the damn trees said dr larch what does he want a baby for how can he have a baby and go to collegeor to medical school when was he ever going to go to medical school wilbur nurse edna asked i knew hed be back nurse angela shouted he belongs with us yes he does said wilbur larch involuntarily and somewhat stiffly his back straightened his knees braced his arms reached out and the fingers of his hands partially openedas if he were preparing to receive a heavy package nurse edna shuddered to see him in such a pose which reminded her of the fetus from three mile falls that dead baby whose posture of such extreme supplication had been arranged by homer wells homer said to olive worthington i have to leave especially with christmas coming and all those memories but there is something and someone ive been neglecting its really all of them at saint cloudsnothing changes there they always need the same things and now that theres a war and everyone is making an effort for the war i think saint clouds is more forgotten than ever and doctor larch isnt getting any younger should be of more use than i am here with the harvest over i dont feel i have enough to do at saint clouds theres always too much to do youre a fine young man said olive worthington but homer hung his head he remembered what mr rochester said to jane eyre dread remorse when you are tempted to err miss eyre remorse is the poison of life it was an early november morning in the kitchen at ocean view olive had not done her hair or put her makeup on the gray in the light and in her face and in her hair made mrs worthington look older to homer she was using the string of her tea bag to wring the last of the tea from the bag and homer could not raise his eyes from the ropy knotted veins in the backs of her hands she had always smoked too much and in the morning she always coughed candy is coming with me said homer wells candy is a fine young woman olive said it is most unselfish of you bothwhen you could be enjoying yourselves to give comfort and companionship to unwanted children the string across the belly of the tea bag was so taut that homer thought it would slice through the bag olives voice was so formal that she might have been speaking at an awards ceremony describing the heroism that was worthy of prizes she was trying her hardest not to cough when the string tore the tea bag some of the wet leaves stuck to the yolk of her uneaten softboiled egg which was perched in a china egg cup that homer wells had once mistaken for a candlestick holder i could never thank you enough for everything youve done for me homer said olive worthington just shook her head her shoulders were squared her chin up the straightness of her back was formidable im so sorry about wally said homer wells there was the slightest movement in olives throat but the muscles of her neck were rigid hes just missing olive said right said homer wells he put his hand on olives shoulder she gave no indication that the presence of his hand was either a burden or a comfort but after they remained like that for a while she turned her face enough to rest her cheek on top of his hand there they remained for a while longer as if posing for a painter of the old schoolor for a photographer who was waiting for the unlikely for the november sun to come out olive insisted that he take the white cadillac well ray said to candy and to homer i think its good for you both that you stick together ray was disappointed that neither homer nor candy acknowledged his observation with any enthusiasm as the cadillac was leaving the lobster pound parking lot ray called out to them and try havin some fun together somehow he doubted that they had heard him who goes to st clouds to have fun i have not really been adopted thought homer wells i am not really betraying mrs worthington she never said she was my mother even so homer and candy did not talk a lot on the drive on their journey inland the farther north they drove the more the leaves had abandoned the trees there was a little snow in skowhegan where the ground resembled an old mans face in need of a shave there was more snow in rlanchard and in east moxie and in moxie gore and they had to wait an hour in ten thousand acre tract where a tree was downacross the road the snow had drifted over the tree the smashed shape of which resembled a toppled dinosaur in moose river and in misery gore and in tomhegan too the snow had come to stay the drifts along the roadside were shorn so sharply by the plowand they stood so highthat candy and homer could detect the presence of a house only by chimney smoke or by the narrow paths chopped through the drifts that were here and there stained by the territorial pissing of dogs olive and ray and meany hyde had given them extra gas coupons they had decided to take the car because they thought that it would be nice to have a means to get away from st cloudsif only for short drivesbut by the time they reached black rapids and homer had put the chains on the rear tires they realized that the winter roads and this was only the beginning of the winter would make most driving impossible if they had asked him dr larch would have saved them the trouble of bringing the car he would have said that no one comes to st clouds for the purpose of taking little trips away from it he would have suggested for fun that they could always take the train to three mile falls with the bad roads and the failing light and the snow that began to fall after ellenville it was already dark when they reached st clouds the headlights of the white cadillac climbing the hill past the girls division illuminated two women walking down the hill toward the railroad stationtheir faces turning away from the light their footing looked unsure one of them didnt have a scarf the other one didnt have a hat the snow winked in the headlights as if the women were throwing diamonds in the air homer wells stopped the car and rolled down the window may i give you a ride he asked the women youre goin the wrong way one of them said i could turn around he called to them when they walked on without answering him he drove ahead to the hospital entrance of the boys division and turned out the headlights the snow falling in front of the light in the dispensary was the same kind of snow that had been falling the night that he arrived in st clouds after his escape from the drapers in waterville there had been something of a brouhaha between larch and his nurses about where homer and candy would sleep larch assumed that candy would sleep in the girls division and that homer would sleep where he used to sleep with the other boys but the women reacted strongly to this suggestion theyre lovers nurse edna pointed out surely they sleep together well surely they have larch said that doesnt mean that they have to sleep together here homer said he was going to marry her nurse edna pointed out going to grumbled wilbur larch i think it would be nice to have someone sleeping with someone else here nurse angela said it seems to me said wilbur larch that were in business because theres entirely too much sleeping together theyre lovers nurse edna repeated indignantly and so the women decided it candy and homer would share a room with two beds on the ground floor of the girls division how they arranged the beds was their own business mrs grogan said that she liked the idea of having a man in the girls division occasionally the girls complained of a prowler or a peeping torn having a man around at night was a good idea besides mrs grogan said im all alone over thereyou three have each other we all sleep alone over here dr larch said well wilbur nurse edna said dont be so proud of it olive worthington alone in wallys room regarded the two beds homers and wallysboth beds were freshly made up both pillows were without a crease on the night table between their beds was a photograph of candy teaching homer how to swim because there was no ashtray in the boys room olive held her free hand in a cupped position under the long dangling ash of her cigarette raymond kendall alone above the lobster pound viewed the triptych of photographs that stood like an altarpiece on his night table next to his socket wrench set the middle photograph was of himself as a young man he was seated in an uncomfortablelooking chair his wife was in his lap she was pregnant with candy the chair was in apparent danger the lefthand photograph was candys graduation picture the righthand photograph was of candy with wallytheir tennis racquets pointed at each other like guns ray had no picture of homer wells he needed only to look out the window at his dock in order to imagine homer clearly ray could not look at his dock and think of homer wells without hearing the snails rain upon the water nurse edna had tried to keep a little supper warm for homer and candy she had put the disappointing pot roast in the instrument sterilizer which she checked from time to time mrs grogan who was praying in the girls division did not see the cadillac come up the hill nurse angela was in the delivery room shaving a woman who had already broken her bag of waters homer and candy passed by the empty and brightly lit dispensary they peeked into nurse angelas empty office homer knew better than to peek into the delivery room when the light was on from the dormitory they could hear dr larchs reading voice although candy held tightly to his hand homer wells was inclined to hurryin order not to miss the bedtime story meany hydes wife florence was delivered of a healthy baby boynine pounds two ouncesshortly after thanksgiving which olive worthington and raymond kendall celebrated in a fairly formal and quiet fashion at ocean view olive invited all her apple workers for an open house she asked ray to help her host the occasion meany hyde insisted to olive that his new baby was a definite sign that wally was alive yes i know hes alive olive told meany calmly it was not too trying a day for her but she did find debra pettigrew sitting on homers bed in wallys room staring at the photograph of candy teaching homer how to swim and not long after ushering debra from the room olive discovered grace lynch sitting in the same dent debra had made on homers bed grace however was staring at the questionnaire from the board of trustees at st clouds the one that homer had never filled out and had left tacked to the wall of wallys room as if they were unwritten rules and big dot taft broke down in the kitchen while telling olive about one of her dreams everett had found her in her sleep dragging herself across the bedroom floor toward the bathroom i didnt have noi legs big dot told olive it was the night florences boy was born and i woke up without no legsonly i didnt really wake up i was just dreamin that there was nothin left of me below the waist except that you had to go to the bathroom everett taft pointed out otherwise why was you crawlin on the floor the important thing was that i was injured big dot told her husband crossly oh said everett taft the point is meany hyde said to olive my baby was born just fine but big dot had a dream that she couldnt walk dontcha see olive meany asked i think god is tellin us that wally is okaythat hes alivebut that hes been hurt hes injured or somethin big dot said bursting into tears of course olive said abruptly its what ive always thought her words startled them alleven ray kendall if he werent injured we would have heard from him by now and if he werent alive id know it olive said she handed her handkerchief to big dot taft and lit a fresh cigarette from the butt end of the cigarette she had almost finished thanksgiving at st clouds was not nearly so mys tical and the food wasnt as good but everyone had a good time in lieu of balloons dr larch distributed prophylactics to nurse angela and nurse edna who despite their distaste for the jobinflated the rubbers and dipped them in bowls of green and red food coloring when the coloring dried mrs grogan painted the orphans names on the rubbers and homer and candy hid the brightly colored prophylactics all over the orphanage its a rubber hunt said wilbur larch we should have saved the idea for easter eggs are expensive well not give up eggs for easter wilbur nurse edna said indignantly i suppose not dr larch said tiredly olive worthington had sent a case of champagne wilbur larch had never drunk a drop of champagne beforehe was not a drinkerbut the way the bubbles tightened the roof of his mouth opened his nasal passages and made his eyes feel dry but clear reminded him of that lightest of vapors of that famous inhalation he was addicted to he drank and drank he even sang for the childrensomething hed heard the french soldiers sing in world war i that song was no more suitable for children than those prophylactics were butbecause of an ignorance of french and an innocence of sexthe french song which was filthier than any limerick wally worthington would ever know was mistaken for a pleasing ditty and the green and red rubbers were mistaken for balloons even nurse edna got a little drunk champagne was new to her too although she sometimes put sherry in hot soup nurse angela didnt drink but she became emotional to the degree that she threw her arms around homers neck and kissed him mightily all the while proclaiming that the spirit of st clouds had been in a noticeable slump during homers absence and that homer had been sent by a clearly sympathetic god to revive them but homers not staying wilbur larch said hiccuping they had all been impressed with candy whom even dr larch referred to as our angelic volunteer and over whom mrs grogan daily fussed as if candy were her daughter nurse edna busied herself around the young lovers the way a moth flaps around a light on thanksgiving day dr larch even flirted with candya little i never saw such a pretty girl who was willing to give enemas larch said patting candys knee im not squeamish candy told him theres no room for squeamishness here larch said burping theres still a little room for sensitivity i hope nurse angela complained larch had never praised her or nurse edna for their willingness to give enemas of course i wanted him to go to medical school to be a doctor to come back and relieve me here wilbur larch told candy in a loud voiceas if homer werent sitting right across the table larch patted candys knee again but thats all right he said who wouldnt rather get a girl like you pregnantand grow apples he said something in french and drank another glass of champagne of course he whispered to candy he doesnt need to go to medical school to be a doctor here theres just a few more procedures he ought to be familiar with hell larch said indicating the orphans eating their turkeyeach with a colored rubber like a name tag stationed in front of his or her plate this isnt a bad place to raise a family and if ktomer ever gets around to planting the damn hillside then youll get to grow apples here too when dr larch fell asleep at the table homer wells carried him back to the dispensary in his time away from st clouds homer wondered had dr larch gone completely crazy there was no one to ask mrs grogan nurse edna and especially nurse angela might agree that larch had traveled around the bendthat he had one oar out of the water as ray kendall would say that he had one wheel in the sand as wally used to saybut mrs grogan and the nurses would most emphatically defend dr larch their view homer could tell was that homer had left them for too long that his judgment was rusty fortunately homers obstetrical procedure had not suffered from his absence pregnant women have no respect for holidays the trains run at different times but they run it was after six in the evening when the woman arrived in st clouds although it was not his usual practice the stationmaster escorted her to the hospital entrance because the woman was already engaged in the second stage of laborher membranes were ruptured and her bearingdown pains were at regular intervals homer wells was palpating the babys head through the perineum when nurse angela informed him that dr larch was too drunk to be aroused and nurse edna had also fallen asleep homer was concerned that the perineum showed signs of bulging and the womans response to a rather heavy ether sedation was quite slow homer was obliged to hold back the infants head in order to protect the perineum from tearing the mediolateral incision which homer elected to perform was made at a point corresponding to seven on the face of a clock it was a safer episiotomy in homers view because the cut could if necessary be carried back considerably farther than the midline type of operation immediately after the birth of the head homer slipped his finger around the neck of the child to see if the umbilical cord was coiled there but it was an easy birth both shoulders emerging spontaneously he applied two ligatures to the umbilical and cut the cord between the two he still had his surgical gown on when he went to the dispensary to see how dr larch was recovering from his thanksgiving day champagne if larch was familiar with the transitions he encountered in moving from a world of ether to a world without anesthesia he was unfamiliar with the transition between drunkenness and hangover seeing homer wells in the bloody smock of his business wilbur larch imagined he was saved ah doctor stone he said extending his hand to homer with a selfcongratulatory formality famous among colleagues in the medical profession doctor who said homer wells doctor stone said wilbur larch withdrawing his hand his hangover settling on hima dust so thick on the roof of his mouth that he could only repeat himself fuzzy stone fuzzy stone fuzzy stone homer candy asked when they lay together in one of the twin beds given them in their room in the girls division why would doctor larch say that you dont need to go to medical school to be a doctor here maybe he means that half the work here is illegal anyway said homer wells so whats the point of being a legitimate doctor but no one would hire you if you werent a legitimate doctor would they candy asked maybe doctor larch would said homer wells i know some things you dont want to be a doctor here anywaydo you candy asked thats right i dont want to he said what is all this about fuzzy stone he was wondering as he fell asleep homer was still asleep when dr larch bent over the thanksgiving woman and examined the episiotomy nurse angela was telling him about it stitch by stitch but although larch appreciated the description it wasnt really necessary the look and feel of the womans healthy tissue told him everything he wanted to know homer wells had not lost his confidence he still had the correct touch he also possessed the selfrighteousness of the young and wounded homer wells had no doubts to soften his contempt for people whod bungled their lives so badly that they didnt want the children theyd conceived wilbur larch would have told him that he was simply an arrogant young doctor whod never been sickthat he was guilty of a young doctors disease manifesting a sick superiority toward all patients but homer was wielding an ideal of marriage and family like a club he was more sure of the tightness of his goal than a couple celebrating their sixtyfifth wedding anniversary he must have imagined that the sacredness with which he viewed his union with candy would hover like a halo above the young couple and shed a conspicuously forgiving light upon them and their child when they returned to hearts haven and hearts rock he must have thought that the goodness of his and candys intentions would glow with such a powerful radiance that olive and ray and the rest of that allknowing saynothing community would be blinded homer and candy must have envisioned that their childconceived in a moment of love that overshadowed wallys being lost or dead or just missingwould be greeted as a descending angel and so they enjoyed the life of a young married couple that winter in st clouds never had being of use been such good fun there was no chore the lovely and growingly pregnant young woman thought herself to be above her beauty and her physical energy were inspiring to the girls in the girls division dr larch devoted himself to teaching homer more about pediatricssince he could find no fault with homers obstetrical procedure and since homer was emphatic about his refusal to participate in the abortions the rigidity of this latter position perplexed even candy who was fond of saying to homer just explain it to me againhow youre not disapproving of the procedure but that you will not yourself be party to what you feel is wrong right said homer wells he had no doubts youve got it theres nothing else to explain i think an abortion should be available to anyone who wants one but i never want to perform one whats hard to understand about that nothing candy said but she would keep asking him about it you think its wrong yet you think it should be legalright right said homer wells i think its wrong but also think it should be everyones personal choice what could be more personal than deciding whether you want a child or not i dont know candy said although it occurred to her that she and homer wells had decided that wally was deadwhich seemed especially personal to her in her fifth month they began sleeping in separate beds but they drew the beds together and attempted to make them up as if they were one big beda problem since there were no doublebed sheets at st clouds mrs grogan wanted to make a present of doublebed sheets to homer and candy but she had no money of her own to buy them and she wondered if purchasing them for the orphanage would seem strange very strange larch said vetoing the idea in other parts of the world they have doublebed sheets wrote wilbur larch in a brief history oj stclouds here in st clouds we do withoutwe just do without yet it was the best christmas ever in st clouds olive sent so many presents and candys exampleas the first happily pregnant woman in any of their memories was a present to them all they had a turkey and a ham and dr larch and homer wells had a carving contest which everyone said homer won he finished carving the turkey before larch finished carving the ham well turkeys are easier to cut than pigs larch said secretly he was very pleased with homers knife work that homer had learned his touch for cutting under circumstances different from mr roses was often on homers mind given certain advantages of education homer thought mr rose might have made an excellent surgeon might have made homer mumbled to himself he had never been happier he was of use he was in loveand was lovedand he was expecting a child what more is there he thought making the daily rounds other people may look for a break from routine but an orphan craves daily life in midwinter in a blizzard when the women were having tea in the girls division with mrs grogan and dr larch was at the railroad station personally accusing the stationmaster of losing an expected delivery of sulfa a woman arrived at the hospital entrance bent double with cramps and bleeding shed had the d without the c as nurse caroline would have observed whoever had managed the dilatation appeared to have managed it safely what was required now was a completion curettage which homer performed alone one very small piece of the products of conception was recognizable in the scraping which caused homer wells a single small thought about four months was what he estimatedlooking quickly at the piece and quickly throwing it away at night when he touched candy without waking her up he marveled at how peacefully she slept and he observed how life in st clouds seemed timeless placeless and constant how it seemed grim but caring how it seemed somehow safer than life in hearts rock or in hearts havencertainly safer than life over burma that was the night he got up and went to the boys division perhaps he was looking for his history in the big room where all the boys slept but what he found instead was dr larch kissing every boy a late good night homer imagined then that dr larch had kissed him like that when hed been small homer could not have imagined how those kisses even now were still kisses meant for him they were kisses seeking homer wells that was the same night that he saw the lynx on the barren unplanted hillsideglazed with snow that had thawed and then refrozen into a thick crust homer had stepped outside for just a minute after witnessing the kisses he desired the bracing air it was a canada lynxa dark gunmetal gray against the lighter gray of the moonlit snow its wildcat stench so strong homer gagged to srnell the thing its wildcat sense was keen enough to keep it treading within a single leaps distance of the safety of the woods the lynx was crossing the brow of the hill when it began to slide its claws couldnt grip the crust of the snow and the hill had suddenly grown steeper the cat moved from the dull moonlight into the sharper light from nurse angelas office window it could not help its sideways descent it traveled closer to the orphanage than it would ever have chosen to come its ferocious death smell clashing with the freezing cold the lynxs helplessness on the ice had rendered its expression both terrified and resigned both madness and fatalism were caught in the cats fierce yellow eyes and in its involuntary spitting cough as it slid on actually bumping against the hospital before its claws could find a purchase on the crusted snow it spit its rage at homer wells as if homer had caused its unwilling descent its breath had frozen on its chin whiskers and its tufted ears were beaded with ice the panicked animal tried to dash up the hill it was less than halfway up when it began to slide down again drawn toward the orphanage against its will when it set out from the bottom of the hill a second time the lynx was panting it ran diagonally uphill slipping but catching itself and slipping again finally escaping into the softer snow in the woods nowhere near where it had meant to go yet the lynx would accept any route of escape from the dark hospital homer wells staring into the woods after the departed lynx did not imagine that he would ever leave st clouds more easily there was a false spring very early that march all over maine the river ice buckled under the wet snow the ponds split apart with gunshots sharp enough to put birds to wing and the bigger inland lakes groaned and sang and cracked like boxcars colliding in the station yards in the apartment she shared with lorna in bath melony was awakened by the kennebecits ice bending under a foot of slush and giving way with a deep gonging alarm that caused one of the older women in the boardinghouse to sit up in her bed and howl melony was reminded of the nights in her bed in the girls division in st clouds when the march ice was grinding downriver from three mile falls she got out of bed and went into lornas room to talk but lorna was so sleepy that she wouldnt get up melony got in bed beside her friend its just the ice lorna whispered that was how she and melony became lovers listening to the false spring theres just one thing lorna said to melony if were gonna be together you gotta stop lookin for this homer character either you want me or you want him i want you melony told lorna just dont ever leave me a permanent couple an orphans ideal but melony wondered where her rage would go if she stopped looking for homer wells would she stop thinking about him too there was too much snow the brief thaw never penetrated the frozen ground and when the temperature dropped and it snowed again the rivers hardened up fast an old mill pond behind the orphanage in st clouds became a trap for geese confused by the thaw the geese landed on the slush that they mistook for open water the slush refroze at night and the geeses paddle feet were caught in it when homer wells found the geese they were frozen statues of their former selves dusted with the new snow they were stony guardians of the pond there was nothing to do but chip them out of the ice and scald them they were easier to pluck because they were partially frozen when mrs grogan roasted thempricking them constantly to bleed their fatshe retained the sense that she was only warming them up before sending them on their dangerous way it was already april by the time the ice broke free in three mile falls and the river overran its banks in st clouds water filled the basement of the former whore hotel and exerted such a force against the underbeams that the saloon bar with its brass footrail fell through the floor and floated out and away through a bulkhead the stationm aster saw it go as obsessed with omens as he was he slept two nights in a row in his office for fear that the station house was in danger candy was so huge she hardly slept at all the morning that the hill was bare homer wells tested the ground he could work a spade almost a foot down before he hit frozen earthhe needed another six inches of thawing before he could plant apple trees but he dared not wait any longer before making the trip to hearts rock to get the trees he didnt want to be away when candy delivered olive was surprised to see him and by his request to trade the cadillac for one of the pickup trucks to transport the baby trees i want to plant a standard fortybyforty homer told olive half macs about ten percent red delicious another ten or fifteen percent cortlands and baldwins olive reminded him to throw in a few northern spies and some gravensteinsfor apple pie she asked him how candy was and why she hadnt come with him he told her candy was too busy everyone liked her and the kids just hung on her it would be hard to leave when the time came homer confided to olive they were of so much usethey were so needed and the con stancy of the demandswell even a day off like this is hard to squeeze in homer said you mean you wont spend the night olive asked too busy homer said but well both be back in time to put out the bees thatll be about mothers day olive observed right said homer wells he kissed olive whose skin was cool and smelled like ash meany hyde and herb fowler helped him load the pickup you gonna plant a whole fortybyforty by yourself meany asked him you better hope the ground unfreezes you better hope your back holds out herb fowler said you better hope your pecker dont fall off hows candy big dot taft asked homer almost as big as you are homer thought just fine he said but busy ill bet said debra pettigrew in the furnace room under the lobster tank ray kendall was building his own torpedo what for homer asked just to see if i can do it ray said but what will you fire it at homer asked and what will you fire it from the hard part is the gyroscope ray said it aint hard to fire itwhats hard is guidin it i dont understand said homer wells well look at you ray said youre plantin an apple orchard at an orphanage you been there five months but my daughters too busy to visit me for a day i dont understand everythin either well be back about blossom time homer said guiltily thats a nice time of year said ray on the drive back to st clouds homer wondered if rays coolness or evasiveness was intentional he decided that rays message was clear if you keep things from me i wont explain myself to you a torpedo candy said to homer when he arrived with the baby trees what for wait and see said homer wells dr larch helped him unload the trees theyre kind of scrawny arent they larch asked they wont give much fruit for eight or ten years homer said then i doubt ill get to eat any of it said wilbur larch well homer said even before there are apples on the trees think how the trees will look on the hill theyll look scrawny said wilbur larch near the top of the hill the ground was still frozen homer couldnt work his spade down far enough and at the bottom the holes he dug filled with waterthe runoff from the snow that was still melting in the woods because he would have to wait to plant the trees he worried about the roots mildewing or getting savaged by micebut mainly he was peeved that he could not control exactly the calendar of his life hed wanted to plant the trees before candy delivered he wanted the hillside entirely planted when the baby was born what did i do to you to make you so compulsively neat asked wilbur larch surgery is neat said homer wells it was the middle of april before homer could dig the holes and plant the fortybyforty orchardwhich he did in three days his back so stiff at night that he slept as restlessly and uncomfortably as candy tossing and turning with her it was the first warm night of the spring they were much too hot under the winterweight blanket when candy broke water they both for a second confused the puddle with their sweat homer helped her to the hospital entrance of the boys division nurse edna prepared candy while homer went to talk to dr larch who was waiting in nurse angelas office i deliver this one larch said there are certain advantages to detachment fathers are a bother in the delivery room if you want to be there just mind your own business rightsaid homer wells he was fidgeting uncharacteristically and dr larch smiled at him nurse edna was with candy while nurse angela scrubbed for dr larch homer had already put his mask on when he heard a commotion from the boys sleeping room he left the mask on when he went to investigate one of the john larches or the wilbur walshes had got up and gone outside to pee against a trash barrelwith considerable noise this in turn had disturbed a large raccoon busy at the trash and the coon had startled the peeing orphan into wetting his pajamas homer tried to sort this out calmly he wanted to get back to the delivery room teeing indoors is better at night he observed to the room at large candys having her baby now whats she havin one of the boys asked either a boy or a girl said homer wells what will you name it another one asked nurse angela named me homer said me tooseveral of them said if its a girl im naming her angela said homer wells and if its a boy if its a boy ill name him angel homer said thats really just angela without the last a angel someone asked right said homer wells and kissed them all good night as he was leaving someone asked him and will you leave it here no mumbled homer wells having pulled his mask backup whatthe orphans shouted no homer said more clearly pulling down the mask it was hot in the delivery room the warm weather had been unexpected because no one had put the screens on larch refused to open any windows at the knowledge that the child one way or another would be named after her nurse angela wept so hard that larch insisted that she change her mask nurse edna was too short to reach the sweat on larchs forehead she missed some of it as the babys head emerged a drop of larchs sweat baptized the child squarely on its templeliterally before it was entirely bornand homer wells could not help thinking that this was not unlike david copperfield being born with a caul when the shoulders did not follow quickly enough to please larch he took the chin and occupit in both hands and drew the infant downward until in a single easy upward motion he delivered the posterior shoulder first homer wells biting his lip nodded his approval as the anterior shoulderand the rest of the child followed its an angel nurse edna announced to candy who was still smiling an ether smile nurse angela who had soaked through another mask had to turn away only after the placenta was born did dr larch say as he sometimes did perfect then as he never before had done he kissed candyalbeit through his mask squarely between her wideopen outofether eyes the next day it snowed and snowedan angry april snowstorm desperate not to relinquish the winter and homer looked at his newly planted apple orchard with concern the frail snowcovered trees reminded him of the luckless geese whod made an illtimed landing in the mill pond stop worrying about the trees said wilbur larch theyre on their own now so was angel wellseight pounds seven ounces and neither an orphan nor an abortion one week short of may there was still too much snow in st clouds for it to be mud season yet homer wells had shaken the individual branches of each of his apple trees and mouse tracks around one particularly vulnerablelooking winter banana had caused him to scatter poison oats and poison corn every tree had a metal sleeve around its slender trunk deer had already nibbled the row of macs planted nearest the woods homer put out a salt lick for the deer deeper into the woods in hopes that the salt would keep them there candy was nursing angel whose crusty remnant of an umbilical had fallen off cleanly and whose circumcision had healed homer had circumcised his son you need the practice dr larch had told him you want me to practise on my son homer had asked may it be the only pain you ever cause him wilbur larch had replied there was still ice on the inside of the windowpanes in the morning homer would hold his finger to the pane until his finger was bright red wet and cold and then hed touch candy with the fingerwhich woke her up when she was slow to respond to his gentler touching of her stubble homer and candy loved how they fit together in the bed again and how angel could fit between them when candy was nursing him and how candys milk would sometimes wake them both up before angels crying would they agreed they had never been happier so what if the sky when it was almost may was still the slate color of february and still streaked with sleet so what if the secret they kept in st clouds could not be kept foreverand was already a secret that half of hearts haven and hearts rock had the sense to figure out for themselves people from maine dont crowd you they let you come to your senses in your own good time every two days there was a ritual weighing of angel wells which was always conducted in the dispensarynurse angela keeping the record dr larch and homer taking turns at poking angels belly looking into angels eyes and feeling angels grip admit it nurse edna said to candy and homer at one such weighingin ceremony you like it here that day in st clouds it was thirtythree degrees the wet snow with which the morning had begun had turned to freezing rain that day in hearts rock olive worthington had her own secret perhaps if homer and candy had been more forthcoming to her olive would have shared her secret with them she would have grabbed the phone and called them but people from maine dont like the telephone a rude invention especially in the case of important news a telephone catches you too offguard a telegram provides you with a decent respectful interval in which to gather your senses and respond olive sent them her secret in a telegram that gave everyone a little more time candy would see the telegram first she was nursing angel in the girls division to quite an appreciative audience of girl orphans when mrs grogan brought her the telegram which one of the lackeys who slaved for the stationm aster had finally gotten around to delivering the telegram was an obvious shock to candy who quite abruptly handed angel to mrs grogan although angel did not appear to be through nursing it astonished mrs grogan that candy did not even pause to properly replace her brashe just buttoned her blouse over herself and in spite of the weather ran outdoors and across to the hospital entrance of the boys division at the time homer was asking dr larch if he larch thought that an xray of his homers heart might prove instructive to homer wilbur larch was thinking very carefully about his answer when candy burst upon them olive worthington was a yankee who knew the price of a telegram the cost of words yet her enthusiasm for her subject had clearly carried her away she went far beyond her usual shorthand self wally found alivestop recovering encephalitis ceylonstop liberated from rangoon burmastop temperature ninetytwo degreesstop weight one hundred five poundsstop paralyzedstop love olive a hundred and five pounds said homer wells alive candy whispered paralyzed nurse angela said encephalitis said wilbur larch how could his temperature be ninetytwo degrees wilbur nurse edna asked dr larch didnt know he wouldnt venture a guess it was another one of those detailsthe clarification of which would take quite a long time for captain worthington who had abandoned his plane over burma about ten months agothe clarification of many such details would take years it was raining so heavily when he jumped it seemed to wally that his parachute had to push against the rain to open yet the roar of the plane was so near wally was afraid hed pulled the cord too soon he was afraid of the bamboohed heard stories of fliers being impaled by itbut he missed the bamboo and landed in a teak tree a branch of which separated his shoulder his head may have hit the trunk or else the pain in his shoulder caused him to lose consciousness it was dark when he woke up and since he couldnt see how far below the ground was he didnt dare to free himself from the chute cords until morning then he gave himself too much morphine for his shoulderand lost the syringe in the dark in his haste to abandon the plane hed not had time to locate a machete in the morning he spent quite a while cutting through the chute cordsrusing only the bayonet in his ankle sheath and having the use of only one strong arm he was lowering himself to the ground when his dog tags caught on a vine and because of his bad shoulder he could neither support all his weight with one arm nor free the tags and so he lost them the chain cut his neck when the tags carne off and he landed on an old teakvood log that was hidden under the ferns and the dead palm fronds the log rolled and he sprained his ankle when he realized that in the monsoon weather he would never know east from west that was when he discovered that his compass was gone he rubbed some sulfa powder on his cut neck wally had no idea where china was he picked his way by moving through whatever was the least dense in this way after three days he had the impression that the jungle was either thinning out or that he was getting better at picking his way through it china was east of wally but wally went south china was upover the mountains but wally sought the valleys where wally was the valleys ran southwesterly he was right about one thing the jungle was thinning out it was also getting warmer every night he climbed a tree and slept in its crotch the large twisted trunks of the peepul treeas gnarled as giant wooden cablesmade the best crotches for sleeping but wajly wasnt the first creature to jfigure this out one night at eye level in the crotch of a peepul tree next to him a leopard was examining itself for ticks wally followed the leopards example and discovered several he gave up trying to remove the leeches one day he saw a pythona small one about fifteen feet it was lying on a rock swallowing something the approximate size and shape of a beagle wally guessed it was a monkey although he couldnt remember if he had seen any monkeys he had seen monkeys of course but hed forgotten them he had a fever he tried to take his temperature but the thermometer in his firstaid kit was broken the day he saw a tiger swim across a river was the day he began to notice the mosquitoes the climate was changing the river with the tiger in it had produced a broader valley the forest was changing too he caught a fish with his hands and ate its liver raw he cooked frogs as big as cats but their legs were fishier than the frog legs he remembered perhaps it was the lack of garlic he ate something that was the consistency of a mango and had no taste whatsoever the fruit left a musty aftertaste and for a whole day he vomited and had chills then the river where hed seen the tiger turned into a bigger river the monsoon water had a powerful current wally was encouraged to build a raft he remembered the rafts he had engineered for travel on drinkwater lake and he cried to think how much harder it was to build a raft with bamboo and vines than with pitch pine and ropesand stray boards and nails and how much heavier the green bamboo was too it didnt matter that the raft leaked it barely floated and if he needed to portage he knew he couldnt carry it he noticed more mosquitoes especially when the river broadened and the current slowed down and he just drifted he had no idea how many days he drifted or when he first knew for certain that he had a fever about the time he saw the rice paddies and the water buffaloes he would say later one day he would remember waving to the women in the rice paddies they looked so surprised to see him when wally saw the rice paddies he must have known hed gone the wrong way he had gone into the heart of burma which is shaped like a kite with a long tail he was much nearer to mandalay than he was to china and the japanese held mandalay but wally had a fever of one hundred four he just drifted sometimes he couldnt tell the river from the rice paddies it was strange how both the men and women wore long skirts but only the men covered their hair they wore what looked like baskets on their heads and the baskets were wrapped with strips of brightly colored silk the womens heads were bare but many of them put flowers in their hair both the men and the women braided their hair they seemed to be eating all the time but they were just chewing betel nuts their teeth were stained their lips made them appear as if theyd been drinking blood but that was just the betel juice the shelters they took wally to were all alikeonestory thatched houses on bamboo stilts the families ate outdoors on a porch they gave him rice and tea and lots of things with curry when his fever went down wally ate panthay khowse noodles and chicken and nga sak kin curried fish balls those were the first words that his burmese rescuers tried to teach him but wally misunderstood he thought nga sak kin was the name of the man who had carried him off the raft and held wallys head steady while the mans wife fed wally with her fingers she was wonderfully small and wore a sheer white blouse her husband touched the blouse and called it by name trying to teach wally more of his language aingyis the man said and wally thought that was the wifes name she smelled like the inside of the thatched housesshe smelled like chintz and lemon rind they were such a nice couple nga sak kin and aingyis wally repeated their names out loud and smiled they smiled back at him mr curried fish balls and his wife mrs blouse she smelled as stickysweet as frangipani she smelled as citrous as bergamot with the fever had come the stiffness in his neck and back but when the fever broke and he stopped vomiting when the headaches were over and the shaking chills were gone and he wasnt even nauseous anymore that was when he noticed the paralysis at that time it was a stiff paralysis in both his lower and upper extremities spasticity wilbur larch would have called it wallys arms and legs stuck straight out and he couldnt move them he was delirious for two or three weeks and when he tried to talk his speech was thick and slow he had trouble eating because of the tremors in his lips and tongue he couldnt empty his bladder and the natives had to catheterize him with a tiny rough bamboo shoot in order for him to urinate at all and they kept moving him they always moved him over water once he saw elephants they were dragging logs out of the forests the surface of the water was forever interrupted with turtles and black snakes and water hyacinths and betel juicea darker red than the blood that traced wallys urine nga sak kin wally asked aingyis he asked where had they gone although the faces of his rescuers kept changing they seemed to understand him must come from a big family wally thought im paralyzed arent i he asked the small pretty men and women who always smiled one of the women washed and combed his hair her whole family watched wallys hair drying in the sunthe blond light leaping into it as it dried how that impressed them they gave him a long sheer white blouse to wear aingyis they said oh its a present from her he thought then they covered his blond hair with a dark wigit was a waxy pigtail and they piled it high on top of his head and studded it with flowers the children giggled they shaved his face so close his skin burned they shaved his legs below the knee where his legs protruded from the long skirt they made him wear the game was to make him a woman the game was to make him safe to make him blend in because his face was so pretty it was easier for them to make him a woman than a man the ideal burmese woman has no breasts it is a shame that they werent more careful when they catheterized himthey were so careful about everything else the bamboo shoot wasnt always clean the catheters roughness hurt him and made him bleed but it was the dirtiness that would give him the infection the infection would make him sterile the epididymis wilbur larch could have informed him is a single coiled tube in which the sperm mature after leaving the testicle epididymitis an infection of that little tube prevents sperm from reaching the sperm duct in wallys case the infection would permanently seal his tube they were correct to catheterize himit was only the how that was wrong he suffered urinary retention his bladder was distendedthey had no choice but to relieve him at times wally would wonder if there wasnt an easier wayor if the bamboo was cleanbut what could he say to them aingyis he would say nga sak kin he would ask them months later he would hear bombing irrawaddy they would explain they were bombing the oil fields along the irrawaddy wally knew where he was he used to bomb those fields too before he heard the bombing and as always disguised as a woman he was taken to a doctor in mandalay his eyes were smarting because theyd rubbed a curry paste on his face to make him look brown but up close with those blue eyes and that patrician nose he couldnt have fooled anyone he saw many japanese in mandalay the doctor had trouble explaining to wally what was wrong with him he said the following in english japanese b mosquito i was bitten by a japanese mosquito wally said but whats a b mosquito he wondered he no longer needed a catheter to pee but the infection had done its damage by the time he heard the bombing of the irrawaddy the paralysis had left his upper extremitieshe had the full use of his arms againand the spasticity had left his legs although his legs were still paralyzed it was a flaccid paralysis and not quite symmetrical his left leg was more dead than his right his bladder was okay and except for the effects of curry his bowels were okay too what he could detect of his sexual function felt normal there are no autonomic effects to encephalitis wilbur larch would explain to candy and to homer wells whats that mean candy asked it means that wally can have a normal sex life said homer wells who didnt know about wallys epididymis wally would have a normal sex life but he wouldnt have an adequate sperm count he would still have orgasm and ejaculationsince so much of the ejaculate is made in the prostate which is quite a way downstream he just could never make his own baby at the time none of them knew wally had been sterilized they knew only about the encephalitis wally caught it from the mosquitoes it was called japanese b encephalitis and it was quite common in asia during the war it is an arthropodborne virus wilbur larch explained residual flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities was not a common effect of the disease but it was well enough known to be documented there are numerous changes that occur in the tissue of the brain but the changes in the spinal cord look very much like polio the incubation period is about a week long and the acute disease process lasts only a week or ten days the recovery is very slow with muscular tremors lasting sometimes for months considering that it comes from birds its a big disease wilbur larch said to nurse edna and nurse angela the mosquito picks up the virus from birds and transmits it to men and other large animals wallys face was so pretty and hed lost so much weight that was why they disguised him as a woman the japanese were both attracted to and intimidated by the burmese womenespecially the padaung women with their high brass collars wound in spirals to stretch their necks that wally was a woman and an invalid made him an untouchable that they had made him look eurasian also made him an outcast when the monsoon season ended in october they either traveled on the river at nights or they protected him from the sun with an umbrellaand with more curry paste he got very tired of curried fish balls but he kept asking for themor so the burmese thought that was all they gave him and when he was delirious he said candys name one of the boatmen asked him about it candy the boatman inquired politely that day they were in a sampan wally lay under a roof of mats and watched the boatman sculling aingyis wally said he meant like hera good woman a wife the boatman nodded at the next port on the river wally didnt know where it might have been yandoon they gave him another sheer white blouse candy the boatman said wally thought he meant give it to candy he smiled he just kept drifting the sampans sharp nose seemed to smell the way it was a country of smells to wallyit was a fragrant dream wilbur larch could imagine wallys journey it was an ether journey of course elephants and oil fields rice paddies and bombs falling dressed up as a woman and paralyzed from the waist downlarch had been there he had been everywhere he had no trouble imagining rangoon and water buffaloes every ether dream has its equivalent of british underground agents smuggling american pilots across the bay of bengal wallys trip through burma was a voyage wilbur larch had often undertaken the blackcurrant odor of petunias was at war with the odor of dung all the way they flew wally across the bay of bengal in a small plane with a british pilot and a sinhalese crew wilbur larch had taken many such flights do you speak sinhala the englishman asked wally who sat in the copilot seat the pilot smelled of garlic and turmeric i dont even know what sinhala is wally said when he shut his eyes he could still see the white waxy flowers of the wild lime bushes he could still see the jungle principal language of ceylon my boy the pilot said the pilot also smelled like tea were going to ceylon wally asked cant keep a blond in burma lad the englishman said dont you know burmas full of nips but wally preferred to remember his native friends they had taught him to salaama low bow with the right hand on the forehead always the right hand theyd explained it was a bow of salutation and when he was sick someone had always stirred the punkah for hima punkah is a large screenshaped fan that is moved by a rope pulled by a servant punkah wally said to the english pilot whats that lad the pilot asked its so hot said wally who felt drowsy they were flying at a very low altitude and the little plane was an oven a brief scent of sandal wood came through the stronger garlic in the pilots sweat ninetytwo degrees american when we left rangoon the pilot said the pilot got a kick out of saying american instead of fahrenheit but wally didnt notice ninetytwo degrees wally said it felt like the first fact he could hang his hat on as they say in maine what happened to the legs the englishman asked casually japanese b mosquito wally explained the british pilot looked very grave he thought that wally meant a planethat the japanese b mosquito was the name of the fighter plane that shot wallys plane down i dont know that one lad the pilot admitted to wally thought id seen them all but you cant trust the nips the sinhalese crew had slathered themselves with coconut oil and were wearing sarongs and long collarless shirts two of them were eating something and one of them was screeching into the radio the pilot said something sharply to the radioman who instantly lowered his voice sinhala is an awful language the pilot confided to wally sounds like cats fucking when wally didnt respond to his humor the englishman asked him if hed ever been to ceylon when wally didnt answer himwally seemed to be daydreamingthe englishman said we not only planted the first rubber trees and developed their bloody rubber plantationswe taught them how to brew tea they knew how to grow it all right but you couldnt get a decent cup of tea on the whole bloody island and now they want to be independent the englishman said ninetytwo degrees wally said smiling yes just try to relax lad the pilot said when wally burped he tasted cinnamon when he shut his eyes he saw african marigolds come out like stars suddenly the three sinhalese began to speak at once first the radio would say something then the three of them would speak in unison bloody buddhists all of them the pilot explained they even pray on the bloody radio thats ceylon the englishman said two thirds tea and one third rubber and prayer he yelled something at the sinhalese who lowered their voices somewhere over the indian ocean shortly before sighting ceylon the pilot was worried about an aircraft in his vicinity pray now damn you he said to the sinhalese who were all asleep that japanese b mosquito the englishman said to wally what does it look like he asked or did it get you from behind but all wally would say was ninetytwo degrees after the war ceylon would become an independent nation twentyfour years after that the country would change its name to sri lanka but all wally would remember was how hot it had been in a way his parachute had never touched down in a way he had remained over burma for ten monthsjust floating there all wally would remember of his own story would never make as much sense as an ether frolic and how he would survive the warsterile paralyzed both legs flaccidhad already been dreamed by big dot taft it was thirtyfour degrees in st clouds when homer wells went to the railroad station and dictated a telegram to olive to the stationmaster homer could not have phoned her and lied to her that directly and hadnt olive telegramed them she must have had her reasons for not wanting to talk on the phone it was with the almost certain feeling that bay and olive knew everything that homer and candy were doing that homer dictated his telegram to oliverespecting a polite formality as faint as a suspicion it was a suspicion that could be proven only impolitely and homer wells was polite god bless you and wallystop when will we see himstop candy and i home soonstop i have adopted a baby boystop love homer youre kind of young to adopt somebody aint you the stationmaster asked right said homer wells candy telephoned her father its gonna be weeks or maybe months before they can move him ray told her hes gotta gain some weight before he can travel so far and theres probably tests theyve gotta doand theres still a war on dont forget at her end of the phone candy just cried and cried tell me how you are darlin ray kendall said that was when she could have told him that shed just had homers baby but what she said was homers adopted one of the orphans after a pause raymond kendall said just one of them hes adopted a baby boy candy said of course ill help too weve kind of adopted a baby together you have ray said his name is angel candy said bless his heart ray said bless you both too candy cried some more adopted huh ray asked his daughter yes said candy kendall one of the orphans she quit the breastfeeding and nurse edna introduced her to the device for pumping her breasts angel disliked his conversion to formula milk and for a few days he displayed a cranky temperament candy displayed a cranky temperament too when homer observed that her pubic hair would be very nearly grown back by the time she returned to hearts haven she snapped at him for gods sake whos going to see whether i have pubic hair or notexcept you candy asked homer showed signs of strain too he was impatient with dr larchs suggestion that homers future lay in the medical profession larch insisted on giving homer a brand new copy of grays anatomy he also gave him the standard greenhills office gynecology and the british masterpiece diseases of women jesus christ said homer wells im a father and im going to be an apple farmer you have nearperfect obstetrical procedure larch told him you just need a little more of the gynecological and the pediatric of course maybe ill end up a lobsterman homer said and ill send you a subscription to the new england journal of medicine dr larch said and jama and s g and o youre the doctor said homer wells tiredly how do you feel candy asked homer like an orphan homer said they held each other tightly but they did not make love how do you feel homer asked i wont know until i see him candy said honestly what will you know then homer asked if i love him or you or both of you she said or else i wont know any more than i know now its always wait and see isnt it homer asked you dont expect me to tell him anything when hes still over there do you candy asked no of course i dont expect that he said softly she held him tighter she began to cry again oh homer she said how can he weigh only a hundred and five pounds im sure hell gain some weight homer said but his entire body shivered suddenly wallys body had been so strong homer remembered the first time wally had taken him to the ocean the surf had been unusually rough and wally had warned him about the undertow wally had taken him by the hand and shown him how to duck under the waves and how to ride them they had walked along the beach for an hour undistracted by candy she had been tanning i dont understand all this stupid lying down in the sun wally had told homer who agreed youre either doing something in the sun and you pick up a little color or youre doing something elsebut youre doing something thats the main thing they were picking up shells and stonesthe beachcombers search for specimens homer was immediately impressed with the smoothness of the stones and the broken pieces of shellhow the water and the sand had softened them this is a very experienced piece wally had said handing homer an especially worn bit of shell it had no edges experienced homer had said and after that wally had said and this is a worldly stone exhibiting an old smooth one homer thought that his desire for candy had changed everything even the natural process of the grinding smooth of stones and shells if he and wally went back to the beach would they still be beachcombers or was it inevitable that the love of a woman would alter even their most commonplace experiences together was he my friend for five minutes wondered homer wellsand my rival for the rest of my life homer entrusted nurse edna with the care of the hillside orchard he explained that the wiremesh sleeves around the trees could not be wrapped so tightly that they didnt permit the trees to growbut also not so loosely that the mice could girdle the trees he showed her how to spot the tunnels of the pine mice who ate the roots everyone kissed candy goodbye even wilbur larch who when he reached to shake homers hand appeared embarrassed that homer brushed past his hand and hugged him and kissed him on his leathery neck nurse edna sobbed the most freely as soon as the pickup truck rolled past the girls division wilbur larch closed himself in the dispensary it was a sunday so raymond kendall was at work on his homemade torpedo when homer brought candy home candy told homer that she could not face seeing olive until the next morning but she was gripped by an unforeseen panic when homer drove off with angel although her milk was gone she knew she would still wake up to her babys clockeven though it would be homer alone who was hearing the actual cries and how many nights had it been since she had slept alone she would tell homer the next day weve got to find a way to share him i mean even before we tell olivenot to mention wallywe have to both take care of him we have to both be with him i just miss him too much i miss you homer wells told her he was an orphan whod had a family for less than a month of his life and he was not prepared to not have a family again when he and angel arrived at ocean view olive greeted homer as if she were his mother she threw her arms around him and kissed him and wept show me thatbabyoh hes darling she cried whatever possessed you youre so young and youre all alone well the baby was all alone too homer mumbled and candy will help me with him of course olive said til help you too she carried angel to wallys room where homer was surprised to see a criband more baby things for just one baby than could have been collected in a thorough search of both the boys and girls divisions in st clouds an army of bottles for the formula awaited homer in the kitchen olive had even bought a special pot for sterilizing the nipples in the linen closet there were more diapers than there were pillowcases and sheets and towels for the first time in his life homer felt that hed been adopted to his horror he saw that olive loved him i think that you and angel should have wallys room olive said she had obviously been busy planning wally wont be able to climb stairs so im having the dining room made into a bedroomwe can always eat in the kitchen and the dining room has that terrace for when the weathers nice im having a ramp built from the terrace to the patio around the pool for the wheelchair as homer held her while she cried a new guilt surrounded him like the nightfall that everold evernew remorse that mr rochester had told jane eyre to dread that poison of life in the second week of may ira titcomb and homer worked alongside each other putting the bees out in the orchards it was the start of blossom time the night before mothers day when they put out the hives everyone remembered mothers day that year no one forgot olive the house was full of little presents and lots of apple blossoms and some of the work crew even gave homer a mothers day presentthey thought it was so funny that hed adopted a baby just imagine you with your very own baby was the way big dot taft put it in the apple mart where they were giving the display tables a fresh coat of paint there were two babies on displayangel wells and florence and meany hydes boy pete pete hyde looked like a potato compared to angel wellswhich is to say his disposition was entirely bland and he had no apparent bones in his face well homer your angel is an angel florence hyde would say and my petes a pete the applemart women teased him endlessly homer just smiled debra pettigrew was especially interested in handling angel wells she would look intently into the babys face for the longest time before announcing that she was sure the baby was going to look just like homer only more aristocratic she guessed squeeze louise said the baby was too precious for words when homer was out in the field either olive or one of the applemart women looked after angel but most of the time candy looked after her baby we kind of adopted him together she would explain she said it so often that olive said candy was as much of a mother to that child as homer was and olive therefore as a kind of jokegave candy a mothers day present too all the while the bees did their work carrying pollen from the frying pan to cock hill and the honey leaked between the clapboards that housed the hives one morning on a corner of the newspaper homer wells saw olives handwritinga penciled remark above the days headlines any one of which might have prompted olive to respond but somehow homer thought the remark was written to him intolerable dishonesty olive had written and one night candy overheard ray her bedroom light was out in the pitch dark she heard her father say its not wrong but its not right at first she thought he was on the telephone after she drifted back to sleep the sound of her door opening and closing woke her up again and she realized ray had been sitting in her room with heraddressing her in her sleep in the darkness and some of the nights in blossom time candy would say to homer youre an overworked father isnt he olive would say admiringly im going to take this kid off your hands for the night candy would say and homer would smile through the tension of these exchanges he would wake up alone in wallys room in anticipation of angel needing his bottle he could imagine raymond kendall getting up to heat the formula and candy being in her bed with the bottle of formula in as near an approximation of the correct angle of her breast as she could arrange it rays torpedo parts were stolen from kittery navy yard both homer and candy knew thats how he got them but only candy criticized ray for it ive caught more mistakes in the way they do things than they know things to do ray said not likely they could catch me but whats it for anyway candy asked her father i dont like there being a bomb hereespecially when theres a baby in the house well when i got the torpedo ray explained i didnt know about the baby well you know now candy said why dont you fire it at somethingat something far away when its ready ill fire it ray said what are you going to fire it at homer asked raymond kendall i dont know ray said maybe the haven clubthe next time they tell me i spoil their view i dont like not knowing what youre doing something for candy told her father when they were alone its like this ray said slowly til tell you what its likea torpedo its like wally comin home you know hes comin you cant calculate the damage candy asked homer for an interpretation of rays meaning hes not telling you anything homer said hes fishinghe wants you to tell him suppose it all just goes on the way it is candy asked homer after they had made love in the cider house which had not yet been cleaned for use in the harvest the way it is said homer wells yes she said just suppose that we wait and we wait how long could we wait she asked i mean after a while suppose it gets easier to wait than to tell well have to tell sometime said homer wells when candy asked when wally comes home homer said when he comes home paralyzed and weighing less than i weigh candy said is that when we spring it on himshe asked are there things you cant ease into wondered homer wells the scalpel he remembered has a certain heft one does not need to press on itit seems to cut on its ownbut one does need to take charge of it in a certain way when one takes it up one has to move it a scalpel does not require the authority of force but it demands of the user the authority of motion we have to know where were going said homer wells but what if we dont know candy asked what if we know only how we want to stay what if we wait and wait do you mean that you wont ever know if you love him or me homer asked her it may be all confused by how much hes going to need me candy said homer put his hand on herwhere her pubic hair had grown back almost exactly as it was you dont think ill need you too he asked her she rolled to her other hip turning her back to himbut at the same time taking his hand from where hed touched her and clamping his hand to her breast well have to wait and see she said past a certain point i wont wait said homer wells what point is that candy asked because his hand was on her breast he could feel her holding her breath when angel is old enough to either know hes an orphan or know who his parents are homer said thats the point i wont have angel thinking hes adopted i wont have him not knowing who his mother and father are im not worried about angel candy said angel will get lots of love im worried about you and me and wally homer said well go crazy candy said we wont go crazy homer said weve got to take care of angel and make him feel loved but what if i dont feel loved or you dontwhat then candy asked him well wait until then said homer wells well just wait and see he said almost with a vengeance a spring breeze blew over them bearing with it the sicklysweet stench of rotten apples the smell had an almost ammonia power that so overwhelmed homer wells that he released candys breast and covered his mouth and nose with his hand it was not until the summer when candy first heard directly from wally she got an actual letterher first communication from him since hed been shot down a year ago wally had spent six weeks in mt lavinia hospital in ceylon they had not wanted to move him from there until hed gained fifteen pounds until his muscle tremors is had ceased and his speech had lost the daydreaming vacantness of malnutrition he wrote the letter from another hospital in new delhi after a month in india he had gained an additional ten pounds he said that hed learned to put cinnamon in his tea and that the slap of sandals was nearly constant in the hospital they were promising him that they would allow him to commence the long trip home when he weighed one hundred forty pounds and when he had mastered a few basic exercises that were essential to his rehabilitation he couldnt describe the route of his proposed voyage home because of the censors wally hoped that the censors would understandin the light of his paralysis that it was necessary for him to say something about his perfectly normal sexual function the censors had allowed this to pass wally still didnt know he was sterile he knew hed had a urinary tract infection and that the infection was gone and how is homer how i miss him wally wrote but that was not the part of the letter that devastated candy candy was so devastated by the beginning of the letter that the rest of the letter was simply a continuing devastation to her im so afraid that you wont want to marry a cripple wally began in her single bed tugged into sleep and into wakefulness by the tide candy stared at the picture of her mother on the night table she would have liked a mother to talk to at the moment and perhaps because she had no memory of her mother she remembered the first night she had arrived at the orphanage dr larch had been reading to the boys from great expectations candy would never forget the line that she and homer had walked in on i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness wilbur larch had read aloud either dr larch had predetermined that he would end the evenings reading with that line or else he had only then noticed candy and homer wells in the open doorwaythe harsh hall light a naked bulb formed a kind of institutional halo above their heads and had lost his place in the book causing him spurofthe moment to stop reading for whatever reason that perception of wretchedness had been candys introduction to st clouds and the beginning and the end of her bedtime story fifteen years for fifteen years they were a couple lorna and melony they were set in their ways once the young rebels of the womenonly boardinghouse they now occupied the choicest roomswith the river viewand they served as superintendents to the building for a consideration regarding their rent melony was handy she had learned plumbing and electricity at the shipyard where she was one of a staff of three electricians the other two were men but they never messed with melony no one ever would lorna became more domestic she lacked the concentration for advanced training at the shipyard but she remained an employeestay on for the pension plan melony had advised her lorna actually liked the assemblyline monotony and she was smart about signing up for the overtime pay shiftsshe was willing to work at odd hours if she could work less her being out late bothered melony lorna became increasingly feminine she not only wore dresses even to work and used more makeup and perfume and watched her weight her voice which had once been harsh actually softened and she developed a smile especially when she was being criticized melony found her increasingly passive as a couple they rarely fought because lorna would not fight back in fifteen years she had discovered that melony relented if there wasnt a struggle given any resistance melony would never quit you dont fight fair melony would occasionally complain youre much bigger than i am lorna would say coyly an understatement by when melony was fortysomething no one knew exactly how old she was she weighed one hundred seventyfive pounds she was five feet eight inches tall she was almost fifty inches around at her chest which meant that she wore mens shirts large anything smaller than a seventeeninch neck wouldnt fit her because her arms were short she always had to roll up the sleeves she had a thirtysixinch waist but only a twentyeightinch inseam which meant that she had to roll up the cuffs of her trousers or have lorna shorten them melonys pants were always so tight across her thighs that they quickly lost their crease there but they were very baggy in the seat melony was not fatassed and she had the nondescript hips of most men she had small feet which always hurt her in fifteen years shed been arrested only oncefor fighting actually the charge was assault but in the end she was stuck with nothing more damaging than a disturbance of the peace shed been in the ladies room of a pizza bar in bath when some college boy had tried to engage lorna in conversation when he saw melony take her place beside lorna at the bar he whispered to lorna i dont think i could find anyone for your friend he was imagining a possible doubledate situation speak up melony said whispering is impolite i said i dont think i could find a date for youthe boy said boldly melony put her arm around lorna and cupped her breast i couldnt find a sheep dog that would hold still for you melony told the college boy fucking dyke he said as he was leaving he thought hed spoken quietly enoughand strictly to impress the shipyard workers at the far end of the bar he couldnt have known that the men were melonys coworkers they held the college boy while melony broke his nose with a metal napkin container the way that melony liked to fall asleep was with her big face on lornas tight bare belly lorna could always tell when melony had fallen asleep because of the change in melonys breathing which lorna could feel against her pubic hair in fifteen years there was only one night when lorna had to ask her friend to move her heavy head before she had soundly fallen asleep what is it you got cramps melony asked no im pregnantlorna said melony thought it was a joke until lorna went into the bathroom to be sick when lorna came back to bed melony said i want to try to understand this calmly weve been like a married couple for fifteen years and now youre pregnant lorna curled herself into a ball around one of the pillows she covered her head with the other pillow her face and her stomach and her private parts were protected but still she trembled she began to cry i guess what youre telling me melony went on is that when women are fucking each other it takes a lot longer for one of them to get pregnant than when a woman is fucking some guy right lorna didnt answer her she just went on sniveling like about fifteen yearslike that long it takes fifteen years for women to get pregnant when theyre just fucking other women boy thats some effort melony said she went to the window and looked at the view of the kennebec in the summer the trees were so leafy that the river was hard to see she let a summer breeze dry the sweat on her neck and chest before she started packing please dont godont leave me lorna said she was still all balled up on the bed im packing up your things melony said im not the one whos pregnant i dont have to go nowhere dont throw me out lorna said miserably beat me but dont throw me out you take the train to saint clouds when you get there you ask for the orphanage melony told her friend it was just a guyjust one guy and it was just once lorna cried no it wasnt melony said a guy gets you pregnant fast with women it takes fifteen years when she had packed up lornas things melony stood over the bed and shook her friend who tried to hide under the bedcovers fifteen years melony cried she shook lorna and shook her but that was all she did to her she even walked lorna to the train lorna looked very disheveled and it was only the early morning of what would be a wilting summer day i ask for the orphanage lorna asked numbly in addition to her suitcase melony handed lorna a large carton and you give this to an old woman named grogan if shes still alive melony said dont say nothing to her just give it to her and if shes dead or not there anymore melony started to say then she stopped forget that she said shes either there or shes dead and if shes dead bring the carton back you can give it back to me when you pick up the rest of your stuff the rest of my stuff lorna said i was faithful to you i was loyal as a dog melony said more loudly than shed meant to speak because a conductor looked at her strangelyas if she were a dog you see somethin you want shitface melony asked the conductor the train is about to leave he mumbled please dont throw me out lorna whispered to melony i hope you have a real monster inside you melony told her friend i hope it tears you to pieces when they drag it out your door lorna fell down in the aisle of the train as if shed been punched and melony left her in a heap the conductor helped lorna to her feet and into her seat out the window of the moving train he watched melony walking away that was when the conductor noticed that he was shaking almost as violently as lorna melony thought about lorna arriving in st clouds that turd of a stationmaster would he still be there that long walk uphill with her suitcase and the large carton for mrs grogan could lorna make it and would the old man still be in the business shed not been angry for fifteen years but now here was another betrayal and melony pondered how readily her anger had returned it made all her senses keener she felt the itch to pick apples again she was surprised that it was not with vengeance that she thought of homer wells she remembered how shed first loved having lorna as a palin part because she could complain to lorna about what homer had done to her now melony imagined shed like to complain about lorna to homer wells that little bitch shed tell homer if there was anybody with a bulge in his pants she couldnt keep her eyes off it right homer would say and together they would demolish a buildingjust shove it into time when time passes its the people who knew you whom you want to see theyre the ones you can talk to when enough time passes whats it matter what they did to you melony discovered that she could think like this for one minute but in the next minute when she thought of homer wells she thought shed like to kill him when lorna came back from st clouds and went to the boarding house to retrieve her things she found that everything had been neatly packed and boxed and gathered in one corner of the room melony was at work so lorna took her things and left after that they would see each other perhaps once a week at the shipyard or at the pizza bar in bath where everyone from the yard went on these occasions they were polite but silent only once did melony speak to her the old woman groganshe was alive melony asked i didnt bring the box back did i lorna asked so you gave it to her melony asked and you didnt say nothing i just asked if she was alive and one of the nurses said she was so i gave the carton to one of the nursesas i was leavin lorna said and the doctor melony asked old larchis he alive barely lorna said ill be damned said melony did it hurt not much lorna said cautiously too bad melony said it shoulda hurt a lot in her boardinghouse where she was now the sole superintendent she took from a very old electricians catalogue a yellowed article and photograph from the local newspaper she went to the antiques shop that was run by her old dimwitted devotee mary agnes cork whose adoptive parents had treated her well theyd even put her in charge of the family store melony asked mary agnes for a suitable frame for the newspaper article and the photograph and mary agnes was delighted to come up with something perfect it was a genuine victorian frame taken from a ship that had been overhauled in the bath yards mary agnes sold melony the frame for much less than it was worth even though melony was rich electricians are well paid and melony had been working fulltime for the shipyard for fifteen years because she was the superintendent of the boardinghouse she lived almost rentfree she didnt own a car and she bought all her clothes at sams armynavy mens store it was fitting that the frame was teakthe wood of the tree that had held wally worthington in the air over burma for one whole nightbecause the newspaper article was about captain worthington and the picturewhich melony had recognized fifteen years agowas also of wally the article was all about the miraculous rescue of the downed and paralyzed pilot who had been awarded the purple heart as far as melony was concerned the whole story resembled the plot of a cheap and unlikely adventure movie but she liked the pictureand the part of the article that said wally was a local hero a worthington from those worthingtons who for years had owned and managed the ocean view orchards in hearts rock in her bedroom in her boardinghouse in bath melony hung the antique frame containing the article and photograph over her bed in the darkness she liked knowing it was thereover her head like history she liked that as much as looking at the photograph in the daylight hours and in the darkness she would linger over the syllables of that heros name worthington she liked to say aloud ocean view she said at other times she was more familiar with saying this hearts rock she would say quickly spitting the short words out in those predawn hours which are the toughest for insomniacs melony would whisper fifteen years and just before she would fall asleep she would ask of the first flat light that crept into her bedroom are you still there sunshine what is hardest to accept about the passage of time is that the people who once mattered the most to us are wrapped up in parentheses for fifteen years homer wells had taken responsibility for the writing and the posting of the cider house rules every year it was the last thing he attached to the wall after the fresh coat of paint had dried some years he tried being jolly with the rules other years he tried sounding nonchalant perhaps it had been olives tone and not the rules themselves that had caused some offense and thereby made it a matter of pride with the migrants that the rules should never be obeyed the rules themselves did not change much the rotary screen had to be cleaned out a word of warning about the drinking and the falling asleep in the coldstorage room was mandatory and long after the ferris wheel at cape kenneth was torn down and there were so many lights on the coast that the view from the cider house roof resembled a glimpse of some distant city the migrants still sat on the roof and drank too much and fell off and homer wells would ask or tell them not to rules he guessed never asked rules told but he tried to make the cider house rules seem friendly he phrased the rules in a confiding voicethere have been some accidents on the roof over the yearsespecially at night and especially in combination with having a great deal to drink while sitting on the roof we recommend that you do your drinking with both feet on the ground homer would write but every year the piece of paper itself would become worn and tattered and used for other thingsa kind of desperation grocery list for example always by someone who couldnt spell corn meel regular flower was written across homers rules one year at times the solitary sheet of paper gathered little insults and mockeries of a semiliterate nature no fucking on the roof or beatoff only in cold storage wally told homer that only mr rose knew how to write that the pranks and insults and shopping lists were all composed by mr rose but homer could never be sure every summer mr rose would write to wally and wally would tell mr rose how many pickers he neededand mr rose would say how many he was bringing and the day they would arrive give or take no contract ever existedjust the short reliable assurances from mr rose some summers he came with a womanlarge and soft and quiet with a baby girl riding her hip by the time the little girl could run around and get into trouble she was about the age of angel wells mr rose stopped bringing her or the woman for fifteen years the only migrant who was as constant as mr rose was black pan the cook hows your little girl homer wells vould ask mr roseevery year that the woman and the daughter didnt show up again she growin like your boy mr rose would say and hows your lady homer would ask she lookin after the little girl mr rose would say only once in fifteen years did homer wells approach mr rose on the subject of the cider house rules i hope they dont offend anyone homer began im responsiblei write them every yearand if anyone takes offense i hope youll tell me no offense said mr rose smiling theyre just little rules homer said yes said mr rose they are but it does concern me that no one seems to pay attention to them homer finally said mr rose whose bland face was unchanged by the years and whose body had remained thin and lithe looked at homer mildly we got our own rules too homer he said your own rules said homer wells bout lots of things said mr rose bout how much we can have to do with you for one thing with me homer said with white people said mr rose we got our rules about that i see homer said but he didnt really see and about fightin said mr rose fighting said homer wells with each other said mr rose one rule is we cant cut each other bad not bad enough for no hospital not bad enough for no police we can cut each other but not bad i see homer said no you dont said mr rose you dont seethats the point we can cut each other only so bad that you never seeyou never know we was cut you see rightsaid homer wells when you gonna say somethin else mr rose asked smiling just be careful on the roof homer advised him nothin too bad can happen up there mr rose told him worse things can happen on the ground homer wells was on the verge of saying right again when he discovered that he couldnt talk mr rose had seized his tongue between his blunt squareended index finger and his thumb a vague taste like dust was in homers mouth mr roses hand had been so fast homer had never seen ithe never knew before that someone could actually catch hold of someones tongue caught ya said mr rose smiling he let homers tongue go homer managed to say youre very fast right said mr rose alertly aint no one faster wally complained to homer about the yearly wear and tear on the cider house roof every two or three years they had to retin the roof or fix the flashing or put up new gutters whats having his own rules got to do with not paying attention to ours wally asked homer i dont know homer said write him a letter and ask him but no one wanted to offend mr rose he was a reliable crew boss he made the picking and the pressing go smoothly every harvest candy who managed the money at ocean view claimed that whatever costs they absorbed in repairs to the cider house roof were more than compensated for by mr roses reliability theres something a little gangland style about the guy wally saidnot exactly complaining i mean i dont really want to know how he gets all those pickers to behave themselves but they do behave themselves homer said he does a good job candy said let him have his own rules homer wells looked away he knew that rules for candy were all private contracts fifteen years ago they had made their own rulesor really candy had made them before wally came home they stood in the cider house after angel was born on a night when olive was looking after angel they had just made love but not happily something was wrong it would be wrong for fifteen years but that night candy had said lets agree to something okay homer said whatever happens we share angel of course homer said i mean you get to be his fatheryou get all the father time you want to haveand i get to have all the mother time i need candy said always said homer wells but something was wrong i mean regardless of what happenswhether im with you or with wally candy said homer was quiet for a while so youre leaning toward wally he asked tm not leaning anywhere candy said tm standing right here and were agreeing to certain rules i didnt know they were rules said homer wells we share angel candy said we both get to live with him we get to be his family nobody ever moves out even if youre with wally homer said after a while remember what you told me when you wanted me to have angel candy asked him homer wells was cautious now remind me he said you said that he was your baby toothat he was ours that i couldnt decide all by myself not to have himthat was the point candy said yes homer said i remember well if he was ours then hes ours nowwhatever happens candy repeated in the same house asked homer wells even if you go with wally like a family candy said like a family said homer wells it was a word that took a strong grip of him an orphan is a child forever an orphan detests change an orphan hates to move an orphan loves routine for fifteen years homer wells knew that there were possibly as many cider house rules as there were people who had passed through the cider house even so every year he posted a fresh list for fifteen years the board of trustees had tried and failed to replace dr larch they couldnt find anyone who wanted the job there were people dying to throw themselves into unrewarded service of their fellow man but there were more exotic places than st clouds where their services were neededand where they could also suffer the board of trustees couldnt manage to entice a new nurse into service there either they couldnt hire even an administrative assistant when dr gingrich retirednot from the board he would never retire from the boardhe mused about accepting the position in st clouds but mrs goodhall pointed out to him that he wasnt an obstetrician his psychiatric practice had never flourished in maine yet dr gingrich was surprised and a little hurt to learn that mrs goodhall enjoyed pointing this out to him mrs goodhall had reached retirement age herself but nothing could have been farther from that womans zealous mind wilbur larch was ninetysomething and mrs goodhall was obsessed with retiring him before he died she realized that to have larch die while still in service would register as a kind of defeat for her not long agoperhaps in an effort to invigorate the boarddr gingrich had proposed they hold a meeting in an offseason hotel in ogunquit simply to break the routine of meeting in their usual offices in portland make it a kind of outing he proposed the ocean air and all but it rained in the colder weather the wood shrank the sand got in the windows and doors and crunched underfoot the drapes and the towels and the bedsheets were gritty the wind was off the ocean no one could sit on the veranda because the wind blew the rain under the roof the hotel provided them with a long dark empty dining room they held their meeting under a chandelier that no one could turn onno one could find the right switch it was appropriate to their discussion of st clouds that they attempted to conduct their business in a former ballroom that had seen better days in a hotel so deeply in the offseason that anyone seeing them there would have suspected theyd been quarantined in fact when he got a glimpse of them that is what homer wells thought he and candy were the hotels only other offseason guests they had taken a room for half the day they were a long way from ocean view but theyd come this far to be sure that no one would recognize them it was time for them to leave they stood outside on the veranda candy with her back against homers chest his arms wrapped around her they both faced out to sea he appeared to like the way the wind whipped her hair in his face and neither of them seemed to mind the rain inside the hotel mrs goodhall looked through the streaked window frowning at the weather and at the young couple braving the elements in her opinion noth ing could ever be normal enough that was what was wrong with larch not everyone who is ninetysomething is senile she would grant you but larch wasnt normal and even if they were a young married couple public displays of affection were not acceptable to mrs goodhalland they were calling all the more attention to themselves by their defiance of the rain whats more she remarked to dr gingrich who was given no warning and had no map with which he could have followed her thoughts til bet theyre not married the young couple he thought looked a little sad perhaps they needed a psychiatrist perhaps it was the weathertheyd been planning to sail ive figured out what he is mrs goodhall told dr gingrich who thought she was referring to the young man homer wells hes a nonpractising homosexual mrs goodhall announced she meant dr larch who was on her mind night and day dr gingrich was rather amazed at what struck him as mrs goodhalls wild guess but he looked at the young man with renewed interest true he was not actually fondling the young woman he seemed a trifle distant if we could catch him at it wed have him out in a minute mrs goodhall observed of course wed still have to find someone willing to replace him dr gingrich was lost he realized that mrs goodhall couldnt be interested in replacing the young man on the veranda and that therefore she was still thinking about dr larch but if dr larch were a nonpractising homosexual what could they ever catch him at we would catch him at being a homosexual just not practising as such dr gingrich asked cautiously it was not hard to rile mrs goodhall hes obviously queer she snapped dr gingrich in all his years of psychiatric service to maine had never been moved to apply the label of nonpractising homosexual to anyone although he had often heard of such a thing usually someone was complaining about someone elses peculiarity in mrs goodhalls case she despised men who lived alone it wasnt normal and she despised young couples who displayed their affection or werent married or both too much of what was normal also enraged her although he shared with mrs goodhall the desire to replace dr larch and his staff at st clouds it occurred to dr gingrich that he should have had mrs goodhall as a patientshe might have kept him out of retirement for a few more years when the young couple came inside the hotel mrs goodhall gave them such a look that the young woman turned away did you see her turn away in shame mrs goodhall would ask dr gingrich later but the young man stared her down he looked right through her dr gingrich marveled it was one of the best looks in the tradition of withering that dr gingrich had ever seen and he found himself smiling at the young couple did you see that couple candy asked him later in the long drive back to ocean view i dont think they were married said homer wells or if theyre married they hate each other maybe thats why i thought they were married candy said he looked a little stupid and she looked completely crazy homer said i know they were married candy said in the sad dingy dining room in ogunquit while the rain pelted down mrs goodhall said its just not normal doctor larch those old nursethe whole bit if someone new in some capacity isnt hired soon i say we send a janitor up therejust anyone who can look the place over and tell us how bad it is maybe its not as bad as we think dr gingrich said tiredly he had seen the young couple leave the hotel and they had filled him with melancholy let somebody go there and see mrs goodhall said the dark chandelier above her small gray head then in the nick of timein everyones opinion a new nurse came to st clouds remarkably she appeared to have found out about the place all by herself nurse caroline they called her she was constantly of use and a great help when melonys present for mrs grogan arrived what is it mrs grogan asked the carton was almost too heavy for her to lift nurse edna and nurse angela had brought it over to the girls division together it was a sweltering summer afternoon still because it had been a perfectly windless day nurse edna had sprayed the apple trees dr larch came to the girls division to see what was in the package well go on open it he said to mrs grogan i havent got all day mrs grogan was not sure how to attack the carton which was sealed with wire and twine and tapeas if a savage had attempted to contain a wild animal nurse caroline was called for her help what would they do without nurse caroline larch wondered before the package for mrs grogan nurse caroline had been the only large gift that anyone sent to st clouds homer wells had sent her from the hospital in cape kenneth homer wells knew that nurse caroline believed in the lords work and he had persuaded her to go where her devotion would be welcome but nurse caroline had trouble opening melonys present who left it mrs grogan asked someone named lorna nurse angela said i never saw her before i never saw her before either said wilbur larch when the package was opened there was still a mystery inside was a huge coat much too large for mrs grogan an army surplus coat made for the alaskan service it had a hood and a fur collar and was so heavy that when mrs grogan tried it on it almost dragged her to the floorshe lost her balance a little and wobbled around like a top losing its spin the coat had all sorts of secret pockets which were probably for weapons or mess kitsor the severed arms and legs of enemies said dr larch mrs grogan lost in the coat and perspiring said i dont get it then she felt the money in one of the pockets she took out several loose bills and counted them which was when she remembered that it was the exact amount of money that melony had stolen from her when melony had left st cloudsand taken mrs grogans coat with hermore than fifteen years ago oh my god mrs grogan cried fainting nurse caroline ran to the train station but lornas train had already left when mrs grogan was revived she cried and cried oh that dear girl she cried while everyone soothed her and no one spoke larch and nurse angela and nurse edna remembered melony as anything but dear larch tried on the coat which was also too big and heavy for him he staggered around in it for a while frightening one of the smaller girls in the girls division whod come into the lobby to investigate mrs grogans cries larch found something in another pocket the snipped twisted ends of some copper wire and a pair of rubberhandled insulated wirecutters on his way back to the boys division larch whispered to nurse angela ill bet she robbed some electrician a big electrician nurse angela said you two nurse edna scolded them its a warm coat anywayat least it will keep her warm itll give her a heart attack lugging it around dr larch said i can wear it nurse caroline commented it was the first time that larch and his old nurses realized that nurse caroline was not only young and energetic she was also big and strongand in a much less crude and vulgar way a little reminiscent of melony if melony had been a marxist thought wilbur larchand an angel larch had trouble with the word angel since homer wells and candy had taken their son away from st clouds larch had trouble with the whole idea of how homer was living for fifteen years wilbur larch had been amazed that the three of themhomer and candy and wallyhad managed it he wasnt at all sure what they had managed or at what cost he knew of course that angel was a wanted child and well loved and well looked afteror else larch couldnt have remained silent it was difficult for him to remain silent about the rest of it how had they arranged it but who am i to advocate honesty in all relationships he wondered me with my fictional histories me with my fictional heart defectsme with my fuzzy stone and who was he to ask exactly what the sexual relationship was did he need to remind himself that he had slept with someone elses mother and dressed himself in the light of her daughters cigar that he had allowed to die a woman who had put a ponys penis in her mouth for money larch looked out the window at the apple orchard on the hill that summer of the trees were thriving the apples were mostly pale green and pink the leaves were a vibrant dark green the trees were almost too tall for nurse edna to spray with the indian pump i should ask nurse caroline to take over the tending of them dr larch thought he wrote a note to himself and left it in the typewriter the heat made him drowsy he went to the dispensary and stretched himself out on the bed in the summer with the windows open he could risk a slightly heavier dose he thought the last summer that mr rose was in charge of the picking crew at ocean view was the summer of when angel wells was fifteen all that summer angel had been looking forward to the next summerwhen he would be sixteen old enough to have his drivers license by that time he imagined he would have saved enough moneyfrom his summer jobs in the orchards and from his contribution to the harveststo buy his first car his father homer wells didnt own a car when homer went shopping in town or when he volunteered at the hospital in cape kenneth he used one of the farm vehicles the old cadillac which had been equipped with a handoperated brake and accelerator so wally could drive it was often available and candy had her own cara lemonyellow jeep in which she had taught angel to drive and which was as reliable in the orchards as it was sturdy on the public roads i taught your father how to swim candy always told angel i guess i can teach you how to drive of course angel knew how to drive all the farm vehicles too he knew how to mow and how to spray and how to operate the forklift the drivers license was simply necessary official approval of something angel already did very well on the farm and for a fifteenyearold he looked much older he could have driven all over maine and no one would have questioned him he would be taller than his boyish roundfaced father they were deadeven as the summer began and there was a defined angularity in the bones of his face that made him seem already grown up even the trace of a beard was there the shadows under his eyes were not unhealthylooking they served only to accent the vivid darkness of his eyes it was a joke between father and son that the shadows under angels eyes were inherited you get your insomnia from me homer wells would tell his son who still thought he was adopted youve got no reason to feel adopted his father had told him youve got three parents really the best that most people get is two candy had been like a mother to him and wally was a second fatheror the favorite eccentric uncle the only life angel had known was a life with all of them at fifteen hed never suffered so much as a change of rooms everything had been the same since he could remember it he had what had been wallys room the one wally had shared with homer angel had been born into a real boys room hed grown up surrounded by wallys tennis and swimming trophies and the pictures of candy with wally when wallys legs worked and even the picture of candy teaching homer how to swim wallys purple heart which wally had given to angel was hung on the wall over the boys bed it concealed an oddly smeared fingerprintolives fingerprint from the night when shed crushed a mosquito against that wall which was the same night angel wells had been conceived in the cider house after fifteen years the wall needed a fresh coat of paint homers room down the hall had been the master bedroom it had been olives room and the room where senior had died olive herself had died in cape kenneth hospital before the war was over even before theyd sent wally home it was an inoperable cancer which spread very quickly after theyd done the exploratory homer and candy and ray had taken turns visiting her one of them was always with angel but olive was never alone homer and candy had saidprivately only to each otherthat things might have worked out differently if wally had made it back to the states before olive died because of wallys precariousness and the added difficulty of moving him in wartime it was thought best not to tell wally of olives cancer that was how olive had wanted it too in the end olive thought wally had come home she was pumped so full of painkillers that she mistook homer for wally in their last few meetings homer had been in the habit of reading to herfrom jane eyre from david copperfield and from great expectations but he gave that up when olives attention began to wander the first few times olive confused homer with wally homer couldnt be sure whom she thought she was addressing you must forgive him olive said her speech was slurred she took homers hand which she did not really hold so much as contain in her lap forgive him said homer wells yes olive said he cant help how much he loves her or how much he needs her to candy olive was clearer hes going to be crippled and hes going to lose me if he loses you too whos going to look after him ill always look after him candy said homer and i will look after him but olive was not so drugged that she failed to detect and dislike the ambiguity of candys answer its not right to hurt or deceive someone whos already been hurt and deceived candy she said with the drugs she was taking olive felt a perfect freedom it was not for her to tell them that she knew what she knew it was for them to tell her what they were keeping from her until they told her she could keep them guessing about what she knew to homer olive said hes an orphan who is homer asked he is she said dont you forget how needy an orphan is hell take everything hes come from having nothingwhen he sees what he can have hell take everything he sees my son olive said dont blame anyone blame will kill you yes said homer wells who held olives hand when he bent over her to hear how she was breathing she kissed him as if he were wally blame will kill you he repeated to candy after olive had died dread remorse said homer wells forever recalling mr rochesters advice dont quote to me candy told him the thing is hes coming home and he doesnt even know his mothers dead not to mention candy said then she stopped talking not to mention said homer wells candy and wally were married less than a month after wally returned to ocean view wally weighed one hundred fortyseven pounds and homer wells pushed the wheelchair down the church aisle candy and wally occupied the converted bedroom on the ground floor of the big house homer wells had written to wilbur larch shortly after wally had come home olives death homer wrote to larch had fixed things for candy and wally more securely than wallys paralysis or than whatever sense of betrayal and guilt might have plagued candy candys right dont worry about angel wilbur larch had written to homer wells angel will get enough love why would he feel like an orphan if he never is one if youre a good father to him and candys a good mother to himand if hes got wally loving him toodo you think hes going to start missing some idea of who his socalled real father is the problem is not going to be angels problem its going to be yours youre going to want him to know youre his real father because of younot because hes going to need to know the problem is youre going to need to tell you and candy youre going to be proud it will be for you and not for angel that youre going to want to tell him hes no orphan and to himself or as an entry in a brief history of st clouds wilbur larch wrote here in st clouds we have just one problem his name is homer wells hes a problem wherever he goes aside from the darkness in his eyes and an ability to sustain a pensive faraway look that was both alert and dreaming angel wells resembled his father very little he never thought of himself as an orphan he knew he had been adopted and he knew he came from where his father came from and he knew he was loved he had always felt it what did it matter that he called candy candy and homer dad and wally wally this was the second summer that angel wells had been strong enough to carry wallyup some steps or into the surf or out of the shallow end of the pool and back into the wheelchair homer had taught angel how to carry wally into the surf when they went to the beach wally was a better swimmer than any of them but he needed to get into deep enough water so that he could either float over a wave or duck under one you just cant let him get dragged around in the shallow water homer had explained to his son there were some rules regarding wally there were always rules angel had observed as good a swimmer as he was wally was never allowed to swim alone and for many summers now angel wells had been wallys lifeguard whenever wally swam his laps or just floated in the pool almost half the physical contact between wally and angel occurred in the water where they resembled otters or seals they wrestled and dunked each other so ferociously that candy couldnt help being anxious at times for both of them and wally was not allowed to drive alone even though the cadillac had handoperated controls someone else had to collapse the wheelchair and put it in or take it out of the back of the car the first collapsible wheelchairs were quite heavy although wally would occasionally drag himself through the ground floor of the house using one of those metal walkers his legs were mere props in unfamiliar terrain he needed his wheelchairand in rough terrain he needed a pusher so many times the pusher had been angel and so many times angel had been the passenger in the cadillac although homer and candy might have complained if they had known wally had long ago taught angel to drive the cadillac the hand controls make it easy kiddo wally would say your legs dont have to be long enough to reach the pedals that was not what candy had told angel about teaching him to drive in the jeep just as soon as your legs are long enough to reach the pedals she had told him kissing him which she did whenever she had the excuse til teach you how to drive when the time came it never occurred to candy that angel had been so easy to teach because hed been driving the cadillac for years some rules are good rules kiddo wally would tell the boy kissing him which wally did a lot especially in the water but some rules are just rules you just got to break them carefully its dumb that i have to be sixteen before i get a drivers license angel told his father right said homer wells they should make an exception for kids who grow up on farms sometimes angel played tennis with candy but more often he hit balls back to wally who maintained his good strokes even sitting down the club members had complained a little about the wheelchair tracks on the claybut what would the haven club have been without tolerating one or another worthington eccentricity wally would set the wheelchair in a fixed position and hit only forehands for fifteen or twenty minutes angels responsibility was to get the ball exactly to him then wally would move the chair and hit only backhands its actually better practice for you than for me kiddo wally would tell angel at least im not getting any better angel got a lot better he was so much better than candy that it sometimes hurt his mothers feelings when she detected how boring it was for angel to play with her homer wells didnt play tennis he had never been a games man he had resisted even the indoor football at st cloudsalthough he occasionally dreamed of stickball usually with nurse angela pitching she was always the hardest to hit and homer wells had no hobbies nothing beyond following angel around as if homer were his sons pet a dog waiting to be played with pillow fights in the dark theyd been popular for a few years kissing each other good night and then finding excuses to repeat the ritualand finding novel ways to wake each other in the mornings if homer was bored he was also busy he had continued his volunteer work for cape kenneth hospital in a sense he had never stopped his war effort his service as a nurses aide and he was a veteran reader of medical literature the journal of the american medical association and the new england journal of medicine were very acceptably piled up on the tables and in the bookcases of the ocean view house candy objected to the illustrations in the american journal of obstetrics and gynecology i need a little intellectual stimulation around here homer wells would say whenever candy complained about the graphic nature of this material i just dont think that angel has to see it candy said he knows i have a little background in the subject homer said i dont object to what he knows i object to the pictures candy said theres no reason to mystify the subject for the child wally said taking homers side theres no need to make the subject grotesque either candy argued i dont think its either a mystery or grotesque angel said that summer he was fifteen its just interesting youre not even going out with girls yet candy said laughing and taking the opportunity to kiss him but when she bent over him to kiss him she saw in her sons lap the illustration that was featured in an article on vaginal operations the illustration indicated the lines of incision for the removal of the vulva and a primary tumor in an extended radical vulvectomy homer candy shouted homer was upstairs in his very spare bedroom his life was so spare hed tacked only two things on his wallsand one of those was in his bathroom by his bed he had a picture of wally in his fliers scarf and sheepskin wally was posing with the crew of opportunity knocks the shadow from the wing of the dark plane completely obscured the face of the radioman and the glare of the indian sun completely whited out the face of the crew chief who had eventually died of his colon complication only wally and the copilot were correctly illuminated although homer had seen better pictures of them both the copilot sent wally a picture of himself and his growing family every christmas he had five or six children and a plump wife but every year the copilot looked thinner the amoeba hed contracted in burma had never entirely left him and in the bathroom homer had tacked up the blank questionnaire the extra copythe one hed never sent to the board of trustees of st clouds the exposure to the steam from the shower had given to the paper of the questionnaire the texture of a parchment lampshade but each question had remained readable and idiotic the master bed was higher than most because in his day senior worthington had enjoyed looking out the window while lying down it was a feature homer also appreciated about the bed he could oversee the pool from up there and he could see the cider house roof he liked to lie on that bed for hours just looking out the window homer candy called to him please come see what your son is reading that was the way they all talked candy said your son to homer and thats how wally spoke too and angel always said dad or pop when he addressed his father it had been an uninterrupted fifteenyear relationship homer and angel upstairs wally and candy in the former dining room downstairs the four of them ate their meals together some nightsespecially in winter whn the bare trees permitted more of a view of the lit dining room and kitchen windows of strangers houseshomer wells liked to take a short car ride before dinner he wondered about the families who were eating dinner together what were their real lives like st clouds had been more predictable what did anyone really know about all those families sitting down to have a meal we are a family isnt that the main thing candy asked homer wells whenever homer appeared to her to be taking longer and longer drives before dinner angel has a family a really wonderful family yes thats the main thing homer agreed and when wally would tell her how happy he was how he felt he was the luckiest man alivehow anyone would give up his legs to be as happy as wally wasthose were the nights that candy couldnt sleep those were the nights when shed be aware of homer wells who was wide awake too some nights they would meet in the kitchentheyd have some rnilk and apple pie some nights when it was warm theyd sit by the swimming pool not touching each other to any observer the space between them would have indicated a quarrel although they rarely quarreled or else indifference but they were never indifferent to each other the way they sat by the pool reminded them both of how they used to sit on ray kendalls dock before theyd sat closer together if ever they were too conscious of this memoryand of missing that dock or of missing ray whod died before angel was old enough to have any memory of himthis would spoil their evening by the swimming pool and they would be forced back to their separate bedrooms where they would lie awake a little longer as he grew older and almost as insomniac as his father angel wells would often watch homer and candy sitting by the pool which he could also see out the window of his room if angel ever thought anything about the two of them sitting out there it was why such old friends sat so far apart raymond kendall had died shortly after wally and candy were married he was killed when the lobster pound blew up his whole dock was blown apart and his lobster boat sank and two old heaps of automobiles he was working on were jolted across his parking lot a good twentyfive yards down the coastal highway by the explosionas if theyd been driven under their own power even the picture window at the haven club was collapsed by the blast but it happened so late at night that the bar was closed and none of the haven clubs regular drinkers was on hand to see their favorite eyesore obliterated from their view of hearts haven harbor ray had been tinkering with his homemade torpedo for all of his legendary mechanical genius he must have found out something about a torpedo that he didnt know the misfortune of someone you love can bring out the guilt in you candy regretted that shed not told her father about homer and angel wells it was no consolation to her that she imagined ray already knew everything she had been able to understand by his silences that he wanted to hear it from her yet not even the death of her father could prompt candy kendall to tell her story to anyone as far south along the coastal highway as powells ice cream palace there had been dead lobsters and lobster parts in the parking lot and in the road this had prompted herb fowler who was never caught without something funny to say to ask old mr powell if he was inventing a new ice cream flavor herb had waited for the summer that angel wells was fifteen before he flicked angel his first rubber angels feelings were slightly hurt that herb had not initiated him sooner angels pal and coworker pudgy pete hyde was only a few months older than angel and not nearly so grown up in countless ways and angel knew that herb fowler had bounced a rubber off pete hydes head when pete was only thirteen what angel hadnt yet fathomed was that pete hyde was a part of ocean views workingclass family and angelalthough he worked with the workerswas from the bosss family the workers knew that homer wells ran ocean view he was the one most in charge this would not have surprised olive and it was clear that candy and wally were grateful for homers authority perhaps because the workers knew that homer had come from st clouds they felt that he was closer to them he lived in what big dot taft called the fancy house but he was like one of them none of the workers resented that homer was the boss with the possible exception of vernon lynch who resented any and every authorityall the more so since grace lynch had died candy who looked into the matters concerning the workers wives discovered that grace had been pregnant shed died of acute peritonitis following a misguided attempt to abort herself homer who would often wonder why she had not chosen to make a second trip to st clouds liked to think that she had not died in vain it had been her death and dr harlows particularly unsympathetic response to it that had prompted nurse caroline to resign from the cape kenneth hospital staff as homer wells had been encouraging her to do nurse caroline finally took homers suggestion and offered her services to st clouds homer wells sent me nurse caroline said when she introduced herself to wilbur larch the old man had not grown too careless sent you for what larch asked tm a trained nurse she said im here to help you help me do what asked larch who was not very convincing at portraying innocence i believe in the lords work nurse caroline said exasperated well why didnt you say so wilbur larch asked so hes given me something besides apple trees the old man mused so theres still hope for him nurse angela and nurse edna were so relieved to get nurse caroline that they werent even jealous here was the new blood that might hold the board of trustees at bay a while longer the new nurse is a definite improvement to the situation dr gingrich confided to the board i would say that she takes a lot of pressure off making any immediate decision as if they werent trying to replace the old man every minute id prefer a young doctor to a young nurse mrs goodhall declared a young doctor and a young administrator you know how i feel about the records the records of that place are pure whimsy but its at least a temporary improvement ill buy that she said if wilbur larch could have heard her he would have said just give me the time lady and youll buy more than that but in wilbur larch was ninetysomething sometimes his face would hold so still under the ether cone that the mask would stay in place after his hand had dropped to his side only the force of his exhalations would make the cone fall he had lost a lot of weight in a mirror or traveling with his beloved ether he had the impression that he was becoming a bird only nurse caroline had the courage to criticize his drug habit you should know of all people nurse caroline told him roughly me of all people larch asked innocently sometimes he found it was fun to provoke her you have a low opinion of religion nurse caroline remarked to him i suppose so he said cautiously she was a little too young and quick for him he knew well what do you suppose a drug dependency isif not a kind of religion nurse caroline asked i have no quarrel with anyone at prayer wilbur larch said prayer is personalprayer is anyones choice pray to whom or what you want its when you start making rules said wilbur larch but he felt lost he knew she could talk circles around him he admired socialism but talking to a damn socialist was like talking to any true believer he had heard her say so many times that a society that approved of making abortion illegal was a society that approved of violence against women that making abortion illegal was simply a sanctimonious selfrighteous form of violence against womenit was just a way of legalizing violence against women nurse caroline would say he had heard her say so many times that abortions were not only a personal freedom of choice but also a responsibility of the stateto provide them once the state starts providing it feels free to hand out the rules too larch blurted hastily it was a yankee thing to sayvery maine but nurse caroline smiled that led him into another of her arguments she could always trap him he was not a systems man he was just a good one in a better world she began patiently her patience with him could make larch furious no not in a better world he cried in this onein this world take this world as a given talk to me about this world but it all made him so tired it made him want a little ether the more he tried to keep up with nurse caroline the more he needed ether and the stronger he felt his need for it the more that made her right oh i cant always be right larch said tiredly yes i know nurse caroline said sympathetically its because even a good man cant always be right that we need a society that we need certain rulescall them priorities if you prefer she said you can call them whatever you want said wilbur larch testily t dont have time for philosophy or for government or for religion i dont have enough time said wilbur larch always in the background of his mind there was a newborn baby crying even when the orphanage was as silent as the few remaining abandoned buildings of st cloudseven when it was ghostly quietwilbur larch heard babies crying and they were not crying to be born he knew they were crying because they were born that summer mr rose wrote that he and the daughter might be arriving a day or so ahead of the picking crew he hoped the cider house would be ready its been a while since weve seen the daughter wally remarked in the applemart office everett taft was outside oiling wallys wheelchair for him so wally sat on the deskhis withered legs swinging limply his unused feet in a perfectly polished pair of loafers the loafers were more than fifteen years old candy was playing with the adding machine i think the daughter is about angels age she said right said homer wells and wally hit homer with a very wellthrown jabthe only sort of punch he could really throw sitting down because homer had been leaning on the desk and wally had been sitting up straight the punch caught homer completely by surprise and very solidly in the cheek the punch surprised candy so much that she pushed the adding machine off the far corner of the desk the machine crashed to the office floor when homer hit the floor he did not land quite as loudly or as deadweight as the adding machine but he landed hard he put his hand to his cheek where he would soon have some swelling and the start of a slight shiner wallycandy said tm so sick of it wally shouted its time you learned a new word homer wally said jesus wally candy said im okay homer said but he remained sitting on the office floor im sorry wally said it just gets on rny nervesyou saying right all the time and although he had not made this particular mistake for years he lifted himself off the desk with his armsit must have seemed to him that the appropriate thing to do would be to swing his legs to the floor and help homer up to his feet hed forgotten that he couldnt walk if candy had riot caught him under the arms and hugged himchest to chest wally would have fallen homer got to his feet and helped candy put wally back on the desk im sorry buddy wally said he put his head on homers shoulder homer did not say right candy went to get a piece of ice in a towel for homers face and homer said its okay wally everythings okay wally slumped a little forward and homer leaned over him their foreheads touched they maintained that position until candy returned with the ice most days for fifteen years candy and homer thought that wally knew everything that he accepted everything but that he resented not being told at the same time homer and candy imagined that it was a relief to wallythat he didnt have to admit that he knew everything what new uncomfortable position would they put him in by telling him now wasnt the main thing that angel not knownot until candy and homer told him the main thing was that angel shouldnt hear it from anyone else whatever wally knew he would never tell angel if homer was surprised he was surprised that wally had never hit him before what was that all about candy asked homer when they were alone that night by the swimming pool some kind of large whirring insect was caught in the leaf skimmer they heard its wings beating against the soggy leaves wthatever it was it grew weaker and weaker i guess it is irritating how i say right all the time homer said wally knows candy said thats what youve thought for fifteen years said homer wells you think he doesnt know candy asked i think he loves you and you love him homer said i think he knows we love angel i think wally loves angel too but do you think he knows angel is ours candy asked i dont know homer said i know that one day angel has to know hes ours i think that wally knows i love you he said and that i love you candy asked does he know that you love me sometimes homer said not very often i wasnt talking about sex candy whispered i was said homer wells they had been careful andin their opinionalmost good since wally had come home from the war homer and candy had made love only two hundred seventy timesan average of only eighteen times a year only one and a half times a month they were simply as extremely careful as they knew how it was another thing that candy had insisted homer agree to that for wallys sake and for angelsfor the sake of what candy called their familythey would never be caught they would never cause anyone even the slightest embarrassment if anyone ever saw them they would stop forever that was why they hadnt told wally why wouldnt wally accept that theyd thought he was deadnot just missingand that they had needed each other and that theyd wanted angel too they knew wally would have accepted that who couldnt accept what had happened what was happening now was what they knew wally wanted to know and they couldnt tell him they had another thing to be careful about because wally was sterile candys becoming pregnant would seem too miraculous to be believed because wallys sterility was not the result of encephalitis it would take him several years to discover that he was sterile he would remember the unclean instrumentation of his urethra but he would remember it graduallythe way he remembered the rest of burma once he learned that his epididymis was sealed for life the specificity of the various bamboo shoots came back to him sometimes it seemed to him that he could recall exactly every catheter that had ever relieved him there is no difference in the feeling of orgasm wally was fond of emphasizing this particular point to homer wells wally called it shooting homer was the only person with whom wally could joke about his condition i can still aim the gun and the gun still goes off wally said and it still goes off with a bangfor me he said its just that no one ever finds the bullet wally remembered from time to time that when one of the burmese on the sampan would instrument him for which he was always so gratefulthere was never very much bleeding even when the bamboo shoot was not exactly straight his blood seemed pale and minimal by comparison to the bloodier stains of the betel juice that everyone spat on the deck if homer wells got candy pregnant again candy made him promise thatthis timehe would give her an abortion she could not fool wally about another trip to st clouds she would not fool him she said and so this added considerationthat candy never get pregnantcontributed to the moderation of their coupling which was almost always managed under conditions harsh enough to win the approval of new englands founding fathers it still would not have won wilbur larchs approval they established no pattern of behavior that could make anyone suspicious as if everyone wasnt already suspicious regardless of how they behaved there was no one place that they met no one day no one time of day in the winter months when angelafter school would take wally for a swim in the indoor pool of a private boys academy homer and candy could manage an occasional late afternoon together but homers bed which had been olives bed which also suffered from all the masterbedroom connotations was full of conflicting emotions for them bothand the bed candy shared with wally had its own set of taboos rarely they took trips the cider house was fit to be used only in the late summer after it had been made ready for the picking crew but ever since angel had learned to drive hed been given the run of the orchardshe was allowed to drive any of the farm vehicles just so he kept off the public roads and his pudgy pal pete hyde often drove around with him homer suspected that pete and angel used the cider house to drink beer in secret whenever they could convince herb fowler to buy beer for them or that they went there for the fifteenyearold thrill of smoking cigarettes and at night trapped by their own insomnia where could candy and homer have disappeared tonow that angel was an insomniac too homer wells knew that there was no reason ever to have an accidentno reason for candy ever to get pregnant certainly not knowing what homer knewand no reason for them ever to get caught either but by being so reasonable and so discreet homer regretted the loss of the passion with which he and candy had at first collided although she insisted and he agreed he thought it was quite unnecessary for him to write to dr larch to request which he did the proper equipment with which to treat the emergency that candy feared for fifteen years homer had told her you wont get pregnant you cant do you have everything you need if you need it she always asked him yes he said hed gotten better about not saying right since wally had hit him and when the word would slip out it was often attended by an equally involuntary wince as if in anticipation of another punch as if anyone he might say the word to would feel as strongly about it as wally and might be as fast as mr rose wilbur larch had misunderstood about the instruments homer had requested for fifteen years hed misunderstood larch had sent everything promptly there were both a medium and a large vaginal speculum and an auvards weighted speculum there was a set of dilators with douglass pointsand one uterine sound one uterine biopsy curette two vulsellum forceps a set of sims uterine curettes and a rheinstaters uterine flushing curette larch sent enough dakins solution and red merthiolate and enough sterile vulval pads for homer wells to perform abortions into the next century im not going into the business homer wrote to dr larch but larch remained encouraged by the simple fact of homers possessing the necessary equipment homer wrapped the instruments in a whole bale of cotton and gauze he then put the bundle in a waterproof bag that had once contained angels diapers he stored the instruments along with the merthiolate the dakins solution and all the vulval pads in the very back of the upstairs linen closet homer kept the ether in the shed with the lawn and garden tools ether was flammable he didnt want it in the house however in the one and a half times a month that he could be with candy it jolted him to realize that in their union there was even after fifteen years a frenzy with which they clung to each other that would not have appeared pale in comparison to their first such meeting in the cider house but since melony had first introduced homer wells to sexand it had been only during that brief period of what seemed to him to be his married life with candy in st clouds that he had experienced any thing of what sex ideally isit was homers opinion that sex had little to do with love that love was much more focused and felt in moments of tenderness and of concern it had been years for example since he had seen candy asleep or had been the one to wake her years since he had watched her fall asleep and had stayed awake to watch her this tenderness he reserved for angel when angel had been smaller homer had occasionally encountered candy in the darkness of angels room and they had even shared a few evenings of that silent wondering parents engage in while watching their children sleep but homer had fallen asleep many nights in the empty twin bed beside angels bed just listening to the breathing of his son after all homer had spent his childhood trying to sleep in a room where an entire population lay breathing and was there a feeling more full of love he wondered than to wake up a child in the morning full of love and apology both homer wells concluded it was with angel that he felt love like that if candy had such moments homer imagined she had to have them with wally an orphans pleasures are compartmental in st clouds it was best to be hungry in the morning they didnt run out of pancakes there was sex which called for good weather and of course melony there were acts of wandering and destruction melony again in any weather there were solitary acts and moments of reflection which could occur only when it rained and only without melony as much as he desired a family homer wells was not trained to appreciate a familys flexible nature that julyit was one hot and lazy saturday afternoon homer was floating in the pool he had been in the orchards all morning mulching the young trees angel had been working with him and now angel was out of the pool but still dripping wet he was tossing a baseball back and forth with wally wally sat on the lawn on a slight knoll above the pool and angel stood on the deck they would throw the hardball back and forth not talking but concentrating on their throws wally would fire the ball with considerable sting for someone in a sitting position but angel had more zip on the ball the ball popped pleasantly in their big gloves candy came down to the pool from the applemart office she was wearing her work clothesjeans a khaki field shirt with oversized pockets and epaulettes work boots a boston red sox baseball cap with the visor turned backward she cared more about protecting her hair from the sun than her face because in the summer her blondness could turn whiter which she knew showed more of the gray i know the men are out of the fields at noon on saturday she said her hands on her hips but the women are working in the mart until three homer stopped floating he let his feet touch the bottom and he stood chest deep in the pool looking at candy wally looked over his shoulder at her then fired the ball to angel who fired it back please hold the ball while im trying to say something candy said wally held the ball what are you trying to say he asked i think that on saturdays as long as there are people working at the mart you should refrain from playing at the pooleveryone can hear you and i think it kind of rubs it in rubs what in angel asked that you get to play and live in the fancy house as they call it and they get to work candy said petes not working angel said pete got a ride to the beach pete hyde is a kid candy said his mother is still working well im a kid arent i angel asked playfully well i dont mean you especially candy said what about you two she asked homer and wally well im a kid too wally said throwing the ball back to angel i just play all day long anyway angel laughed and threw the ball back but homer wells glowered at candy from his chestdeep position in the pool do you see what i mean homer candy asked him homer allowed himself to sink he held his breath for a while and when he came up for air candy was going through the kitchen door the screen door banged oh come on wally called after her of course we see what you mean and that was when homer said it homer spat out some water and said to angel go tell your mother that if she changes her clothes well take her to the beach angel was halfway to the house before it registered with homer what hed said and wally said to angel tell her to change her mood too when angel went in the kitchen wally said i dont think he even noticed what you said old boy its just that she is such a mother to himi cant help thinking of her that way homer said im sure its hard wally said not to think of her any way that you want what homer asked she certainly is manipulative isnt she wally asked him homer ducked his head underwater againit was a cool place to think manipulative he said when he surfaced well someone has to know what to do wally saidsomeones got to make the decisions homer wells who felt the word right rising in him like an unstoppable bubble surfacing from the swimming pool put his hand over his mouth and looked at wally who was sitting on the knoll on the lawn his back very straight the baseball mitt in his lap the baseball held in his hand his throwing arm cocked homer wells knew that if the word had escaped him the ball would have been on its fast way to him as soon as the word was in the airand quite probably before homer could have ducked underwater again she has a point said homer wells she always does wally said and shes aging well dont you think very well homer said climbing out of the pool he buried his wet face in a towel with his eyes closed he could see the delicate latticework of wrinkles at the corners of candys eyes and the freckles on her chest where over the years shed allowed herself too much sun there were also the very few but deeper wrinkles that ran across her otherwise taut abdomen they were stretch marks homer knew he wondered if wally knew what they were from and there were the veins that had gained more prominence in the backs of candys long hands but she was still a beautiful woman when angel and candy came out of the housethey were ready to go to the beachhomer watched his son closely to see if angel had noticed that homer had referred to candy as your mother but angel was the way he always was and homer couldnt tell if angel had caught the slip homer wondered if he should tell candy that wally had caught it they took candys lemonyellow jeep candy drove wally sat up front in the comfortable seat and homer and angel shared the back all the way to the beach wally just looked out the window intently as if he were seeing the road between hearts rock and hearts haven for the first time as if thought homer wells wally had just abandoned the planeover burmaand his chute had just opened and he was searching for a spot to land that was the first time that homer knew for certain that candy was right he knows homer thought wally knows the apple mart never changed it was also a family only debra pettigrew was gone big dot taf ts kid sister had married a man from new hampshire and she came back to hearts rock only at christmas every christmas homer wells took angel to st clouds they had an early christmas breakfast with candy and wally and a lot of opening presents then they took a lot more presents to st clouds they would arrive late in the day or in the early evening and have christmas dinner with everyone how nurse angela cried nurse edna cried when they left dr larch was friendly but reserved the apple mart was nearly as constant as st cloudsin some ways the apple mart was more constant because the people didnt change and at st clouds the orphans were always changing herb fowler still went out with louise tobey who was still called squeeze louise she was almost fifty now shed never married herb shed never been asked yet she had acquired a wifes matronly charms and postures herb fowler was still a very coarse very wornout joke about the rubbers he was one of those thin gray men in his sixties with an outrageous pot belly for such a skinny fellow he carried his paunch like something stolen and badly hidden beneath his shirt and meany hyde was uniformly fat and bald and as nice as ever his wife florence and big dot taft still ruled the roost in the apple mart only momentarily sobered by grace lynchs death these two women with their thighsized upper arms still kept irene titcomb giggling and she still turned the side of her face with the burn scar away everett taft who was the mellowest foreman seemed relieved that homer did the hiring now and that the burden of hiring the extra help at harvest had been lifted off him and vernon lynchs resentment was so monumental that it didnt confine itself to mere particulars either to homers being in charge or to graces death it was just anger that possessed himseething and constant and unrestrained by the ravages of vernons sixtysomething years homer wells said that vernon lynch had a constant brain tumor it never grew it always exerted the same pressure and the same interference its just there like the weather huh ira titcomb the beekeeper kidded with homer ira was sixtyfive but he had another number marked on the trailer he used to carry his hives the number of times hed been stung by his bees only two hundred and fortyone times ira said i been keepin bees since i was nineteen he said so that amounts to only five point two stings a year pretty good huh ira asked homer right mumbled homer wells ducking the expected punch cringing in anticipation of the baseball whistling toward his face at the speed of mr roses knife work homer kept his own accounts of course the number of times hed made love with candy since wally came home from the war was written in pencil and then erased and then rewritten on the back of the photograph of wally with the crew of opportunity knocks two hundred seventyonly a few more times than ira titcomb had been stung by bees what homer didnt know was that candy also kept a recordalso written in pencil she wrote on the back of another print of the photograph of her teaching homer how to swim she kept the photograph almost casually in the bathroom she shared with wally where the photograph was always partially concealed by a box of tissues or a bottle of shampoo it was a cluttered bathroom which olive had outfitted properly beifore she died and before wally came home it had the convenient handrails wally needed to help himself on and off the toilet and in and out of the tub its your standard cripples bathroom wally would say an ape would have a good time in there theres all that stuff to swing from and once that summer returning from the beach they had stopped the car at the playground of the elementary school in hearts haven wally and angel wanted to play on the jungle gym angel was very agile on the thing and wallys arms were so developed that he could move through it with an alarmingly apelike strength and gracethe two of them hooting like monkeys at homer and candy who waited in the car our two children homer had said to the love of his life yes our family candy had said smilingwatching wally and angel climb and swing climb and swing its better for them than watching television said homer wells who would always think of wally and angel as children homer and candy shared the opinion that wally watched too much television which was a bad influence on angel who liked to watch it with him wally was so fond of television that he had even given a tv to homer to take to st clouds of course the reception was very poor up there which had perhaps improved the mccarthy hearings which had been wilbur larchs first sustained experience with television thank god it didnt come in clearly he wrote to homer nurse caroline had been in a bad mood all that year if the us army really was coddling communists as senator mccarthy claimed nurse caroline said that shed consider joining up wilbur larch straining to see senator mccarthy through the televisions snow and zigzagging lines saidhe looks like a drunk to me ill bet he dies young not young enough to suit me nurse caroline said finally they gave the television away nurse edna and mrs grogan were becoming addicted to it and larch considered that it was worse for the orphans than organized religion its better for anyone than ether wilbur nurse edna complained but larch was firm he gave the thing to the stationmaster who in larchs opinion was the perfect sort of moron for the invention it was just the right thing to occupy the mind of someone who waited all day for trains it was wilbur larch who was the first man in maine to call a television what it was an idiot box maine of courseand st clouds especiallyseemed to get everything more slowly than the rest of the country but wally loved to watch it and angel watched it with him whenever candy and homer didnt object wally argued for example that such televised events as the mccarthy hearings were educational for angel he ought to know wally said that the country is always in danger from rightwing nut cases although senator mccarthy lost the support of millions of people as a result of the hearingsand although the senate condemned him for his contemptuous conduct toward a subcommittee that had investigated his finances and for his abuse of a committee that recommended he be censured the board of trustees of st clouds had been favorably impressed by senator mccarthy mrs goodhall and dr gingrich especially were encouraged to complain about nurse carolines socialist views and involvements which they considered tinged the orphanage a shade of pink nurse carolines arrival had stolen a bit of the boards fire if mrs goodhall was at first relieved to learn that someone new had invaded st clouds she was later irritated to discover that nurse caroline approved of dr larch this led mrs goodhall to investigate nurse caroline whose nursing credentials were perfect but whose political activities gave mrs goodhall a glow of hope many times had mrs goodhall advanced her thesis to the board that dr larch was not only ninetysomething he was also a nonpractising homosexual now she warned the board that dr larch had hired a young red theyre all so old theyll be easily brainwashed mrs goodhall said dr gingrich who was increasingly fascinated with the leaps of mrs goodhalls mind was still marveling over the confusing image of a nonpractising homosexual it struck him as a brilliant accusation to make of anyone who was slightly or hugely different it was the best i rumor to start about anyone because it could never be proved or disproved dr gingrich wished hed considered the accusationjust as a means of provocationwhen hed still been practising psychiatry and now not only was dr larch old and homosexual and nonpractisinghe was also in danger of being brainwashed by a young red dr gingrich was dying to find out what dr larchs responses might be to the accusation that he was a nonpractising homosexual because dr larch was so outspoken on the issue of nurse carolines politics shes a socialist not a communist dr larch protested to the board same difference as they say in maineabout so many things the next thing you know larch complained to his nurses theyll be asking us to denounce things what would we denounce nurse edna asked worriedly lets make a list larch said the abortion laws nurse angela said at the top of the list larch agreed oh my nurse edna said republicans said wilbur larch and the board of trustees he added oh dear nurse edna said capitalism nurse caroline said theres never been any capital around here dr larch said insects and scab nurse edna said they all stared at her and maggots nurse edna added theyre what i have to spray the apple trees for insects and scab and maggots as a result wilbur larch dug out of a closet the old black leather bag hed had at the boston lyingin he took the bag to a cobbler in three mile falls who also repaired ladies handbags and put gold initials on saddles and he had the cobbler engrave on his old black bag the gold initials fsfor fuzzy stone that august of just a few days before the picking crew was expected at ocean view wilbur larch sent the doctors bag to homer wells it was the time of year every year when melony took her vacation most of the shipyard workers even the electricians took a couple of weeks in the summer and a couple of weeks around christmas but melony took a whole month during harvest time it made her feel goodor maybe young againto pick apples this year she had decided shed try working at ocean view she still hitchhiked whenever and wherever she traveled and because she wore only mens work clothes she still looked like a tramp no one would ever know that she was a shipyards skilled electrician with enough money in a savings account to buy a nice house and a couple of cars when melony arrived at the apple mart big dot taft was the first to see her big dot and florence hyde were arranging some of the display tables although the only new apples they had available were the gravensteins they had mostly jellies and jams and honey irene titcomb was working the pie ovens wally was in the office he was on the telephone and didnt see melony and she didnt see him candy was in the kitchen of the fancy house talking real estate to olives vulgar brother bucky bean bucky had bought what was left of the point of land ray kendall had owned on hearts haven harbor bucky had put a very cheap and shabby seafood restaurant thereone of maines first carhop restaurants one of those places where young girls dressed like cheerleaders bring you mostly fried and mostly tepid food which you consume in your car the food attaches itself to the cars by means of wobbly little trays that cling to the doors of the cars when the windows are rolled down homer always wanted to take wilbur larch to such a place only to hear what the old man would say larchs response homer was sure would be related to his response to television and to senator joe mccarthy bucky beans new idea was to buy the part of the orchard called cock hill and sell it in oneacre lots as summer property with a view of the ocean candy was in the process of rejecting the offer when melony arrived at the apple mart candys opinion was that oneacre lots were too small and that the unsuspecting new owners would be unprepared for the chemical spray used on the apples that would regularly float over and descend upon their property every summer also the families who bought property and built houses would doubtlessly believe it was their right to climb the fences and pick all the apples they wanted youre just like olive bucky bean complained youve got no imagination concerning the future that was when melony approached big dot taft not only because big dot appeared to be in charge but also because melony felt comfortable with big fat women big dot smiled to see how hefty melony was the two women appeared predisposed to like each other when melony spokeher voice reverberating through the nearempty stalls and surprising meany hyde and vernon lynch who were putting water in the john deeres radiator when melony tried to speak normally her voice was peculiarly deep when she tried to raise the pitch of her voice most people thought she was shouting does a guy named homer wells work here melony asked big dot he sure does big dot said cheerfully are you a pal of homers i used to be melony said i havent seen him in a while she added coylyat least coyly for melon whose love affair with lorna had made her occasionally selfconscious and shy with other women her selfconfidence around men was as steadfast as ever wheres homer florence hyde asked meany he was staring at melony hes puttin out crates in the frying pan said meany hyde something made him shiver you just come to say hello big dot asked melony whose fingersdot noticedwere instinctively opening and closing making fists and then relaxing i actually come for work melony said i done a lot of pickin homer hires the pickers big dot said i guess youre in luckyou bein old friends its too early for hirin pickers vernon lynch said something about the way melony looked at him made him not insist on that point just go tell homer theres someone to see him big dot told vernon homers the boss the boss melony said irene titcomb giggled and turned her burn scar away its actually a kind of secretwhos boss around hereirene said vernon lynch gunned the tractor so hard that an oily black smoke barked out of the exhaust pipe and washed over the women in the mart if youre gonna work here big dot told melony you might as well know it that guy drivin the tractor is the number one asshole melony shrugged theres just one she asked and big dot laughed oh my pies said irene titcomb who went running off florence hyde sized melony up in a friendly way and big dot put her meaty paw on melonys shoulder as if they were lifelong pals irene titcomb ran back to them and announced that the pies were saved so tell us how you know homer wells florence hyde said to melony from where and since when asked big dot taft from saint clouds since forever melony told them he was my guy she told the women her lips parting showing the damage done to her teeth you dont say said big dot taft homer wells and his son angel were talking about masturbationor rather homer was talking they were taking their lunch break under one of the old trees in the frying pan theyd been putting crates out in the orchards all morningtaking turns driving the tractor and unloading the crates theyd finished their sandwiches and angel had shaken up his soda and squirted his father with it and homer had tried to find a casual way to bring up the subject of masturbation candy had mentioned to homer that the evidence on angels bedsheets suggested that this might be the time for a fatherand son conversation regarding angels obviously emerging sexuality boy when i was your agein saint cloudsit was really tough to beat off with any privacy homer had begun he thought casually theyd been lying on their backs in the tall grass under the fullest tree in the frying panthe sun couldnt filter through the lush bent branches and all the heavy apples really angel said indifferently after a while yup homer said you know i was the oldest about your ageand i was supposed to be in charge of all the other kids more or less i knew they werent even old enough to have pubic hair or they didnt even know what to make of their little hardons angel laughed homer laughed too so howd you manage it angel asked his father after a while i waited until i thought they were all asleep and then i tried to keep the bed quiet homer said but youve got no idea how long it can take twelve or fifteen boys to fall asleep they both laughed some more there was one other kid who was old enough to know about it homer confided i think he was fust beginning to experiment with playing with himselfi think the first time that he actually did it he didnt have any idea what would happen and when he actually squirted when he ejaculated you knowhe thought hed hurt himself in the dark he probably thought he was bleeding this story was a complete fiction but angel wells loved it he laughed in a very worldly way which encouraged his father to go on well he was so worriedhe kept asking rne to turn on the light he said something had broken inside him homer said broken angel said and they both howled yes homer said and when i turned on the light and he got a look at himself he said oh god it went offas if he were talking about a gun and hed just shot himself with it father and son laughed over that for a while then homer said more seriously of course i tried to explain it all to him it was hard to make him understand that he hadnt done anything wrongbecause its natural its perfectly healthy and normal but these things have a way of getting distorted angel was quiet now perhaps he saw the reason for the story but just imagine me trying to explain to this kidhe was quite a bit younger than you arethat it was only natural that he would have feelings about girls and about sex long before he would have the opportunity to have anything to do with girls or to actually have sex homer added he had truly labored the point into submission and he paused to see how his son was taking it in angel who had a long stalk of grass in his mouth lay on his back staring at the sprawling trunk of the huge tree they were quiet for a while and then homer said is there anything youd like to ask meabout anything angel gave a short laugh then he paused yes angel said to his father i wonder why you dont have a girlfriend why you dont even seem interested this was not the question homer had expected following his birdsandbees invitation but after a few seconds he realized that the question should have been anticipated and that some reasonable answer was doubtlessly pressing more on angels mind than any truths regarding masturbation i had a girlfriend in saint clouds homer said she was kind of rough on me she was something of a bully older than me and at the time she was stronger than me he said laughing no kidding angel said he wasnt laughing he had rolled over on his elbows and was watching his father intently well we werent very much alike homer saidit was one of those cases of the sex happening before there was a friendship or there really being no friendship and after a short while there wasnt any more sex either after that im not sure what the relationship was it was a sort of bad way to start you mean angel asked right his father said so what happened after that angel asked i met wally and candy homer said carefully i guess i would have married candyif she hadnt married wally she was almost my girlfriend for about five minutes that was when wally was in the war when we wondered if he was still alive homer said quickly ive always been so close to wally and candy and thenonce i had youi started to feel that i already had everything i wanted angel wells rolled over on his back gazing up the trunk of the tree so you still kind of like candy he asked youre not interested in anybody else kind of said homer wells have you met anybody youre interested in he asked hoping to change the subject nobody whod be interested in me his son said i mean the girls i think about are all too old to even look at me that will change homer said poking angel in the ribs the boy doubled up his knees and rolled on his side poking back at his father pretty soon homer said the girls are going to stand in line to look at you he grabbed angel in a headlock and they started wrestling wrestling with angel was one way homer could keep in close physical contact with the boylong after angel had grown selfconscious about being hugged and kissed in public a fifteenyearold boy doesnt want his father draped all over him but wrestling was perfectly respectable that was still allowed they were wrestlingso hard and laughingand breathing so heavilythat they did not hear vernon lynch approach them hey homer vernon said sharply kicking at them as they rolled on the ground under the big treethe way he might tentatively attempt to break up a dogfight when they saw him standing over them they froze in an awkward embraceas if theyd been caught doing something they shouldnt if you quit dickin around vernon said i got a message for you for me said homer wells theres a fat woman who says she knows you shes at the mart vernon said homer smiled he knew several fat women at the mart he assumed that vernon meant big dot taft or florence hyde even squeeze louise had been putting on weight in recent years i mean a new fat woman vernon said he started walking back to his tractor she says she wants to be a picker and she asked for you she knows you homer got slowly to his feet hed rolled over a root of the big tree and the root had hurt him in the ribs also angel had stuffed grass down the back of his shirt angel said to his father oh a fat woman huh i guess you didnt tell me about the fat woman as homer unbuttoned his shirt to shake out the grass angel poked his fathers bare stomach that was when angel noticed that his father had aged he was still a trim man and strong from all the orchard work hed done but just a bit of belly rolled over the belt of his jeans and his hair tousled from the wrestling was more flecked with gray than it was with grass there was something grim around the corners of homers eyes that angel had also never noticed before pop angel asked him softly whos the woman but his father was looking at him in a panic he started buttoning his shirt askew and angel had to help him with it it cant be the bully can it angel was trying to joke with his fathertheir manner together was often full of joking but homer wouldnt speak he wouldnt even smile half a trailer of apple crates still needed to be unloaded but homer drove too fast dumping an occasional crate they had an empty trailer in no time and on the way back to the apple mart homer took the public road instead of winding through the back orchards the public road was faster although homer had told all the drivers to keep off it whenever they couldto avoid any possible accidents with the beach traffic along that road in the summers children are most impressed with the importance of a moment when they witness a parent breaking the parents own rule do you think its her angel shouted to his father he stood over his fathers shoulders his hands on the tractor seat his feet braced against the trailer hitch youve got to admit its a little exciting the boy added but homer looked grim homer parked the tractor and trailer by the storage barns next to the mart you can start putting on another load he told angel but he was not going to get rid of angel so easily the boy dogged his footsteps to the apple mart where big dot and florence and irene were surrounding the implacable and massive melony it is her isnt it angel whispered to his father hello melony said homer wells there was not a sound in the still summer air how you doin sunshine melony asked him sunshine said big dot taft even angel had to say it out loud imagine his father a sunshine but although she had waited years to see him melonys gaze was riveted not on homer wells but on angel melony could not take her eyes off the boy homer wells a pleasantlooking man in his forties did not very precisely remind melony of the homer wells she had known rather it was angel who struck melony with a force quite unexpected by her she had not anticipated being swept off her feet by the nearspitting image of the boy she had known poor angel felt a little wilted by the ruffian eye melony cast over him but he was a young gentleman and he smiled appealingly at the stranger theres no doubt about who you are melony said to the boy you look more like your father than your father big dot and the applemart ladies were hanging on her every word its nice that you see a resemblance said homer wells but my son is adopted hadnt homer wells learned anything through those years of hard knocks those years of muscle and fat and betrayal and growing decidedly older could he still not see in melonys fierce sad eyes that she possessed a quality that could never be bullshitted adopted melony said her yellowgray eyes never once leaving angel she was disappointed in her oldest friend that he should after all these years still try to deceive her that was when candywho had finally gotten rid of bucky beanstrolled into the apple mart removed a gravenstein from a basket on the first display table took a sharp bite noticed that no one seemed to be working and walked over to the small crowd since the most natural space for candy to enter this gathering was between homer and angel she stepped between them and since her mouth was quite full of the new apple she was a little embarrassed to speak to the stranger hi she managed to say to melony who recognized instantlyin candys facethose few parts of angel she had failed to locate in her memory of homer wells this is melony homer said to candy who had difficulty swallowinglong ago on the cider house roof she had heard all about melony this is missus worthington homer mumbled to melony how do you do candy managed to say missus worthington melony said her lynxlike eyes now darting from angel to candy and from angel to homer wells that was when wally wheeled himself out of the office and into the mart isnt anybody working today he asked in his friendly way when he saw there was a stranger he was polite oh hello he said hi said melony this is my husband candy said through lots of apple your husband melony said this is mister worthington mumbled homer wells everybody calls me wally wally said melony and i were in the orphanage together homer explained really wally said enthusiastically thats great he said get them to show you around show her the house too wally told homer maybe youd like to take a swim he asked melony who for once in her life did not know what to say dot wally said to big dot taft get me a count of the number of bushels of gravs we have in storage i got a phone order waiting he turned the wheelchair very smoothly and started to roll back to the office meany knows how many we got florence hyde said he was just in there then someone get meany to tell me wally said its nice to meet you he called to melony please stay for supper candy almost choked but she managed a hard swallow thank you melony called after wally he didnt need any help going in and out of the office because everett taft had years ago taken the threshold off and arranged for the screen door to swing both wayslike a saloon door wally could come and go without assistance hes the only hero here melony thought watching the door swing closed behind the wheelchair she could not control her hands she wanted to touch angel to hug himshed wanted to get her hands on homer wells for years but now she didnt know what she wanted to do to him if shed suddenly dropped to all fours or had crouched into a stance more suitable for a fight she knew that homer wells would be prepared she noticed he had no control of his hands eitherhis fingers were playing pittypat against his thighs hardest for melony was to recognize that there was no love for her in his eyes he looked like a trapped animalthere was no enthusiasm or curiosity about seeing her in any part of him she thought that if shed opened her mouth beginning with the boyhow he was clearly no orphanhomer wells would be at her throat before she cold spit out the story no one seemed to remember that melony had come among other reasonsfor a job angel said would you like to see the pool first well i dont swim melony said but it would be nice to see it she smiled at homer with such an uncharacteristic warmthwhich revealed everything about her bad teeththat homer shivered the apple from which only one uncomfortable bite had been taken hung like a lead weight at the end of candys limp arm ill show you the house candy said after angels shown you the pool she dropped the uneaten apple then laughed at herself ill show you the orchards homer mumbled you dont have to show me no orchards sunshine melony said i seen lots of orchards before oh he said sunshine candy said blankly angel poked his father in the back as they were walking toward the house and pool angel still thought that this surprise was great and unexpected fun homer turned briefly and frowned at his son which angel found all the more amusing while the boy was showing melony the swimming pooland making special note of the ramp for wallys wheelchaircandy and homer awaited her arrival in the kitchen she knows homer said to candy what candy said what does she know melony knows everything said homer wells in a trance of almost ether intensity how could she candy asked him did you tell her dont be ridiculous homer said she just knowsshe always knows dont you be ridiculous candy said crossly wallys a great swimmer angel explained to melony in the ocean he just needs to get carried out past the breakers i can carry him youre a goodlookin guy melony said to angel youre better lookin than your dad ever was angel was embarrassed he took the temperature of the pool its warm he said too bad you dont swim you could stay in the shallow end or i could teach you how to float candy taught my dad how to swim incredible melony said she walked out on the diving board and jounced a little she needed to jounce very little to make the board dip close to the water if i fell in ill bet you could save me she said to angel who couldnt tell if the big woman was being flirtatious or threateningof if she was idly fooling around that was what was exciting about her angel thought she gave him the impression thatfrom one minute to the next she might do anything i could probably save you if you were drowning angel offered cautiously but melony retreated from the end of the diving board which lent to her step the sense of springing power that one detects in the larger members of the cat family incredible she repeated her eyes trying to take in everything want to see the house now angel asked her she was making him nervous gee its some place you got melony told candy who showed her the downstairs homer showed her the upstairs in the hallway between homers and angels rooms melony whispered to him boy you really done all right for yourself howd you manage it sunshine how she feasted on him with her tawny eyes you even got a great view she pointed out sitting on the master bed and looking out the window when she asked if she could use the bathroom homer went downstairs to have a word with candy but angel was still hanging aroundstill very much enjoying himself and still curious the impact that the thuglike nature of his fathers first girlfriend had made on the boy was considerable if angel had been troubled in trying to imagine why his father chose such a solitary life the violent apparition that had presented herself today had done much to reassure him if this menacing woman had been his fathers first experience it was more understandable to angel why homer had been reluctant to repeat the relationship melony seemed to spend a long time in the bathroom and homer wells was grateful for the time he needed itto convince candy and angel to go back to work to leave him alone with melony she wants a job he told them forcefully i need to have a little time with her alone a job candy saida new horror coming into her face the thought of it made her squint her pretty eyes mirrors had never been melonys friends but the mirror in homers bathroom was especially harsh to her she went through the medicine cabinet quickly for no reason she dumped some of the pills down the toilet she began ejecting razor blades from a crude metal dispenser she emptied the dispenser before she could make herself stop she cut her finger trying to pick up one of the blades from the floor she had her finger stuck in her mouth when she first looked at herself in the mirror she held the razor blade in her other hand while she reviewed the fortysomething years she saw in her face oh she had never been attractive she had never been nice but once she had been an efficient weapon she thought now she wasnt so sure she held the razor blade against the pouch under one eye she shut that eye as if the eye itself couldnt watch what she was going to do then she did nothing after a while she put the blade down on the edge of the sink and cried later she found a cigarette lighter candy must have left it in the bathroom homer didnt smoke wally couldnt climb stairs she used the lighter to melt the handle of homers toothbrush she sunk the razor blade in the softest part and waited for the handle to harden when she clutched the brush end in her hand she had quite a nice little weapon she thought then she saw the fifteenyearold questionnaire from the st clouds board of trustees the paper was so old she had to be careful not to tear it how those questions spun her mind around she threw the toothbrush with the razor blade in the sink then she picked it up again then she put it in the medicine cabinet then she took it out she was sick once and flushed the toilet twice melony stayed upstairs in the bathroom a long time when she came downstairs she found homer waiting for her in the kitchen shed had enough time alone for her disposition to change and rechangefor her to grasp hold of her real feelings about finding homer in these surroundings and in what she presumed was a sleazy situation she might have enjoyed a few minutes of the discomfort she had caused him but by the time she came downstairs she was no longer enjoying herself and her disappointment in homer wells was even deeper than her steadfast angerit was nearly level with grief i somehow thought youd end up doin somethin better than ballin a poor cripples wife and pretendin your own child aint your own melony said to homer wells you of all peopleyou an orphan she reminded him its not quite like that he started to tell her but she shook her huge head and looked away from him i got eyes melony said i can see what its likeits like shit its ordinary middleclass shitbein unfaithful and lyin to the kids you of all people melony said she had her hands thrust in her pockets she took them out and clasped them behind her back then she jammed them back in her pockets again every time she moved her hands homer flinched homer wells had expected to be attacked by her melony was an attacker but this was not the attack he had expected he had imagined that he would one day when he saw her againbe a match for her but now he knew that he would never be a match for melony do you think i get my rocks off embarrassin you melony asked him do you think i was always lookin for youonly to give you a bad time i didnt know you were looking for me said homer wells i had you figured all wrong said melony looking at her homer wells realized that hed had melony figured all wrong too i always thought youd end up like the old man like larch homer said of course like larch melony snapped at him i figured you for thatyou know the missionary the dogooder with his nose in the air i dont see larch quite that way homer said dont be snotty to me melony cried her raw face streaked with tears youve got your nose in the airi got that part right but you aint exactly no missionary youre a creep you knocked up somebody you shouldnt a been fuckin in the first place and you couldnt even come clean about it to your own kid some missionary aint that brave in my book sunshine thats a creep melony told him then she left she never asked him about the job he never got to ask her how her life had been he went upstairs to the bathroom and threw up he filled the sink with cold water and soaked his head but the throbbing had no end one hundred seventyfive pounds of truth had struck him in the face and neck and chesthad constricted his breathing and made him ache a vomit taste was in his mouth he tried to brush his teeth but he cut himself in the hand before he saw the blade he felt nearly as paralyzed above the waist as he knew wally must feel below when he reached for the towel by the shower door he saw what else was wrong he saw what was missing from the bathroom the blank questionnaire the one hed never returned to the board of trustees of st clouds was gone it didnt take homer wells long to imagine how melony might answer some of the questions this new panic momentarily elevated him above his own selfpity he called the orphanage immediately and got nurse edna on the phone oh homer she cried so glad to hear his voice this is important he told her i saw melony oh melony nurse edna cried happily missus grogan will be thrilled melony has a copy of the questionnaire homer said please tell doctor larchi dont think this is good news that old questionnaire from the board of trustees oh dearnurse edna said of course she might never fill it out homer said but she has itit says where to send it right on the thing and i dont know where shes gone i dont know where she came from was she married nurse edna asked was she happy jesus christ thought homer wells nurse edna always shouted into the telephone she was so old that she remembered only the days of bad connections just tell doctor larch that melony has the questionnaire i thought he should know said homer wells yes yes nurse edna shouted but was she happy i dont think so homer said oh dear i thought she was going to stay for supper wally said serving the swordfish i thought she wanted a job angel said whats she been doing with herself wally asked if she wanted to pick apples candy said she cant be doing too much with herself i dont think she needed the job homer said she just wanted to look you over pop angel said and wally laughed angel had told wally that melony had been homers girlfriend which wally had thought was very funny ill bet your dad never told you about debra pettigrew kiddo wally said to angel oh come on wally candy said that wasnt serious you left something out angel said to his father angel pointed his finger at homer yes homer admitted but debra pettigrew wasnt anyone special we used to doubledate wally told angel your old man usually got the back seat come on wally candy said shed given homer and angel too many asparagus she had to take some back or there wouldnt be any for wally or herself you should have seen your old man at his first drivein wally said to angel he didnt know what driveins were for maybe angel doesnt know what theyre for candy said sharply to her husband of course i know angel said laughing of course he knows wally said also laughing only bedouins dont know said homer wells trying to go along with the fun after supper he helped candy with the dishes while angel drove around the orchards with pete hyde after supper almost every night the boys had a gamethey tried to drive through all the orchard before it was dark homer wouldnt let them drive in the orchards after darknot after the apple crates had been put out for the pickers wally liked the twilight by the swimming pool from the kitchen window homer and candy could see him sitting in the wheelchair he had tipped his head back as if he were staring at the sky but he was watching the spiral drifting of a hawk over the orchard called cock hillsome smaller birds were pestering the hawk flying dangerously close to it trying to drive it away its time to tell homer said to candy no please candy said she reached around him where he was working at the sink and dropped the broiler rack that the swordfish had been cooked on into the soapy water the rack was greasy and stuck all over with charred bits of fish but homer wells immediately pulled it out of the waterwithout letting it soak and started scrubbing it its time to tell everyone everything said homer wells no more waiting and seeing she stood behind him and put her arms around his hips she pressed her face between his shoulder blades but he did not return her embraceor even turn to face her he just kept scrubbing the broiler rack ill work it out with you any way you want to do it homer said whether you want to be with me when i tell angelwhether you want me with you when you tell wally any way you want it itll be okay he said she hugged him as hard as she could but he just kept scrubbing she buried her face between his shoulder blades and bit him in the back he had to turn toward her then he had to push her away youre going to make angel hate me candy cried angel will never hate you homer said to her to angel youve always been just what you area good mother she held the serving tongs for the asparagus and homer thought that she might attack him but she just kept wrenching the tongs open and closed in her hands wally will hate me she cried miserably youre always telling me that wally knows said homer wells wally loves you and you dont love me anymore do you candy said she started to blubber then she threw the serving tongs at homer then she clenched her fists against her thighs she bit down so hard on her lower lip that it bled when homer tried to dab at her lip with a clean dish towel she pushed him away i love you but were becoming bad people he said she stamped her foot were not bad people she cried were trying to do the right thing were trying not to hurt anybody were doing the wrong thing said homer wells its time to do everything right in a panic candy looked out the window wally was gone from his position at the far corner of the deep end of the pool well talk later she whispered to homer she grabbed an ice cube out of someones drinking glass she held the cube to her lower lip til see you by the pool we cant talk about this around the pool he told her ill meet you at the cider house she said she was looking everywhere for wally wondering what door hed come inany second thats not a good idea to meet there said homer wells just take a walk she snapped at him you walk there your way ill walk there my wayill meet you goddamn it she said she made it into the bathroom before homer heard wally at the terrace door candy was grateful for the special bathroom equipment especially the sink at wheelchair level like a sink for children in a kindergarten like the sinks at st clouds she remembered she knelt on the bathroom floor and hung her head in the sink she turned her face under a faucet the cold water was continuous against her lip how are the dishes coming wally asked homer who was still laboring over the broiler rack kind of messy tonight homer said im sorry wally said genuinely wheres candy he asked i think shes in the bathroom oh said wally he wheeled himself over to the corner of the kitchen where the serving tongs and a few broken bits of asparagus were on the floor he leaned down and picked up the tongs which he delivered to homer at the sink want to see the last couple of innings of the ball game he asked homer let candy do the fucking dishes wally wheeled himself out of the kitchen he waited in the driveway for homer wells to bring the car around they took candys jeep keeping the top down it wasnt necessary to take the wheelchair it was just a little league game and homer could drive the jeep right up to the foul line and they could watch the game from the car seats the town was thrilled to have a lighted field although it was stupid to play little league games after dark it kept the little kids up later than was necessary and the field wasnt that well lithome runs and long foul balls were always lost the tiny in fielders seemed to lose the high popups but wally loved watching the kids play when angel had played wally had never missed a game angel was too old for little league now and he found watching the games the depths of boredom the game was nearly over when they arrived which relieved homer wells who hated baseball a worried fat boy was pitching he took the longest time between pitches as if he were waiting for it to grow so dark or for the lights to fail so completely that the batter could no longer see the ball at all you know what i miss wally asked homer wells whats that said homer who dreaded the answer maybe walking homer thoughtor maybe hes going to say loving my wife thats what i miss but wally said flying i really miss flying i miss being up there wally was not watching the ball game but looking above the tall field lights at some point high in the darkness above everything he said thats how it was i never did it said homer wells my god thats true wally said genuinely shocked thats right youve never flown my god youd love it weve got to arrange that somehow and angel would really find it exciting wally added its the thing i miss most when the game was over and they were driving home wally reached across to the gearshift and popped the jeep into neutral cut the engine just a second he said to homer lets just coast homer turned off the key arid the jeep ambled silently along cut the headlights too wally said just for a second and homer wells cut the lights they could see the lights from the ocean view house ahead of them and both of them knew the road so well that they felt fairly secure just freewheeling in the darkness but then the trees rose up and cut their view of the lighted house and there was an unfamiliar dip in the road for just a moment they seemed to be completely lost possibly plunging off the road into the dark trees and homer wells turned the headlights back on that was flying wally said when they pulled into the drivewayahead of them gleaming in the headlights the wheelchair was parked in waiting when homer carried wally from the jeep to the wheelchair wally let both his arms lock around homers neck dont ever think im not grateful to you for all youve done old boy wally told homer who put him very gently in the chair come on homer said no i mean it i know how much youve done for me and i dont usually get the opportunity to say how grateful i really am wally said he kissed homer smack between the eyes then and homer straightened up clearly embarrassed youve certainly done everything for me wally homer said but wally dismissed this with a wave he was already wheeling himself toward the house its not the same old boy wally said and homer went to park the jeep that night when homer put angel to bed angel said you know you really dont have to put me to bed anymore i dont do it because i have to homer said i like to you know what i think angel said whats that asked homer who dreaded the answer i think you ought to try having a girlfriend angel said cautiously homer laughed maybe when you try having one ill try one too homer said sure we can doubledate angel said i get the back seat homer said sure id rather get to drive anyway angel said not for long you wont rather drive his father told him sure angel said laughing then he asked his father was debra pettigrew big like melony no homer said well she was on her way to being big but she wasnt that bignot when i knew her theres no way big dot tafts sister could have been small angel said well i never said she was small homer said and they both laughed it was a lighthearted enough moment for homer to lean over angel and kiss the boysmack between the eyes where wally had just kissed homer it was a good place to kiss angel in homers opinion because he liked to smell his sons hair good night i love you homer said i love you good night pop angel said but when homer was almost out of the door angel asked him whats the thing you love best you homer told his son i love you best next to me said angel wells candy and wally homer said making them as close to one word as his tongue could manage next to them angel said well doctor larchand all of them in saint clouds i guess said homer wells and whats the best thing you ever did angel asked his father i got you homer said softly next best angel said well i guess it was meeting candy and wally homer said you mean when you met them angel asked i guess so said homer wells next best angel insisted i saved a womans life once homer said doctor larch was away the woman had convulsions you told me angel said angel had never been especially interested that his father had become a highly qualified assistant to dr larch homer had never told him about the abortions what else angel asked his father tell him now thought homer wells tell him all of it but what he said to his son was nothing else really im no hero i havent done any best things or even any one best thing thats okay pop angel said cheerfully good night good night said homer wells downstairs he couldnt tell if wally and candy had gone to bed or if wally was in bed alone the bedroom door was closed and there was no light coming from the crack under the door but someone had left a light on in the kitchen and the outdoor light on the post at the head of the driveway was still on he went to the applemart office to read the mail with the light on in the office candy would know where he was and if shed already gone to the cider house he could walk there from the office it would be smart in that case to leave the office light on and not turn it out until he came back from the cider house that way if wally woke up and saw the light hed figure that homer or candy was still working in the office the package from st clouds arriving so exactly on the day of melonys visit startled homer he almost didnt want to open it the old man has probably sent me enema bags homer wells thought he was shocked to see the black leather doctors bag the leather was scuffed and soft and the brass clasp was so tarnished that its luster was as dull as the cinch buckle of an old saddle but everything that was worn and used about the bags appearance only made the gold initials that much brighter fs homer wells opened the bag and sniffed deeply inside it he was anticipating the hearty arid manly smell of old leather but mixed with the leather smell were the feminine traces of ethers tangy perfume that was when in one whiffhomer wells detected something of the identity that dr larch had fashioned for fuzzy stone doctor stone homer said aloud remembering when larch had addressed him as if he were fuzzy he didnt want to walk back to the house to put the doctors bag away but he didnt want to leave the bag in the office either when he came back to the office to turn out the light he thought he might forget the bag and the thing about a good doctors bag is that its comfortable to carry that was why he took it with him to the cider house the bag was empty of coursewhich didnt feel quite right to homerso he picked some gravensteins and a couple of early macs on his way to the cider house and put the apples in the bag naturally the apples rolled back and forth that didnt feel quite authentic doctor stone he mumbled once his head nodding as he took high steps through the tall grass candy had been waiting for him for a while long enough so her nerves were shot he thought that if it had happened the other way aroundif shed been the one to break things offhe would have been as upset as she was it was heartbreaking for him to see that she had made up one of the beds the clean linen and the blankets had already been put in the cider house in anticipation of the picking crews arrival the mattresses rolled and waiting at the opposite ends of the beds candy had made up the bed the farthest from the kitchen doorway shed brought a candle from the house and had lit itit gave the harsh barracks a softer light although candles were against the rules recently homer had found it necessary to emphasize candles on the list one of the pickers had started a small fire with one some years ago please dont smoke in bedand no candles please was the way hed written that rule the candlelight was faint it couldnt be seen from the fancy house candy had not undressed herself but she was sitting on the bedand she had brushed her hair out her hairbrush was on the apple crate that served as a night table and this commonplace article of such familiarity and domesticity gave homer wells with the black doctors bag in his hand a shiver of such magnitude that he envisioned himself as a helpless physician payinga house call to someone with not long to live im sorry he said softly to her weve tried itweve certainly triedbut it just doesnt work only the truth will work his voice was croaking at his own pomposity candy sat with her knees together and her hands in her lap she was shivering do you really think angels old enough to know all this she whispered as if the flickering room were full of sleeping apple pickers hes old enough to beat off hes old enough to know what driveins are fori think hes old enough said homer wells dont be coarse candy said im sorry he said again theres always so much to do during harvest candy said she picked at her white summery dress as if there were lint on it but it was spotlessly clean and homer wells remembered that senior worthington had this habitthat in seniors case it was a symptom of his alzheimers disease and that dr larch had even known the name for the symptom what did the neurologists call it homer tried to remember well wait and tell them after the harvest then homer said weve waited fifteen years i guess we can wait another six weeks she stretched out on her back on the thin bed as if she were a little girl waiting to be tucked in and kissed good night in a foreign country he went to the bed and sat uncomfortably on the edge of it at her waist and she put her hand on his knee he covered her hand with his hand oh homer she said but he wouldnt turn to look at her she took his hand and pulled it under her dress and made him touch her she wasnt wearing anything under the dress he didnt pull his hand away but he wouldnt allow his hand to be more than a deadweight presence against her what do you imagine will happen she asked him coollyafter she realized that his hand was dead i cant imagine anything he said wally will throw me out candy said blandly and without selfpity he wont homer said and if he did i wouldnt then youd be with me thats why he wont what will angel do candy asked what he wants homer said i imagine hell be with you when he wants and with me when he wants this part was hard to sayand harder to imagine hell hate me candy said he wont said homer wells she pushed his hand away from her and he returned the dead thing to his own lap in another moment her hand found his knee again and he held her hand lightly thereat the wrist almost as if he were taking her pulse at his feet the shabby doctors bag heavy with apples crouched like a cat drawn in upon itself and waiting in the flickering room the doctors bag looked like the only natural objectthat bag would look at home wherever anyone took it it was a bag that belonged wherever it was where will you go candy asked him after a while will i have to go anywhere he asked her i imagine so candy said homer wells was trying to imagine it all when he heard the car candy must have heard it in the same instant because she sat up and blew out the candle they sat holding each other on the bed listening to the car approach them it was an old car or else it was not very well cared for the valves were tapping and something like the tailpipe was loose and rattled the car was heavy and low they heard it scrape on the high crown of the dirt road through the orchard and the driver had to be familiar with the way through the orchard because the headlights were offthats how the car had gotten so close without their knowing it was coming candy hurried to unmake the bed in the darkness she probably wasnt refolding the blankets and the linen very neatly and homer had to help her roll up the mattress its wally candy whispered and indeed the car sounded like the cadillac which since raymond kendalls death had lost its pinpoint timing in fact homer remembered the cadillacs muffler was loose and it had a rebuilt engine which already needed a valve job and it was too heavy and lowbuilt a car for proper use on the ragged dirt roads that wound through the orchards but how could wally have managed it wondered homer wells wally would have had to crawl to the cadillac homer himself had parked it behind one of the storage barns where the road was much too rocky and broken up for the wheelchair maybe its some local kid homer whispered to candy the cider house was not unknown to a few locals the orchard roads had been lovers lanes for more than one couple the heavy car pulled right up to the cider house wall candy and homer felt the front bumper nudge against the building its wally candy whispered why would some local kid bother to park so close the motor knocked for a while after the key was turned off and then there was that ping of engine heat from the heavy car as it settled into place homer let go of candy he tripped on the doctors bag as he started for the door and candy caught hold of him pulling him back against her im not going to make him crawl in here homer said to her but candy could not make herself move out of the darkest corner of the cider house homer picked up the doctors bag and felt his way into the dark kitchen his hand groped for the light switch his hand brushing over his new list of rules he had not heard the car door open but he suddenly heard low voices he paused with his hand on the light switch oh wally this isnt fair he thought if there were voices homer knew that wally had brought angel with him that would have made it easier for wally to get to the cadillacangel could have brought the car around for him but regardless of the torment that burdened wally homer was angry at his friend for involving angel but wasnt angel involved in it anyway homer wondered now they turned the headlights onto light their way to the door it was not the way homer had imagined telling them both but what did the way matter homer wells turned on the light which momentarily blinded him he thought that he must be as lit up as a christmas tree in the cider house door and he thought wasnt it fitting that it had been the cadillac that had rescued him from st clouds and now here was the cadillacin a way come to rescue him again for here he was with the wellworn doctors bag in hand at last prepared to tell the truthready at last to take his medicine in the bright light he nervously picked the imaginary lint off his clothes he remembered what the neurologists call it carphologia he tightened his grip on dr larchs bag and peered into the darkness suddenly it was clear to him where he was going he was only what he always was an orphan whod never been adopted he had managed to steal some time away from the orphanage but st clouds had the only legitimate claim to him in his forties a man should know where he belongs dr larch began another letter to harry truman before he remembered that eisenhower had been president for a few years he had written several letters to roosevelt after roosevelt had died and hed written many more to eleanor but the roosevelts had never written back harry truman had never written back either and larch couldnt remember if hed written to mrs truman too or to trumans daughterwhichever one it was hadnt answered either he tried not to get depressed at the thought of writing to eisenhower he tried to recall how hed begun the last one hed begun dear general but after that he couldnt remember hed said something about how hed been a doctor to the troops in world war ihed tried to sneak up on his real subject a kind of flanking maneuver maybe it was time to try mrs eisenhower but when larch wrote dear mamie he felt ridiculous oh whats the use thought wilbur larch you have to be crazy to write to eisenhower about abortion he tore the letter out of the typewriter out of the blue he decided that the presidents head resembled that of a baby then he remembered that melony had the questionnaire there was no time to fool around he told nurse angela that there would be a meeting after supper after the children had been put to bed nurse angela could not recall that there had ever been a meeting at st clouds except that most uncomfortable meeting with the board of trustees she assumed that if there was going to be another meeting the board was probably involved oh dear a meeting nurse edna said she fretted all day mrs grogan was worried too she was concerned about where the meeting would take placeas if it would be possible to miss it or not find it i think we can narrow down the possibilities nurse caroline assured her all day wilbur larch worked in nurse angelas office no babies were born that day and the one woman who wanted an abortion was welcomed and made comfortable and told that she could have her abortion tomorrow wilbur larch would not leave nurse angelas office not even for lunch not even for tea and not even for the lords work he was reviewing and putting the finishing touches to the history of fuzzy stone that good doctor larch was also writing the obituary of homer wells poor homers heart the rigors ofan agricultural life and a highcholesterol dietan orphan is a meat eater an orphan is always hungry wrote wilbur larch dr stone on the other hand was not a typical orphan larch characterized fuzzy stone as lean and mean after all who among the orphans had ever dared to challenge dr larch and here was fuzzy stone threatening to turn his old mentor in not only did he dare to attack dr larchs beliefs regarding the abortions but also fuzzy had such strong views on the subject that he repeatedly threatened to expose dr larch to the board and now fuzzys zeal was fired with the selfrighteousness of a true missionary for larch knew that the safest place for dr stone to be practising medicine was where the board could never trace him fuzzy was fighting diarrhea amid the dying children of asia larch had just read an article in the lancet about diarrhea being the number one killer of kids in that part of the world homer wells who did not know that bis heart had given out had read the same article the other little details about burma and indiawhich lent such a missionary authenticity to fuzzys angry letters to wilbur larchwere things that larch remembered hearing about wallys excruciating travels there it had been an exhausting day for larch who had also writtenin other voicesto the board of trustees he would have preferred ether to supper although supper he knew would make him more stable for the meeting that his bullied staff was dreading larch read such a short passage from jane eyre that every girl in the girls division was still awake when he left them and he read such a short section of david copperfield that two of the boys complained im sorry thats all that happened to david copperfield today dr larch told them david didnt have a very big day wilbur larch had had a big day and mrs grogan and his nurses knew it he made them all meet in nurse angelas office as if he took comfort from the litter of paper and the gloomy surrounding presence of his massive a brief history of st clouds which was gathered around him he leaned on his overworked typewriter as if the machine were a podium now he said because the women were chatting now he repeated using the word like a gavel to call the meeting to order now were going to head them off at the pass nurse edna wondered if hed been sneaking down to the train station to watch the westerns on the tv with the stationmaster nurse edna did this quite often she liked roy rogers better than hopalong cassidy she wished roy wouldnt sing she preferred tom mix to them all although she loathed the lone ranger she had a soft spot in her heart for tontofor all the worlds sidekicks whom are we heading off nurse caroline asked aggressively and you dr larch said to nurse caroline pointing his finger at her youre my top gun youre the one whos going to pull the trigger you get to fire the first shot mrs grogan who feared for her own sanity feared that dr larch had finally lost his nurse angela suspected larch had been slipping for a long time nurse edna loved him so much that she couldnt judge him nurse caroline just wanted the facts okay nurse caroline said lets begin at the beginning whom do i shoot youre going to turn me in larch told her youre going to blow the whistle on meon all of us here ill do no such thing nurse caroline said very patiently he explained it to them it was so simpleto him it was simple because hed been thinking of it for years it was not simple to the rest of them and he had to take them very slowly through the steps toward their salvation they must assume that melony would respond to the questionnaire they must believe that her response would be negativenot because melony was necessarily negative as larch pointed out to mrs grogan who was ready to defend her but because melony was angry she was born angry she will always be angry and even if she means us no harm one day she will be angry enoughabout something about anythingso that she will respond to the questionnaire and shell say what she knows larch added because whatever else melony is shes no liar therefore he argued he wanted the board to hear that he was an abortionist from someone else first it was the only way they might be saved nurse caroline was the logical betrayer she was young she was relatively new she had struggled with her conscience for an acceptably short period of time and she had decided that she could remain silent no longer mrs grogan and the older nurses had been bullied into accepting a doctors authority as absolute nurse caroline would maintain that they were not to blame nurse caroline however had a challenging attitude toward the authority figures of this or of any society she would present her protest as a matter of womens rightsthat even nurses should never allow doctors to tyrannize them that when a doctor was breaking the law even if it was not a nurses role to challenge him it was her right and her moral obligation to expose him larch was sure that mrs goodhall would like that bit about moral obligationmrs goodhall doubtlessly labored under the illusion that her own moral obligations were the guiding lights of her life and dr larch felt that it was the overwhelming burden of these obligations that had made her a sour joyless woman nurse edna and nurse angela listened to larch as if they were baby birds awaiting a parents return to the nest their heads were sunk into their shoulders their faces were tilted up their mouths silently forming the words they heard larch speakin anticipation of swallowing worms mrs grogan wished that shed brought her knitting if this was what a meeting was she never wanted to attend another but nurse caroline began to see she had a basically brave and a fundamentally political conscience and once she grasped the portrait of the board as her enemy she was most attentive to her commander who had so arduously plotted the boards defeat it was a kind of revolt and nurse caroline was all for revolution also larch pointed out to her you need to win a few points with the rightwingers on the board theyve colored you pink now you color yourself christian theyre not only going to end up forgiving you theyre also going to want to promote you theyre going to want you in charge and you larch said pointing to nurse angela me said nurse angela she looked frightened but larch knew that she would be the perfect one to recommend fuzzy stone hadnt she named him and hadnt she almost dared all those times to join fuzzy in his righteous debate with dr larch because fuzzy knew them all and loved them all he knew what they needed and his beliefs regarding the abortions were so much more in sympathy with nurse angelas own beliefs they are nurse angela said but i believe in abortion of course you do larch said and if you want saint clouds to continue to offer abortions you better pretend that youre on the other side youd better all pretend what do i pretend wilbur nurse edna asked that its a great load off your consciencethat i have been caught larch told her perhaps if fuzzy stone came back nurse ednas conscience would let her sleep and mrs grogan could lighten up on the praying perhaps she would not be so driven to pray if they had that wonderfully decent dr stone around not that we dont all adore dr larch nurse angela would tell the board and not that the poor old man didnt believe in himself and in what he was doingand for whom he was doing it he was always devoted to the orphans it was just that this social problem got the best of him and of his judgment and how this issue has upset us all how it has taken its toll how indeed nurse edna thought her mouth still open her head lolling between her shouldersshe was more in love with him than ever he really was devoted to his orphans he really would do anything for them but what will happen to you wilburif we expose you nurse edna asked a slim tear making its difficult way down her wrinkled cheek im almost a hundred years old edna he said softly i suppose ill retire you wont go away will you mrs grogan asked him i wouldnt get very far if i tried he said he had been so convincing about fuzzy stonehe had presented them with such marvelous detailsthat nurse caroline was the only one to spot the problem what if homer wells wont come here and pretend to be fuzzy stone she asked dr larch homer belongs here nurse angela said by rote that homer wells belonged to st clouds was to nurse angela as obvious a fact as the weathereven if this fact to homer had been his lifes crucible but he doesnt believe in performing abortions nurse caroline reminded all the old people when did you last talk to him about it she asked larch ive talked to him j pretty recently and he believes in your right to perform themhe even sent me here to help you and he believes it should be legalto have one but he also says i that he could never personally do itto him its killing someone thats how he sees it thats what he says he has nearperfect procedure wilbur larch said tiredly when nurse caroline looked at all of them she saw them as if they were dinosaursnot just prehistoric but also almost willfully too large for the world how could the planet ever provide enough for them it was not a very socialist thought but this was the conviction with which her heart sank as she looked at them homer wells thinks its killing someone nurse caroline repeated as she spoke she felt she was personally responsible for starving the dinosaurs the old people looked gaunt and feeble to herdespite their size is the alternative just waiting and seeing nurse angela asked no one answered her o lord support us all the day long until the shadows lengthen and the evening cornes mrs grogan began softly but dr larch wouldnt hear her out whatever the alternative isif there is oneit isnt prayer he said its always been an alternative for me mrs grogan said defiantly then say it to yourself he said dr larch moved slowly in the small room he handed nurse angela the letter to the board he had written for her he handed nurse caroline her letter too just sign themhe said read them over if you want you dont know that melony will expose you mrs grogan said to him does it really matter larch asked just look at me do i have a lot of time they looked away i dont want to leave it up to melony or to old age he added or to ether he admitted which caused nurse edna to cover her face with her hands i prefer to take my chances with homer wells nurse angela and nurse caroline signed the letters several examples of the correspondence between wilbur larch and fuzzy stone were also submitted to the board of trustees nurse angela would include these in the envelope with her letter the board would understand that all the nurses and mrs grogan had discussed the matter together wilbur larch would not need ether to help him sleepnot that night mrs grogan who usually slept like a stone would be awake all night she was praying nurse edna took a long walk through the apple orchard on the hill even when they all pitched in for the harvest it was hard to keep up with the apples homer had provided nurse caroline who everyone agreed was the most alert was assigned the task of familiarizing herself with the details of the life and training of the zealous missionary dr stone if the board asked questionsand surely they wouldsomeone had to be ready with the right answers despite her youth and her energy nurse caroline was forced to take fuzzys history with her to her bed where sleep overcame her before she got to the part about the childrens diarrhea nurse angela was on duty she gave the woman who was expecting an abortion another sedative she gave a woman who was expecting a baby a glass of water she tucked one of the smaller boys back into his bedhe must have had a dream he was completely on top of his covers and his feet were on his pillow dr larch had been so tired that he had gone to bed without kissing any of the boys so nurse angela decided to do this for himand perhaps for herself when shed kissed the last boy her back was hurting her and she sat down on one of the unoccupied beds she listened to the boys breathing she tried to remember homer wells as a boy to recall the particular sound of his breathing she tried to get a picture of the postures of his style of sleep it calmed her to think of him given old age given ether given melony she too would prefer to take her chances with homer wells please come home homer nurse angela whispered please come home it was one of the few times that nurse angela fell asleep when she was on duty and the first time ever that she fell asleep in the boys sleeping room the boys were astonished to discover her with them in the morning she woke up with the boys climbing on her and she needed to busy herself to assure the younger ones that no great change in the order of their lives was being heralded by her being found asleep among them she hoped she was telling the truth a particularly small and superstitious boy did not believe her he believed in things he referred to as woods creatures which he refused to describe and he remained convinced that one of these demons had turned nurse angela into an orphan overnight when you fall asleep the bark grows over your eyes he explained to her heavens no she said yes he said and then only the trees will adopt you nonsense nurse angela told him the trees are just trees and bark cant hurt you some of the trees used to be people the little boy told her they used to be orphans no no dear no they didnt nurse angela said she made him sit on her lap although it was early in the morning she could hear the typewriter dr larch had more to say the little boy in her lap was trembling he was listening to the typewriter too do you hear that he whispered to nurse angela the typewriter she asked him the what he said thats a typewriter she said but he shook his head no its the bark he said it gets in at night and in the morning although her back still hurt her nurse angela carried the boy all the way to her office she showed him the noise hed hearddr larch at the typewriterbut she wondered if larch in the state he was in when he was writing was not even more terrifying to the little boy than his imagined tree people you see nurse angela asked the boy its a typewriter and thats doctor larch larch scowled at them irritated by the interruption he grumbled something they couldnt hear you know doctor larch dont you nurse angela asked the little boy but the child had no doubt he threw his arms around nurse angelas neck then tentatively he let go with one hand with which he pointed at the typewriter and at dr larch woods creature he whispered this time the letter was written in larchs most didactic voice he wrote to homer wells he told homer everything he didnt beg he did not characterize fuzzy stone as having an altogether more important job than homer had he did not point out that both homer wells and fuzzy stone were imposters larch said that he was sure angel would accept his fathers sacrificehell value your need to be of use was how wilbur larch put it young people find risktaking admirable they find it heroic larch argued if abortions were legal you could refusein fact given your beliefs you should refuse but as long as theyre against the law how can you refuse how can you allow yourself a choice in the matter when there are so many who havent the freedom to make the choice themselves the women have no choice i know you know thats not right but how can youyou of all people knowing what you know how can you feel free to choose not to help people who are not free to get other help you have to help them because you know how think about whos going to help them if you refuse wilbur larch was so tired that if he had allowed himself to go to sleep the bark would have grown over his eyes here is the trap you are in dr larch wrote to homer and its not my trapi havent trapped you because abortions are illegal women who need and want them have no choice in the matter and youbecause you know how to perform themhave no choice either what has been violated here is your freedom of choice and every womans freedom of choice too if abortion was legal a woman would have a choiceand so would you you could feel free not to do it because someone else would but the way it is youre trapped women are trapped women are victims and so are you you are my work of art wilbur larch told homer wells everything else has just been a job i dont know if youve got a work of art in you larch concluded in his letter to homer but i know what your job is and you know what it is too youre the doctor it went out in the same mail with the letters and the evidence to the board of trustees nurse caroline not only carried the letters to the railroad station she also watched the mail being put on the train when the train left she observed a particularly lostlooking young woman whod gotten off the train on the wrong side of the tracks the stationmaster who was watching television was not available to give directions nurse caroline asked the woozy young woman if she was looking for the orphanage which she was unable to speak or else choosing not to she simply nodded and accompanied nurse caroline up the hill dr larch was just finishing with the abortion patient whod arrived the day before and had spent the night im sorry you had to wait i hope you were comfortable he told her yes everyones been very nice she said even the children seem nicewhat i saw of themdr larch was puzzled by the even why wouldnt the children seem nice then he wondered if he had any idea how everything at st clouds might appear to others he was on his way to the dispensary to rest for a while when nurse caroline introduced him to the next patient the young woman still wouldnt speak which made it hard for larch to trust her youre sure youre pregnant he asked her she nodded second month larch guessed the woman shook her head she held up three fingers third month larch said but the woman shrugged she held up four fingers maybe four larch asked she held up five fingers youre five months pregnant larch asked now she held up six fingers maybe six larch asked the woman shrugged are you sure youre pregnant larch began again yes she nodded you have no idea how long youve been pregnant larch asked her while nurse caroline helped the woman undress she was so undernourished both larch and nurse caroline saw instantly that she was more pregnant than they first supposed after larch examined the woman who was extremely jumpy to his touch and feverish he said you might be seven months you might be too late larch pointed out to her the woman shook her head larch wanted to look more closely but nurse caroline was having difficulty getting the woman to assume the proper position and while nurse caroline took the womans temperature all larch could do was press his hand against the womans abdomen which was extremely tensewhenever larch barely touched her she would hold her breath have you tried to do something to yourself he asked the woman gently have you hurt yourself the woman froze why wont you talk larch asked the woman shook her head are you mute she shook her head have you been injured larch asked the woman shrugged finally nurse caroline made the woman comfortable in the stirrups im going to look inside you now larch explained this is a speculum he said holding up the instrument it may feel cold but it doesnt hurt the woman shook her head no really im not going to hurt youim just going to look her temperature is a hundred and four nurse caroline whispered to dr larch this will be more comfortable for you if you can relax larch said he could feel the womans resistance to the speculum as he bent to look the young woman spoke to him it wasnt me she said i would never have put all that inside of me all that larch said all what suddenly he didnt want to look before he knew it wasnt me she repeated i would never do such a thing dr larch bent so close to the speculum he had to hold his breath the smell of sepsis and putrefaction was strong enough to gag him if he breathed or swallowed and the familiar fiery colors of her infection even clouded by her discharge were dazzling enough to blind the intrepid or the untrained but wilbur larch started to breathe again slowly and regularly it was the only way to keep a steady hand he just kept looking and marveling at the young womans inflamed tissue it looked hot enough to burn the world now do you see homer larch asked himself through the speculum he felt her heat against his eye breaking the rules melony who had hitchhiked from bath to ocean view hitchhiked back on the same day shed lost her zeal for apple picking she retreated to plan another vacationor to plead to return to work melony went to the pizza bar where everyone went and she was looking so woebegone that lorna left the lout she was with at the bar and sat down in the booth opposite her i guess you found him lorna said hes changed melony said she told lorna the story it wasnt for me that i felt so bad melony said i mean i didnt really expect him to run away with me or anythin like that it was just himhe was really better than that i thought he was someone i thought was gonna be a hero i guess thats dumb but thats what he looked likelike he had hero stuff in him he seemed so much better than everybody else but he was just a fake you dont know everythin thats happened to him lorna said philosophically she didnt know homer wells but she had sympathy for sexual entanglements her present sexual entanglement grew impatient at the bar where hed been waiting for her he was a bum named bob and he came over to melonys booth where the two women were holding hands i guess whats the matter with homer is that hes a man melony observed i only ever met one who didnt let his dong run his lifeshe meant dr larchand he was an ether addict are you with me or have you gone back to her bob asked lorna but he stared at melony we was just talkin she was just bein an old friend melony said i thought you was on vacation bob said to melony why dontcha go somewhere where theres cannibals go beat off in a bucket melony told him go try to fill a pail go drip in a teaspoon she told him and bob twisted her arm too sharplyhe broke it then bob broke her nose against the formica tabletop before some of the shipyard workers pulled him off her lorna took her friend to the hospital and when theyd put the cast on her arm and had set her nosethey set it almost straightlorna took melony back to the womenonly boardinghouse where they both agreed they belonged together lorna moved her things back in while melony was convalescing the swelling in her face went down after a few days and her eyes turned from black to a purplishgreen to yellow in about a week the thing is melony said with her sore face against lornas tummy with lornas hand stroking her hair when he was a boy he had that kind of bravery thats really specialno one could make him just go along with what was goin on and now look at him bangin a cripples wife lyin to his own son its disgusting lorna agreed why not forget it when melony didnt answer her lorna asked how come youre not gonna press charges against bob suppose it works melony asked pardon me lorna said suppose they really put bob in jail or send him off somewheres melony asked then when im all better i wont be able to find him oh lorna said homer wells did not recognize the voice that spoke to him from the headlights glare what you got in the bag homer asked mr rose it had been a long drive from the carolinas and mr roses old car creaked and popped with heat and with apparent pain its nice of you workin all night to make my house nice for me homer he said when he stepped in front of his headlights his black face was still hard to see but homer recognized the way he movedso slowly but with a felt potential for moving so fast mister rose homer said mistuh wells said mr rose smiling they shook hands while homers heart calmed down candy was still hiding in the cider house and mr rose sensed that homer wasnt alone he was peering through the lit kitchen looking into the shadowy bunkroom when candy walked guiltily into the light missus worthington said mr rose mister rose candy said smiling shaking his hand were just in time she said to homer poking him we just this minute got all the bed linen ready she told mr rose but mr rose observed that there was no car or truckthat they had walked to the cider house had they carried all the blankets and sheets just this minute we got it all folded up i mean candy said homer wells thought that mr rose might have seen the light in the applemart office when he drove by we were working late in the office homer said and we remembered the linen was down hereall in a heap mr rose nodded and smiled then the baby cried candy jumped i wrote to wally bout bringin the daughter mr rose explained as a young woman about angels age walked into the light with a baby in her arms i havent seen you since you were a little girlhomer wells told the young woman who looked at him blankly it must have been an exhausting trip with a small child my daughter mr rose said in introduction and her daughter he added missus worthington said mr rose introducing her and homer wells candy candy said shaking the young womans hand homer homer said he couldnt remember the daughters name and so he asked her she looked a little startled and looked at her fatheras if for clarification or advice rose mr rose said everyone laughedthe daughter too the baby stopped crying and looked with wonder at the laughter no i mean your first name said homer wells rose is her first name said mr rose you already heard it rose rose candy asked the daughter smiled she didnt look very sure rose rose said mr rose proudly everyone laughed again the baby was cheering up and candy played with the little girls fingers and whats her name candy asked rose rose this time the young woman answered for herself she dont have a name yet rose rose replied were still thinking it out said mr rose what a good idea said homer wells who knew that too many names were given frivolously or just temporarilyor in the cases of john wilbur and wilbur walsh that they were repeated without imagination the cider house isnt really set up for a baby candy said to rose rose if youd like to come up to the house i may have some baby things you could usetheres even a playpen in the attic isnt there homer we dont need nothin mr rose said pleasantly maybe shell look another day i could sleep a whole day i think said rose rose prettily if youd like candy told her i could look after the baby for youso you could sleep we dont need nothin mr rose repeated not today anyway he said smiling want a hand unpacking homer asked him not today anyway mr rose said whats in the bag homer he asked when theyd all said good night and homer and candy were leaving apples homer admitted that would be strange said mr rose homer unzipped the bag and showed him the apples you the apple doctor mr rose asked him homer almost said right he knows homer said to candy as they were walking back to the office of course he knows candy said but whats it matter if were stopping i guess it doesnt matter homer said since you were prepared to tell wally and angel she said i guess it wont be that hard to really do it after the harvest he said he took her hand but when they came near the apple mart and the office light they dropped hands and walked their separate ways whats the bag for candy asked him before she kissed him good night its for me said homer wells i think its for me he fell asleep marveling at what seemed to him to be the extreme control mr rose had of his worldhe even controlled the speed at which his daughters daughter would be named not to mention probably the name itself homer woke up near dawn and took a fountain pen from his night table and used it to write with a heavy finality over the penciled number on the back of the photograph of the crew of opportunity knocks with the dark ink he followed the outline of the pencil this permanency was reassuringas if ink as on a contract was more binding than pencil he couldnt have known that candy was also awake her stomach was upset and she was looking for some medicine in her and wallys bathroom she also found it necessary to address the subject of the two hundred seventy times she and homer had made love together since wally had come home from the war but candy honored the finality of this number with less significance than homer honored it instead of writing over the number in ink candy used her eraser to remove the evidence from the back of the photograph of her teaching homer how to swim then her stomach calmed and she was able to sleep it astonished her how completely relaxed she was at the prospect that after the harvest her life as shed grown used to it would be over homer wells didnt try to go back to sleep he knew his history on the subject of sleep he knew there was no fighting history he read an article in the new england journal of medicine about antibiotic therapy hed followed for many years the uses of penicillin and streptomycin he was less familiar with aureomycin and terramycin but he thought that antibiotics were easy to figure out he read about the limited usage of neomycin he made note of the fact that achromycin and tetracycline were the same he wrote erythromycin in the margin of the article several times until he was sure he knew how to spell it dr larch had taught him that method of familiarizing himself with something new erythrmycin wrote homer wellsthe apple doctor as mr rose had called him he wrote that in the margin too the apple doctor and just before he got out of bed he wrote a bedouin again in the morning candy sent angel to the cider house to inquire if rose rose needed anything for the baby and that was when angel fell in love he was shy with girls his own age boys his own age and a little older always teased him about his name he thought he was the only angel in maine he was even shy in advance of meeting girls anticipating when he would have to tell them his name in hearts rock and hearts haven the prettier more confident girls in his class ignored him they were interested in the older boys the girls who appeared to like him were plain sullen gossips who most enjoyed talking to other girls like themselves about themselves or about which boys had said what to whom every time angel spoke to a girl he knew his remarks were relayed that evening over the telephone to every other neglected girl in his class the following morning they would all smirk at himas if hed said the same foolish thing to each of them and so he learned to keep quiet he watched the older girls in school he approved of the ones who did the least amount of talking to their girlfriends they struck him as more mature by which he meant that they were actually doing things they would not want their girlfriends to know in girls angels age looked forward to dating boys angels ageas in other timeslooked forward to doing things mr roses daughter was not only the most exotic young woman angel had ever seen if she had a daughter she must also have done things it was cold and damp in the cider house in the mornings when angel arrived there rose rose was outside in the sun washing baby rose in a bucket the baby was splashing and rose rose was talking to her daughter she didnt hear angel walking up to her perhaps since angel had been brought up more by his father than by his motherangel was predisposed to be attracted to a madonna scene rose rose was only a few years older than angelshe was so young that her maternity was startling when she was with her baby her gestures and her expressions were womanly and she had a full womanly figure she was a little taller than angel she had a round boyish face good morning angel said startling baby rose in the bucket rose rose wrapped her daughter in a towel and stood up you must be angel she said shyly she had a fine scar that sliced across the flange of one nostril and her upper lip it made a nick in her gum which angel could see when she parted her lips later he would see that the knife had stopped at the eyetooth and removed it which accounted for her only partial smile she would explain to him that the wound had killed the root of the tooth and that the tooth had fallen out later he was so smitten when he first met her that even the scar was beautiful to him it was her only apparent flaw i wondered if i could help you get anything for the baby angel said she seem to be teethin rose rose reported on her daughter she kind of cranky today mr rose came out of the cider house when he saw angel he waved and smiled and then he walked over and put his arm around the boy how you doin he asked you still growin i think i used to carry him on top of my head he told rose rose he used to grab them apples i couldnt reach mr rose explained punching angel affectionately on the arm im counting on growing a little more angel saidfor rose roses benefit he wouldnt want her to think he had stopped growing he wanted her to know that he would be taller than she one day he wished hed worn a shirt it was not that he wasnt muscular it was somehow more grownup to wear a shirt then he imagined that she might approve of his summer tan and so he relaxed about not having a shirt he put his hands in the hip pockets of his jeans and he wished hed worn his baseball cap it was a boston red sox cap and he had to get hold of it first thing in the morning if he was going to wear itotherwise candy would wear it they had been meaning to buy another baseball cap for two summers now candy owed him one because shed admitted to tearing one of the sweat holes in the cap by poking a pencil through it candy worked as a checker during the harvest and she needed her pencil this would be the second harvest that angel would be a checker and the second summer that he got to drive one of the tractors that hauled the apples out of the orchards when angel told his father that rose roses baby was teething homer knew what to do he sent angel with wally to town to buy some pacifiers and then he sent angel back to the cider house with a package of pacifiers and a fifth of bourbon wally drank a very little bourbon from time to time and the bottle was threequarters full homer showed angel how to dab whiskey on baby roses gums it numbs the gums angel explained to rose rose he dipped his pinky finger in the whiskey then he stuck his finger in baby roses tiny mouth at first he was afraid hed gag the baby girl whose eyes instantly grew large and watery at the bourbon fumes but then baby rose went to work on angels finger so ferociously that when he removed his finger to apply more bourbon the baby cried to have the finger back you gonna make her drunk rose rose warned no i wont angel assured her im just putting her gums to sleep rose rose examined the pacifiers they were rubber nipples like the nipple on a babys bottle but without the hole and attached to a babyblue plastic ring that was too big to swallow the problem with using a regular bottle nipple angel wells explained was that the baby would keep sucking in air through the hole and the air would give the baby burping fits or a gassy stomach how come you know so much rose rose asked angel smiling how old are you im almost sixteen angel said how old are you bout your age she told him in the afternoon when angel came back to the cider house to see how the teething was going baby rose was not the only rose with a pacifier stuck in her mouth mr rose was sitting on the cider house roof and angel could seefrom a considerable distance because of the unreal babyblue hue of the plastic ringthat he had a pacifier in his mouth are you teething too angel called up to him mr rose removed the pacifier from his mouth slowlythe way he did everything im cuttin out smokin said mr rose you got a nipple in your mouth all day who needs a cigarette he stuck the pacifier back in his mouth and grinned at angel broadly in the cider house baby rose had fallen asleep with a pacifier in her mouth and angel surprised rose rose as she was washing her hair she was bent over the kitchen sink with her back to him he couldnt see her breasts although she was bare from the waist up is that you she asked ambiguously keeping her back turned to himbut not jumping to cover herself sorry angel said stepping back outside i should have knocked then she jumped and covered herself her hair still soapy she must have thought it was her father i was checking on how the teething was going angel explained it goin fine rose rose said you a good doctor you my hero for today she was smiling her partial smile a stream of bright suds from the shampoo ran around her neck and down her chest over her arms which shed folded with a towel across her unseen breasts angel wells smiling backed so far away from the cider house door that he bumped into the old car which was parked close enough against the cider house to appear to be helping hold the building up he heard a tiny pebble come rolling down the cider house roof but when it hit him on the headeven though hed had time to steal the baseball cap away from candy and now wore it at a casual angle with the visor shading his foreheadthe pebble hurt he looked up at mr rose who had rolled the pebble in his directiona perfect shot gotcha mr rose said smiling but it was rose rose whod really gotten him angel staggered back to the apple mart and into the fancy house as if hed been struck by a boulder who was the babys father angel wells wondered and where was he and where was mrs rose were mr rose and his daughter all alone angel went to his room and began to compose a list of namesgirls names he took some names he liked out of the dictionary and then he added other names that the dictionary had overlooked how else do you impress a girl who hasnt been able to think of a name for her baby angel would have been a blessing to st clouds where the practice of naming the babies was a little worn out although nurse caroline had contributed her youthful energy to the nearly constant occasion her rather political choices had been met with some resistance she was fond of karl for marx and eugene for debs but everyone balked at friedrich for engels and so she had been reduced to fred which she didnt like nurse angela also complained about norman for thomas to her it was a name like wilbur but it was difficult to know if angel wells could have kept his passion for names intact when the task was almost a daily business finding a name for rose roses daughter was a devotion quite unexpectedyet it was typical of a boys first love abby thought angel wells alberta alexandra amanda amelia antoinette audrey aurora aurora rose angel said aloud god no he said plunging into the alphabet the scar on the face of the young woman he loved was so extremely thin so very fineangel imagined that if he could kiss that scar he could make it disappear and he began working his way through the bs bathsheba beatrice bernice bianca bridget dr larch was facing a different problem the dead patient had come to st clouds without a scrap of identification shed brought only her burning infection her overpowering discharge her dead but uriexpelled fetus and several of the instruments sheor someone else had put into herself in order to expel the fetus her punctured uterus her unstoppable fever her acute peritonitis she reached dr larch too late for him to save her yet larch blamed himself she was alive when she got here larch told nurse caroline im supposed to be a doctor then be one nurse caroline said and stop being maudlin im too old larch said someone younger someone quicker might have saved her if thats what you think maybe you are too old nurse caroline told him youre not seeing things as they are as they are said wilbur larch who closed himself off in the dispensary hed never been good about losing patients but this one nurse caroline knew was quite lost when shed arrived if he can hold himself responsible for a case like that nurse caroline told nurse angela then i think he ought to be replacedhe is too old nurse angela agreed its not that hes incompetent but once he starts thinking hes incompetent hes had it nurse edna would not contribute to this conversation she went and stood outside the dispensary door where she repeated and repeated youre not too old youre not incompetent youre not too old but wilbur larch could not hear her he was under ether and he was traveling he was far away in burmawhich he saw almost as clearly as wally ever saw it although larch even with ethers assistance could never have imagined such heat the shade that he saw under the peepul trees was deceiving it was not really cool therenot at that time of the day that the burmese refer to as when feet are silent larch was observing the missionary dr stone making his rounds even the noonday heat would not keep fuzzy stone from saving the diarrhetic children wally could have informed larchs dream with some better detail how slippery the bamboo leaves were when one was trying to walk uphillfor example how the sleeping mats were always damp with sweat how it seemed to wally to be a country of submagistrates corrupted by the britisheither into being like the british or into being consumed by their hatred of the british wally had once been carried across a plateau shot through with sprouting weeds and befouled with pigshit on it was a former tennis court built by someone british the net was now a magistrates hammock the court itself because of the high fence that enclosed it was a good place to keep the pigs the fence which had once kept tennis balls from being lost in the jungle now made it more difficult for the leopards to kill the pigs at that way station wally would remember the magistrate himself had instrumented his urinary tract for him a kindly roundfaced man with patient steady hands he had used a long silver swizzle sticksomething else the british had left behind although the magistrates english was poor wally had made him understand what the swizzle stick was for british ees crazy the burmese gentleman had said to wally yes yes i think so wally had agreed he hadnt known many british but some of them seemed crazy to him and so it seemed a small thing to agree toand wally thought it was wise to agree with whoever it was who held the catheter the silver swizzle stick was too inflexible for a proper catheter and the top of the thing was adorned with a kind of heraldic shield queen victorias stern face presiding in this one case she was observing a use of the instrument she adorned that might have shocked her only british ees crazy enough to make something to stir a drink the magistrate said chuckling he lubricated the catheter with his own saliva through his tears wally tried to laugh and in the rounds that dr stone was making wouldnt many of the diarrhetic children suffer urinary retention wouldnt dr stone have to relieve their little distended bladders and wouldnt his catheter be proper and his method of instrumentation sound in wilbur larchs eyes which were over burma dr stone would be perfectfuzzy stone wouldnt lose a single patient nurse caroline understanding that the coincidence of the woman dying without a name would not sit well alongside the recent evidence submitted to the board of trustees knew it was time for her to write to homer wells while dr larch rested in the dispensary nurse caroline worked with a vengeance over the typewriter in nurse angelas office dont be a hypocrite she began i hope you recall how vehemently you were always telling me to leave cape kenneth that my services were more needed here and you were right and do you think your services arent needed here or that they arent needed right now do you think the apples cant grow without you just who do you think the boards going to replace him with if you dont step forward one of the usual cowards who does what hes told one of your typically careful mousy medical mena little lawabiding citizen who will be of absolutely no use she mailed that letter at the same time she alerted the stationmaster that there was a body at the orphanage various authorities would have to be sent for it had been a long time since the stationmaster had seen bodies at the orphanage but he would never forget the bodies he had seennot his predecessor after the sternum shears had opened him up and certainly never the fetal autopsy from three mile falls a body the stationmaster asked he gripped the sides of the small table where the constant television revealed to him its blurry fadein and fadeout imagesany of which the stationmaster found preferable to the more vivid picture of those longago bodies someone who didnt want to have a baby nurse caroline told him she butchered herself trying to get the baby out she got to us too late for us to be able to do anything about it unanswering and never taking his eyes from the snowy zigzagging figures on the tv screen the stationmaster clung to the table as if it were an altar and the television was his godat least he knew he would never see on that television anything resembling what nurse caroline described and so the stationmaster continued to watch the tv instead of looking into nurse carolines eyes carmen cecelia charity claudia constance cookie cordelia angel wells cocked the red sox cap at the correct angle although it was cool in the early morning he elected not to wear a shirt dagmar he thought daisy dolores dotty where are you going in my hat candy asked him she was picking up the breakfast dishes its my hat angel said going out the door love is blind wally said pushing his wheelchair away from the table does he mean me or angel candy wondered homer and wally were worried about angels puppylike infatuation with rose rose but that is all it seemed to candy puppylike candy knew that rose rose had too much experience to allow angel to get carried away that wasnt the point homer had said candy imagined that rose rose had more experience in her little finger than but that wasnt the point either wally had said well i hope the point isnt that shes colored candy had said the point is mister rose wally had said the word right had been almost visible on homers lips men want to control everything candy thought homer wells was in the applemart office in the mail there was a letter for him from dr larch but homer didnt look through the mail that was wallys job besides the picking crew had arrived the harvest would be starting as soon as homer could get it organized he looked out the office window and saw his son not wearing any shirt and talking to big dot taft he opened the screen door and hollered at angel hey its cold this morningput on a shirt angel was already walking toward the barns beyond the apple mart i got to warm up the tractor he told his father warm yourself up first homer told him but the boy was already very warm this morning edith angel asked himself ernestine esmeralda eve he thought he bumped into vernon lynch who was glowering over a cup of hot coffee watch where yer goin vernon told angel faith angel said to him felicia francesca frederica asshole said vernon lynch no thats you big dot taft told him youre the asshole vernon god i love the harvest wally said cruising around the kitchen table while candy washed the dishes its my favorite time mine too candy said smiling what she thought was i have six more weeks to live black pan the cook was back candy had to hurry she had to take black pan shopping a man named peaches had picked for them before but not for several years he was called peaches because his beard never grew also a man named muddy was back no one had seen muddy for years hed been badly knifed at the cider house one night and homer had driven him to the hospital in cape kenneth muddy had taken one hundred twentythree stitches homer wells thought hed looked like a kind of experimental sausage the man whod cut him was long gone that was one of mr roses rules homer guessed it might have been the dominant rule of the cider house no hurting each other you cut people to scare them to show them whos boss but you dont send people to the hospital then the law comes and everyone at the cider house feels small the man whod cut muddy hadnt been thinking about the community he was really tryin to cut my ass off man muddy had said as if he were surprised he was an amateur mr rose had said he long gone now anyway the rest of the crew except for mr roses daughter hadnt been to ocean view before mr rose arranged with angel how rose rose and her daughter would spend the day she gonna ride around with you and help you out mr rose told angel she can sit on the fender or stand behind the seat she can ride on the trailer before it full sureangel said if she need to take the baby back to the cider house she can walk mr rose said she dont need no special favors no angel said it surprised him that mr rose would speak this way about his daughter when she was standing beside him looking a little embarrassed baby rosepacifier in placerode her hip sometimes black pan can look after the baby mr rose said and rose rose nodded candy said shed look after her too angel offered no need botherin missus worthington said mr rose and rose rose shook her head when angel drove the tractor he always stood up if he sat down without a cushion on the seat and he thought a cushion was for an old man with piles he couldnt quite see the radiator cap he was afraid that if he sat down the engine might overheat and the radiator would boil over without his noticing it but most of all it looked better to drive a tractor standing up he was glad he was driving the international harvester years ago raymond kendall had built a swivel for the seat he could let rose rose sit downwith or without baby rose in her lapand he could stand a little to one side of the swivel seat and operate the tractor without awkwardness there was a foot clutch a foot brake and a hand throttle the emergency hand brake was next to rose roses hip the gearshift was by her knee why you wear that old baseball cap she asked him you got nice eyes but nobody see em you got nice hair but nobody see it and you got one pale forehead cause the sun cant find your face if you didnt wear th at dumb cap your face would be as brown as your body this implied to angel of course that rose rose liked his body being brown didnt care for his forehead being pale and had manageddespite the hatto notice his eyes and hair and to like them too after filling the trailer with his first load of apples angel took a long drink from a water jug in the orchard twisting the baseball cap backward on his head as he drank then he wore it that way the way a catcher wears a baseball capor the way candy wore it with the visor tipped over her hair and the back of her neck somehow it looked better that way on candy when rose rose saw angel wearing the cap that way she said now you look real stupid like you got a ball for a head the next day angel let candy wear the cap baby rose was sucking the pacifier like a threehorsepower pump and rose rose smiled at angel wheres that nice hat she asked him i lost it he lied too bad she said it was nice i thought you didnt like that hat he said i didnt like that hat on you said rose rose the next day he brought the hat and put it on her head as soon as she was settled into the tractor seat rose rose looked awfully pleased she wore the hat the same way angel had worn itlow over her eyes baby rose looked crosseyed at the visor you lost it and then you found it huh rose rose asked angel right angel said you better be careful she told him you dont wanna get involved with me but angel was flattered and encouraged that shed even noticed his interestespecially since he was unsure how to express his interest how old are you he asked her casually later that day bout your age angel was all she said baby rose slumped against her breast a floppybrimmed white sailors hat protected the baby from the sun but under the brim of the hat the little girl looked glassyeyed and exhausted from chomping on the pacifier all day i dont believe you can still be teethin rose rose said to her daughter she took hold of the babyblue plastic ring and pulled the pacifier out of the little girls mouth it made a pop like a wine cork which startled baby rose you becomin an addict rose rose said but when baby rose started to cry her mother put the nipple back how do you like the name gabriella angel asked rose rose i never heard it before she said how about ginger angel asked that somethin you eat rose rose said gloria angel asked that nice said rose rose who it for your baby angel said ive been thinking of names for your baby rose rose raised the visor of the boston red sox cap and looked into angels eyes why you thinkin of that she asked him just to be of help he said awkwardly just to help you decide decide rose rose asked to help you make up your mind said angel wells the picker named peaches was almost as fast as mr rose he was emptying his canvas bag into a bushel crate and he interrupted rose rose and angel you countin me angel peaches asked i got you angel said sometimes angel examined the fruit if he didnt know the picker very wellto make sure they werent bruising it if they were bruising it or if there were other signs that they were picking too fast angel wouldnt give them the top price for a bushel but angel knew peaches was a good picker so he just put a number on the list without getting off the tractor to look at the apples aint you a checker peaches asked angel then sure i got you angel said to him dont you wanna check me then better make sure i aint pickin pears or somethin peaches said grinning angel went to look over the apples and that was when peaches said to him you dont wanna go into the knife business with mistuh rose then he walked away with his bag and his ladder before angel could say anything about his appleswhich were of course perfect back on the tractor angel got up his nerve are you still married to the babys father he asked rose rose wasnt ever married she said are you still together you and the father angel asked baby got no father rose rose said i wasnt ever together i like hazel and heather angel said after a while theyre both names of plants so they sort of go with rose i dont have no plant i got a little girl rose rose said smiling i also like the name hope angel said hope aint no name rose rose said iris is nice angel said but its sort of cute because its another flower then theres isadora whew said rose rose no name is better than some well how about plain old jane asked angel wells who was getting frustrated jennifer jessica jewel jill joyce julia justine she touched him she just put her hand on his hip which nearly caused him to jackknife the trailer and spill the load dont never stop she told him i never knew there was so many names go on she said her hand urging himit was just a little shove before she returned her hand to her lap where baby rose sat mesmerized by the tractors motion and the tractors sound katherine kathleen kirsten kitty angel wells began go on rose rose said her hand grazing his hip again laura laurie laverne lavinia leah that means weary he told her leslie libby loretta lucy mabel that means lovable he told her malvina that means smooth snow he explained i never livin where they got snow rose rose said maria angel said marigold thats another flower mavis that means a thrush its a kind of bird he said dont tell me what they mean rose rose instructed him melissa mercedes angel said aint that a car rose rose asked him its a good car angel said a german car very expensive i seen one i think rose rose said they got a funny bulls eye on the hood their insignia said angel wells their what she asked its a kind of bulls eye youre right angel said say it again rose rose said mercedes he said it for rich people aint it rose rose asked the car he asked the name or the car she said well angel said its an expensive car but the name means our lady of mercies well fuck it then rose rose said didnt i tell you not to tell me what the names mean sorry he said how come you never wear a shirt she asked him aint you never cold angel shrugged you can go on with them names any time she told him after the first four or five days of the harvest the wind shifted there was a strong sea breeze off the atlantic and the early mornings were especially cold angel wore a tshirt and a sweat shirt over that one morning when it was so cold that rose rose had left baby rose with candy angel saw that she was shivering and he gave her his sweat shirt she wore it all day she was still wearing it when angel went to help with the cider press that night and for a while they sat on the cider house roof together black pan sat up there with them and he told them about the time when thered been an army installation on the coast which they could see at night it was a secret weapon he told them and your father black pan told angel he made up a name for ithe had us all shittin our pants we was so scared it was a kind of wheel he told usit sent people to the moon or somethin it was a ferris wheel said mr rose in the darkness it was just a ferris wheel yeah that what it was black pan said i seen one once but it was somethin else that used to be out there mr rose said dreamily it got used in the war yeah black pan said they shot it at somebody watching the lights on the coast rose rose announced im movin to the city maybe when you old enough said mr rose maybe atlanta she said i been in atlanta she told angelat night too that was charlestonmr rose said unless you was in atlanta some other time you said it was atlanta she told him maybe i said it was atlanta said mr rose but it was charleston black pan laughed rose rose forgot to give the sweat shirt back but in the morning when it was still cold she was wearing one of mr roses old sweaters and she handed the sweat shirt back to angel got my own clothes sort of this mornin she told angel the baseball cap pulled lower than usual over her eyes black pan was watching after baby rose and it took angel a while to see that rose rose had a black eyea white person doesnt spot a black eye on a black person right away but she had a good one he say it okay if i wear your hat but for you to wear your own shirt rose rose told angel i told you she said you dont wanna get involved with me after the picking that day angel went to the cider house to have a word with mr rose angel told mr rose that he meant nothing improper by letting rose rose wear his sweat shirt angel added that he really liked mr roses daughter and so forth angel got pretty worked up about it although mr rose remained a calm calm man of course angel and all the rest of them had seen mr rose peel and core an apple in about three or four secondsit was widely presumed that mr rose could bleed a man in half a minute he could have made the whole mess of a human being look like a series of slight shaving injuries who told you i beat my daughter angel mr rose asked gently rose rose had told angel of course but now angel saw the trap he was only making trouble for her mr rose would never allow himself to have any trouble with angel mr rose knew the rules they were the real cider house rules they were the pickers rules i just thought you had hit her angel said backing off not me said mr rose before he put the tractor away angel spoke with rose rose he told her that if she was frightened about staying in the cider house she could always stay with himthat he had an extra bed in his room or that he could vacate his room and make it into a guest room for her and her baby a guest room rose rose said she laughed she told him he was the nicest man she ever knew she had such a languid manner like someone who was used to sleeping while standing upher heavy limbs as relaxed as if she were underwater she had a lazy body yet in her presence angel felt the same potential for lightningquick movement that surrounded her father as intimately as someones scent rose rose gave angel the shivers at supper his father asked him how are you getting along with mister rose im more curious how youre getting along with rose rose candy said how hes getting along with the girl is his own business wally said right said homer wells and wally let it pass how youre getting along with mister rose is our business angel wally said because we love you homer said mister rose wont hurt me angel told them of course he wont candy said mister rose does what he wants wally said hes got his own rules said homer wells he beats his daughter angel told them he hit her once anyway dont make that your business angel wally told the boy thats right homer said ill make it my business candy told them if hes beating that girl hell hear about it from me no he wont wally said better not homer told her dont tell me what to do she told them and they were quiet they both knew better than to try to tell candy what to do are you sure its true angel candy asked almost sure the boy said ninetynine percent make it a hundred percent angel before you say its true his father told him right angel said as he got up from the table and cleared his dishes good thing we got all that straightened out wally said when angel was in the kitchen good thing were all such experts at the truth he said as candy got up from the table to clear the dishes homer wells kept sitting where he was the next morning angel learned that rose rose had never been in the oceanthat shed picked citrus in florida and peaches in georgia and shed driven up the east coast all the way to maine but shed never stuck so much as her toe in the atlantic shed never even felt the sand thats crazy said angel wells well go to the beach some sunday what for she said you think i gonna look better with a tan what would i go to a beach for to swim angel said the ocean the salt water i dont know how to swim rose rose informed him oh he said well you dont have to swim to enjoy the ocean you dont have to go in over your head i dont have no bathin suit she said oh angel said well i can get you one ill bet one of candys would fit you rose rose looked only mildly surprised any bathing suit of candys would be a tight fit for their lunch break after rose rose had seen how baby rose was getting along with black pan angel drove her to the babytree orchard near cock hill they were not picking the baby trees so there was no one there you could barely see the ocean you could see the unnatural end of the horizon how the sky inexplicably flattened outand by standing on the tractor they could distinguish the different tones of blue and gray where the sky bled into the sea rose rose remained unimpressed come on angel said to her you got to let me take you to see it he tugged her by one armjust fooling around just an affectionate gesturebut she suddenly cried out his hand grazed the small of her back as she turned away from him and when he looked at his hand he saw her blood its my period she lied even a fifteenyearold boy knows that the blood from anyones period isnt usually found on the back after they kissed for a while she showed him some of the woundsnot the ones on the backs of her legs and not the ones on her rump he had to take her word for those she showed him only the cuts on her backthey were fine threadthin razorlike cuts they were extremely deliberate very careful cuts that would heal completely in a day or two they were slightly deeper than scratches they were not intended to leave scars i told you she said to angel but she still kissed him hard you shouldnt have no business with me i aint really available angel agreed not to bring up the matter of the cuts with mr rose that would only make things worserose rose convinced him of that and if angel wanted to take her to the beachsomehow some sunday they should both be as nice to mr rose as they could manage the man named muddy whod been reassembled with one hundred twentythree stitches had said it the best what he said once was if old rose had cut me i wouldnt of needed one stitch i would of bled a pint an hour or even slower and when it was finally all over it would have looked like someone hadnt used anythin on me except a stiff toothbrush when angel was putting the tractor away on saturday it was muddy instead of peaches who spoke to him you dont wanna get involved with rose rose you know the knife business aint your business angel muddy said putting his arm around the boy and giving him a squeeze muddy liked angel he remembered fondly how angels father had gotten him to cape kenneth hospital in time when there was another night pressing angel sat with rose rose on the cider house roof and told her all about the ocean the strange tiredness one feels at the edge of the sea the weight in the air the haze in the middle of a summer day the way the surf softens sharp things he told her the whole familiar story how we love to love things for other people how we love to have other people love things through our eyes but angel could not keep secret what he imagined was the enormity of mr roses wrongdoing he told the whole story to his father and to candy and wally he cut her he deliberately cut her wally asked angel no doubt about it angel said im a hundred percent sure i cant imagine how he could do that to his own daughter said homer wells i cant believe how were always saying how wonderful it is that mister rose is so in charge of everything candy said shivering we have to do something about this we do wally asked well we cant do nothing candy told him people do wally said if you speak to him hell hurt her more angel told them and shell know i told you i want your advice i dont want you to do anything i wasnt thinking of speaking to him candy said angrily i was thinking of speaking to the police you cant carve up your own children but will it help herif he gets in trouble homer asked precisely wally said were not helping her by going to the police or by speaking to him angel said theres always waiting and seeing said homer wells for fifteen years candy had learned to ignore this i could ask her to stay with us angel suggested that would get her away from him i mean she could just stay here even after the harvest but what would she do candy asked there arent any jobs around said homer wells not after the harvest its one thing having them pick wally said carefully i mean everyone accepts them but theyre only migrantstheyre transients theyre supposed to move on i dont think that a colored woman with an illegitimate child is going to be made to feel all that welcome in maine not if shes staying candy was cross she said wally in all the years ive been here ive never heard anyone call them niggers or say anything bad about them this isnt the south she added proudly come on wally said it only isnt the south because they dont live here let one of them actually try to live here and see what they call her i dont believe thatcandy said then youre dumb wally said isnt she old boy wally asked homer but homer wells was watching angel are you in love with rose rose angel homer asked his son yes angel said and i think she likes meat least a little he cleared his own dishes and went upstairs to his room hes in love with the girl homer said to candy and wally as plain as the nose on your face old boy wally said where have you been he wheeled himself out on the terrace and took a few turns around the swimming pool what do you think of that homer asked candy angels in love i hope it makes him more sympathetic to us candy told him thats what i think about it but homer wells was thinking about mr rose how far would he go what were his rules when wally wheeled himself back into the house he told homer that there was some mail for him in the applemart office i keep meaning to bring it up to the house wally told him but i keep forgetting it just keep forgetting it homer advised him its the harvest since i dont have time to answer any mail i might as well not read it nurse carolines letter had also arrived it was waiting for him with dr larchs letter and with a letter from melony melony had returned the questionnaire to homer she hadnt filled it out shed just been curious and shed wanted to look it over more closely after shed read it a few times she could tellby the nature of the questionsthat the board of trustees were in her opinion a collection of the usual assholes the guys in suits she called them dont you hate men in suits shed asked lorna come on lorna had told her you just hate men all men men in suits especially melony had said across the questionnaire which would never be filled out melony had written a brief message to homer wells dear sunshine i thought you was going to be a hero my mistake sorry for hard time love melony homer wells would read that much later that same night when he couldnt sleep as usual and he decided to get up and read his mail he would read dr larchs letter and nurse carolines too and any doubts that were remaining about the doctors bag with the initials fs engraved in gold had disappeared with the darkness just before dawn homer saw no reason to add irony to their predicament he decided not to send melonys response to the questionnaire to larch or to nurse carolinehow would it help them to know that they had turned themselves in when they might have gone on for another few years he sent a single short note addressed to them both the note was simple and mathematical i am not a doctor i believe the fetus has a soul im sorry sorry said wilbur larch when nurse caroline read him the note he says hes sorry of course he isnt a doctor nurse angela admitted thered always be something hed think he didnt know hed always be thinking he was going to make an amateur mistake thats why hed be a good doctor said dr larch doctors who think they know everything are the ones who make the most amateur mistakes thats how a good doctor should be thinking that theres always something he doesnt know that he can always kill someone were in for it now nurse edna said he believes the fetus has a soul does he larch asked fine he believes that a creature that lives like a fish has a souland what sort of soul does he believe those of us walking around have he should believe in what he can see if hes going to play god and tell us whos got a soul he should take care of the souls who can talk back to him he was ranting then nurse angela said so we wait and see not me said wilbur larch homer can wait and see he said but not me he sat at the typewriter in nurse angelas office he wrote this simple mathematical note to homer wells you know everything i know plus what youve taught yourself youre a better doctor than i amand you know it you think what i do is playing god but you presume you know what god wants do you think thats not playing god i am not sorrynot for anything ive done one abortion i did not perform is the only one im sorry for im not even sorry that i love you then dr larch walked to the railroad station and waited for the train he wanted to see the note sent on its way later the stationmaster whom larch rarely acknowledged admitted he was surprised that larch spoke to him but because larch spoke after the train had gone the stationmaster thought that larch might have been addressing the departed train goodbye dr larch said he walked back up the hill to the orphanage mrs grogan asked him if he wanted some tea but dr larch told her that he felt too tired for tea he wanted to lie down nurse caroline and nurse edna were picking apples and larch went a little way up the hill to speak to them youre too old to pick apples edna larch told her let caroline and the children do it he then walked a short distance with nurse caroline back toward the orphanage if i had to be anything he told her id probably be a socialist but i dont want to be anything then he went into the dispensary and closed the door despite the harvest weather it was still warm enough to have the window open during the day he closed the window too it was a new full can of ether perhaps he jabbed the safety pin too roughly into the can or else he wiggled it around too impatiently the ether dripped onto the face mask more freely than usual his hand kept slipping off the cone before he could get enough to satisfy himself he turned a little toward the wall that way the edge of the windowsill maintained contact with the mask over his mouth and nose after his fingers relaxed their grip there was just enough pressure from the windowsill to hold the cone in place this time he traveled to paris how lively it was there at the end of world war i the young doctor was constantly embraced by the natives he remembered sitting with an american soldieran amputeein a cafe all the patrons bought them cognac the soldier put out his cigar in a snifter of cognac that he couldnt finish not if he intended to stand on his crutches with his one legand wilbur larch breathed deeply of that aroma that was how paris smelledlike cognac and ash that and like perfume larch had walked the soldier homehed been a good doctor even there even then he was a third crutch to the drunken man he was the mans missing leg that was when the woman had accosted them she was a whore quite clearly and she was quite young and quite pregnant larch who didnt understand french very well assumed that she wanted an abortion he was trying to tell her that she was too late that shed have to go through with having this baby when he suddenly understood that she was asking only what a whore is usually asking plaisir damourshe asked them the amputated soldier was passing out in larchs arms it was to larch alone that the woman was offering the pleasure of love non merci wilbur larch mumbled but the soldier collapsed larch needed the pregnant prostitute to help carry him when they delivered the soldier to his room the woman renewed her offer to wilbur larch he had to hold her at arms length to keep her away from himand still she would slip through his grasp and push her firm belly into him plaisir d amour she said non non he told her he had to wave his arms to keep her away one hand swinging back and forth beside the bed knocked over the ether can with the loose pin slowly the puddle developed on the linoleum floor it spread under the bed and all around him the strength of the fumes overpowered himthe woman in paris had smelled very strongly too her perfume was strong and stronger still was the effluvia of her trade by the time larch moved his face away from the windowsill and the cone fell he was already gagging princes of maine he tried to call for them but he didnt make a sound kings of new england he thought he was summoning them but no one could hear him and the french woman lay down beside him and snuggled her heavy belly against him she hugged him so tightly that he couldnt breathe and her flavorful tangy aroma made the tears run down his cheeks he thought he was vomiting he was plaisir damour she whispered oui merci he said giving in to her out merci the cause of death would be respiratory failure due to aspiration of vomit which would lead to cardiac arrest the board of trusteesin light of the evidence submitted against himwould privately call it a suicide the man was about to be disgraced they told themselves but those who knew him and understood his ether habit would say that it was the kind of accident a tired man would have certainly mrs grogan knewand nurse angela and nurse edna and nurse caroline knew toothat he was not a man about to be disgraced rather he was a man about to be no longer of use and a man of use wilbur larch had thought was all that he was born to be nurse edna who for some time would remain almost speechless found his body the dispensary door was not a perfect seal and she thought that the odor was especially strong and that dr larch had been in there longer than usual mrs grogan who hoped hed gone to a better world read in the voice of a troubled thrush a quavering passage of jane eyre to the girls division an orphan loves and needs routine the women reminded each other nurse caroline who was tough as nails and found dickens a sentimental bore had a firm grasp of the language she read aloud an almost hearty passage of david copper field to the boys division but she found herself broken by the prospect of the expected benediction it was nurse angela who said it all according to the rules let us be happy for doctor larch she said to the attentive children doctor larch has found a family good night doctor larch nurse angela said good night doctor larch the children called good night wilbur nurse edna managed to say while nurse angela summoned her strength for the usual refrain and nurse caroline who hoped the evening wind would dry her tears marched down the hill to the railroad stationonce again to inform the frightened stationmaster that there was a body in st clouds that sunday at ocean view was an indian summer day and homer wells was fishing not real fishing homer was trying to find out more about the relationship between mr rose and his daughter the two men sat on the cider house rooffor the most part they werent talking not talking too much homer assumed was the only way to go fishing with mr rose below them angel was trying to teach rose rose how to ride a bicycle homer had offered to drive rose rose and angel to the beach and to drive back and pick them up at some designated hour but it mattered to angel that he and rose rose were independentto be driven to the beach only emphasized that he was still waiting to be old enough to get his drivers license the beach was too far to walk to and homer wouldnt allow angel to hitchhike but it was only a four or fivemile ride on a bike and the road was mostly flat mr rose observed the lesson placidly but homer grew anxious for rose rose to succeed on the bicycle he knew how much preparation had gone into the proposed triphow angel had fussed over both his own and candys bicycles and how angel had discussed with candy which of candys bathing suits would be the most suitable for rose rose together they had chosen an emerald green oneit had one pink spiraled barberpole stripe and candy was sure the suit would fit rose rose better than it fit her it had always been too loose in the bust and in the hips for candy its the kind of thing youre supposed to learn when youre a little kid i guess homer wells observed of the bicycle lesson angel would run alongside the wobbly bicycle which rose rose struggled to ride after the bike was moving at a comfortable speed angel would release his hold on it rose rose would either not pedalhugging the bike until it simply ran out of speed and topipledor else she would pedal furiously but without guidance she seemed unable to balance the bicycle and pedal it at the same time and her hands appeared frozen on the handlebars for her to balance and pedal and steer simultaneously looked increasingly like a distant miracle can you ride one mr rose asked homer i never tried said homer wells id probably have a little trouble he admitted it looked easy enough to him there were no bicycles at the orphanage the children might have used them to ride away the only bicycle in st clouds was the stationmasters and he rarely rode it i never tried either said mr rose he watched his daughter careen over a slight hill she shrieked the bike jackknifed she felland angel wells ran to her to help her up a line of men sat with their backs against the cider house wall some were drinking coffee some were drinking beer but all of them watched the bicycle lesson some were encouragingand as vocal as local fans rooting at a sporting eventand others watched the procedure as placidly as mr rose it had been going on for a while and the applause what thered been of itgrew spottier and more random dont give up angel said to rose rose i not givin up rose rose said did i say i was givin up you remember what you said to me once about the rules homer asked mr rose what rules mr rose asked you know those rules i put up every year in the cider house homer said and you mentioned that you had other rulesyour own rules for living here yeah those rules said mr rose i thought you meant that your rules were about not hurting each otheri thought they were about being careful homer said sort of like my rules too i guess say what you mean homer said mr rose is someone getting hurt homer asked i mean this yearis there some kind of trouble rose rose was up on the bicycle her look was grim both she and angel were sweating it appeared to homer that rose rose was jouncing on the seat too hard almost intentionally hurting herself or else she was treating herself so roughly in order to give herself the intensity she needed to master the machine she wobbled off a knoll out of sight behind some apple trees and angel sprinted after her why dont they just walk the picker named peaches asked they coulda been there by now why dont someone take em in some car another man asked they wanna do it they own way muddy said there was a little laughter about that show some respect said mr rose homer thought mr rose was speaking to him but he was speaking to the men who stopped laughing pretty soon that bicycle gonna break mr rose said to homer rose rose was wearing a pair of blue jeans some heavy work shoes and a white tshirt because she was sweating the outline and the colors of the emeraldgreen and pink bathing suit were visible through her shirt imagine her learnin to swim said mr rose homer wells felt bad for angel but another subject weighed more heavily on his mind about someone being hurt homer said about the rules mr rose reached into his pocket slowly and homer half expected to see the knife but it was not the knife that mr rose removed from his pocket and very gently placed in homers handit was the burneddown nub of a candle it was what was left of the candle candy had lit for their lovemaking in the cider house in her panicwhen she thought it was wally who had caught them thereshe had forgotten it homer closed his fingers around the candle and mr rose patted his hand that gainst the rules aint it mr rose asked homer black pan was baking corn bread and the smell rose from the cider house and hung deliriously over the roof which was warming in the latemorning sun pretty soon it would be uncomfortably hot on the roof aint that bread ready to eat yet peaches hollered into the kitchen no it aint black pan said from inside the cider house and pipe down or you wake the baby shit peaches said black pan came outside and kicked peachesnot terribly hardwhere he was leaning against the cider house wall when that bread ready you wont call it shit will you black pan asked him i wasnt callin nothin shit mani was just sayin it peaches said just pipe down black pan said he observed the bicycle lesson how it comin with that he asked they tryin hard muddy said they inventin a new sport peaches said and everyone laughed show some respect said mr rose and everyone piped down black pan went back inside the cider house what you bet he burns the bread peaches asked quietly if he burns it it cause he took the time to kick your ass muddy told him the bicycle was broken either the rear wheel wouldnt turn or else the chain was jammed in the wheel theres another bicycle angel told rose rose you try that one while i fix this one but while he fixed candys bicycle rose rose had to suffer with a boys bicycle so that in addition to her troubles she slipped and hurt her crotch against the crossbar homer was actually worried about how hard a fall she had and he asked her if she was all right it just like a cramp she called to him but she remained bent over until angel managed to get candys bicycle running again it looks hopeless homer confided to mr rose what about them rules mr rose asked him homer put the candle in his pocket he and mr rose regarded each otherit was almost a contest the way they looked at each other im worried about your daughter said homer wells after a while together they watched rose rose fall off the bicycle again dont worry about her said mr rose she looks unhappy sometimes homer said she aint unhappy mr rose said are you worried about her homer asked him once you start worryin you can worry bout anybody cant you said mr rose it appeared to homer wells that her fall against the crossbar was still giving rose rose some pain because she stood for a while with her hands on her knees and her head down as if her stomach hurt her each time she fell off the bicycle homer and mr rose missed the moment when she gave up they just noticed that she was running off in the direction of the orchard called frying pan and that angel was running after her both bicycles were left behind thats too bad homer said they would have had a good time at the beach maybe i can convince them to let me drive them there leave em alone said mr rose the way homer heard it it was more of a command than a suggestion they dont have to go to no beach mr rose said more mildly they just young they not sure how to have a good time he said just think what might happen at the beach they might get drowned or some people might not like seein a white boy with a colored girland they both in bathin suits it better they dont go nowhere mr rose concluded that was the end of that subject because then mr rose asked are you happy homer am i happy said homer wells why you repeat every single thing mr rose asked him i dont know homer said im happy sometimes he said cautiously that good said mr rose and mistuh and missus worthingtonare they happy i think theyre pretty happy most of the time homer told him that good said mr rose peaches whod had a few beers approached angels bicycle warily as if the machine were dangerous even when it was lying on the ground careful it dont bite you muddy warned him peaches mounted the bike and grinned at the men how do it start he asked them and they all laughed muddy got up from against the wall and went over to candys bicycle i have you a race he said to peaches yeah said black pan in the cider house door we see which one of you falls down first mine aint got no middle muddy observed of candys bike that make it go faster peaches said he tried to move angels bike forward as if his feet were paddles you aint ridin that thing you fuckin it one of the men said and everyone laughed black pan ran up behind peaches and started pushing him faster cut that shit out peaches cried but black pan got the bike rolling so fast that he couldnt keep up with it i cant be in no race if someone dont push me too muddy said and two of the men got him rolling faster than peaches who had disappeared over a hill into the next field from which the men could hear him screaming holy shit said muddy when he was under way he pedaled so hard that the front wheel rose off the ground and then the bicycle rode right out from under him the men were howling now and black pan picked up muddys fallen bicycle he was the next to try it you gonna try it too mr rose asked homer as long as angel and candy werent around to watch him homer thought he would sure homer said im next he yelled at black pan who was balancing the bicycle in place his feet slipping off the pedals he fell over on his side before he could get moving that was no real turn black pan said i get another try are you going to try it homer asked mr rose not me said mr rose the babys cryin someone said go pick her up said someone else ill take care of that said mr rose to all of them ill watch the babyyou all play peaches appeared over the hill he was walking the bicycle beside him and he was limping it hit a tree he explained it went right at the tree like the tree was its enemy you supposed to steer it muddy told him it steer itself peaches said it dont listen to me homer supported black pan while the cook mounted candys bike a second time here we go black pan said with determination but he kept one arm wrapped around homers neck he had only one hand on the handlebars and he wasnt pedaling youve got to pedal it to make it go homer told him you got to push me first black pan said somethin burning someone shouted oh shit my corn bread black pan said he lunged to one side his arm still around homers neck so that homer fell over with himon top of the bicycle i told you he was gonna burn that bread peaches told muddy give me that bike muddy said taking angels bike away from peaches two of the men were giving homer a push i got it i got it homer told them so they let go but he didnt have it he veered sharply in one direction then he veered back toward the men who had to run out of his way then he jackknifed the bike and went tumbling one waythe bike went another everyone was laughing now peaches looked at homer wells lying on the ground sometimes it dont help if you white peaches told homer and everyone howled it help if you white most of the time said mr rose he stood in the cider house door the smoke from the burning corn bread billowing behind him his daughters daughter in his armsthe pacifier a seemingly permanent fixture in her mouth and after mr rose had spoken he stuck a pacifier in his mouth too in the heart of the valley that was at the bottom of frying pan where the ocean might be a hundred miles away and no breath from the sea ever reached rose rose was stretched out in the dark grass under a northern spy that no one had picked yet angel wells was stretched out beside her she let her arm loll on his waist he ran his finger very lightly over her face following the line of her scar down her nose to her lip when he got to her lip she held his hand still and kissed his finger she had taken off the work shoes and the blue jeans but she kept candys bathing suit and the tshirt on wouldnt of had no fun at no beach anyway she said well go another day angel said we wont go nowhere she said they kissed each other for a while then rose rose said tell me bout it again angel wells began to describe the ocean but she interrupted him no not that partshe said i dont carebout no ocean tell me bout the other partwhere we all livin together in the same house you and me and my baby and your father and mistuh and missus worthington rose rose said that the part that get to me she said smiling and he began again about how it was possible he was sure that his father and wally and candy wouldnt object you all crazy she told angel but go on she said there was plenty of room angel assured her aint nobody gonna mind bout the baby she asked him she shut her eyes with her eyes shut she could see what angel was describing a little better that was when angel wells became a fiction writer whether he knew it or not thats when he learned how to make the makebelieve matter to him more than real life mattered to him thats when he learned how to paint a picture that was not real and never would be real but in order to be believed at alleven on a sunny indian summer dayit had to be better made and seem more real than real it had to sound at least possible angel talked all day he just went on and on and on he would be a novelist before nightfall in his story rose rose and everyone else got along famously no one objected to anything anyone else did all of it as they say in maine worked out sometimes rose rose cried a little more often they just kissed only a few times did she interrupt him usually because she wanted him to repeat something that had seemed especially unlikely to her hold on a minute shed say to angel better go over that again cause i must be slow in the late afternoon the mosquitoes began to bother them and it crossed angels mind how some evening rose rose could ask wally to tell her what the rice paddy mosquitoes were like an ocean view mosquito isnt anything compared to a japanese b mosquito wally would have told her but angel didnt get to tell rose rose this part of the fantasy she was starting to stand up when an apparent cramp or the pain from her fall against the bicycles crossbar dropped her to her knees as if shed been kicked and angel caught her around her shoulders you hurt yourself on the bicycle didnt you he asked her i was tryin to she said then what he asked her i was tryinto hurt myself rose rose told him but i dont think i hurt myself enough enough for what he asked to lose the baby she told him youre pregnant angel asked her again she said again and again i guess she said somebody must want me to keep havin babies who angel asked her never mind she told him someone whos not here he asked oh he here rose rose said but never mind the father is here angel asked the father of this one yeah he here she said patting her flat stomach who is he angel asked never mind who he is she told angel tell me that part againonly better make it two babies now they me and you and everybody else and two babies she said wont we all have fun angel looked as if shed slapped him rose rose kissed him and hugged himand she changed her tone of voice you see she whispered to him holding him tight we wouldnt of had no fun at no beach angel do you want the baby he asked her i want the one i got she told him i dont want this other one she struck herself as hard as she could when she said other she bent herself over again shed knocked the wind out of herself she lay in the grass in what angel could not help observing was a fetal position you wanna love me or help me she asked him both he said miserably aint no such thing as both she said if you smart you just stick with helpin methat easier you can stay with me angel beganagain dont tell me no more bout that rose rose said angrily dont tell me no more names for my baby either just plain help me she said how angel asked anything he told her just get me an abortion rose rose said i dont live round here i dont know nobody to ask and i got no money angel thought that the money hed been saving to buy his first car would probably be enough money for an abortionhe had saved about five hundred dollarsbut the problem was that the money was in a savings account the trustees of which were his father and candy angel couldnt take any money out without their signatures and when angel called herb fowler at home the news regarding the abortionist was typically vague theres some old fart named hood who does em herb told angel hes a retired doctor from cape kenneth but he does the business in his summer house over on drinkwater lucky for you its still almost summer i heard he does em in the summer house even if its the middle of the winter do you know what it costs angel asked herb a lot herb said but it dont cost as much as a baby thanks herb angel said congratulations herb fowler told the boy i didnt know your pecker was long enough its long enough angel said bravely but when angel looked in the phone book there was no dr hood among the many hoods in that part of maine and herb fowler didnt know the mans first name angel knew he couldnt call everyone named hood and ask each time if this was the abortionist angel also knew hed have to speak to candy and his father in order to get the money and so he didnt delay in telling them the whole story god what a good boy angel is wally would say later he never tries to keep anything from anybody he just comes right out with itno matter what it is she wouldnt tell you who the father is homer wells asked angel no she wouldnt angel said maybe muddy wally said probably peaches candy said whats it matter if she doesnt want to say who the father is the main thing is she doesnt want the baby said homer wells the main thing is to get her an abortion wally and candy were quiet they wouldnt question homers authority on this subject the problem is how do we know which hood to call when the phone book doesnt say which one is the doctor angel asked i know which one it is homer said and hes not a doctor herb said he was a retired doctor angel said hes a retired biology teacher said homer wells who knew exactly which mr hood it was homer also remembered that mr hood had once confused a rabbits uteri with a sheeps he wondered how many uteri mr hood imagined women had and would he be more careful if he knew a woman had only one a biology teacher angel asked not a very good one either homer said herb fowler has never known shit about anything wally said the thought of what mr hood might not know gave homer wells the shivers shes not going anywhere near mister hood homer said youll have to take her to saint clouds he told angel but i dont think she wants to have the baby angel said and if she had it i dont think shed want to leave it in the orphanage angel homer said she doesnt have to have a baby in saint clouds she can have an abortion there wally moved the wheelchair back and forth candy said i had an abortion there once angel you did angel said at the time wally told the boy we thought wed always be able to have another baby it was before wally was hurtbefore the war candy began doctor larch does it angel asked his father right said homer wells he was thinking that he should put angel and rose rose on a train to st clouds as soon as possible with all the evidence that had been submitted to the board of trustees homer didnt know how much more time dr larch would have to practise ill call doctor larch right now homer said well put you and rose rose on the next train or i could drive them in the cadillac wally said its too far for you to drive wally homer told him baby rose can stay here with me candy said they decided that it would be best if candy went to the cider house and brought rose rose and her baby back to the house mr rose might give rose rose an argument if angel showed up at night wanting rose rose and the baby to go off with him he wont argue with me candy said ill just say ive found a lot of old baby clothes and that rose rose and i are going to dress up the baby in everything that fits her at night wally said for christs sake mister rose isnt a fool i dont care if he believes me candy said i just want to get the girl and her baby out of there is there that much of a rush wally asked yes im afraid there is said homer wells he had not told candy or wally about dr larchs desire to replace himself or what revelations and fictions had been delivered to the board an orphan learns to keep things to himself an orphan holds things in what comes out of orphans comes out of them slowly when homer called st clouds he got nurse caroline in their shock in their grief in their mourning for dr larch they had determined that nurse caroline had the sturdiest voice over the phone and they had all been trying to familiarize themselves with dr larchs plans for everything and with his massive a brief history of st clouds as well every time the phone rang they assumed it was someone from the board of trustees caroline said homer wells its homer let me speak with the old man nurse angela and nurse edna and even mrs grogan would love homer wells foreverin spite of his note of denialbut nurse caroline was younger than any of them she did not feel the abiding sweetness for homer wells that comes from knowing someone when hes a baby she felt he had betrayed larch and of course it was a bad time for him to ask for the old man when larch had died nurse angela and nurse edna and mrs grogan had said they were not up to calling homer nurse caroline hadnt wanted to call him what do you want nurse caroline asked him coldly or have you changed your mind theres a friend of my sons said homer wells shes one of the migrants here shes already got a baby whos got no father and now shes going to have another then shell have two nurse caroline informed him caroline said homer wells cut the shit i want to talk to the old man id like to talk to him too nurse caroline told him her voice rising larch is dead homer she said more quietly cut the shit said homer wells he felt his heart dancing too much ether she said theres no more lords work in saint clouds if you know someone who needs it youll have to do it yourself then she hung up on himshe really slammed the phone down his ear rang he heard the sound of the logs bashing together in the water that swept the winkles away his eyes had not stung so sharply since that night in the drapers furnace room in waterville when he had dressed himself for his getaway his throat had not ached so deeplythe pain pushing down into his lungssince that night he had yelled across the river trying to make the maine woods repeat the name of fuzzy stone snowy meadows had found happiness with the furniture marshes good for snowy thought homer wells he imagined that the other orphans would have difficulty finding happiness in the furniture business at times he admitted he had been very happy in the apple business he knew what larch would have told him that his happiness was not the point or that it wasnt as important as his usefulness homer shut his eyes and watched the women getting off the train they always looked a little lost he remembered them in the gaslit sleightheir faces were especially vivid to him when the sled runners would cut through the snow and strike sparks against the ground how the women had winced at that grating sound and briefly when the town had cared enough to provide a bus service how isolated the women had seemed in the sealed buses their faces cloudy behind the fogged glass through the windows they had appeared to homer wells the way the world appeared to them just before the ether transported them and now they walked from the station homer saw them marching uphill there were more of them than hed remembered they were an army advancing on the orphanage hospital bearing with them a single wound nurse caroline was tough but where would nurse edna and nurse angela go and what would happen to mrs grogan worried homer wells he remembered the hatred and contempt in melonys eyes if melony were pregnant i would help her he thought and with that thought he realized that he was willing to play god a little wilbur larch would have told him there was no such thing as playing a little god when you were willing to play godat allyou played a lot homer wells was thinking hard when he reached into his pocket and found the burneddown nub of the candle mr rose had returned to himthat gainst the rules aint it mr rose had asked him on his bedside table between the reading lamp and the telephone was his battered copy of david copperfield homer didnt have to open the book to know how the story began whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show he recited from memory his memory was exceedingly keen he could recall the different sizes of the ether cones that larch insisted upon making himself the apparatus was rudimentary larch shaped a cone out of an ordinary huckaback towel between the layers of the towel were layers of stiff paper to keep the cone from collapsing at the open tip of the cone was a wad of cottonto absorb the ether crude but larch could make one in three minutes they were different sizes for different faces homer had preferred the readymade yankauer maska wiremesh mask shaped like a soup ladle wrapped with ten or twelve layers of gauze it was into the old yankauer mask on his bedside table that homer deposited the remains of the cider house candle he kept change in the mask and sometimes his watch now he peered info it the mask contained a piece of chewing gum in a faded green wrapper and the tortoiseshell button from his tweed jacket the gauze in the mask was yellow and dusty but all the mask needed was fresh gauze homer wells made up his mind he would be a hero he went downstairs to the kitchen where angel was pushing wally around in the wheelchairit was a game they played when they were both restless angel stood on the back of the wheelchair and pushed it the way you push a scooter he got the chair going faster and fastermuch faster than wally could make it move by himself wally just steeredhe kept turning and turning wally kept trying to miss the furniture but despite his skill as a pilot and the good size of the kitchen floor eventually angel would get the chair going too fast to control and theyd crash into something candy got angry at them for it but they did it anyway especially when she was out of the house wally called it flying most of all it was something they did when they were bored candy had gone to the cider house to get rose rose and her baby angel and wally were freewheeling when they saw how homer looked they stopped whats the matter old boy wally asked his friend homer knelt by wallys wheelchair and put his head in wallys lap doctor larch is dead he told wally who held homer while he cried he cried a very short time in homers memory curly day had been the only orphan who ever cried for a long time when homer stopped crying he said to angel ive got a little story for youand im going to need your help they went outside to the shed where the garden things were kept and homer opened one of the quarterpound ether cans with a safety pin the fumes made his eyes tear a little hed never understood how larch could like the stuff he got addicted to it homer told his son but he used to have the lightest touch ive seen patients talking back to him while they were under and still they didnt feel a thing they took the ether upstairs and homer told angel to make up the extra bed in his roomfirst with the rubber sheet theyd used when angel had still been in diapers then the usual sheets but clean ones over that for baby rose angel asked his father no not for baby rose homer said when he unpacked the instruments angel sat down on the other bed and watched him the waters boiling wally called upstairs you remember how i used to tell you that i was doctor larchs helper homer asked angel right said angel wells well i got very goodat helping him homer said very good im not an amateur he told his son thats really itthats the little story homer said when hed arranged everything he needed where he could see it everything looked timeless everything looked perfect go on angel wells told his father go on with the story downstairs in the quiet house they heard wally in his wheelchair rolling from room to room he was still flying upstairs homer wells was talking to his son while he changed the gauze on the yankauer mask he began with that old business about the lords work and the devilshow to wilbur larch it was all the work of the lord it startled candy how the headlights from her jeep caught all the men in the starkest silhouettes against the sky how they were perched in a row like huge birds along the cider house roof she thought that everyone must be up therebut not everyone was mr rose and his daughter were inside the cider house and the men were waiting where theyd been told to wait when candy got out of the jeep no one spoke to her there were no lights on in the cider house if her headlights hadnt exposed the men on the roof candy would have thought that everyone had gone to bed hello candy called up to the roof one day that whole roof is going to cave in it suddenly frightened her how they wouldnt speak to her but the men were more frightened than candy was the men didnt know what to saythey knew only that what mr rose was doing to his daughter was wrong and that they were too afraid to do anything about it muddy candy asked in the darkness yes missus worthington muddy called down to her she went over to the corner of the cider house where the roof dipped closest to the ground it was where everyone climbed up an old picking ladder was leaned up against the roof there but no one on the roof moved to hold the ladder steady for her peaches candy said yes maam peaches said please someone hold the ladder she said muddy and peaches held the ladder and black pan held her hand when she climbed up on the roof the men made room for her and she sat down with them she could not see very clearly but she would have known if rose rose was there and if mr rose had been there candy knew he would have spoken to her the first time she heard the sound from the cider houseit came from directly under hercandy thought it was the baby just babbling or rnaybe beginning to cry when your wally was a boy it was differentout there black pan said to her it look like another country then his gaze was fixed upon the twinkling coast the noise under the cider house roof grew more distinct and peaches said aint it a pretty night maam it was decidedly not a pretty night it was a darker night than usual and the sound from the cider house was now comprehensible to her for a second she thought she was going to be sick careful when you stand up missus worthington muddy said to her but candy stamped her feet on the roof then she knelt down and began to beat on the tin with both her hands its so old a roof missus worthington black pan said to her you best be careful you dont fall through it get me down get me off candy said to them muddy and peaches took her arms and black pan preceded them to the ladder even walking down the roof candy tried to keep stamping her feet going down the ladder she called rose she could not say the ridiculous name of rose rose and she couldnt make herself say mister rose either rose she called ambiguously she wasnt even sure which one she was summoning but it was mr rose who met her at the cider house door he was still getting dressedhe was tucking his shirt in and buttoning his trousers he looked thinner and older to her than hed looked before and although he smiled at her he didnt look into her eyes with his usual confidencewith his usual polite indifference dont you speak to me candy told him but what would he have said your daughter and her baby are coming with me candy walked by him into the cider house she felt the tattered rules with her fingers as she found the light rose rose was sitting up on the bed she had pulled her blue jeans on but she hadnt closed them and she had pulled the tshirt on but she held candys bathing suit in her lapshe was unfamiliar with wearing it and shed not been able to put it on in a hurry she had found only one of her work shoes which she held in one hand the other one was under the bed candy found it and put it on the correct footrose rose wore no socks then candy tied the laces for her too rose rose just sat on the bed while candy put on and tied her other shoe youre coming with me your baby too candy told the girl yes maam rose rose said candy took the bathing suit from her and used the suit to wipe the tears from rose roses face youre fine youre just fine candy said to the girl and youre going to feel better no ones going to hurt you baby rose was sound asleep and candy was careful not to wake her when she picked her up and handed her to her mother rose rose moved uncertainly and candy put her arm around her when they walked out of the cider house together youre going to be just fine candy said to rose rose she kissed the young woman on her neck and rose rose who was sweating leaned against her mr rose was standing in the darkness between the jeep and the cider house but the rest of the men still sat on the roof you comin back mr rose saidnothing was raised at the end of his voice it was not a question i told you not to speak to me candy told him she helped rose rose and her baby into the jeep i was speakin to my daughter mr rose said with dignity but rose rose would not answer her father she sat like a statue of a woman with a baby in her arms while candy turned the jeep around and drove away before they went into the fancy house together rose rose slumped against candy and said to her i never could do nothin about it of course you couldnt candy told her he hated the father of the other one rose rose said he been after me ever since youre going to be all right now candy told the girl before they went inside through the windows they could watch wally flying back and forth in the house i know my father missus worthington rose rose whispered he gonna want me back he cant have you candy told her he cant make you go back to him he makes his own rules said rose rose and the father of your beautiful daughter candy asked holding the door open for rose rose and her baby girl where is he my father cut him up he long gone rose rose said he dont wanna be involved with me no more and your mother candy asked as they went in the house she dead rose rose said that was when wally told candy that dr larch was dead too she would not have known it to look at homer who was all business an orphan learns how to hold back how to keep things in are you all right candy asked homer while wally wheeled baby rose around the downstairs of the house and angel took rose rose to his room which was prepared for her im a little nervous homer admitted to candy its certainly not a matter of technique and ive got everything i needi know i can do it its just that to me it is a living human being i cant describe to you what it feels likejust to hold the curette for example when living tissue is touched it respondssomehow homer said but candy cut him off it may help you to know who the father is she said its mister rose her father is the fatherif that makes it any easier the crisply madeup bed in angels childhood room and the gleaming instrumentswhich were displayed so neatly in the adjacent bedmade rose rose both talkative and rigid this dont look like no fun the girl said holding her fists in her lap they took the other one out through the topnot the way she was supposed to come out rose rose explained shed had a caesarean homer wells could see perhaps because of her age and her size at the time but homer could not quite convince her that this time everything would be much easier he wouldnt need to take anything out through the top go stay with wally angel candy told the boy go give baby rose a ride in the wheelchair knock over all the furniture if you wantshe told him kissing her son yeah you go away rose rose told angel dont be afraid candy told rose rose homer knows what hes doing youre in very safe hands she swabbed rose rose with the red merthiolate while homer began to show rose rose the instruments this is a speculumhe said to her it may feel cold but it doesnt hurt you wont feel any of this he assured her these are dilators homer said but rose rose shut her eyes you done this before aint you rose rose asked him he had the ether ready just breathe normally he told her at the first whiff she opened her eyes and turned her face away from the mask but candy put her hands at rose roses temples and very gently moved her head into the right position the first smell is the sharpest said homer wells please have you done this before rose rose asked him her voice was muffled under the mask im a good doctori really am homer wells told her just relax and breathe normally dont be afraid rose rose heard candy tell her just before the ether began to take her out of her body i can ride it she said rose rose meant a bicycle homer watched her wiggle her toes rose rose was getting her first feel of the sand the beach was warm the tide was coming in she felt the water around her ankles no big deal she murmured rose rose meant the ocean homer wells adjusting the speculum until he had a perfect view of the cervix introduced the first dilator until the os opened like an eye looking back at him the cervix looked softened and slightly enlarged and it was bathed in a healthy clear mucusit was the most breathtaking pink color that homer had ever seen downstairs he heard the wheelchair careening through the housethere was a wild and nonstop giggling from baby rose tell them not to get that baby overexcited homer said to candy as if she were his nurse of longstanding and he was used to giving her directions and she was used to following them exactly he did not let the ruckus or candy trying to quiet them down distract him he watched the cervix open until it opened wide enough he chose the curette of the correct size after the first one thought homer wells this might get easier because he knew now that he couldnt play god in the worst sense if he could operate on rose rose how could he refuse to help a stranger how could he refuse anyone only a god makes that kind of decision ill just give them what they want he thought an orphan or an abortion homer wells breathed slowly and regularly the steadiness of his hand surprised him he did not even blink when he felt the curette make contact he did not divert his eyes from witnessing the miracle for that night candy slept in the extra bed in angels roomshe wanted to be close by if rose rose needed anything but rose rose slept like a rock the gap left by her missing tooth made a small whistling noise when her lips were parted it was not at all disturbing and candy slept quite soundly too angel slept downstairs sharing the big bed with wally they stayed awake quite late talking wally told angel about the time he first fell in love with candy although angel had heard the story before he listened to it more attentivelynow that he thought he had fallen in love with rose rose wally also told angel that he must never underestimate the darker necessities of the world where his father had grown up its the old story wally said to angel you can get homer out of saint clouds but you cant get saint clouds out of homer and the thing about being in love wally said to angel is that you cant force anyone its natural to want someone you love to do what you want or what you think would be good for them but you have to let everything happen to them you cant interfere with people you love any more than youre supposed to interfere with people you dont even know and thats hard he added because you often feel like interfering you want to be the one who makes the plans its hard to want to protect someone else and not be able to angel pointed out you cant protect people kiddo wally said all you can do is love them when he fell asleep wally felt the movement of the raft on the irrawaddy one of his friendly burmese rescuers was offering to catheterize him first he dipped the bamboo shoot in the brown river then he wiped it dry on one of the strips of silk that bound up his head basket then he spat on it you want to pees now the burmese asked wally no thank you wally said in his sleep no piss now he said aloud which made angel smile before he fell asleep too upstairs in the master bedroom homer wells was wide awake hed volunteered to have baby rose for the night because ill be up all night anyway he said hed forgotten how much he enjoyed having a baby to look after babies reminded homer of himself they were always wanting something in the middle of the night but after hed given baby rose her bottle the child went back to sleep and left homer wells alone again it was nonetheless a pleasure having the little girl to look at her black face in the bed beside him was no bigger than his hand and occasionally her hands would reach up and her fingers would open and close grasping at something she saw in her sleep the presence of another breather in the room reminded homer wells of the sleeping quarters in st clouds where he had some difficulty imagining the necessary announcement let us be happy for doctor larch homer said softly doctor larch has found a family good night doctor larch he tried to imagine which one of them would have said it he imagined it would have been nurse angela and so it was to her that he sent the letter now that dr larch had died mrs goodhalls pleasure at the thought of replacing the old nonpractising homosexual was less intense it did stimulate her however to imagine replacing him with that young missionary who had antagonized him so dr gingrich saw some faint justice appear on the horizon at the thought of replacing larch with someone whod clearly driven the old man crazy but dr gingrich was not so interested in the outcome of the situation in st clouds as he was fascinated with his secretive study of mrs goodhalls mind in which he found such a complex broth of righteous delusion and inspired hatred of course dr gingrich and the other board members were eager to meet young dr stone but dr gingrich was particularly eager to observe mrs coodhall at such a meeting mrs goodhall had developed a ticwhenever someone provided her with unusual pleasure or displeasure the right side of her face suffered an involuntary muscular contraction dr gingrich imagined that upon meeting the missionary doctor mrs goodhall would enter a phase of nearly constant spasm and he could not wait to observe this you must stall the board homer wrote to nurse angela tell them that your efforts to reach dr stone are hampered by the doctor being in transit between two of the missions hospitals in india say assam is one say new delhi is the other say you dont expect to be able to communicate with him for a week or more and thatif he was willing to consider the position at st cloudshe couldnt possibly be available before november homer wells hoped that this would allow him the time to tell angel everything and to be finished with the harvest youll have to convince the board that you are competent midwives in addition to being good nurses and that youll be able to recognize the patients who should be referred to a physician homer wrote to nurse angela you must forgive me for needing all this time but perhaps i will seem more believable to the board of trustees if everyone has to wait for me it takes time to leave asia he also requested that they send him the available history of fuzzy stone and tell him anything that larch might have omittedalthough homer could not imagine that st larch had left out anything it was with the shortest possible sentence that homer told nurse angela that he had loved larch like a father and that they had nothing to fear from melony poor bob who had broken her nose and her arm had plenty to fear from melony however but bob wasnt smart enough to be afraid of her when the cast would come off her arm and when her nose looked more or less normal again melony and lorna would cruise the old familiar spotsthe pizza bar in bath among themand bob would have the charmless instinct to annoy them again melony would disarm him with her shy smilethe one that humbly revealed her bad teeth to himand while bob turned his oafish attention to lorna melony snipped off the top half of his ear with her wirecutters the electricians common and trusty tool then melony broke several of bobs ribs and his nose and beat him unconscious with a chair she had her heart in the right place regarding st clouds but melony was an eyeforaneye and a titfortat girl my hero lorna called her it was a touchy word to use around melony who had long thought that homer wells was made of hero stuff homer was a hero in rose roses eyes she spent all of monday in the bed in angels room with candy bringing her baby to her from time to time and angel visiting with her every chance he could get youre going to love this room angel told her you plain crazy rose rose told him but i already love it it was a day that hurt the harvest mr rose wouldnt pick and half the men were sore from falling off the bicycles homer wells who never would master the terrible machine had a puffy knee and a bruise between his shoulder blades the size of a melon peaches refused to go up a ladder he would load the trailers and pick drops all day muddy groaned and complained he was the only one among them who had actually learned to ride black pan announced that it was a good day for a fast mr rose it appeared was fasting he sat outside the cider house in the weak sun wrapped in a blanket from his bed he sat indianstyle not talking to anyone he say he on a pickin strike peaches whispered to muddy who told homer that he thought mr rose was on a hunger strike tooand every other kind of strike there is well just have to get along without him homer told the men but everyone pussyfooted their way past mr rose who appeared to have enthroned himself in front of the cider house or else he planted hisself like a tree peaches said black pan brought him a cup of coffee and some fresh corn bread but mr rose wouldnt touch any of it sometimes he appeared to be gnawing on one of the pacifiers it was a cool day and when the faint sun would drift behind the clouds mr rose would draw the blanket over his head then he sat cloaked and robed and closed off completely from any of them he like an indian peaches said he dont make no treaty he want to see his daughter muddy informed homer at the end of the day that what he say to meit all he say just see her he say he wont touch her tell him he can come to the house and see her there homer wells told muddy but at suppertime muddy came to the kitchen door alone candy asked him in and asked him to eat with themrose rose was sitting with them at the table but muddy was too nervous to stay he say he wont come here muddy told homer he say for her to come to the cider house he say to tell you they got they own rules he say you breakin the rules homer rose rose sat so still at the table that she was not even chewing she wanted to be sure to hear everything muddy was saying angel tried to take her hand which was cold but she pulled it away from him and kept both her hands wound up in her napkin in her lap muddy wally said you tell him that rose rose is staying in my house and that in my house we follow my rules you tell him hes welcome to come here anytime he wont do it muddy said i have to go see him rose rose said no you dont candy told her you tell him he sees her here or nowhere muddy candy said yes maam i brung the bicycles back muddy said to angel they a little banged up angel went outside to look at the bicycles and thats when muddy handed him the knife you dont need this angel muddy told the boy but you give it to rose rose you say i want her to have it just so she have one angel looked at muddys knife it was a bonehandled jackknife and part of the bone was chipped it was one of those jackknives where the blade locks in place when you open it so it cant close on your fingers the blade was almost six inches long which would make it prominent in anyones pocket and over the years it had seen a lot of whetstone the blade was ground down very thin and the edge was very sharp dont you need it muddy angel asked him i never knew what to do with it muddy confessed i just get in trouble with it ill give it to her angel said you tell her her father say he love her and he just wanna see her muddy said just see he repeated angel considered this message then he said i love rose rose you know muddy sure i know muddy said i love her too we all love her everybody love rose rosethat part of her problem if mister rose just wants to see her angel said how come youre giving her your knife just so she have one muddy repeated angel gave her the knife when they were sitting in his room after supper its from muddy he told her i know who it from rose rose said i know what knife everyone goti know what they all look like although it was not a switchblade it made angel jump to see how quickly she opened the knife using only one hand look what muddy do she said laughing he been sharpeniri it to deathhe wore it half away she closed the knife against her hip her long fingers moved the knife around so quickly that angel didnt notice where she put it you know a lot about knives angel asked her from my father she said he show me everythin angel moved and sat on the bed next to her but rose rose regarded him neutrally i told you she began patiently you dont wanna have no business with mei could never tell you nothin about me you dont wanna know bout me believe me but i love you angel pleaded with her after she kissed himand she allowed him to touch her breastsshe said angel lovin someone dont always make no difference then baby rose woke up and rose rose had to attend to her daughter you know what i namin her she asked angel candy rose rose said that who she isshe a candy in the morning on the downhill side of the harvest everyone got up early but no one got up earlier than rose rose angel who had more or less been imagining that he was guarding the house all night noticed that rose rose and her daughter had gone angel and homer got in the jeep and drove out to the cider house before breakfast but there was nowhere they could go that morning that rose rose hadnt been to ahead of them the men were up and looking restless and mr rose was already maintaining his stoical sitting position in the grass in front of the cider housethe blanket completely covering him except for his face you too late mr rose said to them she long gone angel ran and looked in the cider house but there was no sign of rose rose or her daughter she gone with her thumb she say mr rose told homer and angel he made the hitchhiking signhis bare hand emerging from the blanket only for a second before it went back into hiding i didnt hurt her mr rose went on i didnt touch her homer he said i just love her was all i just wanna see herone more time im sorry for your troubles homer wells told the man but angel ran off to find muddy she say to tell you you was the nicest muddy told the boy she say to tell your dad he a hero and that you was the nicest she didnt say where she was going she dont know where she goin angel muddy told him she just know she gotta go but she could have stayed with us angel said with me he added i know she thought about it muddy said you better think about it too i have thought about iti think about it all the time angel said angrily i dont think you old enough to think about it angel muddy said gently i loved her the boy said she know muddy said she know who she is too but she also know you dont know who you is yet looking for her and thinking about her would help angel to know that he and candy would drive south along the coast for an hour then they would drive north for two they knew that even rose rose would know enough about maine not to go inland and they knew that a young black woman with a baby in her arms would be quite exotic among the hitchhikers of maine she certainly would have less trouble than melony getting a rideand melony always got rides mr rose would maintain his almost buddhist position he made it through lunch without moving but in the afternoon he asked black pan to bring him some water and when the men were through picking that day he called muddy over to him muddy was very frightened but he approached mr rose and stood at a distance of about six feet from him where your knife muddy mr rose asked him you lose it i didnt lose it muddy told him but i cant find it he added it around you mean mr rose asked him it around somewhere but you dont know where i dont know where it is muddy admitted never do you no good anywaydo it mr rose asked him i never could use it muddy admitted it was a cold and sunless late afternoon but muddy was sweating he held his hands at his sides as if his hands were dead fish where she get the knife muddy mr rose asked what knife muddy asked him it look like your knifewhat i seen of it said mr rose i gave it to her muddy admitted thank you for dointhat muddy mr rose said if she gone with her thumb i glad she got a knife with her peaches muddy screamed go get homer peaches came out of the cider house and stared at mr rose who didnt move a muscle mr rose didnt look at peaches at all black pan muddy screamed as peaches went running off to get homer wells black pan came out of the cider house and he and muddy got down on their knees and peered at mr rose together you all stay calm mr rose advised them you too late he told them no one gonna catch her now she had all day to get away mr rose said proudly where she get you muddy asked mr rose but neither he nor black pan dared to poke around under the blanket they just watched mr roses eyes and his dry lips she good with that knifeshe better with it than you ever be mr rose said to muddy i know she good muddy said she almost the best said mr rose and who taught her he asked them you did they told him that right said mr rose that why she almost as good as me very slowly without exposing any of himself keeping himself completely under the blanket except for his facemr rose rolled over on his side and tucked his knees up to his chest i real tired of sittin up he told muddy and black pan i gettin sleepy where she get you muddy asked him again i didnt think it would take this long said mr rose it taken all day but it felt like it was gonna go pretty fast all the men were standing around him when homer wells and peaches arrived in the jeep mr rose had very little left to say when homer got to him you breakin them rules too homer mr rose whispered to him say you know how i feel i know how you feel said homer wells right said mr rosegrinning the knife had entered in the upper right quadrant close to the rib margin homer knew that a knife moving in an upward direction would give a substantial liver laceration which would continue to bleedat a moderate ratefor many hours mr rose might have stopped bleeding several times and started again in most cases a liver stab wound hemorrhages very slowly mr rose died in homers arms before candy and angel arrived at the cider house but long after his daughter had made good her escape mr rose had managed to soak the blade of his own knife in his wound and the last thing he told homer was that it should be clear to the authorities that he had stabbed himself if he hadnt meant to kill himself why would he have let himself bleed to death from what wasnt necessarily a mortal wound my daughter run away mr rose told all of them and i so sorry that i stuck myself you better say that what happen let me hear you say it he raised his voice to them that what happen muddy said you kill yourself peaches told him that what happen black pan said you hearin this right homer mr rose asked him that was how homer reported it and that was how the death of mr rose was receivedthe way he wanted it according to the cider house rules rose rose had broken the rules of course but everyone at ocean view knew the rules mr rose had broken with her at the end of the harvest on a gray morning with a wild wind blowing in from the ocean the overhead bulb that hung in the cider house kitchen blinked twice and burned out the spatter of apple mash on the far wall near the press and grinder was cast so somberly in shadows that the dark clots of pomace looked like black leaves that had blown indoors and stuck against the wall in a storm the men were picking up their few things homer wells was therewith the bonus checksand angel had comewith him to say goodbye to muddy and peaches and black pan and the rest of them wally had made some arrangements with black pan to be crew boss the following year wally had been right about mr rose being the only one of them who could read well and write at all muddy told angel that hed always thought the list of rules tacked to the kitchen wall was something to do with the buildings electricity cause it was always near the light switch muddy explained i thought they was instructions bout the lights the other men since they couldnt read at all never noticed that the list was there muddy if you should happen to see her angel said when he was saying goodbye i wont see her angel muddy told the boy she long gone then they were all long gone angel would never see muddy again eitheror peaches or any of the rest of them except black pan it wouldnt work out having black pan as a crew boss as wally would discover the man was a cook not a picker and a boss had to be in the field with the men although black pan would gather a fair picking crew together he was never quite in charge of themin future years of course no one would ever be as in charge of a picking crew at ocean view as mr rose had been for a while wally would try hiring french canadians they were after all closer to maine than the carolinas but the french canadian crews were often illtempered and alcoholic and wally would always be trying to get the french canadians out of jail one year wally would hire a commune but that crew arrived with too many small children the pregnant women on the ladders made everyone nervous they left something cooking all day and started a small fire in the kitchen and when the men ran the press they allowed their children to splash about in the vat wally would finally settle on jamaicans they were friendly nonviolent and good workers they brought with them an interesting music and a straightforward but contained passion for beer and for a little marijuana they knew how to handle the fruit and they never hurt each other but after mr roses last summer at ocean view the pickerswhoever they werewould never sit on the cider house roof it just never occurred to them and no one would ever put up a list of rules again in future years the only person who ever sat on the cider house roof was angel wells who would do it because he liked that particular view of the ocean and because he wanted to remember that november day in after muddy and the rest of them had left and his father turned to him they were alone at the cider house and said how about sitting on the roof for a while with me its time you knew the whole story another little story angel asked i said the whole story said homer wells and although it was a cold day that november and the wind off the sea was briny and raw father and son sat on that roof a long time it was after all a long story and angel would ask a lot of questions candy who drove by the cider house and saw them sitting up there was worried about how cold they must be but she didnt interrupt them she just kept driving she hoped the truth would keep them warm she drove to the barn nearest the apple mart and got everett taft to help her put the canvas canopy on the jeep then she went and got wally out of the office where are we going wally asked her she bundled him up in a blanket as if she were taking him to the arctic circle we must be going north he said when she didnt answer him my fathers dock she told him wally knew that ray kendalls dock and everything else belonging to ray had been blown over land and sea he kept quiet the ugly little carhop restaurant that bucky bean had manufactured was closed for the season they were alone candy drove the jeep through the empty parking lot and out to a rocky embankment that served as a seawall against the waves in hearts haven harbor she stopped as near to the oceans edge as she dared to near the old pilings of what had been her fathers dockwhere she and wally had spent so many evenings so long ago then since this wasnt wheelchair terrain she carried wally about ten yards over the rocks and the sand and sat him down on a relatively smooth and flat shelf of the jagged coastline she wrapped wallys legs in the blanket and then she sat down behind him and straddled him with her legsas a way of keeping them both warm they sat facing europe in this position like riders on a sled about to plunge downhill this is fun wally said she stuck her chin over his shoulder their cheeks were touching she hugged him around his arms and his chest and she squeezed his withered hips with her legs i love you wally candy said beginning her story in late november in the mousing season the board of trustees at st clouds approved the appointment of dr f stone as obstetricianinresidence and the new director of the orphanagehaving met the zealous missionary in the boards chambers in portland the birthplace of the late wilbur larch dr stone who appeared a little tired from his asian journeying and from what he described as a touch of something dysenteric made the correct impression on the board his manner was somber his hair was graying and cropped in an almost military fashion hindu barbers he apologized showing a mild sense of humor actually candy had cut his hair homer wells was carelessly shaven clean but tousled in his dressboth at ease and impatient with strangers in the manner the board thought of a man with urgent business who was not in the least vain about his appearance he hadnt the time the board also approved of dr stones medical and religious credentialsthe latter in the estimation of the devout mrs goodhall would give to dr stones authority in st clouds a balance that she noted had been missing in dr larch dr gingrich was excited to note the contortions registered on mrs goodhalfs face during the entire meeting with young dr stone who did not recognize gingrich and goodhall from his brief glimpse of them in the offseason ogunquit hotel dr gingrich found a comforting familiarity in the young mans face although he would never associate the glow of a missionary with the sorrowful longing he had seen on the face of the lover perhaps mrs goodhalls tic affected her visionshe did not recognize the young man from the hotel either or else her mind would never grasp the possibility that a man devoted to children could also be a man with a practicing sexual life to homer wells mrs goodhall and dr gingrich were not special enough to remember the peevish miseries compounded in their expressions were not unique and the way that homer looked when he was with candy was not the way he looked most of the time on the matter of abortions dr stone surprised the board by the adamant conviction he held that they should be legalized and that he intended to work through the proper channels toward that end however dr stone assured them as long as abortions were illegal he would rigorously uphold the law he believed in rules and in obeying them he told the board they liked the hardship and selfsacrifice that they imagined they could witness in the wrinkles around his dark eyesand how the fierce asian sun had blistered his nose arid cheeks while he had toiled to save the diarrhetic children actually he had deliberately sat for too long in front of candys sunlamp andon the religious grounds more comfortable to the board and to mrs goodhall especially dr stone said that he himself never would perform abortions even if they were legalized i just couldnt do it he lied calmly if it ever was legal of course he would simply refer the unfortunate woman to one of those doctors who could and would it was clear that dr stone found those doctors not to his liking that despite his loyalty to dr larch dr stone found that particular practice of larchs to be an act decidedly against nature it was in large measure indicative of dr stones christian tolerance that despite his longstanding disagreement with dr larch on this delicate subject the young missionary was forgiving of larchfar more forgiving than the board by no small portion i always prayed for him dr stone said of dr larch his eyes shining i still pray for him it was an emotional moment perhaps influenced by the aforementioned touch of something dysentericand the board was predictably moved by it mrs goodhalls tic went wild on the matter of nurse carolines socialist views dr stone assured the board that the young womans fervor to do the right thing had simply beenin her youth misguided he would tell her a few things about the communist guerrilla activity in burma that would open her eyes and dr stone convinced the board that the older nurses and mrs grogan had a few more years of good service in them its all a matter of guidance dr stone told the board now there was a word that pleased dr gingrich dr stone opened his hands they were rather roughly calloused for the hands of a doctor mrs goodhall would observethinking it charming how this healer of children must have helped with building the huts or planting the gardens or whatever other rough work thered been to do over there when he said guidance homer wells opened his hands the way a minister received a congregation thought the board or the way a good doctor received the precious head of a newborn child they thought and it was thrilling after they had interviewed him how he blessed them as he was leaving them and how he salaamed to them nga sak kin said the missionary doctor oh what had he said they all wanted to know wally of course had taught homer the correct pronunciationit being one of the few burmese things that wally had ever heard correctly although hed never learned what it meant homer wells translated the phrase for themwally had always thought it was someones name it means homer told the enraptured board may god watch over your soul which no man may abuse there were loud murmurs of approval mrs goodhall said all that in such a short phrase its a remarkable language dr stone told them dreamily nga sak kin he told them again he got them all to repeat it after him he was pleased to imagine them later giving this meaningless blessing to each other it would have pleased him more if hed ever known what the phrase actually meant it was the perfect thing for a board of trustees to go around saying to each other curried fish balls i think i got away with it homer told wally and candy and angel when they were eating a late supper in the house at ocean view it doesnt surprise me wally told his friend i have every reason to believe that you can get away with anything upstairs after supper angel watched his father pack the old black doctors bagand some other bags as well dont worry pop angel told his father youre going to do just fine youre going to do just fine too homer told his son im not worried about that downstairs they heard candy pushing wally around in the wheelchair they were playing the game that wally and angel often playedthe game wally called flying come on wally was saying angel can make it go faster candy was laughing im going as fast as i can candy said please stop thinking about the furniture wally told her please look after wally homer said to angel and mind your mother he told his son rightsaid angel wells in the constantly changing weather of maine especially on cloudy days the presence of st clouds could be felt in hearts rock with a heavy certainty the air of st clouds could be distinguished in the trapped stillness that hovered above the water of drinkwater lake like those water bugs those water walkers that were nearly constant there and even in the fog that rolled over those bright coastal lawns of hearts havens welltodo there was sometimes in the stormcoming air that leaden heartsinking feeling that was the essence of the air of st clouds candy and wally and angel would go to st clouds for christmas and for the longer of angels school vacations too and after angel had his drivers license he was free to visit his father as often as he liked which was often but when homer wells went to st cloudseven though wally had offered him a carhomer took the train homer knew he wouldnt need a car there and he wanted to arrive the way most of his patients did he wanted to get the feel of it in late november there was already snow as the train moved north and inland and by the time the train reached st clouds the bluecold snow was deeply on the ground and heavily bent the trees the stationmaster who hated to leave the television was shoveling snow off the platform when the train pulled in the stationmaster thought he recognized homer wells but the stern black doctors bag and the new beard fooled him homer had started the beard because it had hurt to shave after hed burned his face with the sunlamp and once the beard had grown for a while he thought the change would be suitable didnt a beard go with his new name doctor stone homer said to the stationmaster introducing himself fuzzy stone he said used to be an orphan here now im the new doctor oh i thought you was familiar the stationmaster said bowing as he shook homers hand only one other passenger had gotten off the train in st clouds and homer wells had no difficulty imagining what she wanted she was a thin young woman in a long muskrat coat with a scarf and a ski hat pulled almost over her eyes and she hung back on the platform waiting for homer to move away from the stationmaster it was the doctors bag that had caught her attention and after homer had arranged for the usual louts to tote his heavier luggage he started up the hill to the orphanage carrying just the doctors bag the young woman followed him they walked uphill in this fashion with the woman lagging purposefully behind until they almost reached the girls division then homer stopped walking and waited for her is this the way to the orphanage the young woman asked him right said homer wells since he had grown the beard he tended to oversmile at people he imagined that the beard made it hard for people to tell whether he was smiling are you the doctor the young woman asked him staring at the snow on both their bootsand warily at the doctors bag yes im doctor stone he said taking the womans arm and leading her toward the hospital entrance of the boys division may i help you he asked her and so he arrived as nurse edna would say bringing the lords work with him nurse angela threw her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear oh homer she whispered i knew youd be back call me fuzzy he whispered to her because he knew that homer wells like rose rose was long gone for several days nurse caroline would be shy with him but he wouldnt need more than a few operations and a few deliveries to convince her that he was the real thing dr stone even as a name would be a fitting successor to dr larch for wasnt stone a good hard feetontheground reliablesounding sort of name for a physician and mrs grogan would remark that she had not enjoyed being read aloud to so much since those hardtoremember days of homer wells and it was to everyones relief that fuzzy stone would exhibit as few symptoms of his former respiratory difficulties as homer wells had exhibited signs of a weak and damaged heart candy and wally worthington would throw themselves full tilt into apple farming wally would serve two terms as president of the maine horticultural society candy would serve a term as director of the new york new england apple institute and angel wells whom rose rose had introduced to love and to imagination would one day be a novelist the kids got fiction in his blood wally would tell homer wells to candy a novelist was also what homer wells had becomefor a novelist in candys opinion was also a kind of impostor doctor but a good doctor nonetheless homer never minded giving up his nameit wasnt his actual name to begin withand it was as easy to be a fuzzy as it was to be a homeras easy or as hard to be a stone as it was to be anything else when he was tired or plagued with insomnia or both he would miss angel or he would think of candy sometimes he longed to carry wally into the surf or to fly with him some nights homer imagined he would be caught or he worried about what he would do when nurse angela and nurse edna were too old for the lords work and for all the other work in st clouds and how would he ever replace mrs grogan sometimes when he was especially tired he dreamed that abortions were legalthat they were safe and available and therefore he could stop performing them because someone else would do thembut he was rarely that tired and after a while he would write to candy and say that he had become a socialist or at least that hed become sympathetic to socialist views candy understood by this confession that homer was sleeping with nurse caroline which she also understood would be good for themthat is this new development was good for homer and for nurse caroline and it was good for candy too homer wells saw no end to the insights he perceived nightly in his continuous reading from jane eyre and from david copperfield and great expectations he would smile to remember how he had once thought dickens was better than bronte when they both gave such huge entertainment and instruction what did it matter he thoughtand from where comes this childish business of better if not entertainment he took continued instruction from grays anatomy for a while he lacked one thingand he was about to order it when one came unordered to him as if from god mrs grogan would say the stationmaster sent him the message there was a body at the railroad station addressed to dr stone it was from the hospital in bathwhich had been dr larchs longstanding source for bodies in the days when hed ordered them it was some mistake homer wells was sure but he went to the railroad to view the body anywayand to spare the stationmaster any unnecessary agitation homer stood staring at the cadaver which had been correctly prepared for such a long time that the stationmaster grew even more anxious id just as soon you either take it up the hill or send it back the stationmaster said but homer wells waved the fool off he wanted peace to look at melony she had requested this use of her body lorna had told the pathologist at the bath hospital melony had seen a photograph in the bath paper together with an article revealing dr stones appointment in st clouds in the event of her death which was caused by an electrical accident melony had instructed lorna to send her body to dr stone in st clouds i might be of some use to him finally she had told her friend of course homer remembered how melony had been jealous of clara he would write to lorna they would correspond for a while lorna would inform him that melony was a relatively happy woman at the time of her accident in lornas opinion something to do with how relaxed melony had become was responsible for her electrocuting herself she was a daydreamer lorna would write homer knew that all orphans were daydreamers you was her hero finally lorna would tell him when he viewed her body he knew he could never use it for a refresher course he would send to bath for another cadaver melony had been used enough should i send it back doctor the stationmaster whispered no she belongs here homer wells told him and so he had melony brought uphill it would be essential to keep the sight of her in her present form a secret from mrs grogan what homer told them all was that melony had requested she be buried in st clouds and so she wason the hill under the apple trees where it was torturously hard to dig a correct hole the root systems of the trees were everywhere finally a large and deep enough hole was managed although it was backbreaking labor and nurse caroline said i dont know who she is but she sure is difficult she was always that said homer wells here in st clouds wilbur larch had written we learn to love the difficult mrs grogan said her cardinal newman over melonys grave and homer said his own prayer to himself about her he had always expected much from melony but she had provided him with more than hed ever expected she had truly educated him she had shown him the light she was more sunshine than he ever was he thought let us be happy for melony he said to himself melony has found a family but chiefly for his education he would peruse and linger over every word of a brief history of st clouds in this pursuit he would have nurse angelas and nurse ednas and mrs grogans and nurse carolines tireless company for by this pursuit they would keep wilbur larch alive not that everything was clear to homer the later entries in a brief history of st clouds were marred by shorthand inspirations and the whimsy conveyed to larch through ether for example what did larch mean by rhymes with screams and it seemed uncharacteristically harsh of larch to have written i put the ponys penis in her mouth i contributed to that how could he have thought that homer wondered because homer never knew how well dr larch had known mrs eamess daughter and as he grew older homer wells alias fuzzy stone would take special comfort in an unexplained revelation he found in the writings of wilbur larch tell dr stone dr larch wroteand this was his very last entry these were wilburs last words there is absolutely nothing wrong with homers heart except for the ether homer wells knew there had been very little that was wrong with the heart of wilbur larch to nurse edna who was in love and to nurse angela who wasnt but who had in her wisdom named both homer wells and fuzzy stone there was no fault to be found in the hearts of either dr stone or dr larch who wereif there ever wereprinces of maine kings of new england authors notes pp anthony trollope who visited portland maine in and wrote about it in his north america was mistakenin the manner of wilbur larchs father about the intended future of the great eastern pp i am indebted to my grandfather dr frederick c irving for this information regarding dr ernst the curveball pitcherand for the particularly medical language in this chapter my grandfathers books include the expectant mothers handbook a textbook of obstetrics and safe deliverance dr ernsts studies of bacterial infections drew the attention of a dr richardson of the boston lyingin hospital the maternity hospital where wilbur larch served an internship and later joined the staff dr richardsons article the use of antiseptics in obstetric practice would surely have caught the attention of that eager student of bacteriology clapsufferer wilbur larch the interest in antiseptics among obstetricians was due to their effect in preventing the most deadly puerperal infection of that day childbed fever in in some maternity hospitals the death rate among the mothers was about one in eight in when wilbur larch was still at the boston lyingin a mothers odds were better the doctors and their patients were washed with a solution of bichloride of mercury before larch would leave the boston lyingin he would see the antiseptic technique advance to the asepticthe latter meaning free from bacteria which meant that everything was sterilized the sheets the towels the gowns the gauze sponges the instruments were boiled pp on the use of ether most historians of anesthesia agree with dr sherwin b nuland that surgical anesthesia began at massachusetts general hospital on october when william morton demonstrated the effectiveness of ether dr nuland writes everything that led up to it was prologue everything that was tangential to it was byplay and everything that followed it was amplification according to dr nuland ether in proper hands remains one of the safest inhalation agents known at a concentration of only to percent it is a light tasty vapor in light concentration even thirty years ago hundreds of cases of cardiac surgery were clone with light ether and partially awake even talking patients some of dr larchs colleagues at the time would have preferred nitrous oxide or chloroform but larch developed his preference for ether through selfadminister someone would be crazy to selfadministration chloroform it is twentyfive times more toxic to heart muscle than is ether and has an extremely narrow margin of safety a minimal overdose can result in cardiac irregularity and death nitrous oxide requires a very high at least percent concentration to do the job and is always accompanied by a degree of what is called hypoxiainsufficient oxygen it requires careful monitoring and cumbersome apparatus and the patient runs the risk of bizarre fantasies or giggling fits induction is very fast ether is a perfect drug addiction for a conservative p the source of this story is again my grandfather who graduated from harvard medical sjchool in he became chief of staff of the boston lyingin hospital and was william lambert richardson professor of obstetrics at harvard for a number of years i remember him as a good storyteller and an occasional bullyof the other members of his family as a young doctor he had many experiences delivering babies to bostons poorer immigrant families and to read him is to understand that he had as many opinions and prejudices as he had experiences and talents pp ether was first synthesized in by a twentyfiveyearold prussian botanist people have been having ether frolicsand later laughinggas partiesever since in john dalton published his study of the compounds physical and chemical properties coleridge was a laughinggas mana party sniffer and a frequenter of the experiments with nitrous oxide conducted by humphrey davy the poet was certainly familiar with ether it was a pityfor himthat he apparently preferred opium pp a caesarean section is today a relatively calm operation the abdominal incision is small because the uterus is opened inside the abdominal cavity but in dr larchs days at the boston lyingin in and the incision made in the abdominal wall was nearly a foot long the uterus was lifted through the incision and placed upon the patients abdomen the slashing of this great plumcolored organ produced a dramatic gush of liquid and blood my grandfather wrote the uterus was then sutured with silk and returned to the abdominal cavity the abdomen was closed in the same way considerably more discomfort followed such an operation than follows a caesarean section now the operation in larchs timeand without complications would require nearly an hour p this death by scurvy is based on an actual case the strange case of ellen bean as told by my grandfather a spinster of thirtyfive years and of new england stock grandfather wrote of ms bean whose condition and cause of death was the same fate i awarded to the unfortunate mrs earnes as my grandfather wrote the pregnant state does not engender in all women the rapturous joy traditionally associated with this condition indeed there are some who view their future with a sour visage and a jaundiced eye this much may be assumed from the case of ellen bean p in wilbur larchs own state in dear old maine performing an abortion was punishable by a year in jail or a onethousanddollar fine or bothand if you were a doctor you might lose your license to practice the eastmaneverett act of described the attempted abortion of any woman with child as an offense whether such child be quick or notand regardless of the method p instead of red merthiolate dr larch might have used dakins solution although its likely he would have learned more about its uses during his short visit to france in world war i that is where my grandfather learned of the many uses of dakins solution and where he learned how to débridethat is to cut away all the devitalized tissue surrounding a wound the french were good teachers of this he said pp in order for dr larch to find the music in the abortion palace remindful of mahlers kindertotenlieder he would have to be gifted with a little precognition mahlers song cycle was written in that is implied in the line of course they could not have been singing mahlers songs on the death of children but those were the songs wilbur larch had heard p this is my grandfathers description of the condition of an actual patient an extreme small woman named edith fletcherupon whom a caesarean section was performed boston lyingin hospital july a pelvis this small is rare pp mrs w h maxwells a female physician to the ladies of the united states being a familiar and practical treatise of matters of utmost importance peculiar to women adapted to every

of husbands or otherwise in short she treated venereal diseases mrs maxwell also wrote that she gave her attention as well to women who are forced by the malfunction of their genital organs or other cause to resort to premature delivery in short she performed abortions p the new england home for little wanderers was originally the baldwin place home for little wanderers the charter was granted by the commonwealth of massachusetts in the name was changed to the new england home for little wanderers its present name in more than a decade before wilbur larch founded the orphanage in st clouds p in a gynecology textbook howard kellythe standard at that time the term d and c is used i think its safe to assume that the term was in common use in p my grandfather said that he needed to use his grays anatomy in france in world war i as a navigational chart pp this is the exact description of a d and c as viewed by dr richard selzer yale school of medicine a general surgeon and author mortal lessons notes on the art of surgery and rituals of surgery are among his books im grateful for his reading of the manuscript of this novel and his generous adviceespecially his introducing me to dr nuland who was the overseer of all the medical aspects of this novel p the source of my information concerning the physical and mental manifestations of alzheimers disease is the journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences volume xxxiv number july the article by dr sherwin b nuland the enigma of semmelweisan interpretation dr nuland first presented his material in a lecture at the yale school of medicine the annual history of surgery series his thesis is that ignac semmelweis the tortured discoverer of the sources of puerperal fever suffered from alzheimers disease and not from neurosyphilis furthermore dr nuland believes that semmelweis died of injuries received in a mental institutionie he was beaten to death by his keepers the records of bedlam and of other institutions for the insane show that this was common as late as the early part of this century and occasional reports still appear pp the source of the description of homer wellss first eclampsia patient is my grandfathers book safe deliverancethe chapter on puerperal convulsions grandfather examines the case of a lucy nickerson who died in of an eclamptic condition thatwas further aggravated by a forced deliverythe only method known to physicians of the unfortunate mrs nickersons day pp the source of this treatment is again my grandfather dr frederick c irving he was called fritz grandfather

spring would be considered too early to bother waxing the press boards the first press wouldnt be until september when youd be pressing the early mclntoshes and the gravensteins the press boards or racks are wooden slats over which the cider cloths or press cloths are folded the press boardsthey are stacked sevenhigh take quite a beating and the wax protects them the mash which is also called the pomace is squeezed between these boards under a pressure of two thousand pounds it takes eight hours to squeeze a thousand gallons of cider out of the pressabout three gallons per bushel of apples the reason you wax the press boards before the first press is that you dont want to take the time to do it once the harvest has begun and youre running the cider mill during the harvest maybe as much as every other night and every day that it rainswhen you cant pick apples in the s and the s the last good press would have come in january im indebted to my old friends ben and peter wagner and to their mother jean for this and other applefarming information the wagners run the applecrest farm orchards in hampton falls new hampshire where i worked when i was a boy jean and her late husband bill gave me my first job p all orchards have names it is common practice too for farmers to name their buildings this is necessary for the shorthand language of simple directions as in the deere has a flat and needs fixing in the frying pan or i left the dodge in number two because wally is spraying in the sanborn and hell need a ride back in the orchard where i worked there was a building called number twoalthough there was no number three and i dont remember a number one many of the orchards were named after the families whod been the original homesteaders on that particular piece of land brown eaton coburn and curtis are some local names i remember there was an orchard called twenty acres and another one called nineteen and there were the plainer namesan orchard called the field one called the fountain one called the spring and one called oldnew because it was half old trees and half newly planted the frying pan is also called frying panwithout the article p anyone who grew up near the ocean as i did could detect a sea breeze in iowa if one was blowing p the prayer that mrs grogan recites is credited to john henry cardinal newman the english theologian and author im told that the prayer was originally part of one of cardinal newmans sermons it was also what served my family as a family prayer and was spoken at the graveside of my maternal grandmother it was her favorite her name was helen bates winslow and she died just a month short of her hundredth birthday the festivities the family had planned for that event would doubtlessly have killed my grandmother had she lived until then cardinal newmans prayer must be a very good one or at least it worked very welland for a very long timefor my grandmother who was devoted to it i was devoted to her pp alzheimer described the disease he called presenile dementia in deterioration in cognition occurs relatively early in the disease and is marked by a disturbance of recent memory and a loss of the ability to learn new things dr nuland of yale also states that some patients are more likely to begin with personality changes and some with intellectual changes the advance of the disease in either case is marked by a lowering threshold of frustration dr nuland notes that the sequence in which certain small jobs need to be done would be difficult to follow and that complex ideas are hard to comprehend and impossible to explain to others it is a rapid deterioration that advances in alzheimer victims the average lifespan from the time of diagnosis is approximately seven years there are patients who live much longer and many who die within a few months in recent years it has been recognized that alzheimers is not only an uncommon disease that affects people in midlife but also a relatively frequent cause of mental and physical degeneration in the elderly many of whom were previously thought to have simple hardening of the arteries arteriosclerosis p the famous paris edition

because i was born and grew up in exeter new hampshire the brent limerick is dated it is a classic organ limerick so called because there is a special category of limericks devoted to the peculiarities of the male and female organs as in there was a young fellow named cribbs whose cock was so big it had ribs and in the famous limerick that was voted best limerick by one of the

estimate is low even in a poll many parents are unwilling to admit that any child of theirs was unwanted furthermore unwed or abandoned mothers were not included in the survey their opinions regarding how many of their children were unwanted were never counted for more information on this subject see jarnes tragers the bellybook ben franklin was the fifteenth of seventeen children his faith in
