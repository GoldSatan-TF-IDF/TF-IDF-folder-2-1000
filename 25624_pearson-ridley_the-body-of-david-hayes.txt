ridley pearson the body of david hayes the ninth book in the boldt matthews series the body of david hayes is dedicated to john jamerson one lou boldt picked up bits and pieces of the assault over an uncooperative cell phone paramedics were still on the scenea trailer park near seatac airport a promising report because it suggested the victim was still there as well if he reached the site in time boldt meant to ride to the hospital in the back of the ambulance he owed danny foreman that much the crown vic bumped through a pothole that would have knocked dentures out boldts eyes shifted focus briefly to catch his reflection in the silver of the windshield boldt had crossed forty a few years back tinges of gray gave a hint of it he was in the best physical shape of his professional career thanks to weight watchers a renewed interest in tennis and a regimen of situps and pushups in front of cnn each morning he scratched at his tie seeing that he was wearing some of his dinner a familiar tendency and hit a second pothole because of the distraction his head came up to catch a glimpse of a closed gas station plywood tombstones where the pumps should have been the signs torn down the neon beer ads gone from the windows he turned down a muddy lane dodging the first of many emergency vehicles the air hung heavy with mist seattle working its way out of a lazy fall and into the steady cold drizzle of winter three to five months of it depending on el niño or la niña boldt couldnt keep straight which was which beneath twin sliding glass windows on the butt end the once white house trailer carried a broken chrome script that boldt reassembled in his head to read everhome it had come to rest in a patch of weedy lawn that needed cutting and was accessed by a poured concrete path broken and heaved like calving icebergs the emergency vehicles included a crime scene unit van a king county sheriff patrol car and an ambulance with its hood up technically the scene was the seattle police departments and therefore boldts but danny foremans career had landed him first in the sheriffs department then spd and now bci bureau of criminal investigation what some states called the investigative arm of the state police boldt wasnt going to start pawing the dirt in a turf war danny foreman was well liked both despite and because of his unorthodox approach to law enforcement to his detriment and to his favor he played it solo whenever possible it had won him accolades and gotten him into trouble the job was as much politics as it was raw talent and foreman lacked political skills which to boldt explained their mutual respect foreman lay on a stretcher inside a thicket of blackberry bushes that grabbed at boldts pant legs a balloonlike device had been inserted into dannys mouth a woman squeezed the bag while monitoring her sports watch foreman a darkskinned african american looked wiry and older than the early fifties boldt knew him to be tired and beaten down his nap was graying now and cut short and a pattern of black moles spread beneath both eyes lending him the masklike look of a raccoon could it possibly have been as long as all that boldt was quickly caught up to date by a deputy sheriff and the paramedic both interrupting each other to finish the others sentence the deputy sheriff knew the name boldt and acted like a teenager in front of a rock star trying to impress while fawning at the same time boldt had enough headlines to fill a scrapbook but wasnt inclined to keep one he had the highest case clearance per average in the history of the seattle police department he had rumors to defeat and stories to live up to and none of it mattered a damn to him which only served to provoke more of the same foreman had apparently been hit by a projectile stun gun and subsequent to thatthese people all spoke the same way and though boldt was probably supposed to as well hed never taken up the languagethe subject was administered a dose of an unknown drug with behavioral characteristics not dissimilar to those of rohypnol the date rape drug of choice alternately known as roofies ruffies roche r rib and rope produced sedation muscle relaxation and amnesia in the victim more commonly a coed found later with her panties down than a cop on a stakeout the ambulance on the scene was having engine trouble and though a second ambulance had been dispatched efforts were being made to get this one started boldts chest tightened with anticipation as he learned that the combination of the medication and the stun gun had resulted in respiratory depression foreman had nearly stopped breathing hed been unconscious for almost fifteen minutes look what the dog drug in a blinking foreman said suddenly his voice slurred behind the drug his gaining consciousness sent the paramedic into high gear shouting out numbers like a sports announcer you took a stun dart boldt said then they roped you feel like jello no bones discounting the one i got for emma my nurse here keep it in your pants danny the woman said grinning or ill search my bag for the hemostats emma and i went to high school together we went to the same high school emma corrected for boldts sake only agent foreman graduated twentyeight years ahead of my class always technicalities with you foreman said we met outside of work emma further explained to foreman she said and here i am with my hand on your heart wish our situations were reversed its the medication loosening his tongue emma said next thing hell be proposing good part is he wont remember any of this seriously boldt asked doubtful hell sleep soon and when he wakes hell have lost most of the last few hours good god bullshit foreman said im as clear as day starting when behind him boldt heard the ambulances engine rev and a handful of halfassed cheers ive got a vague recollection of thinking a dog had bit me or a bee stung me thats about it a stakeout boldt inquired a solo stakeout budget cuts meaning you will or will not share the identity of whomever it was you were watching in that trailer ill need a kiss before i can answer that foreman added from her not you fat chance the medic said as they strapped foreman into the stretcher boldt collected more bits and pieces foreman had gone offradio while on duty which had eventually caused his own people to go looking for him bci had called king county sheriff asking for a bolobe on lookout a patrol unit had found foremans cara brandnew cadillac escaladewhich had eventually led to discovering foreman out cold in the bushes boldt was told the house trailer held a good deal of blood evidence while the emts loaded foreman into the ambulance boldt conducted a quick examination of the trailer a tubeframe lawn chair in the center of the small living room looked to be the origin of most of the blood the scarlet stains radiated out like the spokes of a wheel dirty dishes filled the sink and the television was on tuned to a rerun of con air the gloved forensics guy told boldt the only thing theyd touched was the mute button on the remote the volume was deafening boldt filed this away as important information several pizza boxes were stacked on the counter the cardboard oilstained indicating age in the back bedroom a room about eight by ten feet he took in the unmade bed and clothes on the floor we seem to be missing a body boldt said kcso csu was stenciled across the back of the mans white paper coveralls the crime scene unit of the king county sheriffs office boldt repeated do we have a body the man turned around he wore plastic safety glasses over a pinched face were told we have an earlier id made on the possible victim by the surveillance team the mobile homes rented to one david hayes male caucasian thirtyfour our guy claims hayes was observed inside this structure earlier this evening boldt experienced a small stab of anxiety he knew the name yet couldnt place it another unpleasant reminder of his being on the other side of forty your guy or bcis guy are you talking about agent foreman we are we do bcis forensics the technician clarified boldt had forgotten about the arrangement between bci and the sheriffs office spd had their own lab and field personnel the ambulance driver wouldnt let boldt ride along so he followed in the crown vic once at the hospital while they awaited processing boldt found himself a sugarandcream tea and joined foreman in the emergency room no one seemed in any great hurry to help a pro job by the look of it boldt said sounds like it whos david hayes and why is his name so familiar to me its a case were working we are you sure about that danny because i may have squirreled things for you there without meaning to i called your lieu on the way over here he said theyd assigned csu to your assault he didnt know anything about any stakeout anything about a bloody trailer you put csu into that trailer when they showed up danny didnt you this is before you lost your breath and went unconscious isnt that right hayes was paroled from geiger four days ago two years in medium two in minimum and someone wanted him more than you did whys that seventeen million reasons the light finally went on in boldts head hes the guy thats right a wire fraud case involving his wifes bank six or seven years earlier seventeen million intercepted electronically not a penny recovered a christmas party boldt said hows that i met the guy hayes at a christmas party for lizs bank sparks firing on top of sparks you were with us at the time i was in my fifth year with fraud yeah before darlenes illness before everything like eighteenhour shifts for me it was wire fraud right fucking black hole is what it was police used the term to define an unsolvable case we collared hayesby luck mostly we never recovered the software he used and we never found the money more important we never uncovered whose money it was we knew it was headed offshore but it never got there that meant someone had seventeen million bucks he was willing to lose rather than identify himself thats what interested us boldt considered this and offered unsolicited advice a cop pulling an unauthorized stakeout on a guy who helped steal seventeen million dollars is going to get asked some questions danny foreman said nothing more of the case came back to boldt it had been a bad time for him and liz he remembered that especially so we put the bloodbath in the trailer down to the rightful owners of the seventeen mil coming after hayes boldt speculated foreman changed the subject we couldnt prove the money ever left the bank bank figured it got deposited into some brokerage account papered over by hayes still inside the banks system there but not there a real whiz kid our david hayes a real wunderkind he said with the animosity of a scorned investigator boldt knew the feeling he was twentyseven at the time and the bank had basically given him control over anything with a chip inside it they even called him that chip his nickname did you write this up the stakeout boldt brought it back to the here and now no one in bci gives a shit about a cold case like this ask around i guarantee you this isnt anywhere on spds radar either tell me youre not pulling a lone ranger because you know thats how this is going to play do i want the money yes for me personally come on this is about closing a black hole nothing more and you think thats how its going to play boldt repeated what the hell were you thinking we connect the dots on this lou its going to prove me out we youre investigating my assault right spd is in on this now it almost sounded as if foreman had planned it that way boldt wouldnt put it past him you took a dive in order to get a case reopened its not like that part of boldt wanted to congratulate the man if this were the case any cop taking a hit even a lone ranger was certain to awaken the sleeping giant of the spd bureaucracy the other part of him didnt want to give foreman that kind of credit didnt want to see a friend misuse the system didnt want to believe the assault had been anything but a surprise to danny foreman most of all he didnt want to think that danny had caused that bloodbath inside the trailer and then done damage to himself in order to cover it up remember lou this was lizs bank still is right tell me they dont want their money back or maybe you dont remember i promise you liz remembers boldt felt stung by the comment and he wasnt sure why he remembered plenty just seeing foremans face and hearing his voice triggered any number of memories the cancer ward at university darlene foremans funeral a wake for her while liz healed and grew stronger a growing distance between them as foreman stopped calling and stopped returning calls what the hell happened to us boldt asked liz lived foreman answered as if hed been waiting to say this for years and perhaps he had resentment envy hang any name on it you wantthats what happened and im supposed to tell you im sorry but im not i still cant bear the thought of being around you two throws me right back into all my shit seeing you now its a good thing dont get me wrong but not with her not the two of you not together i feel cheated lou and my guess is itll never go away you want me to pass this off to someone boldt wanted nothing to do with the case nothing to do with old wounds like these it isnt like that id offer lamoia but hes tied up in a seminar two weeks of counterterrorism heaven help the enemy nah my guysll take care of this inhouse i realize it falls within city limits but cut us some slack and well save you the paperwork that doesnt sit right with me youre saying you dont want me to open this up was foreman playing him taking it away so that boldt would reach all the harder for it and why was he suckering into it its open now isnt it i know how you are leave it be lou be a pal and pass it off to my guys it still felt like an attempt at reverse psychology the paperwork finally came through and foreman was officially admitted an xray orderly arrived to escort foreman to the photo booth boldt stayed seated in the uncomfortable chair a threeweekold copy of people magazine dogeared in the plexiglas rack stephen king looking at him sideways boldt called out ill wait and see if you need a ride home foreman trundled off his walk giving away the lingering effect of the drugs boldt felt a knot in his throat still stunned that friendship could go so far wrong guilty for getting all the breaks while danny foreman had gotten none he hunkered down for a long wait thinking to call liz so she didnt wait up liz lived boldt heard the words echo around in his head like it was some kind of crime two liz boldt finished her morning run with sex on her mind it wasnt often she hungered for it like this but she seized the moment sprinting up the back steps and through the kitchen door her battle with lymphoma had taken some of the meat off her bones a few years earlier but shed filled out since and she knew her husband liked the way she looked in her running clothes she hurried into the living room where she found lou down on the carpet in front of a quiet television grunting softly through a string of situps the possibility of their joining in the shower heightened her sense of urgency the kids would be up in a matter of minutes lou had been out late on a call and consequently he was running much later than usual you got back late last night she said what happened yeah after two it was danny foreman someone took it to him pretty badly beat him up danny drugged him knocked him out cold harborview released him and i drove him home hell mend we havent seen him in ages she felt awful about it especially given darlenes death but foreman wasnt the only friend theyd lost to the shift of kids and parenting their social calendar never too full to begin with given the demanding hours of both the bank and the police department rarely included dinner with friends outside the smallest of circles lizs promotion three years earlier to executive vice president of information technology a division that prior to that promotion shed known little about had come only months after her remission from cancer and only a year and a half behind the birth of their second child yeah lou sat up and grabbed around his knees we talked about that a little hes got issues we should have had him over to dinner him and about a dozen others no i mean it she said as close as i was to darlene all those months lou stood liz couldnt remember him looking this fit he said which as it turns out is why he wouldnt have accepted anyway youre not serious totally he resents that you lived and darlene didnt she felt a spike of heat as a wave of indignation and guilt clouded her thought he said that it wouldnt have been a pleasant dinner i should say not it isnt aimed at you personally no not at all she said sarcastically cutting him off its us as a couple apparently understandable when you think about it its not understandable and its not excusable if theres a problem there its entirely our fault for not working harder when it counted did we even see him after the service of course we did a bunch of times but it obviously didnt work for him liz wondered what other tragedies lay in their wake children caused some serious waves listen i beat myself up over this last night but im all right with it i think its all yours thanks a lot she said she offered to shower first and take over the breakfast duty and he thanked her for it she had to organize sarahs tote but that wouldnt take but a minute she caught herself laying out how to juggle the next fortyfive minutes in order to carry it off smoothly no one in the family did well when the kids turned the morning into a zoo while boldt showered she dressed taking her time to get it right miles entered sleepyeyed awakened by the sound of the shower the same every morning liz slipped into autopilot dress them brush their hair while they brushed their teeth beds made breakfast going a pot of english breakfast for lou which seemed to surprise him she could tell shed be a few minutes late to work this morning but what was was she had no desire to change it over a hurried breakfast they managed fragments of a conversation dannys case she said moving around the kitchen now tidying up anything interesting that wire fraud case the seventeen million our case she said surprised the bank you introduced us once the guy they caught remember it was a christmas party i think that guy david hayes she said softly hes out on parole the first butterfly wings fluttered in her chest she moved toward the wall calendar as if interested in the week ahead a dinner date at jazz alley and a church board meeting for her piano lessons for miles and ballet for sarah again next monday parole already was it possible you didnt know had she spoken her thoughts aloud she cautioned herself steady absolutely not i would have thought the bank would have been told that you guys would all be up to speed on the lookout as it were we will im sure we are well thats dannys case sort of not really it gets complicated yes it does it must she said heading for an open chair and sitting down with the kids some things were impossible to juggle a bald eagle with a wingspan of nearly six feet soared past liz boldts twentyninthfloor office window at eye level she took it as an omen even though she didnt believe in such things lizs beliefs were rooted firmly in god and though she preached to no one not even her children she prayed her way through her trials and celebrations every day offered her an opportunity to learn something about herself sometimes strengthening sometimes testing that faith she lived to see joy in the eyes of her children to hear laughter around the house the smallest things in life proved of the greatest significance selfishness which she now felt had predestined her to cancer and to her rediscovery of faith was a thing of the past she had wrestled that demon free throwing herself into service she thought of her responsibilities in terms of a pyramid with god at the top her children and husband next her church her job her community paroled it felt like falling out of remission she had little doubt of where this was headed only how to handle it her family her job even westcorps reputation and therefore possibly the upcoming merger could all come tumbling down around her if she didnt manage this exactly right the eagle represented something frightening a phoenix david hayes risen from his own ashes her phone rang and she answered it elizabeth boldt its me paralysis her breath caught in her throat like swallowing water too fast she knew his voice instantly tommys cabin five oclock watch for anyone following coast to the side of the road open the hood like theres something wrong shut it if youre in the clear and climb back inside youve got to do this liz please im in serious trouble with the sound of the click she too hung up the phone her hand trembling her mouth dry a sickening feeling worming through her stunned she sat motionless steam wafting from the cup of decaf her eyes stung the phone purred a second time but she would not answer it feeling as if she might throw up she hooked the trash can with her foot and dragged it closer a bubble wedged in her throat tears threatened behind a screaming in her ears fingernails on a blackboard she forced prayer to replace her thought her memories relying on an invisible force that supported her it had started innocently enough not so innocent later and after that a pale quivering need a hunger of addictive proportions the wet slap of flesh and the teethgnawing cries of secreted pleasure a crime and she the perpetrator her husband the cop her office intercom chirped snapping her to the present she didnt answer it everyone everything outside this office suddenly felt like a violation anger stole through her overcame her because she knew above all else that she would do exactly as hed instructed nothing would be allowed to come between the peace and happiness she and her husband and their family had found she would end this again as she had ended it once before six years earlier in the same office she had waited impatiently behind her desk unable to get any work done before someone arrived annoyed that these things took so long it was suddenly as if with her computer frozen she had nothing to do though she knew this was untrue that there was plenty on her desk that needed her attention she couldnt bring herself to it her excuse the unresponsive screen in front of her and the resident terror that her data might be lost she brooded like a spoiled little girl angry at herself for pouting instead of getting something done finally a knock on her door and she looked up in time to see him enter a kid in his midtwenties a little pale but with sweet intelligent eyes and a habit of pursing his lips between words as he spoke as if everything he said held some secret irony for him dark hair and strong shoulders she took him for a rock climber or one of the army of twentysomethings that headed into the surrounding forests on weekends in search of extreme outdoor experiences im david it he said referring to the banks information technologies department liz boldt she held him in the same regard as she did a garage mechanic or the guy who came to fix the refrigerator at home you want my chair id like to sit in it he said i dont need to take it with me a wise guy at that she stood behind and to his left wanting to see what it was he did to her machine wanting to step in and move him away if he restored the spreadsheet shed been working on because it contained figures such bank employees should not see he typed at a speed she thought reserved for only the highestpaid executive secretaries it seemed at times his left hand typed while his right worked the mouse navigating through a dozen screens so quickly that she failed to identify a single one control panel she asked very good youre fast typing yes he said not in everything she thought him rude for the comment but wasnt about to say so wasnt about to piss off the one guy capable of getting her back to work you were working a spreadsheet yes youd like the data back if possible please its all ones and zerosanythings possible if only that were true she thought she and lou had been nearly as frozen as malfunctioning as her computer david hayes stopped what he was doing and looked back at her again she wondered if she had spoken some of her thoughts aloud was there any other explanation for that inquisitive expression of his had he asked her something and shed missed it he returned to his work at the keyboard but in that penetrating look of his she experienced both terror and excitement terror because she didnt know what shed missed excitement because from somewhere within her bubbled up a primitive urge born of flesh and nerve and the raw juices that pulsed through her she dismissed this physical response as nothing more than an errant sensation like being barefoot on a carpet and having a spark fly from fingertip to wall switch a lowenergy warmth flooded her entire body she tried her best to ignore it he left a few minutes later her data restored on the screen but not before shed made the mistake of calling out to him youre my hero this offering of hers created the opportunity for him to connect with another of those looks this time as the door closed behind him she felt herself shudder toe to head her body warming as if after a shot of liquor and she knew shed crossed some forbidden line liz skipped out of work early to make the pm deadline she drove through the nightmarish traffic that had come to own seattle the sun already sinking toward the green of the islands and the jagged gray silhouette of the olympics she called home and left a message saying that if traffic allowed she would stop by the market a cheat because she could have spoken to lou by calling his mobile little tricks she had once played so well but that now unraveled her her work schedule had become so unpredictable with the approaching bank merger that lou had taken on picking up the kids from afterschool care she still picked up miles on mondays his music night because it also happened to be sarahs ballet class and both locations fit perfectly into her later commute but tonight there would be no time for the market she repeatedly questioned her coming here as if practicing her own defense to lou knowing her keeping the date had nothing whatsoever to do with any feelings for david hayes long since over but instead with something much more basicprotecting the family preventing the past from contaminating the present david was certainly capable of using their past as a weapon so she came here out of fear and she knew that was wrong she had to preempt or coopt any attempt on his part to compromise her and she had to keep her guard up for she knew david to be a notch smarter than most and his woundedhero charm disarming she pulled over as directed along a stretch of twolane roadway bordered by a forest of cedar pine and fir hed chosen this time of day no doubt for the limited light of dusks gray wash it was as if for these few minutes a fog had descended enveloping her the ground was spongy beneath the tires she overheated a result of nerves and put down her window a tangy pine scent loamy and dark filled the car reminding her of their own family cabin on a lake she stepped out of the car in a moment of anxiousness hoping to cool off her shoes sank into the muddy grass and she leaped back behind the wheel and pulled the door shut hey lizzy she jumped i wondered if youd come david hayes stood just outside her window his black irish face was swollen and discolored with orange bruises his green eyes sparkling as she remembered by the look of the way the gray tshirt held to him jail time had been spent in the prison gym he limped around the front of the vanblue jeans and a brown leather beltand slipped through the passenger door pulling down the visor and setting both the makeup mirror and the vans rearview mirror to his liking his eyes darted constantly between liz the windshield and to both those mirrors moving with the speed of a fly sensing the swatter a mathematician and programmer david lived for calculation she knew he already had a plan that in his mind she was already a part of it this she could not allow its good of you to come he wore a single leather driving glove on his left hand she made out a ring of medical adhesive tape on that same wrist was i offered a choice she stared a little too long at his bruises and cuts and realized too late that he might take this as interest i dont remember forcing you he inspected her in a way that had once made her warm all over now it rippled fear in the form of gooseflesh i heard about you getting sick and all that it was hard on you but it isnt true you look incredible dont youre in trouble i can see that but i cant help you david you can actually if you want if you dont want then thats another thing looking straight ahead she reached for the ignition it was wrong of me to come here he reached across his right hand clasping hers preventing her from starting the van his gloved hand remained in his lap can we talk this out please she felt his temper bubble shed seen it boil a few times stand back you came here so we could talk right if not why else are you here i dont know she felt angry on the edge of tears and this made her angrier still fear i think afraid youll ruin my life no never he said just the opposite what i propose benefits us both you for your reasons me for mine that reasoning of his please get out of the car youre scaring me im not talking about running off together about jumping into bed weve done that no matter that we feel differently about it message received im talking about freeing us both she felt herself shudder she had felt free until a few hours ago now she found her own eyes wandering to the drivers side rearview mirror hoping someone might drive by she could jump out flag them down david was sure to run if she tried such a thing wasnt he i fucked up lizzy dont call me that and dont use that language with me got the wrong people mad at me i think they would have killed me except they want their money back please get out of the car for christs sake lizzy im missing two fingernails on my left hand my heads caved in he touched his head they would have killed me i wish they had youre probably wishing they had nonsense i need your help absolutely not cut a deal theyll protect you its how its done from these people i dont think so please get out of the car she repeated her eyes desperate for traffic now they described my dog buck you remember buck they described killing buck please get out she felt frantic do something he held the car keys in his right hand fingers blindly counting through them as if they were prayer beads my mother wrote me about buck she was looking after him for me said hed gotten into some bad food or something poisoned maybe im sorry about buck its not about buck its about my mother the point is they know where she lives they can get to her they will get to her if i dont cooperate these people dont care about anything but that money then give them the money and give me my keys please i cant give them the money because i cant get into the bank she felt her heart pounding grow painful you see no that is not on the table turn yourself in make a deal for protection if you turn over the money he scoffed you think anyone cares about that money other than the people after me the bank was insured the state got their conviction its over the bank would welcome the money returned believe me youre missing the point the point is that these people would welcome the money returned a few minutes liz he caught himself before he completed his nickname for her a few minutes of your time if the money transfers my mother lives do not put this onto me okay okay then who would you suggest tony who else has access to it or should i call phillip and ask for a hall pass percolating the lid still on she extended her open hand awaiting her keys you know exactly how to help your mother david it is not up to me he inhaled and threw himself back against the headrest some money then maybe get my mother on a plane or something im good for it he smiled an ironic smile i feel bad about your mother honestly i do but the solution is to cut a deal the state wont want just the moneytheyre greedytheyll want me to set up these other people the people i stole it from and for the record i did not know who they were an account is all a dummy account but there is no way there is absolutely no way i am ever going to be that stupid believe me his left hand the one with the glove shook involuntarily in his lap she felt her original intention slipping away to his reasoning there was no way she would participate in this but shed done little if anything to discourage him i love my husband i love my family she appealed to the man shed once known dont put me in this position david the keys dangled above her open palm i didnt know where else to turn think this through i have youll see the keys swung back and forth like a pendulum its going to work out she snatched the keys back though he willingly released them he said at least think about it do not call me all i ask is that you think about it he slipped out of the car looked both ways up and down the road and quietly shut the door he had disappeared into the trees by the time her trembling hand worked the key into the ignition seeing her family around the kitchen table like something out of a norman rockwell painting made liz despise herself all the more as she walked in it seemed so long ago that shed returned from her morning run eager for some playful sex in the shower sorry im late lou was already out of his chair help you with the bags his gleeful innocence caught her in the center of her chest knocking the wind out of her the shopping she stumbled i never got there got hung up at work you called from your cell ever the detective sometimes she hated him for it but not now she reserved that emotion for herself did i its possible i ran out to a meeting with the caterers phillip seems to think that because im a woman i should be in charge of food and beverage on the big night what big night miles asked expectantly at six years old he was sensing his approaching birthday party he had his fathers nose for clues she set down her umbrella hung up her coat in the hall closet and left her purse by the toaster plugging in her cell phone little rituals that began to settle her nerves better now daddy cook dinner sarah said i can see that it looks yummy it was meat loaf and green beans she loved him for all his interests jazz anything culinary film he wasnt a microwave husband he even made his pancakes from scratch he stood for her caught her chair and dragged it back she winced a grin of appreciation vaguely in his direction refusing to meet eyes her heart ready to burst rough day then he sounded cautious all of a sudden perhaps he sensed it she hoped not same old same old you hows danny whos danny miles asked is danny coming to my party a friend of ours lou answered his son and no hes not mommy and daddy are talking liz informed the children we can do this later lou announced whatd you do in school today sport first grade for miles preschool for sarah lou had once worked an illegal adoption case and ever since shed felt fragile about leaving the kidseven dropping them off at school columbine hadnt helped david hayes didnt help if anything ever pulled the marriage apart it would be the kids who would suffer the irreparable damage she thought it possible however unlikely she might even lose them to lou in a judgment she had strikes against her for all his flaws his general inability to groom himself his blind dedication to the job a sense of focus that could so distract him he would miss entire conversations a sour stomach and poor digestion that could clear a room despite it all lou came off the hero the white knight she shook her head to stop the thoughts sensing herself becoming panicky irrational nothing miles answered seven hours and you just sat there dad well and it went on like this as it did every night the kind of mindless prattle so easily dismissed one night so treasured on this particular evening when mindlessness was what she craved she sat there as an observer watching them like watching a movie lou teasing the children laughing manners being reminded him stealing glimpses of her and offering a smile and she returning it and feeling traitorous then it was dishes and miles with a broom he could barely control and sarah announcing for all she had to go potty lou sweeping the child up in his strong arms and warning her to hold it as he rushed her out of the room mommy miles said pointing down muddy shoes you leave in twos the school was teaching him all sorts of expressions like this she looked down her pulse quickening mud and grass clung to the sides of both shoes i ran out to a meeting with the caterers right and sherlock holmes flushing the toilet for sarah at first she didnt remember having climbed out of the car but then she recalled opening the hood and closing it just as david had instructed she glanced toward the living roomwhere lou would be coming fromwondering if hed already caught the mud if she tried to hide it now would it just compound her problems they both knew there was no place downtown she would pick up mud and grass like this the catering was out of a fabulous restaurant called wild ginger lou had helped her pick it no city parks between the bank and wild ginger she heard the toilet gurgle she cupped her hand beneath the faucet and splashed her blouse jumping back as if an accident dang she hollered brushing herself off her silk blouse went translucent and she made sure it stuck to her chest for she knew if anything would divert lous attention away from her shoes her wet blouse would they passed in the doorway lou said all by herself liz said i splashed lou said lucky me she hated him for being so predictable for him allowing her to take advantage like this ill change she announced i hope not he said turning her meaning lou boldt loved word games sweetheart she hadnt realized shed started crying until her vision blurred she cleared her right eye with her fingertip hormones again he looked at her oddly as if he didnt know her but seemed to buy it just the same and that hurt worse ill start the bath thanks for them he teased i know you okay no she said honestly okay he said backing away and slipping into the kitchen take your time when they finally made it to bed she realized it was horrible timing to start into this now he was talking about how tired he was having been up the night before with danny foreman she had her head buried in a church periodical a magazine with testimonies of healing and she searched the pages for guidance knowing shed pick up something if she stayed with it finally reading a piece on avoidance she placed the magazine down she gathered her courage you feel like talking for a minute he fought off a yawn and said yes he meant no but that hed try i didnt go to the caterer a feeling of weight lifted off her the childish glee of watching a hotair balloon rise into a blue sky i know a moment of incredulity you know birthday shopping right i was ready to cover for you if you needed it im thinking of getting him a sport coat he keeps asking for a coat like mine tweed maybe for his recital can you imagine a little buttondown shirt and tie tell me that wouldnt be amazing amazing she said choking back a knot in her throat reaching over and gently touching his hair it wasnt going to happen not tonight he closed his eyes and smiled lost in that imagination of his she scratched his scalp like rubbing a cat ill get the light she said um he answered already on his way to sleep three impressive danny foreman called out loudly as the paper target crept toward liz it hung from a clip attached to a belt drive allowing the shooter to replace it with a fresh one and then electronically return it to a desired distance liz was shooting thirty feet she wore eye and ear gear and a blue business suit with black pinstripes the indoor firing range was too loud for them to try to carry on a conversation but she pulled one ear off her headset and shouted above the percussion of reports hardly impressive nine in the magazine i only hit the target with three of them she pointed out the holes in the blackandwhite bottleshaped target you want a go no thanks you sure he assented pulling hearing protection and goggles off a peg on the wall and accepting the weapon a slick little nine millimeter this doesnt strike me as you liz lou gave it to me a couple years ago i protested naturally but i took a course so id know what im doing they had yet to say hello to each other liz bearing the burden of what lou had told her about dannys lingering resentment and now a renewed interest danny foreman ran the target out to thirty feet raised the gun sighted and squeezed off a single shot it struck the target low he lowered the gun studied it raised it a second time and caused liz to jerk back as he unloaded the magazine with eight incredibly fast consecutive shots he left a tight pattern very near the center circle of the target sweet he said placing down the weapon his shooting seemed charged with emotion tension hung in the air along with the bitter tang of cordite im truly sorry liz said foreman tugged the headset off whats that never mind they chased down a pair of fiberglass chairs in the waiting area in front of two vending machines and a trash can that smelled of burnt coffee grounds the sign on the wall read no smoking but there were wellused ashtrays on each of the three round tables the vinyl floor had been swabbed down with a lemonscented disinfectant foreman offered to clean her gun for her and she took him up on it handing him a gray plastic kit of swabs and oil that lou had given her along with the gun foremans big hands wrapped around the metal like talons on prey danny foreman spoke with a warm sonorous voice that liz remembered well a voice it felt nice to be around she said weve not seen much of each other have we i want you to know that darlenes passing hit us both very hard we miss hermiss you both dannyvery much i could have called should have he said i got this notion it was better to start fresha new life you know transferred over to bci bought a little place over to madison park didnt change much of anything though i miss her badly liz she wasnt the best at such discussions even among her girlfriends she preferred listening to talking and when she did speak it was to express her true opinions most of which were the last thing anyone wanted to hear theres no set time for grieving its a process but speaking as a friend lou and i would like to see more of you than we do darlene and i always enjoyed our time with the two of you and here we are his face screwed up tight yeah but its business we both know thats why you called me let me tell you something it makes it all the more difficult for me in fact she had called him to test the thickness of the ice like tossing rocks and watching them skim across the frozen surface called him to edge her boot down onto that ice and listen for the splintering cracks beneath her added weight if she misjudged or misstepped she knew the peril she faced this meeting with danny would determine how much she shared with lou believing it unfair to revisit that pain unless absolutely forced to she avoided eye contact focusing on his long fingers and the meticulous way he handled the weapon she said he wants me to get him some cash hayes were talking about just to make sure i get this right yes foreman pulled out a notebook contacted you how she ran down the events bending facts slightly to make it sound as if hayes had contacted her due to her position in the bank and the location of this facetoface how was that known to you she paused too long trying to think something up foreman filled the gap in case you forgot liz i was the investigator on the original wire fraud that put me in a lets call it a unique position that allowed me to collect all sorts of information about this case some of it relevant at the time some not the room dropped about twenty degrees she realized now that calling foreman had been a terrible mistake im sure thats true do we understand each other yes we do the ice gave way and she clung to the ragged edges half in half out lou would have to be told i cant see any reason to drag lou through any of this foreman said like a mind reader well we differ there but thats between lou and me let me clarify one point in particular and i want you to think carefully before you answer this because im going to consider it as a statement to law enforcement just so we understand each other if i can help in any way then i want to thats partly why i called you some people liz they call us first because they think that helps remove them from suspicion not that youd ever resort to such a tactic im just saying who called who doesnt matter much and the point you want to clarify you were or were not involved in any with the initial wire fraud was not there is no way this is ever coming back onto you there is nothing out there thats going to blindside me or anyone else associated with this investigation discounting personal relationships that you may or may not have had with employees of the bank im not interested in that unless it carries weight with my investigation and youre telling me it does not thats correct the edges broke free and she bobbed up to her neck the weight of her clothing pulling her down okay good then tell me about the meeting location time circumstances duration topics discussed any items exchanged you want to edit out the personal stuff thats just fine there was no personal stuff she regained some internal strength defiant in her defense im just saying what you tell me here liz is going down in my notes you understand my notes can be subpoenaed probably will be subpoenaed so a person wants to think that through i havent thought any of this through david said he needed my help he said he was afraid for his mother shed told him all this already then the money i told him i couldnt do that next time youll agree i most certainly will not you played it right believe it or not convincing but next time youll agree to pay in exchange for him leaving you alonewhich he wont well make the drop not you and thatll be the end of it it wont be the end of it you just said so yourself your role in it im talking about its complicated liz we want that money we want whoever that money belonged to more than anything we want to know how he did ithow he hid that money for so long foremans eyes were unrelenting and cold this merger he continued mtk buying out westcorp thats significant hayes switched lawyers within a week of that announcement did you know that how would i possibly know that his new team pressed hard for parole and they got it attorneyclient privilege well never know who hired those new attorneys but someone wanted hayes sprung for a reason and that reason is the merger but we announced the merger nine months ago and theyve been lobbying for an early release ever since your systems fold into mtks or the other way around i see what youre driving at all the hardwares in place if thats what youre askingand mind you this is confidential information so put your pen down foreman did so were in beta testing on the frontend system our accounts merge into their hardware we throw the final switch at a reception sunday nine pm and im in charge of the catering she thought absurdly front end whats that about both brokerage and retail operate on a threetier server system windows environment on the front endthe retail side for our account executives tellers and the like not terribly secure but easy to use a unix level that handles account management wire transfers the nuts and boltsmuch more secure and a pair of assincredibly stable and secure ibm machineson the very bottom of the stack for the account datathe balances but youre only testing the front end the windows environment is the last to be tested its the most likely to have bugs and glitches the technicians have been through the lowerlevel servers for months now we dont expect any surprises there she asked why the technical interest danny ive got to think like hayes ive got to put myself in his shoes he said he needed you to pull this off he did and what makes you special ignoring any personal connection my access security clearance yes you the only one with this clearance hardly how many others she had called for the meeting and yet they were working his agenda im not sure not sure or wont tell youll have to go above me for that sorry we dont want to get into this do we his eyes drilled into her whatever past theyd shared was briefly forgotten me explaining how it was that hayes came to you before anyone else he waited its a simple enough question liz and im forbidden from answering it i signed documents what youre asking is something i cannot doconsequences be what they may foreman set down the clean and reassembled weapon and pushed back from the table she filled the resulting silence my point in calling you was to let you know that an opportunity exists to make a deal with david your point in calling me foreman corrected was to find out how much i know hes clearly terrified at the moment and i would think youd want to jump on that foreman steamed still not recovered from her refusal im on your side dont make me jump through hoops just to understand the way this works understanding it is one thing stopping him is another and itll be impossible if i dont know what he knows and he worked there liz at the bank that puts me at a distinct disadvantage from the getgo how can i protect the other people with this clearance rating if i dont know who they are youll have to go above me goddamn it foreman slapped the table the gun jumped so did liz sorry he said composing himself his display of temper rattled her she didnt know this side of danny foreman how on earth did this case get so personal for him cut a deal with him danny if you use me use me to bring him that deal ill work on it and do it quickly because im going to lay this all out for lou and after that you know lou give me a day cant ive got to tell him tonight there are channels to go through at the bank too give me a break she offered him her own deal ill explore permission to turn over what you need our classified information if youll put together that deal once lou is involved he wont let you within a mile of david hayes dont kid yourself so well both work quickly liz proposed there are still a few hours left in the day i dont know about you but my guys dont move that fast this is the government dont forget try as if i have a choice he said and acknowledged with a sly grin that liz had won the first round four unaccustomed to such things liz suffered a bout of depression as she rode an elevator toward the fifth floor of the public safety building and her husbands office revisiting the affaircapital awas certain to disturb and disrupt lou was certain to strain and test their marriage and just the thought of that made her skin clammy her neck tense shed never once been called to the principals office but now she knew how it felt like this old public building there had been an earlier time when their marriage had shone in all its glory now the place existed in a ponderous state of absolute cheerlessness she hoped their relationship was not destined to suffer a similar fate required to check in with an attendant outside of crimes against persons liz indirectly alerted lou to her arrival and he was waiting for her as she was buzzed through the door to her relief he looked neither troubled nor angry and just seeing him made her feel better hey you she said he said nothing escorting her into his office and shutting the door seeing their childrens artwork taped and tacked to the walls and corkboard alongside crime scene photos and photocopied memos twisted liz into a knot she wantedneededto keep this businesslike yet personal honest and yet not too specific keeping in mind his feelings above her own he was certain to take this as being as much of a shock as she had when shed received that first call from david she remembered her own reaction as breathless and frightened and wanted to remember to give him a chance to recover regardless of what his steeled exterior revealed as a cop lou boldt could hide anything going on inside him she sat down and to her great relief lou turned a chair to face her forgoing his regular chair behind the desk hey there yourself he finally said she kept in mind that he questioned people for a living he turned them around on themselves to where they would confess to what they had no intention of revealing both a good listener and quick on his feet lou was not to be challenged she schooled herself not to get competitive or defensive we need to go back several years she began to the embezzlement okay but it wasnt okay and he knew that for it also marked another event in their lives she plunged in in all this time youve never asked me with whom i had the affair youve never told me he said making a point of his impression of the proper order of things i cant tell you how much i respected you for that appreciated your leaving that choice to me i know it cant have been easy none of this has ever been easy lou said for either of us i wanted to know so i wouldnt keep guessing every time we attended a bank function i didnt want to know because comparisons were inevitable and i didnt want to carry my own inadequacies around didnt want to face where id failed you didnt want to judge you for your taste in lovers and hate you for it for the record im over that stuff now its history he had a tendency to speak like this adopting phrases from his workfor the recordand subjecting her to them its david hayes she watched as the news hit him actually glad to see he couldnt carry this off with a stone face and calm exterior he paled nodded the embezzler danny foremans stakeout he nodded again pieces fitting together for him he was with it back then this is before i was promoted to oversee the department did you know anything about it at the time the embezzlement the similarity of this question to that of danny foreman bothered her she rehashed for him the known facts of the embezzlementthe wire fraud the missing seventeen million the belief that the money still resided somewhere on the banks servers and danny foremans determination to intercept any attempt to retrieve the stolen funds and the software responsible for hiding it and to identify the people whose money it had been her husband stayed with her never interrupting his ear turned slightly toward her his eyes fixed as if shed winded him david contacted me at the office yesterday and i went to see him lou nodded she wanted more from him than this any expression of his internal emotions anything but talking to a robot she described the threats hayes had received the physical beating hed taken and her insistence he go to the authorities to make a deal i took all this to danny foreman today she described we made a deal that id try to get permission to release some of the classified bank information to him if hed work on a deal to get david and his mother relocated boldt said calmly theres a saying in witness protection the difference between deal and dead is one letter right well what i want to say is im embarrassed and ashamed by all of this by everything thats happened back then now the fact he contacted me but i cant hide it wont hide it and i wont give anyone the chance to use that against me against us i know how hard this must have been for you coming here explaining this but if you expect me to thank you i dont expect any such thing do i want you to thank me no but a reaction would be nice shout at me scream at me be angry with me what are you feeling in there and why wont you show me im thinking youre the one that needs protection not thinking she complained feeling what are you feeling lou straightened up and waited for her eyes to meet his own i dont feel in this office this is not a place for that i work here i process facts i process death i occasionally allow myself to feel when i get into my car and head home but even then i turn the radio up real loud put the windows down and stay quiet about it you feel for about the first six months on this job that would be a while ago for me after that you try not to let emotion overcome reason not that youre always successful youre not what am i feeling now he continued hurt trapped concerned for you worried about danny foreman being involved because hes famous for what we call a lone ranger attitude and i dont want you caught up in that at the same time im grateful to be included i do thank you for that and while id like to be feeling more at least for your sake i find myself instead trying to jump ahead and get this thing contained because youre my wife and i dont want you in the middle of this trapped did i say trapped you did i dont know what i meant by that despite his outward façade of complacency she recognized his fixed stare he was lost to thought she felt this kind of information was better doled out in doses than dumped all at once as she had done but shed had little choice so what do we do she asked i talk to danny we sort this out and me we handle it from here liz if he contacts you again then thats where youre involved again but thatll be by phone only youre not to make any kind of physical contact with him again any kind of physical contact she resented him including that i wasnt the one who made contact i thought i explained that you went to see him lou reminded you cooperated that wouldnt look good to a judge or jury what are you talking about what if it comes down to his word against yours that you had nothing to do with the original crime were past that were way past that dont you think that just might have come out in the original trial how is the bank going to feel about you taking a meeting in secret with a convicted embezzler was the bank notified its none of their business its exactly their business its none of your business or shouldnt be she processed this and knew he was right and this filled her with an added dread ill talk to danny boldt said again she didnt want lou comparing notes with danny foreman but any thought of containing this was long gone who else has access to it the way you do thats what danny wants too im not danny i do tony does of course phillipgoes without saying maintenance he asked programmers a dozen or more for the unix system sure not the ass tonys the only programmer we have who works with the ass typically we outsource that work to ibm anyway theyre their own worlds the ass so in some ways tony larossa is more important to hayes than you except that david has a past with me he thinks he can use it to his advantage hed have to strongarm tony or try to bribe him and neither of those is even a remote possibility either is a possibility lou said these people drugged danny you said they pulled a couple fingernails off hayes they killed a dog threatened an old lady what makes tony larossa immune okay she said so tonys in the picture as well ill call him no lou said sharply youre discounting the possibility that tony was involved from the beginning tony hes my director of it she said this but felt a worming sensation overcome her tony we barbecue with tony and beth the twins were an expensive adoption boldt interrupted finishing her sentence for her the failed invitros must have run in the tens of thousands whered tony get that kind of money he makes a good living hes worth a look we all get favorable loan rates dont lump tony in with david hayes hes not that kind of person and you are stay clear of tony liz not a word until weve had a chance to run some background i didnt come here to turn the investigation over to you lou i came here to be honest with you to include you consider me now included not like this whatd you expect id let danny run you no ones running me hayes is running you or trying to going to danny before coming to me how am i supposed to feel about that she hadnt considered his professional pride might be more wounded than his husbands pride then realizing the two were impossibly intertwined she resigned herself to the fact that shed botched the whole thing from the start without thinking she asked are you alright with this conflicted i think its called sarcasm was misplaced in him like a preacher swearing i obviously failed you as a husband no matter how far in the past that kills me your taking this to danny before me also hurts and i might add makes it all the more difficult for us both unlike danny i put your safety first the investigation second whether or not i can make that happen at this late date is anybodys guess but it has to happen because i am not exposing you to this guy again i wont have his mothers murder on my conscience lou that might not make any sense to you but i want you clear on this i will be involved at least to the extent david thinks im involved i want to be cooperative i want to work this out yes but as wife and husband not informant and detective i cant make any promises at least not the one youre asking for ill need to make some calls she felt a victim again much as she had after the meeting with david lou had boxed her into something shed not seen coming and she deeply resented the way he felt it was his right to make decisions for her ill try to do whatever you and danny ask lou but i will not be excluded from the decisionmaking process you or someone is going to offer david a deal i will bring him that deal if necessary well protect the mother if we can depending on where she lives california somewhere thats more problematic but not impossible as i said i need to make some calls she felt the principal had dismissed her but she wasnt done as far as im concerned the worst thing that can happen is that we allow this to drive a wedge between us which is why danny and i are now in charge lou said because thats not the worst truth be told it doesnt even come close alone now boldt wondered why her affair had to resurface why liz had to remind him that he should feel something more than his general sense of numbness allowed over the past six years hed figured out how to hide much of this behind a carefully erected wall now despite all his emotional masonry that wall had crumbled down around him around them both boldt phoned danny foreman prepared to feel impotent and the source of anothers unspoken amusement cuckolded he lacked a cohesive strategy but knew time was of the essence danny would already be working angles that he boldt had yet to see to wait too long was to be completely excluded liz had put herself in the center of this and now boldt needed to extricate her as quickly as possible foreman didnt pick up at his office nor did he answer his mobile boldt left a pair of messages but he knew in advance that there was good reason for foremans silence danny foreman was already hard at work and boldt was playing catchup it was an unspoken rule in the boldt home that police business not be discussed and so the collision of these two worlds caused repeated violations begun the previous morning with the discussion of danny foremans assault and continued now through the postdinner kitchen cleanup as liz patrolled the table and countertops boldt parked himself in front of the sink and splashed his way through a pile of pots and dishes most of which were on their way to the kitchenaid dishwasher to his right a noisy prehistoric contraption that needed replacement the thing would outlive most dogs without ever failing but its churning swishing and occasional grinding amounted to an invasion of privacy as far as boldt was concerned so he didnt turn it on when the time came instead he eavesdropped on his son miles practicing piano its beautiful liz said finishing off a countertop with a damp sponge he sensed in her the desire to reestablish their lives as normal its astonishing boldt said his age and as little training as he has had he was wondering what came next and how he could work to separate liz from the investigation chip off the old block liz said off the old bolt she corrected amusing him for a moment even to him they felt like husband and wife again i dont have a tenth of that kind of talent he got it listening to you watching you practice as much as you do id love to take credit for any of that believe me but thats more your department more divine intervention than learned behavior hes special youre both special liz said and sarah too the wall phone rang interrupting the few moments of distraction away from the case with the chiming of those tones both husband and wife went silent caught in a pregnant pause of indecision as to who should answer and who should listen in boldt had never loved the phone considering evening phone solicitation a crime on the level of a felony and now had no desire to ever hear it ring again they both expected it to be hayes but it was laura towle inviting them to a dinner with the school board member who represented their district boldt listened onesided as liz accepted she knew that her husband supported her own passion to improve the early reading program but the intrusion registered on both their faces as liz hung up david hayes had stepped into their lives there was no getting around it not long after that they rounded up the kids and got them to bed familiar routines that settled boldts anxieties and reminded him how important this family life had become for him twenty minutes after the kids went down lizs cell phone rang and this time her face collapsed as she answered boldt edged up next to her and she cocked the phone away from her head just far enough for boldt to overhear hayes made it short and sweet she was to withdraw five thousand dollars in cash from the bank deposit it into an aluminum briefcase sold by a brookstone store in the small mall beneath the bank and carry it with her out of the bank and onto the streets additional instructions were to come by cell phone then theyre willing to deal liz said stretching the known facts the details arent worked out but theyre sympathetic to your situation theyre willing to protect you and your mother let me work this out for you david the long pause on the other end of the call seemed good reason for hope dont let me down lizzy these guys theres no deal that could possibly be good enough help me out here do this for me tomorrow four pm sharp the line disconnected twentyfive minutes later at boldts beckoning danny foreman knocked on the back door and boldt let him in he was out of breath his forehead sparkling his eyes frantic betraying a cluttered mind let me explain this foreman said looking too big for the lovingly restored parlor chair that had once been lizs greataunts he sat forward dispensing a sense of urgency that boldt found contagious boldt reviewed the hayes phone call with danny foreman as if liz werent in the room an attitude corrected after a series of glaring looks on her part he built up to a point where he felt himself capable of negotiating liz out of the money drop that hayes had requested it was then that foreman jumped in with his own news ive spoken to paul geiser any deal is predicated upon the recovery of the software or whatever means was used to hide the money as well as the identification and apprehension of whoevers money it was in the first place but thats ridiculous liz blurted out thats not a deal thats conscription hes not a cop for heavens sake paul is just a prosecutor hed have to pull some serious strings to provide permanent relocation for hayes and his mother witness protection like that is only done on the federal level boldt felt himself nodding along the state could protect an important trial witness for a matter of weeks or sometimes even months but true relocation was a matter for the justice department if he can put a racketeering charge onto whoevers got a thumb on hayes then the us attorneys office takes over and he says relocation is possible not guaranteed but possible but thats the only way its going to happen its too much liz said youre speaking for him now are you lay off danny boldt said foreman sat back and collected himself paul asked if liz would go along with us at least far enough to obtain what he calls the cloaking softwarewhatever means was used to hide the money i told him i doubted it given your involvement youve got that right lets not jump to conclusions okay liz leveled a look at both men did you tell this prosecutor about david and me danny foreman looked as if shed slapped him across the face he knows danny she said indicating boldt i told you i wasnt going to hide any of this he knows i have some juice on you yes because he asked how far we could push you and you answered how boldt asked i was clear that the degree of her involvement would probably be defined by you more than by her but you said you had juice i did but paul has no idea of the nature of that he can guess liz said no if he guesses it will have to do with internal politics because thats the way paul geiser thinks foreman looked around the room his eyes landing on the kids books and toys boldt wondered if he was thinking that had darlene lived such clutter might be on the floor of his own living room i want her to make the drop absolutely not to show goodwill to show him she means business that he can trust her hayes needs her and her security clearance in order to access these computers that makes her a constant target of possible abduction a drop like this for all we know its a trap being laid to kidnap her liz interjected then why wouldnt he have simply taken me when we met earlier he had a terrific opportunity no its not the way david operates hes not going to kidnap anyone if he cant get me to do this for him hell think of something else we do not want to lose contact with him foreman pressed liz is that contact so well give him what he wants boldt said liz asked will someone please tell me what were all agreeing to give us a chance to set it up boldt told foreman who looked as surprised as liz that he had acquiesced boldt told them exactly what he had in mind five the womens rest room down the hall will have a yellow sign out front saying its being cleaned danny foreman told liz over the phone in a calm melodious voice go in there now she walked out her office door and down the hall telling her assistant that shed be right back she doubted that the wall clock read she was scheduled to pick up the five thousand in cash at this was it a day of clockwatching over actually doing some felt a bit surreal stepping inside she was met by a woman she recognized this woman locked the door behind her and whispered clear into the echoing tile room it took liz a moment to identify detective bobbie gaynes because of the dark blue coveralls gaynes was the first woman to ever make homicide she wore her dark hair cut short and the cleaningcompany coveralls fit her loosely gaynes spoke softly your every movement will be tracked by special ops mrs b everyone on the crimes against persons unit called her this just as the lieu probably told you i need you to follow my instructions closely and do exactly as i say me and the girls urge you to ask questions whenever youre unclear well repeat or explain ourselves as necessary though time is of the essence okay we want to get this right the first time okay she waited hardly a second good liz found it hard to breathe lou had explained the operation to her but it had seemed at the time that little would be expected of her now even that little bit felt like too much gaynes continued this here is gina the woman stood about five feet and had to be a size two she had italian coloring a sweet smile and a firm handshake if you ever seen cats up on fifth you seen ginas handiwork in front of gina on the countertop between two sinks a series of open fishing tackle boxes offered a wealth of cosmetics from eyebrow pencils and blushes to hairpieces and bras a woman with dark hair average height stood next to gina her blouse unbuttoned and hanging open she looked familiar though liz felt certain theyd never met no introduction was made this woman remained firmly fixed on gina your bra size mrs b gina asked the familiarity of her addressing liz this way unsettling as if she too were a part of cap thirtytwo a liz answered embarrassed by what two nursing children chemotherapy and drastic weight loss had done to her breasts the other woman peeled her blouse off and removed her bra leaving her naked from the waist up gina positioned liz to face the mirror while she worked on this other womans face gaynes and gina wrapped the standins chest to flatten her high breasts gina explained believe it or not and im sure you will its the first thing a guyll noticethe chest what the gaynes interrupted ginas done all our so work for the past couple years best in the business special ops was a prestigious though dangerous posting the woman who had not yet been introduced by name redressed herself only then did liz realize this person wore the exact same clothes as she is this what i think it is liz asked gina asked liz for the brand and color of the lipstick she wore the cosmetologist then directed gaynes to one of the tackle boxes all the while using small pieces of foam rubber dabbed and coated in various bases and blushes to build the coloring onto the womans cheeks and brow she worked incredibly fast her hands nearly a blur gaynes reported two minutes gina explained we dont want you to spend more than five minutes in here because after that it can raise eyebrows speaking of which she grabbed up an electric razor and zipped it along the other womans brow then turned to a pair of tweezers officer malone here is going to take your place gaynes said its a bit of a tricky deal so youre going to want to play this headsup if we blow it either something happens to you or to officer malone herenot that she doesnt know the score its just that we want to give this the best shot gaynes unzipped the coveralls and handled a police radio apparently clipped to her belt one minute she announced the thing spit back at her a mans voice but not lous malone looked at liz for the first time and liz gasped aloud at this womans similarity pretty fucking good huh gaynes said slipping into her more familiar self backing up she gained just enough distance to where she could see the woman clearly the hastily applied makeup blended perfectly into the surface of this womans skin shallowing her cheeks stretching her chin transforming her looks gina put finishing touches to the hairclearly a wig that had been chosen ahead of time gaynes said malones with washington state bureau of criminal investigation on loan its a shared operation mrs b pleased to meet you malone said stretching out her hand liz boldts hand shook of its own accord as she stepped forward and greeted the nearly perfect reflection of herself malones hand was hot lizs was bone cold okay gaynes said partys over girls times up gaynes quickly briefed liz on how to execute the substitution as malone zipped herself back into a pair of housecleaning coveralls and gina placed a dark scarf over the standins head the good thing gina said calmly as she pulled the scarf forward to hide as much of the face as possible is that no one pays any attention at all to the help were invisible its straight to the elevators for us for liz who was to return to her office for exactly five minutes their behavior took on the feel of choreography and she envied them their cool her role was to be fleeting with malone carrying the brunt of the load and yet she still felt lightheaded with anticipation back in her office she shut the door and paced watching the time and wondering how it could slow so drastically only childbirth produced a slower clock than this the phone rang but she let her assistant pick up when lou was announced liz snatched it up thank goodness she said are you okay no can you go through with this yes gaynes briefed you yes three steps he said i understand the most important of which is turning around and hiding she interrupted i got that the black raincoat he said turn around once youre in there small steps exactly ive got it she said scared you bet thats good how can you say that there will be a diversion once youre out you get to that door she told me a plainclothes will be waiting for you on the other side i wish i were there now we can call this off he said his expectant voice clearly preferring this choice no i want you to catch him i want this over they had discussed this once the money was delivered hayes was guilty of extortion at that point they had the pressure to negotiate a deal to get liz out of the middle and hayes to cooperate if all went well a matter of hours and she and lou could begin the process of rebuilding times up he said everyone keeps saying that at any given moment theres one of us within three or four steps of you its her im worried about this malone girl what if he harms her how am i supposed to live with that no matter what you stay inside the bank gaynes explained that times up she said impatient now to have it over with she added she explained it lou twice ive got it be safe he said he hung up before she had the chance to tell him that she loved him maybe hed sensed it coming she thought maybe he couldnt handle that right now the buildings lobby contained westcorps flagship branch it looked like a downtown mens club with teller windows elaborately decorated in dark wood paneling reproduction partner desks green banker desktop lights brass and smoked glass chandeliers and a rich green carpet with borders of twisting gold braids the phones purred they did not ring voices traveled only a few feet wearing her black fulllength raincoat and carrying the aluminum briefcase shed purchased in the westcorp centers small mall only minutes before liz entered the branch office as nervous as on her wedding day keenly aware of the elaborate charade and her role as a participant to anyone else the banks main floor appeared no different than on any other business day but to her the abundance of familiar faces made this seem more like the staging of a christmas play she immediately identified no fewer than five familiar faces from crimes against persons two behind desks posing as bank officers one up a ladder affixing to the wall a bright orange banner offering lowinterest car loans two others just behind the bank tellers pretending to be busy with paperwork seeing their faces calmed her she approached the teller line cordoned off by stainless steel stands and retractable belts she hesitated a little too long at the small sign atop the stanchion next a young asian guy in his twenties standing in the third window over liz felt a jolt of panic i can help you the young man encouraged in all it took her a little under five minutes to get the cash withdrawn from their home equity line she tried not to be bothered by the feeling of a dozen eyes boring into her behind her a maintenance man moved aside two orange cones from in front of the revolving doors removing the closed for repair sign she identified him as detective frank mcnamara the pounding of her heart the dry mouth the stinging eyes accounted for the panic she fought to control along with the rhythmic surge of blood in her ears and the coarse sound of her breathing she stepped inside the revolving door hoisting the briefcase and pushing on the bar with both hands the lumbering carousel began to spin the glass tinted ahead of her its surface mirrored behinda new feature this had been mcnamaras handiwork the mylarmirrored glass would hide her she recalled lous instructions vividly clutch the briefcase to her chest turn toward the center of the revolving door and compress herself taking tiny footsteps careful not to jam the doors motion no one had warned her how confined this space would feel how it would shrink around her removing all the air two steps into it she sagged and thought she might pass out as a crimes against persons lieutenant boldts participation in this or any special ops surveillance even one involving his wife was strictly in an advisory role boldt was ready for undercover street work if necessary dressed in blue jeans a black sweatshirt advertising a paris jazz club and a british driving cap pulled down low on his brow the disguise was finished off with a pair of blackframed fashion glasses he looked nerdy by designa fortyyearold loner who sat on park benches feeding the pigeons in the front of his thoughts lay the possibility that the money drop was nothing more than a clever cover for the opportunity to abduct his wife never mind the special ops switchmalone for lizboldt was not going to have any abduction on his conscience pahwan riz a thirtyfiveyearold malaysian american whose mother was a fullblooded englishwoman had skin the color of a leather couch mercurial green eyes that squinted naturally in a constant suspicion and a lilting singsong voice that belied his intensity riz commanded this special operation and ran his unit like a military man under normal circumstances boldt celebrated rizs formalities admired a man who had fought racial prejudice in order to reach the coveted position of commander of a twentyfiveperson team that was regularly at high risk so offered officers the likelihood of live ammunition combat and as such drew its water from a dark well because it was made up of those willing even eager to put themselves into the line of fire sos direction of the operation came as a mixed blessing boldt occupied the cracked vinyl passenger seat of a former steamcleaning van confiscated years before in a drug bust it served as the communications command vehicle mobile headquarters for riz and his blackclad squad of commandos with the van parked on the third level of a parking garage across the street from the bank both boldt and the wheel man a guy named travis brandished binoculars trained onto the bank buildings exterior behind them on the other side of a black curtain where a bank of television monitors flickered in the dim light came the sputtering and spitting sound of radio traffic orchestrated by a dullvoiced unexcitable woman dispatcher who sat next to riz reece boldt called out using the universally accepted but incorrect pronunciation of the commanders last name as the banks revolving door moved for the first time we saw it riz confirmed the revolving door spun like a giant paddle wheel riz called out commands and the dispatcher repeated them a big guy on the sidewalk sucked on a cigarette and turned toward the revolving doors just as a woman wearing a black raincoat and carrying an aluminum briefcase stepped out from those doors and into pedestrian traffic even knowing what to look for boldt missed the switch never saw his wifes black raincoat tucked into the apex of that spinning wedge of the revolving doors phase two riz said calmly a woman dressed as liz boldt looking like liz boldt and carrying an aluminum briefcase like the one liz boldt was supposed to be carrying headed down the sidewalk as instructed boldt hoisted the binoculars even under magnification malone passed for liz boldt popped open his door and said im on channel onesix and ive got my cell keep me in the loop lieutenant riz complained too loudly for the small confines of the panel van he stopped boldt i remind you we have an operation in place you cannot must not visit your wife inside that bank not yet it could be watched i know that reece the guy made it sound like boldt had never been on a surveillance he eased the vans door shut inexplicably drawn to protect this woman pretending to be his wife once out on the street boldt quickly spotted the woman in the black raincoat walking west down the hill on madison boldt wore a cell phone ear bud in his right eara common sight on the streets now and one that made such clandestine surveillance easier than before in boldts case the ear bud wire was plugged into a portable policeband radio tucked under his jacket in his ear the dispatchers voice inquired ltb boldts radio handle he acknowledged the dispatcher then rattled off a request that boldt switch sides of the street riz didnt want anyone from the team directly behind malone boldt obeyed the request crossing with a group of southbound pedestrians tension surging through him in long waves he was thinking that malones walk was all wrong lacking both lizs elegance and the subtle but stirring sway of her hips malones efficient stride was all about training athleticism and preparation at a moments notice malone was ready to either drop to the sidewalk like a sack of cement or sprint in the opposite direction under that controlled movement was a body like a cats malone continued west on madison down toward the waterfront now directly ahead of her the streets dead end into the northsouth sidewalk that fronted elliott bay would somewhat contain her and boldt thought hayes too smart to corner himself like that so what the hell was he up to then he realized that riz was being forced to reduce the number of personnel he sent into the area for fear that in large numbers even the undercover officers might be spotted riz cut back from eight undercover officers to four on foot holding the others in positions two blocks away across the deserted stretch of parking tarmac beneath the elevated lanes of alaskan way an unmarked van of swatlike so operatives was moved into position across from the seattle aquarium it was here the aquarium a series of restaurants an imax theater that riz initially focused his personnel boldt understood rizs reluctance to accept that hayes would make things easy for them by directing liz to a ferry or a boatfully contained and so easily tracked and followeda criminals nightmare but with the middle stretch of waterfront buildings soon to be under the umbrella of rizs wellorchestrated team boldt played the contrarian riz did finally direct a few of his people toward the ferry docks but by the time he thought to do so boldt was already several hundred yards ahead of not only the closest operative but malone as well for she had stopped and stared out to sea for seven long minutes presumably under the direction of hayes as she now carried lizs cell phone her pause caused a momentary paralysis for special ops finding themselves unable to predict her next move boldt by playing against the grain ended up at the ferries well ahead of the mark and ahead of special ops also the only one already in place when malone made her unexpected move south south to the ferries the washington state department of transportationwsdotoperates the busiest ferry system in north america handling nearly seventy thousand passengers per day piers and of the seattle terminal a sprawling landscape of parking lots and docks present managers with a logistical challenge similar to that of running a small airport in constant motion teams of dockworkers and sailors and maintenance personnel food service people and housecleaners attempt to keep a fleet of thirtyone ships on a reliable schedule the two terminals operate under a surprising calm the result of a wellpracticed routine boldt faced a decision as he read from the electronic sign that listed scheduled departures slip offered a bainbridge island ferry departing at and with a short crossing time of thirtyfive minutes right or wrong boldt had to commit boarding ahead of lizmalonewas something he doubted hayes would anticipate police reacted they followed a surveillance mark they didnt arrive ahead of the mark hopeful that riz might yet sneak one or more of his undercover operatives onboard boldt believed hayes would be looking to identify those behind malone he doubted hayes would recognize him especially given the jeans the glasses and the hat pulled down over his brow but he nonetheless stopped at a tourist stand and bought two orca whale beanie babies for the kids with the white shopping bag in hand marking him a tourist he felt even better disguised head down bunched in with a dozen commuters boldt boarded the grayandwhite ferry puyallup filled to capacity as she was to be at this hour puyallup carried passengers and more than vehicles the teeming masses of commuters contributed to boldts camouflage he bought a times from a vending machine in the main cabin and headed to a window seat with a view of the boarding areas as the dispatcher barked orders boldt realized riz and his team were now scrambling to deploy undercover officers onto the ferry hayes orchestrated malones arrival at the pier to within a few scant minutes of the puyallups departure leaving her one of the last passengers to board interpreting what he heard in his ear boldt saw a single undercover bike patrol officer board the ferry behind her boldt searched his memory for a name hendersen a lanky surfer dude blond in his early thirties he wore colorful spandex bearing lance armstrongs signature and the us postal service logo a black helmet that was pointed in front and back a red backpack with a dozen zippers and a pair of stereo headphones connected to a joggers portable cd player that strapped to his chest the cd player was in fact a police radio the spaceage riding glasses he wore concealed a microphone allowing twoway conversation hendersen bobbed his head constantly as if he were listening to music the ferry left the pier smoothly malone deeply into the role of liz boldt arrived on the passenger deck the aluminum briefcase in hand among a cluster of the last passengers to board seconds behind her hendersen appeared easily spotted by his helmet malone walked the length of the ship and out through the forward doors to the bow deck lizs cell phone held tightly to her ear boldt reached inside his jacket and turned down the radios volume distracted by the clatter of dispatch with ten staircases and three decks an elevator and twentyfive hundred passengers the puyallup seemed an easy place to lose somebody once hayes manipulated her below deck it would require but a matter of seconds to stash malone into a vehicle smuggling her off the ship would prove more difficult but he put nothing past hayes given what hed seen so far an organized patient personality boldt reached hendersen and introduced himself without looking directly at the man they divided the ship in two between them hendersen taking the outside deck boldt remaining inside they would pass responsibility for her back and forth between them via the radio if she moved up or down levels whoever was following her at the time was to stay with her because radio contact could be problematic given all the steel boldt added in a whisper well aware of the many passengers surrounding them both if she heads downstairs to the vehicles get word to me somehow because thats the deal got it they split up both aware of the difficulty of having only a twoman surveillance team boldt watched hendersen head outside only yards behind malone the two visible through the passenger decks large windows like watching a silent movie boldt noticed the horizon shift as the ferry corrected course the dispatcher came onto the radio announcing that personnel would be deployed on the ground at the bainbridge island ferry terminal in the event malone disappeared onboard or later disembarked the islands law enforcement quickly proved itself ill prepared for a spontaneous undercover operation an officer was currently racing home to change into civilian clothes and to switch cars with his wife boldt asked that this man and his car be available to him in the event malone left the ferry hendersen could follow on bike if necessary it wasnt a great plan but it was all they had malone completed a full circle of the outside deck and boldt called off hendersen with a simple command sent over the radio bainbridge island drew closer the sun sank lower finally slipping behind the dramatic mountain range and delivering a thickening twilight boldt took over following malone to the ships stern where she reentered the enclosed passenger deck boldt stopped outside rather than enter behind her he glanced over the rail at the ships bubbling wake and the ruffled feathers of a group of hungry white seagulls riding the wind facing away out to sea he called over the radio to hendersen and made a second handoff stairs came hendersens blunt reply ascending repeat ascending boldt reentered in time to catch a glimpse of hendersens colorful bike uniform disappearing through a metal exit door the ferry sounded its loud horn boldt felt a jolt with the unexpected sound dusk settled softening edges blurring the horizon running color to gray boldt reached the upper level with its small cabin and larger deck malones back was turned to him as she passed outside hendersen and boldt met eyes exchanging a look as hendersen retreated down the stairs and boldt took over malone lizs phone pressed to her ear nodded faintly as she listened a family of four headed past boldt down the stairs leaving only him and one other man who sat alone with his back to boldt outside malone joined a line of others pressed against the stern rail a chill wind blew it took boldt a change of angles to spot the black wire leading from the seated mans earthe same kind of handsfree cell phone wire that he himself wore talking to whom he wondered malone boldt edged closer excitement pounding inside his chest ten feet five feet on the edge of his peripheral vision boldt saw malones movement as she glanced back over her shoulder at him boldt paused instinctively knowing something was wrong the seated man turned and boldt saw his face not david hayes but a man in his sixties with poor skin malone threw the briefcase off the side of the ferry with all her strength its brushed aluminum spun in lazy loops as it tumbled and then disappeared out of sight boldt stood paralyzed the ferry was nowhere near landfall five thousand dollars in marked bills had just been tossed overboard no matter how tempted he could not give malone awaycould not compromise her instead he casually reached inside his jacket pocket and tripped the button to speak to rizs dispatcher a moment later came the response a helicopter would be dispatched though it wouldnt be airborne for at least thirty minutes boldt was to secure a gps location from the ferrys captain asap a trickle of dread swept through boldt as he sensed a much bigger plan at work wondering if that plan still called for the abduction of malone aka liz boldt hendersen had caught boldts radio communication and waited on the main passenger deck malone remained outside in the bitter wind cradling lizs cell phone in her palm as if it held answers boldt hurried across the deck jumping a chain that forbade him from doing so and climbed the steep ladder he pounded on the heavy door to the pilothouse displaying his credentials and shield through the thick glass window a moment later he was inside relaying the ferrys latitude and longitude to riz and company he checked the ships radar surprised it picked up no boats in the immediate area no vessels of any kind hed been absolutely convinced that some kind of small craft was out there retrieving the money boldt engaged one of the deck officers throwing a string of questions at him the man small but with a thick neck and jutting jaw replied in a tight high voice the wsdot website offers ferrycamdotcom vessel watch live video of the terminals gps locating of the ferries gps boldt asked the global positioning systems satellite technology allowed pinpoint location given the exact time malone had thrown that briefcase a person could evidently visit a website that indicated the ferrys precise location on the web boldt mumbled realizing that hayes could know exactly where that briefcase had been tossed overboard or had the briefcase bought from brookstone had a transmitter already embedded in it had anyone checked for that he didnt think so boldt scrambled down the steep steel steps leading from the pilothouse and crossed to the upper sundeck realizing that hayes could already be heading for the cash he grabbed for the radio yanking it from his pocket dispensing with policy boldt asked to speak to riz when the co came onto the radio boldt said tell me liz is okay shes in a back office with one of our girls riz said were sure positive lieutenant your wifes been on the phone with him off and on for the last ten minutes malone listening in to those calls and performing as he says two guys in their twenties came through the door and into the upper deck area engaged in a heated baseball debate the only two words that boldt heard being sacrifice fly and then all at once he had it the briefcase would never be retrieved sacrifice fly hayes had tested liz directing her to withdraw the money and toss it on command and she had passed that test but there was something larger at work as well oh shit said the lieutenant known for never swearing weve been scammed reece he dug a hole and we fell into it seal the building boldt hesitated only a second knowing the trouble he was about to cause if he turned out to be wrong about this david hayes is inside the bank six boldt believed that hayes had used the money drop not only to distract police but to access the banks powerful as servers described by liz as the heart of the data system but with the office building currently locked down and everyone inside the building being funneled out a single exit proffering id and subjected to random searches boldts theory showed signs of collapse david hayes was nowhere to be seen an acneridden young man named pendleton hartsmith joined a floridcheeked irishman douglas witte who headed the banks security department the pair sat with boldt in a small conference room typically reserved for loan review it smelled of carpet glue witte explained that access to westcorps offices required a creditcardsized id card like the one liz carried each and every access was recorded by time date employee and location of entry or egress the unix servers and the ass each required additional clearance for access following nineeleven witte explained we installed palm scanners on our two hardware plants the suites that house our major servers access is limited to a very select group of executives including liz boldt thought and can we determine if that security has been breached witte said it hasnt its the first thing we checked when you called for this lockdown the ass are pristine witte popped a stick of gum into his mouth and offered some to the others hartsmith took a stick boldt passed cameras show anything your guys have already requested our pictures witte said were making dubs as i understand i see a possible conflict hartsmith said that won both mens attention were all digital here lieutenant security clearance video surveillance its all digitized information and all of it is stored on one of the four unix servers witte jumped in and explained thats what i meant by making a dub our video surveillance is stored electronically to disk think tivo we can review it straight off the disks or dub it down to halfinch tape or dvd as were doing for you and if someone got into these servers boldt said leading hartsmith on thats my point you look at it that way its a pretty fallible system boldt could see hayes having entered the building and then the processing suites but convincing the computercontrolled security system otherwise boldt suddenly wondered if that had already happened if hayes had come gotten his money and gone can you put a guard a human being one of your security guys on the doors to these processing rooms can we not rely on the technology so much it would cost id have to check check boldt said and if youre refused let me know right away he looked for cracks in his reasoning absolutely certain that hayes used the money drop as a diversion but stumped to prove it witte pulled himself out of a chair and left the small conference room hartsmiths intelligent eyes stared off into space deep in thought its problematic hartsmith said a computer controlling its own security but then again its integrated a closed system you cant get into the system to mess with it because it guards its own door but if you do get through that door boldt could see liz being forced to gain hayes access to the servers could feel her terror increasingly it seemed to boldt that if hayes could not get her to cooperate his only choice would be to kidnap her or someone else at the bank with the proper security clearance then were toast yes you erase any record of your visit and you dump any video that captured you its brilliant really except that its putting the cart before the horse but how do we know absolutely there is no absolute way but if youre asking if i think someone raided the ass today id put a good piece of change on that not having happened boldt understood then that both foreman and liz were right hayes needed liz for her palm print to gain access once inside the server suites with access to the mainframes he could not only steal his money back but erase any record hed ever been in the building clear himself of any charges and he could do it using the very same computers that were supposed to catch him perhaps today using liz to make the money drop to distract bank security and the police was nothing more than a dry run a chance for him to inspect the place to get a lay of the land and refine his plan if so theyd pick him up on the security video boldt caught up to liz still being held in a small room off the banks branch offices located on the ground floor he asked her to assemble a list of all westcorp employees and executives with security clearance to the server suites he intended to interview them all he then called in the best eyes on his squad unwilling to wait for video dubs from the bank surveillance cameras within the hour he had six officers in front of televisions carefully screening the jerky imagerystill images shot every four seconds and stored to video at shortly after pm one of the officers spotted david hayes elvis is in the building the woman announced to her colleagues a little punchdrunk from the hours of tedious viewing boldt was telephoned and awakened at home thirty minutes later boldt found himself waiting for danny foreman outside the first hill brownstone belonging to one thedona rembrandt wilson hed left two messages for foreman as well as sending a page and felt confident that rain or shine danny foreman would meet him there given the gravity of the find he tried foremans cell phone one last time and finally elected to make the interview alone hed left liz at home with the kids but not before placing a team of uniformed patrol officers one on foot one in the cruiser to watch his own house boldt remained convinced hayes intended to abduct her he wasnt about to leave her unwatched and unguarded thedona wilson an african american woman with good bone structure and large hands required boldt not only to show his identification but to pass his credentials through her chained front door allowing her to make a call downtown by the time she admitted boldt and showed him into the living room she was dressed in a white satin robe tied tightly around the waist and was sipping herbal tea she offered nothing to boldt viewing him with skepticism until boldt placed some photocopied images in front of her and happened to mention that elizabeth boldt was his wife at that point she did in fact offer boldt tea or coffee but he declined too edgy and highstrung interested only in making some progress on the case these images captured on security video show this man the one in the hat at your desk do they not yes sir they do do you remember this man im a customer service representative mr boldt im supposed to remember faces make conversation and crosssell this man here was in his late twenties early thirties polite handsome softspoken boldt shifted uncomfortably not wanting to hear hayes described in any of these ways you leave your desk at one point then he leaves with you boldt shuffled the freezeframe images to his safedeposit box safe deposit boldt echoed yanking his notebook from his blazers inside pocket thats all i know dont remember the box number in the two hundreds i thinktwoohsix twooheight or is that an area code she tugged her robe to ensure it stayed tightly closed at her chest itll be in the log a name brindle binder she searched her memory boldt felt all the blood settle out of him like someone had pulled a cork brimmer boldt said she snapped her long fingers cracking the air brimmer first initial e a funny name everest everett e brimmer boldt said this time dryly not hayes youre sure it was brimmer he doesnt gain access without signing in without me comparing that signature card and im telling you it was brimmer for sure the signature card would allow an expert to compare handwriting if it came back hayes as he was certain it would then it would serve as probable cause for them to obtain a warrant and to drill the safedeposit box boldt assumed this effort would prove fruitless he suspected hayes had kept the cloaking softwarewhich hed used to keep the seventeen million hidden in westcorps systemin the safedeposit box he had it now and with it the ability to recover the money given use of the pseudonym brimmer bank officers had failed to identify the box as registered to hayes boldt told ms wilson hed meet her at the bank at am monday and that together they would examine the safedeposit logbook an exercise in futility he knew that name brimmer she said why the long face lieutenant its nothing boldt answered lying well in fact it was lizs maiden name elizabeth brimmer e brimmer a false identity hayes had established no doubt years ago while still a bank employee while still infatuated in love boldt wondered that name that safedeposit box connected hayes to liz and liz to the past and boldts memory to that shared past as well suddenly he felt sick to his stomach seven the struggle is not in solving this case boldt told liz who was still half asleep because to tell the truth i dont care about the embezzlement this seventeen million dollars the struggle is to protect you and to save our marriage its retaining or maintaining respect for each other making it out the other side in one piece i didnt know hed used my maiden name it borders on worship that kind of thing im thinking he probably had a shrine to you in his jail cell stop it im serious what if he did so what you dont see any shrine on this end do you im telling you the battle i face right now is forgiveness finding forgiveness that and protecting you this money i could care less im sorry she said pulling up the bedcovers experiencing a chill i woke you up it was stupid of me dont be ridiculous she called out as he crossed the bedroom to the bathroom door and dont walk away from me he turned one foot half of him into the sanctuary of excusable privacy you have every right to be upset she said dont do that he said dont manipulate me like that i am not manipulating you i mean every word of that it doesnt help things its honesty its what im thinking it has to help im just telling you i dont care about the money neither do i i care about you thats important to me to us i hate the images i have in my head the two of you together im resentful i even have them understandable dont patronize he cautioned is there a script im supposed to follow she asked im saying what comes to my head lou what comes to my heart dont condition that let me speak so speak youre mad at me she said i accept that there you go again im not going anywhere she fired back bitterly are you is that what this is about youre the only one whos walked out on this marriage lou i didnt this again yes i suppose so this again and again and again and i hate it as much as you dofor the record id like nothing more than to rewind and erase the tape forget it ever happened but we cant right were stuck with it were both going to have to live with it maybe forever i appreciate your efforts at forgiveness but you dont just jump there all at once its a process not a destination his mouth opened twice and he even raised his hand as if about to speak but then he pounded a fist against the doorjamb his jaw muscles knotted he choked out i dont want this well ive got news for you neither do i im going to go sleep with miles all im going to say is that if you start that kind of thing its hard to undo it so what do you want from me he asked frustrated she considered this deeply and finally waited for eye contact before delivering her response time she said boldt slept in their shared bed that night and through the weekend though fitfully if at all mercifully work saved him from his insomnia in the wee hours of monday morning the alert came from his pager at a few minutes before four the code was for an assault the address not one he recognized but he knew damn well that even the dumbest dispatcher would not page a lieutenant unless the reported crime was of incredible importance to either the department as a whole or the lieutenant personally sergeants and their squads kept oncall hours but not lieutenants he hung up the bedside phone liz spoke through a dry throat sweetheart its danny foreman boldt said whats he want at this hour not the call boldt answered correcting her the victim robberyassault someone beat him up pretty badly and robbed him i gotta go is he going to be okay i think so get back to sleep if you can im up she said you call me when you can maybe i just had to get that off my chest friday night he said meaning i feel better for having said what i said i feel more like a team all of a sudden us i mean music to my ears she said speaking of which ill pick up miles yes she said ill get them both and be home around six ill get the team back here to watch the house as soon as i can okay he was dressed now standing at the closet safe fetching his gun he slipped the blazer on tugged on his shirtsleeves she called him over and scratched out a stain cant take me anywhere he said oh i dont know about that he hesitated a moment but he leaned over then and kissed her on the lips a little peck but a kiss nonetheless and she felt like a high school girl who didnt want to wash her face for a week a mile down martin luther king boulevard boldt turned right and worked his way into the middleclass mostly black neighborhood foremans house was a modest oneandahalfstory clapboard inside the front door boldt met with the familiar smell of a crime scene male sweat he walked through the house and descended steep stairs into the dank cellar it was dark and bitter down here a tomb with stale air that carried on it the rusty tang of fresh blood clusters of halogen lights on aluminum tripods stenciled spd blinded the man who remained in the wooden chair at their center foreman sat slumped forward doing his best to hide the pain the smell of solvent stung boldts sinuses acetone it didnt make sense that sid the departments scientific identification division would fume for prints down here with rescue crews still in attendance glue duct tape and superglue answered the female half of the two personnel working on foreman wrists and ankles to each other and the chair to the floor foremans left hand was missing two fingernails accounting for the pool of blood on that side of the floor twice in a week boldt said foreman didnt react the rescue woman informed him that foreman had been given a sedative to help with the pain the basement space was small with little room for more than a heating system a hotwater tank and a beatup washing machine add to that two light stands the chair and the man at their center the two search and rescue personnel attempting to free foreman and a pair of emts standing by half tucked under the wooden staircase and it was approaching claustrophobic foremans lip was split and his right eye swollen boldt pulled out a handkerchief and gently wiped the mans face clean foreman lifted his head and the two met eyes and boldt felt pain tingle clear through him bastards foreman managed to mutter who no fucking clue one of the emts piped up that the small spot on the right side of foremans neck was consistent with an injection they got you again rohypnol the date rape paralysis drug truth serum boldt thought foreman merely rolled his eyes he appeared ready to pass out boldt made a quick study of the basement disappointed to see so many people and so much equipment the scene was now contaminated beyond recovery the young woman said he could try his wrists now but it might hurt danny foreman tore a fourinch strip of his own flesh away he pulled so hard his face grimaced and his eyes shone but he did not cry out an emt shot forward and went to work bandaging the wounds boldt saw more blood now it was everywhere sprayed around like a kid with a garden hose boldt took in some of the odds and ends piled on a dusty shelf a faded frisbee wellworn work gloves a pair of hiking boots a waffle iron with a cracked black cord two or three cardboard boxes that boldt knew without looking contained darlenes things clothes and accessories and maybe some photo albums a hospital bracelet cut off a limp wrist three years earlier seeing the damage to the skin the rescue woman told foreman they were going to give the solvent a few minutes longer on the ankles foreman gushed through a string of expletives still under the influence the rescue worker called for boldts attention and pointed out what appeared to be the carcass of a dead bug a housefly or larva to the left of foremans chair when that bug rolled lightly a few inches across the floor boldt identified it as cigar or cigarette ash any of you smoke down here boldt stepped carefully toward the evidence no answers im going to ask all of you but this woman to leave now he instructed them on how to leave in single file being careful to set their feet down slowly and gently and only in a clear area of the floor boldt knelt down and eased the small worm of gray ash into a threebyfive manila envelope that he kept on his person for evidence collection foreman tried to speak but ended up drooling and spitting instead fuck he finally managed to moan throwing his head around like a blind man at the piano other than the pulled nails foremans hands showed no signs of struggle no indication hed fought back a moment later the rescue worker had foremans ankles free and asked boldts permission to summon her partner and the emts in order to get foreman into the waiting ambulance boldt acquiesced again trying to minimize the crime scene contamination once foreman was gone boldt searched the house now joined by the timely arrival of his own departments scientific identification division better late than never boldt told the anemic thirtyyearold wearing the blue windbreaker marked with his departments acronym the guy had thin bluish lips and the pale skin of a cadaver boldt had never seen him before the only espresso was a twentyfourhour drivethru on the other side of broadway and believe me you do not want to see me before my first espresso i believe you boldt said leading the man into the bedroom guarded by a uniformed patrol officer the bedroom was undisturbed except for the closet there boldt saw a number of shoes swept aside a hinged shoe rack swung out of the way and an empty wall safe hanging open with no sign of tampering boldt said the combination probably came sometime around the second fingernail hows that captain espresso had not seen foremans left hand its nothing boldt replied develop prints if you can inside the safe and out and keep alert for cigar or cigarette ash anywhere in the house check all the trash cans the sinks the perimeter outside id love an extinguished butt if we can find it got it the sid man replied this guys in the family on the job you understand that i got it lieutenant were all over this tell bernie lofgrin im lead you lieutenant my squad boldt would have to put this off on someone lieutenants didnt run cases but i want bernie calling me got it and try eating some red meat boldt said on his way out of the small bedroom boldt thought he heard the guy mumble fuck you under his breath but didnt return to challenge him he deserved it danny foreman had not deserved it however and boldt resolved to bring somebody in for gluing wrists together and using visegrip pliers to extract fingernails and also to learn whatever it was that his former friend and colleague danny foreman wasnt telling him eight liz skipped her run got the kids up and fed and dropped them off at school with little fanfare one of their better mornings at work now she felt the presence of her cell phone weighing on her purse hoping it might ring that she might hear from lou about danny foreman being a victim and what that meant to the investigation still caught up in the events of friday culminating in the discovery that hayes had used her maiden name on his safedeposit box she felt hypersensitive to her surroundings and the goingson within the bank asked to turn over the list of names of bank employees with security clearance to the unix and as servers liz also felt obligated to personally notify all five of them of this development not so much as a warning but as a courtesy one colleague to another she spoke to phillip in person clearing both her release of the names and letting him know that she intended to make the calls herself his reaction was positive though guarded as westcorps ceo he wanted his employees and his computer systems protected but he reminded liz no less than three times of the impending merger and how any negative publicity could affect the companys stock price with equity markets tanking many a merger had been put off or canceled outright westcorp could ill afford any such setback this late in the game lizs first warning was to go out to tony larossa her director of information technology seemingly a target for hayes since tony knew the banks computer systems inside and out and was one of a select few who could program an ibm as she decided to see tony in person as well using her security pass to allow her access to the twentyfifth floor the elevator doors slid open and she stepped through to the quiet chaos of the busiest division in the company hers with the technical transfer of the merger only days away her people were basically working around the clock and they showed it twofive as lizs it team referred to this floornever twentyfivewas of an open floor plan eleven office cubicles with walkways between them all but two were currently occupied to her right a meeting was under way in the larger of two corner conference rooms to her left the entire north end was now screened off by a wall of thick shatterproof bulletresistant glass and the buffed steel girders to support it this dividing wall had been erected after the fact post and offered but a single door accessed by one of the now infamous electronic palmscanners inside this glassedin room there was also a door accessing a second server to her left was tonys private office one of two executive offices on this floor liz approached tonys secretary a sweetfaced hispanic woman who favored a good deal of makeup can he see me she barely hesitated already moving toward his office door he could if he were here the secretary responded liz checked her watch and then the wall clock tony larossa was typically the first to arrive and the last to leave liz teased hes not allowed to be sick this week call the cdc but then the more dreaded conclusion seeped into her consciousness when you say hes not here since when not here since all morning youve called home spoken to beth called home of course no answer and his cell voice mail he missed a very important conference call with mtk no one ever heard from him which was when i heard about it and believe me i heard about it liz clarified beth didnt answer the home phone no maam the twins she said the twins must be sick beth and tony had adopted russian twins less than six months earlier you all right mrs boldt fine liz said concerned is all im sure hes all right no answer on his cell phone no you paged him i did twice now liz couldnt help but wonder if the money drop had not been more than just a distraction away from the bank had david or whomever used it to abduct tony larossa at the same time liz scribbled out her cell phone number on a yellow postit and passed it to the secretary i want to know the moment you hear from him okay and have tony call this same number as well i want to be the first to speak to him after you sure thing the secretary picked up on lizs jumpy nerves and interrupted her departure whats going on mrs boldt she avoided giving an answer understanding then how practiced lou had to have become to endure bad news without the slightest indication how he must have learned to quash his own emotions to keep himself out of it and this went a long way to explain him to her it struck her as odd that she was still learning things about him that it had taken hardship to open her eyes she crossed the room to tommy lings cubicle shed had a lot of dealings with tommy over the past year because his bailiwick was computersecurity integration tommys chinese american heritage put him a thirdgeneration american with not a twinge of asian accent he wore a sumptuous dark green wool suit and a shiny black tie against a gunpowder gray shirt with an english spread collar he looked to be in his early twenties but she knew from his employment records that he was pushing forty tommy she said you can set it up to have the system alert you when tony enters the building cant you if you say to im saying to she wrote down her office extension and cell phone number to save him having to look them up the moment he enters okay is there anything wrong she considered how to answer i have some really good news for him for the whole department and i want him to be the first to hear the answer clearly satisfied even pleased ling she returned to the executive floor before trying to reach lou by now her heart was working a little harder than normal her chest warm her face flushed she peeled off the gray suit jacket hoping to cool off the phone pinched at her shoulder its tony she told her husband without introductions hed be right at the top of my list in terms of people with access to the system what about him she heard concern in his voice she knew she was speaking too quickly but couldnt control herself hes not in so you know what they call him on twofive the rooster because hes up before everyone else its ninethirty lou liz im going to say something and i dont want to hurt your feelings but when you get excited or nervous you beat around the bush and youre doing that now and thats getting me nervous and excited so please just take a second to settle down and tell me what it is you want me to come away with from this call the reprimand and lous instinct toward professionalism had their desired effect she felt her frustration sink and her thoughts clarify she also felt a little ticked off at him for being so blunt but knew she deserved it hes not answering any of his phones more puzzling beth isnt picking up at home tony has already missed an important conference call and a meeting thats not like him she knew to allow lou time to think an emergency with the twins boldt suggested i know liz said thats what i thought too but his cell phone and his pager his secretary cant find him tony larossa hes the most wiredin guy there is okay okay what she asked feeling the heat return i agree its significant i can send a patrol unit out to their house make inquiries but more than likely theyre just broken down in a tunnel or on a bridgesomewhere that interferes with reception hospitals require you to shut off phones and pagers which brings us back to the twins or maybe its batteries it happens theres usually a pretty simple explanation for things like this either he was trying to calm her or he believed this she didnt know which she told him about having asked tommy ling to watch the system for tonys use of his access card thats good thinking lou said you must be married to a cop youll send somebody im on it he paused and then said thats what you wanted all along wasnt it me to send a unit over there her breath caught busted she thought she said im getting miles and sarah dont forget dont change the subject on me you just worked me thanks for this she hung up before giving him a chance to vent at am her office phone sounded the intercom tone and she picked up tommy ling said frantically main entrance tonys here hes had a heart attack or something youd better get down there there were times liz marveled at the speed and ease of elevators but this was not one of them she arrived on the ground floor to a sea of security shirts bent over a pair of legs she assumed to be tonys a throng of employees lined up trying to get in and chaotic shouting of nearly everyone involved she pushed her way through the attendants enough to first identify and then get a better look at tony larossa his face was a pale color shed never seen before his lips a faint blue he was either unconscious or dead hed made it through one of the two metal detectors and had collapsed a black nylon webbed briefcase lay unzipped and opened on the security inspection table it was common practice for security to search every bag it appeared that tony had collapsed in the middle of just such a search she established that an ambulance had been called verified by the sudden distant whine of a siren that grew progressively louder one of the attendants got tonys feet elevated as a woman began cpr on his chest a male guard pinched off tonys nose and administered mouthtomouth a handkerchief placed over tonys lips a low steady voice counted onetwothreefour and liz felt her chest swell and her eyes challenged by tears as this team of trained people tried to save him tonys life seemed to be passing before her eyes and she silently whispered prayers that tony not be harmed she removed all fear all claims that the images before her could in any way harm him she fought this her way while they fought theirs giving no thought to calling lou or to anything outside the sphere of this immediate need the emts swarmed inside with their equipment and wheeled stretcher and took over the cpr without missing a beat it looked to liz so rehearsed and choreographed and she realized that there were people in this world who did nothing but save other people or try to she marveled at how strange it must be to rise every morning and put on a graystriped shirt and know you will see death and injury before the sun sets what happened dilly she managed to ask the guard she knew only by his first name she saw him twice a day every day dilly was middleforties and beerbellied with an easy disposition mr larossa same as always got the green light stepped up to be checked but tripped the mag going through he indicated the metal detector and i dont know just something came over him like he pulls out his cell phone no big deal but something hammered him he just stared at it tried to pass it off and keeled over dropped like a stone three of us here not one of us got to him in time to catch him went down hard thunked his head pretty good thats the cell phone she asked stepping so easily into the role of inquisitor understanding the rush that lou felt doing this a blue nokia sat on the scratched vinyltopped table that security used for searches liz stepped up to the open briefcase papers pens several small computer disks a laptop a palm pilot device a second cell phone a small motorola flip liz glanced back and forth between the two cell phones two not one before she even placed the call to lou she knew this addition to be of significance to tonys heart attack she knew it all had to do with david and his determination to get at this money tony larossa she thought in stunned disbelief she caught lou on his way back to work hed followed the foreman crime scene with a meeting at the bank looking over safedeposit logs speaking to lou over the phone she said we have to find beth and the kids something terrible has happened nine liz came through the larossas front door timidly knowing she was on lous turf and feeling strange about it her job her assignment was to get beth to talk lou had offered to drive beth to the hospital but all she would say was that tony had told her to stay here in all their years together liz and lou had never crossed over like thislou investigating the bank liz walking into one of his crime scenes that was how it felt to her a crime scene not beth and tonys house where she and lou had attended a christening reception only a few months earlier she thought of this living room the way it had been then loud voices laughter beer and the smell of cigarettes on a passing suit kids running around in their sunday best elton john on the stereo beths tight dresses that reminded liz of sophia loren in an old filmmuch too low at the neck tailored at the waist to cling to her swaying hips too retro to qualify as retro as if she shopped the salvation army but tony wasnt much for fashion either so that visiting them left liz feeling as if shed stepped into an old blackandwhite television show the larossas had never left the late sixties beth and lou occupied the rooms love seat a plush white fuzzy carpet spongy beneath lizs shoes she saw several patrolmen gathered in the kitchen the twins were not in sight though a distant crying pulled lizs attention toward the second floor whos with the twins liz asked theyre upstairs with mary beth said to liz judging by lous relieved expression liz had extricated the first words of significance theyre both okay liz asked fine beth said dazed she told liz tony said to stay right here beth had been run over by the events her reddish shoulderlength hair usually worn with a severe flip and needing gobs of hairspray hung lifeless and tangled her large brown eyes that typically animated her speech dimmed in a squinted gloomy sadness her high cheekbones looked sunken and her plucked eyebrows always arched too high lay flat behind a scowl but nothing limited the beauty of her italian skin it possessed an almost artificial luminescence that knocked ten years off her thirtyeight liz couldnt tell how long shed been in her clothesa white turtleneck and casual black pants with an elastic waist it might have been all night she had that weary look about her on a nod from lou liz said you understand that tony collapsed beth at the bank wed like to get you to the hospital they said not to go anywhere that theyd call when it was okay to leave who boldt asked there were two of them beth said in a tight whisper her eyes locked in a stare as she relived events stayed with us all night tony was supposed to do something at the bank for them they said they were staying with us until it was done then later one of them got a call on his cell phone and they just up and left in a hurry told me not to leave the house not to use the phone until tony came home liz asked what was tony asked to do for them beth she shook her head back and forth a child not supposed to reveal a secret they gave him a phone and a disk thats all i know about it boldt wrote on the pad faster than beth was supplying answers and then tore the piece of notepaper loose and leaning across toward liz left a laundry list of questions sitting in front of her descriptions timing exactly what happened demands two cell phones liz thought there might be something to the order hed written them in she felt privileged to be included and wanted to do this right she and beth could not be considered best friends but beth had on several occasions unloaded onto her about her fertility problems talking extremely personally and graphically every relationship was viewed differently by those involved lou took her affair with david much more seriously than she ever had beth might believe them far closer friends than she did so liz proceeded combining sympathy with a forced intimacy she asked beth what they looked like and when beth stammered and began sliding back toward emotion rather than reason liz salvaged her by prodding with descriptions of her own tall fat loud dark there were two of them beth repeated her eyes darting between lou and liz lou said softly we know they told you to say nothing about it beth tonys going to get better and when he does he could be in some trouble here and no one wants to see that happen they made him do it beth shouted loudly one of the patrolmen poked his head out from the kitchen and then retreated they told him theyd hurt the twins if they didnt get a call within the hour then when they did get the call i dont think it was what they expected they panicked and took off they must have heard hed collapsed she added cautiously im afraid to leave they told me not to leave liz asked again if beth could describe them beth explained once again that there were two of them both wearing nice suits goodlooking men whom shed initially taken to be fbi agents or cops theyd arrived at the back door the night before just after dinner tony was careful wouldnt let them into the house but then when they mentioned the embezzlement investigation and that theyd rather talk in private he let them in liz repeated two men dark suits goodlooking the man who spoke the one on the left didnt have much of an accent but the other one once they were inside the door i knew something was wrong what kind of accent liz asked thick i dont know italian russian not french not spanish she glanced at lous list description and timing taken care of she moved on asking beth what happened beth wormed her fingers as she spoke they were polite at first i had no idea she was interrupted by a muted peal of joy from the upstairs the twins were clearly enjoying themselves oblivious to their mothers contained terror a floor below beth looked up toward them her face bunching as tears threatened lou asked what did they say they were doing here all i remember is that all at once they were pushing tony the other one pulled me turned me and covered my mouth it happened so quickly she rubbed her wrists where liz could see thin but deep red bruises they had the twins then i dont remember how exactly tony and i we did exactly as they asked i stayed with the children in the living room the one who couldnt speak so well watched us while the other one took tony into the kitchen there was talking but i couldnt hear for how long lou asked five minutes ten everything slows down you know did you know that slows down to where it feels like forever all i wanted was them gone to leave us alone it seemed like forever liz asked you dont know what they said to tony she saw immediately that this question frustrated lou and she resolved that before asking anything more she would wait for a signal from him the one who could speak it was something to do with the bank tony came in and told me to do whatever the man asked that all he had to do was go to the office for a few minutes everything was going to be okay as long as we did what they asked theyd stay at the house until they confirmed tony had done whatever it was they were asking him to do you said they panicked and took off lou said when was this i couldnt tell you beth said liz reminded her that lou wanted to get beth to the hospital if possible im not going anywhere beth said im not leaving the children and im not going without them and im not taking them with me you see im staying its over lou said no she replied sharply just because you say its over doesnt mean its over no of course not lou said shooting liz a quick look which she took to mean she should continue you dont know for sure what they asked tony to do she asked just something at the bank thats all that they would hurt himusif he didnt do this she looked up at lou and burst into tears i did what they told me to do liz moved over to comfort her of course you did beth its not your fault lou excused himself and walked into the kitchen a lot of male voices in there but liz couldnt make out what was said liz said gently we need to get you down to the hospital beth thats why lou asked me here marys with the twins the police can protect them better here but tony needs you right now these men wanted something from tony wanted him to do somethingwe think we know what it might have been beth jerked her head up to meet lizs eyes some of the brightness returned tonys security clearance allows him a great deal of access at the bank liz said she knew another possibility existed but didnt mention it that tony had been part of the earlier embezzlement that everything that had happened here this morning connected directly to the past just as what had been happening to her also connected to her past tonys a good man beth mumbled youve seen him with the twins he needs you beth weve got to get you down to the hospital why dont i check with mary and make sure everythings okay mary was tonys older sister and the mother of five if shes got it under control well let lou take you to see tony okay beth nodded though appeared off in another realm lou signaled a patrolwoman who came over and sat across from beth liz hurried upstairs knowing in advance that mary had everything under control finding it so she returned to the living room and won lous attention through the kitchen door she told him somewhat loudly so beth could hear beth has agreed to go see tony with you i told her thered be plenty of officers here while mary looks after the twins absolutely boldt said beth stood up from the couch and the patrolwoman hooked an arm to steady her liz said lets get you freshened up and lou will drive you over there she felt nearly desperate to get back to the bank and keep her people on point in tonys absence like it or not the merger quickly approached and her team was directly responsible for a smooth transition she contained her impatience willing to give this a few more minutes not long thereafter she pulled the boldt minivan back into the banks subterranean parking garage and her reserved spot she shut off the engine and collected her purse climbing out of the van she was immediately jolted by the ringing of her cell phone and she scrambled to answer it occupied as she was her left hand holding her purse while her right hand dug down into a pocket for the phone she jerked back but did not scream as a hand clapped over her mouth broad daylight was her first inexplicable thought the garage glowed beneath a gloomy twilight of tube lighting by the time her panicked brain registered anything beyond the time of day shed been catapulted through the vans open sliding door a bag placed over her head and a wide piece of tape slapped around her head holding it to a headrest while wedging open her mouth she heard the tinkle of keys along with the contents of her purse spill she heard her cell phone beep and the familiar sound of the vans seat belt warning buzzer but the engine did not start in the course of events her arms were yanked and taped together behind the seat although her wrists did not touch all this in a matter of ten to fifteen seconds by the time someone pinched at her eyes and pulled the fabric away her head was swooning toward unconsciousness she heard a sound she assumed to be the glove box followed by another familiar sound she couldnt place she struggled attempting to whip her head side to side her initial fear was rapethese were men and she was a woman and shed been immobilized and her hands taped apart her ankles were bound too now that she thought to try to move them but sitting up in the backseat of a car when the first of the two eyeholes was cut away and she saw the front seat of the van empty she braced herself expecting to be groped or molested instead her vision was temporarily blocked as a hairy wrist crossed its path and a second eyehole was cut from the fabric then she heard a metallic click thinking first and foremost of lous leatherman allinone tool a gift shed given him not too many christmases ago but a gift shed never seen him use since theyre going to cut me the thought threw her into a sudden frenzy she feared anything to do with fire drowning or cutting shed have rather gotten struck by a train or hit headon by a truck than any of those three the vans door slid shut silencing her surroundings only a small hum penetrated the vehicle she tugged at her arms but to no avail then quit altogether as she tired and took in more of her surroundings the sounds shed heard had been the operation of the vans vcr and a videotape being inserted into a deck that hid in the console between the front seats she knew this because the tiny television screen that folded down from the ceiling shone a bright blue a bold white arrow pointing to the right when the first of the sordid images filled that small screen she thought this some kind of perverse sick jokesomeone tying her up and forcing her to watch pornography terror again stole through her as she imagined some stranger sitting directly behind her in the third seat watching the video as he contemplated where to start with her but then the woman naked and on all fours her blurry bare backside toward the camera slowly turned around a mans chest and shoulders seen behind her all at once the background looked far too familiar logs a lamp a clock all at once liz couldnt breathe choked the tape and hood pressing so tightly into her open mouth she screamed but barely heard her own voice she squinted her eyes shut as that face on the screen slipped first into profile and then turned toward the cameras hidden lens but she looked again driven by a defiant curiosity the bare breasts and shoulders so familiar the hair the line of the neck the curve of the hips a face all her own for all her endless hours in this vehicle as driver liz realized she had never once sat in these backseats the minivans vcr typically ran nothing more offensive than peter pan or the wizard of oz something to occupy the kids in bumpertobumper traffic or for the nearly twohour drive up to their cabin liz looked away but found her blurry eyes wandering back to the small screen in a wave of selfloathing the video was date and timestamped in the upper righthand corner a date she would have done anything to erase from her life the camera angle possibly shot from inside the cabins closet offered an unobstructed view of the bed where liz sporting a haircut she would never have again a haircut that also dated the event once again turned to face the camera the contact of skin the silent motions captured in grainy blackandwhite the pursed lips and agonized faces all added up to an unattractive disgusting carnal dance that debased her from outside the parked van one saw only the flashing blue light from the screen playing out on a womans face wet with tears and a gaping mouth held open by silver tape as the woman struggled to be free the van rocked side to side as if driven by a strong wind inside atop the stained carpet floor lay her daughters second favorite doll a coloring book and a plastic bag of crushed goldfish crackers she felt half dead as she watched amazed at the familiarity of the whore on the tape strange coincidences even the birthmark on the outside flank of her right buttock looked just like her own my little martian her husband called it it couldnt possibly be she who had done these things her heart told her but of course her eyes proved otherwise back and forth she went wife mother sinner slut slowly in timing with her efforts to free her wrists she came to understand the effect this videotape might have on her own and her husbands careers their lives more important their children if the tape ever went public what kind of looks would the children endure from their teachers the parents of their friends how would it affect her own relationship with her children for the rest of their lives she attempted to measure the fallout if the tape were sent to phillip the date confirming a connection to david hayes at the time of the embezzlement the seattle times posted on the internet her world shrank her cell phone rang from the front seat where it had been dumped from her purse with one mighty effort the tape tore and her hands came free and only then did she see that one edge had been cleanly cut only then did she connect this with the sounds she had heard just before shed been closed inside the leatherman tool they had wanted her to free herself she tore the tape from her mouth and slipped off the hood slammed the retractable video screen up into its locked position and lunged for the phone she fell to her knees her ankles still taped help me she hollered into the phone before her mind registered that this tape must never be revealed to anyone any kind of help was the last thing she wanted a deep male voice that nearly hid the rich eastern european accent said next time you are asked to do something we will expect you to do it yourself not send a replacement cooperate and you can be the last person to ever see this tape be ready to act at a moments notice disconnected standing away from the van listening carefully one could hear along with the whine of passing traffic a womans painful sobbing from within a woman stretched thin between the past and the present a woman faced with the reality of selfloathing and the disintegration of all things good of all things held dear and sacred bared before her eyes destroyed ten boldt mumbled through an apology embarrassed humiliated even that miles had not been picked up from his piano lesson and was awaiting a ride like every aspect of private education admission to concert pianist bruce lavins afternoon session had required an application referrals a waiting list and a substantial deposit six months later miles had finally been asked to join a confusion on our end boldt said sucking up to lavin and feeling like a sycophant he realized how stupid this explanation sounded i dont run a babysitting service lavin clarified the schedule here is boldt interrupted very tight i know lavin had nearly beaten this mantra into parents preparation and punctuality were his credo as long as his students practiced and showed up on time lavin kept them in the program im on my way if it should happen again it wont boldt assured the man the cost of the course paid in full and up front was nonrefundable if a child was let go expulsions could not be appealed but the child could reapply for future sessions boldt tried liz at the office and then on the cell ready to give her a piece of his mind but when she failed to answer either phone his anger quickly shifted to concern he hadnt seen her hadnt heard from her since their meeting out at beth larossas house earlier in the day having assigned it himself he knew that the security duty amounted to a single unmarked car watching either the bank or their home depending on her location by mutual consent she wasnt to be followed unless she requested it and she was asked to make that request if her movement involved contact with hayes otherwise boldt and liz had agreed she should be allowed to have a life boldt was informed that the sienna was observed leaving the garage about twenty minutes after its return from the larossa residence that put her leaving work late morning or early afternoon no contact prior or since no contact lieutenant he tried both lines again and then on a hunch he tried home but to the same result a cop with boldts experience didnt panic it had been programmed out of him but a groundswell of internal dialogue ran as background chatter in his thoughtsseveral voices inside him competing for airtime prioritizing his responsibilities he hurried to the crown vic and challenged traffic to reach miles before lavin reconsidered and expelled him from the program he inched the car up to first hill staying on small streets with stop signs every block trying to avoid the congestion of traffic lights but he and a few hundred other drivers all had the same idea and the going remained bumpertobumper when his cell phone rang he prepared to berate liz he answered yeah hoping to project his anger so she couldnt miss the subtext lieutenant his expectations flattened he barked what is it call for you something about your daughter he called the number a cat did a somersault in his chest mindy crawford answeredsarahs ballet teacher he knew what was coming and cut in immediately interrupting her introduction of herself we messed up our pickups today he said my fault the woman paused perhaps surprised by his prescience i could drop her by your house ms crawford offered but ive another class to teach first it would be a little after seven if thats all right the ballet school was the other end of the world from madrona where boldt was heading he and miles could try to make it but her offer sounded like a better idea he told her so no problem she said so cheerfully as to instill guilt in boldt it was a problem a big problem for the boldt family he tempered some of his anger with calls first to spds metro and then king county sheriffs traffic patrol to make certain liz hadnt been in a traffic accident then he called lamoia sergeant john lamoia who had mentored under boldt for a good part of his homicide career who had stepped in as squad sergeant behind boldt after boldts promotion to lieutenant was a man who knew few bounds but got the job done yo lamoia answered boldt asked how the terrorism seminar was going unable to jump right in with a request to find his wife ive seen shit you wouldnt believe bombs the size of cigarette packs and briefcase gadgets that can zero every computer in a building this is the ultimate technoromp sarge lamoia continued to call boldt by his former rank if these ragheads get their mitts on half this shit we got big problems danny foreman said if youre our line of defense heaven help the enemy got that right lamoia understood when to rescue boldt from his own misgivings talk to me about foreskin lamoia had nicknames for everyone ive got some problems of my own boldt said grateful for the bridge lamoia offered him one i could use your help on go boldt explained his situationmiles needing to be picked up and the greater need of finding liz he didnt go into details on lizs current situation or the case in general because lamoia would have picked up most of it already the ferry surveillance had involved too many people not to get talked up in the department i can cut out of here in ten ill hit all the hot spots though i cant exactly see mrs b in a fern bar i was thinking you could check with danny foreman you should know hes fresh out of the hospital himself make up some excuse that you screwed up surveillance on my wife and dont want me finding out and wondered if he knew her tentwenty me screwing up that would fit thats good cover it was generous of him lamoia was no screwup but his reputation as a rogue player would make just about anything he said believable ironically foreman of all people a classa lone ranger would understand his situation clearly deeply concerned a different lamoia asked how worried are we here sarge theres no doubt in my mind that shes in play their first mark a guy named larossa a friend of ours through the bank keeled over of a heart attack this morning and is in intensive care the way it plays for me is that the tuneup that hayes tookthis is the night we found foreman lying in the bushes outside that trailerwas to win some cooperation from him he ends up accessing a safedeposit box where hed probably hid the software that had cloaked the embezzled money that software gets passed to larossa by whoevers now running hayes because larossa can get to the banks computers larossa didnt get the job done for them so liz moves to the top of their list she too has access to the bank computers and now shes missing that sounds like something worth a little more than a chat with foreskin dannys lead on thisat least in his mind he isand hes more than a little crazy with it its all tied up with darlene for him i wouldnt be surprised if he was running liz in some covert op that only he knows about peachy thats why i think we look there first got it lamoia hesitated before asking the obvious and if thats not happening let me get the kids home get them safe you check with danny then well worry about the next phase if there is one boldt emphasized lean on him john we dont want to waste resources and energy if dannys hiding something from us me and foreskin we got some history sarge dont worry about a thing bruce lavin met boldt out on the curb miles in tow as miles climbed in the back and buckled himself in the piano teacher came around and stepped up to boldts window boldt prepared himself to be lectured something he didnt need right then we need to talk lavin spoke in a whisper an urgency his body language punctuating his words he was a small man with wild curly hair and piercing eyes his voice crackled like the sound of a cheap radio is there a problem boldt spun around to look at miles so his son could feel the depth of his concern miles had been endlessly briefed about the level of privilege these lessons represented quite the contrary lavin said his edgy voice still hushed your son lieutenant your boy is perhaps the most musically gifted child ive ever taught and believe me said the teacher ive taught plenty he needs testingmathematically musically if he is what i think he is although id be honored to work with him you can and should do better boldt felt a fathers pride engulf him a child prodigy hed seen the same aptitude at home which had inspired these lessons in the first place hed been so prepared for lavins abuse about bad parenting that this complete reversal caught him off guard his throat constricted and he choked out you can arrange the testing of course ill have to speak to my wife is it expensive wickedly as is juilliard the man said an impish grin satisfying his sense of humor and that may be where hes headed someday sorry about the pickup boldt said we must have gotten our wires crossed lavin patted him on the arma shocking gesture from what boldt knew of himwaved goodbye into the backseat and walked back into the house boldt sat motionless the tingling sensation only now receding well aware that this was one of those moments in life he would never forgeta minutelong conversation through a car window an entirely new world unfolding before him his son a musical wizard he couldnt wait to tell liz by midnight boldt lamoia bobbie gaynes and daphne matthews had all made calls had driven the streets had checked with lizs friends lamoia reported that hed spoken to danny foreman who had professed to know nothing of lizs whereabouts but the way he said it sarge he may not be lying but he isnt solid somethings up with him boldt had the same feeling about foreman though there wasnt much to be done about it initiating anything like a formal complaint would require a good deal more than suspicion and bad feelings the boldt kitchen served as the command center with boldt acting as both dispatcher and babysitter memories of her imposed themselves an involuntary reaction to her absence making a vegetable face for the kids cucumber eyes orange mouth driving miles and sarah amid fits of laughter to school to church arriving to bed playful and daring a woman who attacked life sometimes to the detriment of her popularity a woman unafraid tested by cancer by faith by degrees her resolute composure inspired him like wind to a sailor not long ago she had suggested that should he want to retire from policing and take up his jazz piano fulltime she would support such a decision even if it meant downscaling their lifestyle a partner in full matthews and boldt shared a volatile history as coworkers who had for a single night been much more the lingering sensations of that night had carried forward years into their relationship with matthews now testing a livein arrangement with lamoiano two more opposite people existed on earth in boldts opinionnew lines had been drawn the teasing and subtle flirtation was gone for now and that somehow didnt feel right boldt considered her his closest female friend after liz a person he could share himself with honestly there was no end to his appreciation for her and what she gave back to him but the spark that existed there now flickered instead of glowed matthews stopped by the house running out of ideas of where to find liz a blue goretex rain jacket tight jeans and a crisp white shirt her hair damp but not stringy a little more fatigue around her eyes than her office hour cosmetics allowed she stood just inside the kitchen door having turned down a chair not wanting to stay boldt knew this had more to do with the current state of their friendshiptested by her decision to be with lamoiathan it did her schedule they knew each other a little too well when she brought up the unmentionable he thought it so appropriate to come from her only she could ask him such a thing daphne asked have you tried her doctorthe hospital im still hoping foreman knows where she is lou have you checked have you called is that the psychologist or the friend asking she fired back is that the detective or the husband asking her skill at twisting things around second only to her ability to keep a straight face i have not listen lou dont he said sharply she would have told me thats not something she would hide you have to turn cell phones off in hospitals she explained repeating an argument hed given liz earlier that same day emotional mirrors things drag out and take twice as long as you thought she and i went over the arrangements for picking up the kids twice this is not something she would have forgotten to do its not that its just unlike her its impossible maybe the first place you should have called was her doctor he checked his watch to see that only a few minutes had passed since his last check hed never learned how to wait well he assigned other people to wait in place of him he ordered people to wait for him but he did not wait himself now its midnight and youre not going to reach her doctor even if you tried and you know that she said interpreting his expression busted you did this intentionally didnt you waited like this she turns her phone off when shes praying too he said she could have gone to a reading room a library any place quiet and you believe that daphne made it a statement just to sting him when a pair of headlights bumped into the driveway at and they both identified lizs minivan daphne offered to leave by the front door her car parked out on the curb she said ill call off the others already moving for the front door she wont be thrilled to discover you called out the bloodhounds ill make sure its zipped up on our end and left between the two of you to handle as you want shed reached the front door talking softly for the benefit of the sleeping kids daphne could juggle a dozen balls at once while riding a unicycle i owe you he called out shut up she closed the front door quietly behind her boldt was about to charge out back when he thought better of it schooling himself to show concern not anger waiting up for her was fineexpected even attacking her was unforgivable five long minutes passed and liz had still not appeared boldt finally succumbed and headed outside on the back steps he stopped abruptly as the garage door pushed open and liz staggered out as drunk as a skidrow bum liz sputtered as she walked unsteadily forward unable to enunciate barely able to walk if i dont pee in about five seconds she looked up took in boldt as if just now noticing him and cocked her head saying oh shit she crushed a hydrangea on her way to hoisting her skirt and running her panties down to her ankles she squatted right there and urinated in the garden then rocked forward falling onto her knees and vomited hed nursed her through the evils of chemotherapy the drain of radiation the indignities brought on by childbirth but hed never seen her stonecold drunk inside the back door he got her out of her suit coat and shirt both messed with vomit and left them at the top of the stairs for the basement laundry he undressed her in the bedroom and placed her sitting up in the tub with a warm shower running she never said a word resigned to a dull stupefied embarrassment she threw up again in the tub and yet again into the toilet after he made her drink a full glass of water when the water finally stayed down he got three more glasses into her as well shunning the aspirin that would have helped a good deal but went against her convictions she passed out in bed as her head hit the pillow boldt stayed awake another forty minutes adrenalized making sure she slept on her side in case she vomited in her sleep he drifted off some time past three when boldt awoke to miles shaking him at am liz was already gone from the house having fled the humiliation flipping pancakes washing faces changing clothes making sandwiches boldt worked himself into an angry lather isolation desertion betrayal was this about david hayes thirty minutes late for work by the time hed dropped the kids he felt he deserved an explanation believed it up to her to call he snatched up the receiver with every incoming call barking into the phone while expecting to hear lizs apologetic voice over the past twelve hours burdened by little sleep and challenged by an emotional abyss boldt had traveled through concern worry anger and into the depths of infuriation it now spilled out of his pores as an acrid smell and registered in his bloodshot eyes as venom quickly moving silhouettes slipped by the glass wall of his office like shadow puppets his squad desperately avoiding him and then the call came eleven liz picked a spot familiar to her one where she felt safe comfortable and emotionally protected a place where she had come to meditate and pray during her convalescence the weatherworn bench in golden gardens park aimed toward the sound offering a wideangle view of green water lush islands and a steelwool sky that moved inland swiftly overhead boldt came around and sat down next to her thank you she began knowing what she had to do and grateful he would do this on her terms i know youre busy i dont need an apology as much as an explanation she heard him holding back as he always did afraid to expose himself to speak too quickly and later regret what he said the trouble was that in trying to play it safe he didnt play at all the sea breeze blew some stray strands of hair off her face that wet wind felt surprisingly good to her he looked out into the gray you and this bench yes she gathered her strength knowing she wouldnt find a way to cozy up to this she had to inch to the edge and then jump the only way theres a tape the sounds were the wind and her husbands breathing go on she looked up into the gray wash of sky im on the tape with david its video and its awful awful he would drag it out of her of course because he couldnt help himself twenty years of questioning people they surprised me in the van in the underground parking they taped me to a seat and made me watch he turned and touched her and she felt a jolt of electricity with the contact are you all right she felt a wash of relief come with his concern in a rush she described the terror in the van the fact theyd cut the tape to allow her to fight her way free they two of them but dont do this please dont interrogate me please dont i need a husband not a detective right now he pulled closer to her on the bench she despised herself for everything shed done to him and the marriage briefly she wished shed died from her illness and spared them both all of this its how i think he said two of them it happened quickly she told it all to him again hoping he wouldnt make her go through it for a third time and wheres the tape now in the van i havent touched it i dont want you to see it lou i dont want to see it he said but i do want to run it through the lab for fingerprints no someone will play it and i couldnt bear that he put his right hand on her leg and threw his left arm around her and pulled her to him from behind they looked like a pair of lovers but that was not how it felt to her as she shook in his hold he said bernie will handle this however i want it handled not to worry i feel awful i understand that but we can and will protect this the point is that i need to know as much about this tape as possible bernie can work magic with things like this trust me to handle this discreetly ill do what i have to do and nothing more they knew it wasnt me with the money she couldnt remember if shed told him about the cell phone call that came after her brain wasnt functioning correctly said i had to do it myself next timethat no one would see the tape if i did as they said im to be ready at a moments notice who has your cell number asked the detective hayes does we know that but who else outside your circle of friends her recall of the events inside the van suddenly included the beeping of her cell phone as they had that hood in place over her head she told him she thought theyd switched her phone off and back on again the chimes familiar to her he said that would explain them knowing her numbersome cell phones displayed their numbers on startup it also seems to put hayes in the clear he said for all we know hayes doesnt know about the tape himself how can that possibly be true of course he knows about it he made it thats an assumption he corrected we dont have the luxury of assumptions she released a contemptuous laugh i cant do this i cant play watson im on that tape lou someone has that tape and if i cooperate with them if i help them get this money thats breaking all sorts of laws im a sworn executive of the bank i cannot do what they ask and yet if i dont she mulled this over for the umpteenth time do you realize what happens if that tape gets out the dates on it i told you that didnt i david must have been involved in the embezzlement by then every way you look at this its bad i dont see a way out of it damned if i do damned if i dont if its not hayes extorting you then we need to know who it is thats where we start and we dont get ahead of ourselves no one has asked you to do anything not yet by the time they do maybe we know who they are youd be surprised how things can turn around even in something like this the challenge for you and me is to stay above it our feelings our emotions work against us theyre probably counting on that theyre probably counting on it dividing us we cant let that happen he sounded so detached as if hed already let go of the pain associated with her sordid past i hear the detective speaking but im wondering about the husband hes out of the office lou said can you compartmentalize so easily who said it was easy theres more she said bringing herself to a place shed been unable to face alone more it came out of him as a gasp a blow to the chest youll find out anyway she said better we discuss it now but please please remember that this never had anything to do with inadequacy dont jump to that conclusion okay it was revenge i think for all the time i never got weve talked about this before it was my shortcomings not yours takes two he said i know it does and thats generous of you to say no what i have to tell you involves the date the date yes here she was about to explain something even she didnt fully understand dangerous territory she took a deep breath when all this happened back then we talked through it i agreed to call it off i remember he clearly didnt want memories forced on him but she didnt know how else to approach this he said we picked up and we started again it wasnt over she blurted out there was one more timeonly oneabout three months after our agreement he called and i dont know one of those mistakes for all time i know by the date that this was the time he videoed i dont know why he did it why i did it youre better off if you let it go he advised and now she understood just how angry he was knew he was boiling inside she couldnt broach this issue with him feeling this way i cant do this right now he said as if reading her thoughts shed dreaded this moment ever since committing the actand shed known all along this moment would someday come as it now had shed wounded him shed invalidated the sense of trust that had taken so many years to rebuild she felt awful and yet she felt a selfish relief that she feared he sensed and would only make matters worse the truth like a razor could cut painlessly at first she feared what would happen between them as he started to bleed it rained all of a sudden one minute a fine mist and then torrential the two of them on that bench unable to move and run for shelter the rain on his face looked like tears to her maybe a combination she thought paralyzed by the pain shed inflicted she understood now that she would continue to suffer for her actions as she had for nearly six years but suffer together not alone a part of her had hoped sharing this might mitigate some of that internal pain but shed lied to herself about that as well pain couldnt be shared pain was a very private thing they drove in the dead of night two people uncomfortable with the silence as well as the expectation to fill it she wore the evidence of an impossibly long day in the form of bloodshot eyes and redistributed makeup he carried the deadened countenance of a man poisoned by grief the steady sloshing of the wipers worked like background music she wanted to be home in bed the victim of a temporary eighthour suicide her brain all but used up i miss them already she said they had left the kids off an hour ago theyre safer there i know that but it doesnt make me miss them any less he said after what happened to beth and tony we dont have a choice he kept telling her things she already knew she let it go did you see their faces she asked tears and confusion a hopeful pleading that mama and daddy were not going to drive away and leave them they were laughing and playing by the time we were out of the drive count on it they love kathy and knowing my sister shell spoil them rotten its a match made in heaven lous sister unable to have children of her own doted on sarah and miles as if they were royalty liz didnt think it the best for anyone we need to think about getting him tested he said his music aptitude its something we need to think about when to do it what it means to him to us in terms of some home schooling and theres the cost of course i cant do this now she said honestly i cant pretend alls well like this between us i mean what would you rather talk about broken promises if we dont pretend its normal its never going to be she turned toward the cars rainstreaked side window studying the bars of silver and black like a cage this is coming apart on us lou uhhuh they worked through another few minutes of silence lou reached for the radio at one point but apparently thought better of it he pulled the car off the highway into a service station close to the onramp to buy himself a cup of tea and her a bottle of water i didnt mean to go back to him and i should have told you right away i know that she waited to say this until he was closing his door to head inside uhhuh he said after the door was shut back on the highway he told her im ready when youre ready i know that she said doesnt have to be now it cant be now not when im this tired and you you look sick with grief he didnt respond please dont give up okay dont shut me out so much has changed so much good has come into our lives thats worth fighting for she waited for him to say something anything when he did not she said i think id like it better if you yelled at me or something got angry if you let out whatevers inside of you how can you be so calm i am not calm then show it do something say something i need to hear it from you he said whatever excuses you have i need to hear them just confessing it isnt enough i have to understand it he tricked me he used sympathy he probably did it just to make the tape he played methats how you would put itand i gave in i regretted it at the time and i regret it now she saw anger pass across his face with the oncoming headlights so you got drunk rather than tell me the bars of the cage bent with the speed of the car she cried privately not allowing him to see he dug out a handkerchief offered it across the seat to her and she rejected it angry that he would attempt such a gesture he said you came home and made love with me and pretended it hadnt happened how could you have done that i dont know she answered honestly slap slap went the wipers for what its worth with him it was never making love it was sex an escape nothing more thats not worth anything not to me lou said though im certainly glad you made that important distinction mile markers slipped past the distance between them growing i miss them already she said yeah me too twelve boldts dashboard clock registered the colon between the numbers flashing as it counted off the seconds in the evening darkness that enveloped the cars interior less than twentyfour hours earlier he and liz had dropped off the kids and now the events of this day occupied him as he navigated around the streets clogged with traffic inventing a route that might speed his arrival to what he had been told was a bloodied cabin and possible crime scene he had not slept well if at all that prior night laboring under the strain of their discussion in the car wondering about their future feeling betrayed by their past the early morning derailed without the routine of the kids had presented them with too much time together too much opportunity to speak and nothing to discuss they settled on a truce of silence each reading a different section of the morning paper or in boldts case pretending to read work that day had been paintbynumbers one of the only times he welcomed a lieutenants paperwork the administrative meetings the indulgence of actually reading the group emails anything to occupy him without discussion without human contact he had swum around the fifth floor like a fish in the wrong school now a call from danny foreman summoned him to a cabin in the woods a cabin that foreman claimed to know about because liz herself had provided its location boldts head spun with possibilities earlier hed been thrown into turmoil over a call hed received from dr bernie lofgrin the civilian director of the police departments crime lab you got a minute lofgrin had asked im signing off on overtime vouchers and desperate for distraction boldt said not that he would have ever put off a call from bernie who was both a close friend a fellow jazz enthusiast and the sole source of all things evidentiary among several dozen active cases the lab was currently working both the foreman crime scene evidence and lizs videotape for boldt and the call could have concerned either or both boldt had been eager to learn about one extremely reluctant to hear about the other the tapes a secondgeneration copy dubbed from the original boldt clarified correct and not to worry about content for viewing i digitally obscured a central panel allowing only a half inch border to show i sampled the first thirty seconds of sound for bandwidth and signal also supports the determination of it being second generation those halfinch borders dont reveal any live action only the setting a darkly paneled or log room and a timeanddate stamp i suspect the location is a bedroom and im not asking questions im the only one who handled the tape and it remains in my possession no case number has been assigned which means you owe the taxpayers for about an hour of my time boldt thanked him knowing when bernie needed to hear it the man had taken several key steps to protecting the tape i developed four good latent prints and six partials off the videocassette itself ran them through alps he said meaning the computerized comparison automated latent print system and struck out with known felons convicted or otherwise no hits the bubble of boldts building optimism burst hed hoped against hope that some of the prints would come back for david hayes a registered felon and excon the letdown was severe well i dont mind saying thats a disappointment so i ran it through wsw the washington state workers database that included all day care instructors public school teachers most health care personnel all firemen policemen politicians their spouses and in some cases their childrens prints as well and i nailed down two then on to the state ins database immigration and naturalization service and a hit for one of the partials but ive got to caution you it would never hold in court in case thats a consideration you got a pencil boldt assured him he was already taking notessomething bernie always wanted to hear the partial comes back one malina alekseevichthats a male name by the way malina i doublechecked but as ive said we aint gonna prove its him anyway like many in the department bernie slipped into street speak whenever a situation called for it did ins happen bernie cut him off interrupting employment is listed as a driver for s g imports never heard of them your department not mine im happy to say and the two positives from wsw boldt asked he assumed one of these two identities would prove to be liz although in reconstructing events boldt knew she claimed to have never handled the tape if her prints were on it that would need explainingyet another uncomfortable discussion between husband and wife the deeper he involved himself the worse it got daniel foreman and paul geiser lost in thought recalling the conversation now boldt nearly drove off the road danny foreman and paul geiser foreman he understood the tape could have once been in foremans possession but a prosecuting attorneys prints how was that to be explained added to this was that the request boldt had received to drive out to the log cabin a possible crime scene had come from foreman things were getting interesting his cell phone emitted a single beep indicating a text message one eye on the road one eye on the phone boldt read the message as it scrolled across the phones tiny screen from b lofgrin cig ash ided from foreman cs proletarskie russian more comebl it didnt surprise him that bernie was working late the man kept all hours depending on the labs workload he assumed bernie had become excited by the discovery of foremans prints on the video and then went back and pushed his crew to work the foreman crime scene nor did it surprise him that bernie had not telephoned him his friend would assume boldt was home with the family and would not have wanted to disturb him sending a text message allowed boldt to make the choice to read it or not think about it or not boldt was certain hed find a carbon copy on his office email in the morning hopefully along with the more to come information the point that bernie seemed eager to make and one that required boldt to read between the lines was the connection between a russian with temporary immigration papers identified by a partial fingerprint left on the videocassette and a russian brand of cigarette found in the form of ash at the foreman torture as the pieces both began to take shape and to fit into place boldt found himself excited his senses heightened the russian seemed a promising lead to follow someone to interview and look at closely no matter that the evidence remained circumstantial but it was foremans role as victim as another person found to have handled that video as the man who had called boldt out on a misty dark evening that currently intrigued him suspicion worked its web boldt had to weigh how much to give foreman and how much to withhold how much to explore and how much to place aside pieces fitting was one thing the picture those pieces were a part of the story they told quite another boldt drove into the dense woods that led to the cabin he pulled the car forward and parked alongside danny foremans sparkling new escalade wondering why anyone would dump so much money into a luxury vehicle he could see there was someone inside the cabin and he assumed it to be foreman but despite the presence of the mans car he wasnt taking any chances there were too many fingernails lying on the ground in this case for him to be careless too many questions now surrounding both foreman and geiser boldt reached the edge of the trees and worked his way around back the blood pressure building in his chest and surging past his ears as a low whine he paused along the way to allow his ears to stretch and his eyes to scan the backyard was small anklehigh field grass and weeds ran up to a poured concrete patio that housed a rusted barbecue grill and twin beach chairs that had seen better days a frayed patio umbrella listed above the chairs anchored in a stack of rock and brick a can of charcoal starter caught his eye concrete steps led up to a back door that had been left open an inch not taking his eyes off the door he withdrew his weapon crossed the spongy backyard and eased the door fully open using the jamb as cover he called out danny in here it was foremans voice im at the back boldt announced playing it safe not wanting to walk into a trap let him come to me foreman entered the kitchen casually he looked tired he wore a disposable glove on his right hand but not on his left because of the two heavily bandaged fingers hey hey boldt echoed returning his gun to his belt holster foreman led the way through the tiny kitchen guy used this place as his hang belongs to a friend when liz mentioned it i knew exactly where she meant we did some surveillance out here back during the embezzlement some surveillance what kind of surveillance danny meaning boldt didnt answer like an emcee foreman swept his left arm out indicating the room before them the cabins central room was contaminated with spilled blood boldt slipped on gloves and squatted and touched a droplet on the floor it was tacky not wet but not dry less than four hours old another one boldt said noticing the two fingernails on the cabin floor next to the leg of a bloodcovered wooden chair to which the victim had been taped with duct tape all of this came into his mind effortlessly he didnt merely surmise the crime scene he saw it as an eerie blackandwhite moving image a man in the chair struggling gagged blindfolded another man in front of him a pair of visegrip pliers in hand boldt shook this image out of his head and continued to collect information i dont know about that foreman said it certainly looks like another one hayes then me now this similar but i dont know somethings not right its almost like me and hayes were clinical you know whereas this one this looks emotional angry the guy doing the deed lost it and got all wild like boldt took in the carnage i dont know at your scene we found blood on the ceiling as well the walls yeah but look at this place boldt recalled that bernie lofgrins scientific identification division had determined that foreman had probably been beaten using a plastic bag filled with wet sandthis theory supported by forensic evidence recovered at the scene at some point the bag had torn open spraying sand into the bloody mix and matching the splatter patterns boldt carefully dodged the chair and examined some blood splatter on the far wall he didnt see any sand mixed in foreman had been here longer had a head start boldt said youd think a person could maybe narrow this down by method rohypnol duct tape fingernails thats got to be a signature crime i ran it by matthews and didnt get very far i think ill try oc this time organized crime we got to ask ourselves foreman said if this vicand im assuming it to be david hayesgot up and walked away or was hauled out of here in a hefty lawn bag cause one thing that aint part of the original signature is the lack of a body i was in that chair lou and im telling you theres no way you get yourself out of this and go for a stroll but there had been no body at the trailer either it seemed odd that foreman would overlook the obvious boldt circled the bloody chair and again watched his theory play out briefly as film hayes or whoever had occupied that chair was taking a beating his head snapping left and right boldt studied the splatter patterns on the ceiling that supported this determination the blood was dense immediately above the chair and more sporadic and separated farther out from this epicenter all this made sense to him some of it did not however what do you think foreman asked as if the two were regarding a painting in a museum ive got some questions what kind of questions foreman clearly didnt like the sound of that he wanted this cutanddried he wanted his assumptionthat hayes had probably been killed in this chairfront and center questions for sid im first officer foreman declared it wont be sid itll be our guys the state bureau of criminal investigation outsourced their field detection and lab work to king county sheriffs the lab had a good reputation but boldt didnt personally know anyone there and it was the personal relationships that got investigations cleared foreman repeated what kind of questions boldt doubted then that foreman had read the preliminaries from the two other such beatingsincluding his own he wasnt sure he wanted to give something away for nothing there were answers he needed as well boldt wandered into the doorway of the adjacent bedroom and suddenly felt breathless his chest tight his imagination besieged by images it was a twin bed pulled off the wall a nightstand shoved into the corner it faced a closet with louvered panels on the folding doors boldt looked away just as quickly he asked howd you manage getting the camera into the closet what foreman answered the video its why they beat you wasnt it danny that video pulled your nails and drugged you until you coughed up the combination and location of the safe you had the video in the safe six years you kept that thing why just tell me you didnt drag it out at night and slip it into the vcr danny tell me thats not why your prints were on it boldt felt sick a combination of this bedroom the smell of blood and vomit and other images now swarming his brain he didnt need to see the video foreman let himself down into a wooden chair just outside the bedroom door i obtained the warrant through an assistant us attorney at the time i lured hayes away from the cabin with an anonymous call the hope was for data captureto record his keystrokes in all three cameras were installed each covering an area that included a phone jack because we assumed he was doing this online tech services did it for me under the protection of special operations you were with us at the time boldt said seattle police correct he used a laptop moved around we couldnt predict what room hed use i had no idea lou i went fishing and i caught the wrong fish if it hadnt been relevant it wasnt relevant a bank officer it was very much relevant for two or three days she was a primary suspect your wife im talking about the only thing that saved her the only one who saved her youre looking at him i kept the tape to myself explored what needed exploring and never surfaced her name we went through the treatments together he said meaning their wives cancer treatment and it just got harder and harder to look you in the eye and then darlene slipping and liz recovering uglier and uglier what were paul geisers prints doing on the video boldt asked trying to keep their personal history out of this but seeing clearly how entangled it all was get your story straight danny that way you only have to tell it once to hell with you foreman shouted you should have destroyed the tape you mean i should have told you about it dont you thats not what i said a bank exec is sleeping with my embezzlermy suspectand im supposed to destroy that evidence would you have destroyed that evidence six years boldt said his throat dry yes i would have the tape wasnt the only thing in my safe every scrap of information pertaining to this case was in there with it most of it burned to disk all of it gone now destroyed i dont know this is the first ive heard about the tape resurfacing a pause as foreman added it up so they got to liz again thats what youre telling me in fact boldt was telling him more than he wanted to the result of allowing his emotions to play into this was it the only tape of them yes and geisers prints i cant answer that foreman said news to me my guess would be that all the tapes at some point crossed his desk i dont have a specific memory of lizs tape being grouped with the others i do remember clearly the first time i saw it and the realizationthe needto protect you if possible my memory is that i got this tape out of the group but they were numbered at the time you know and i can see me keeping tabs on it but including it so nothing fishy surfaceda tape being noticed missingand maybe it was in the stack that crossed pauls desk early on as inventory was being matched against the warrant something like that boldt didnt like the explanationit felt to him as if foreman were making this up on the flybut he accepted it for the time being i feel a little sick boldt said probably the air it stinks in here you must have surveillance notes putting liz with hayes last week he wondered if theyd met here at the cabin was foreman aiming to involve liz no i wasnt watching this place was this credible boldt wondered a location under surveillance six years earlier and foreman doesnt chase it down when the mans released from prison i sat on the rentalthe mobile homethinking he might make a move got stung instead they got you twice and now they appear to have gotten hayes twice why risk that boldt asked why not do what had to be done the first time they werent going to torture me out in the damn woods foreman complained and these guys are smart they dont put kidnapping on the rap sheet assault maybe seconddegree manslaughter but its in the victims home its breaking and entering robbery light stuff compared with kidnapping that argument wasnt quite right but boldt didnt push it they got hayes that first time we know that by the blood type at the scene why risk why bother with a second event this stuck in boldts craw these people seemed smartas danny had just said even lizs assault in the van looked more like robbery they were carefully avoiding the charges that drew mandatory time and a maximumsecurity facility so why risk a second attack on hayes especially given that he might be being watched boldt gestured at the torture scene did you see this go down danny of course not but liz had told you about the cabin you were watching the cabin you said so thats you talking not me he added i was suckered away from here anonymous call saying i should take a meeting in town that hayes was thinking of turning i ended up stuck in a traffic jam on the id been over in bellevue missed the meet entirely fuck me boldt felt a measure of pride at having successfully distracted danny foreman away from asking again about the forensic evidence that boldt found inconsistent at the scene veteran cops rarely snuck something past one another and boldt had done just that by focusing foreman on himselfa subject most people found irresistible you know what happens when i call in the lab techs foreman asked theyre going to go room by room he said dusting developing prints boldt felt a spike of heat travel up his spine thing about latents foreman said they cant be dated they could be from yesterday or they may be six years old and they all look the same boldt paced back to the doorway and glanced into the bedroom again this time the film that played in his head had his naked wife grabbing headboards touching the bedside lamp pressing her sweating palm on the wall with her prints in the wsw database it would be only a matter of time until shed be placed in the cabin and questioned a matter of time until shed have to detail the affair with hayes he felt himself shrink and recoil would foreman now suggest or offer to destroy evidence and wipe down the cabin where was this going what was it foreman wanted i need her to go along with whatever they ask her to do foreman said there it was words hanging between them as if stopped in space and floating boldts response determined their power or impotence i need her safe boldt said you walk out of here now and theres no record of your having been here what forensics finds or doesnt find is a product of what there is to find in the first place but when the prelims on this cabin come back clean for liz youll know why she gets another call and im the first one you contact she gets asked to do something for these people and she does it no more substitutions coach if they were gonna snatch her up theyd have done it clearly shes of more use to them on the outside they arent going to harm her theyre going to use her and youre going to let them the message didnt surprise boldt but foremans edgy demanding tone did the ordeal that foreman had gone through had taken its toll boldt had no idea what it was like to have fingernails pulled no idea what that did to a person its seventeen million dollars danny westcorp was insured theyre not out a cent i know theyd love to prevent something similar from happening again but the only person who seems to really give a damn about closing this case is you as for me my concern is for liz and only liz i want her out i want her disconnected neither of us needs to relive this all it can do is hurt us what youre asking is impossible its the one thing im working against her involvement as to my condoning the destruction of evidencei cant do that either her prints or not the cabin needs to be gone over by the technicians we need every scrap of evidence there is and ill tell you why he said because this crime scenewhatever happened here whoever it happened tois wrong can i put my finger on it no i cant not yet but its wrong you dont do this twice to the same guy i just dont see professionals doing that thats why we need the technicians thats why im going to stay right here with you until they arrive lizs prints can and will be explained no matter the outcome does anyone think she possesses the strength to tie david hayes into a chair even with rohypnol not a chance she will not participate beyond serving as a comm center they want to call her fine beyond that its surrogates undercover officers and thats that youre going to make this decision for her foreman asked without her you tried to blackmail me a minute ago danny extort me for what a sixyearold case that no one cares about look in the mirror there are reasons the original investigating officer doesnt get the lead when a case resurfaces you embody those reasons youre burned out danny you blame that case for darlenes illness even for her death for all i know youre hanging on to this one and its going to take you with it let it go man pass it off to someone less personally attached is that what youre going to do foreman asked his voice steady and calm but belying an undercurrent of raw energy that raised boldts hackles practice what you preach soldier boldt felt a severe stab of pain in the center of his chest and nearly buckled over with it he was living this case something every detective knew not to do it caught up to you this kind of thing you okay foremans voice sounded distant to boldt he hadnt realized hed gone blind in one eye until the condition cleared like a window shade lifting lou fine boldt lied but he could see clearly again out of both eyes his hearing returned to normal losing that echo he realized they were like two high school kids who entered into a brawl as opponents but rose from the pile bloody and shaking hands i cant do what you ask ive got to say no to the evidence tampering and no to liz doing anything for hayes or whoevers behind this ill take what comes my way is i guess what im saying to you you want to play hardball thats up to you its not up to me said foreman never has been if theres a body out there i want to find it fast yes because maybe it leads us to who did this ahead of whatever they have planned for liz they whatever if hayes survived or if he gave up whatevers necessary to get that money back then theres only one person this is gonna come back on lou and thats liz slice it dice it i dont care its going to be liz she has access and she has history who would you come after boldt knew he was right though wanted to talk himself out of it this being wednesday evening the bank reception celebrating the merger was now just a few days away the embezzled money had to be wired out ahead of that deadline or be lost it seemed hard to imagine that by monday morning everything would be back to normal theres stuff ive got to do he said so who makes the call its wednesday night danny he held this leverage over foremansid processed evidence at all hours foremans private lab likely did not it was to both their benefits if boldt made the call if spd did the work so make the call boldt saw a flicker of thought register in foremans eyes just a flicker but enough to sense hed been had danny foreman knew hed never have his evidence in time unless spds lab handled the crime scene he had purposefully manipulated boldt into making the offer to involve spds lab the involvement of the lab would mean boldt or one of his squad would inherit the paperwork the meetings the explanations the press the analysis danny foreman had just encumbered boldt leaving himself free to pursue the money trail more to the point foreman knew boldt would not walk away from any crime scene i dont like being run danny i suckered into a phony tip or id have been here to prevent this at the very least to witness it how do you think i feel so who did that to you not me come sunday night you and liz are gonna see theres only one way to play this she walks into that bank she does what he asksthey askand we follow that money to the scumbag whos causing all this trouble you arent there yet but youll get there lou i know you will i wouldnt count on it that tape ever gets seen itll sure as hell end her career and it wont help yours any well land on our feet and ill be there to catch you sure you will danny boldt raised his phone and called bernie lofgrin directly ready to involve the lab he sensed he was making a huge mistake thirteen boldt found true police work electrifying now that he carried a lieutenants shield such moments came rarely and so when encountered proved all the more meaningful for him detection was a mathematical process and therefore very much related to his music which he thought of as a mathematical language as a detective you connected a to b and b to c and therefore a to c and around and around it went simple algebra and geometry applied to everyday problemsolving the problem had been to approach his interview of malina alekseevich with more than a hunch and a whim for boldt several disparate pieces of evidence came together in the mens room midway into his morning routine at work standing at the urinal going about his business he heard the distinct click of the doors deadbolt being thrown and glanced over his shoulder to see a woman locking the lavatory door wrong door boldt called out his right hand fishing to return himself to his shorts this is the mens room when the woman told him she needed two minutes of his time and called him by rank boldt hurriedly zipped himself up in all his years of policing hed never been ambushed in a mens room she was a handsome woman in her early thirties strongbodied and bigchested she wore her blondtinted hair as bangs in front and cropped at her shoulders lending her coif the look of a helmet he searched for a name to go with that pleasant face but couldnt find it he washed his hands as she moved over to him and spoke quickly and softly sorry for the cloakanddagger but i couldnt think how else to ensure privacy he apologized for having forgotten her name olson she replied maddie olson organized crime boldt was glad for the moment it took him to yank a couple of paper towels from the box and dry his hands for it gave him time to think hed put the request through to oc earlier this same morning attempting to establish the torture scenes as signature crimes hoping oc might have someone on file who liked to pull fingernails and now here was olson delivering information in a quirky and exceptionally unusual way he did not question her motives except to know that if shed gone to these lengths she must require an enormous amount of secrecy he realized too that she was right about her choice of methods any detective from oc visiting a homicide lieutenant was going to be noticed even if they took a minute together in a conference room the safest way was to force an encounter outside the offices but boldt went from his car to his office to his car and home he didnt offer a person like olson much chance to corral him okay im listening he said your inquiry this morning rohypnol duct tape and fingernail extraction youre not going to get anything out of oc on that im not he said trying to follow her no youll nudge us again in another few days and we still wont have an answer for you i dont have a few days i know that im in the cubicle next to marcel i overheard your request marcel malvone on oc nearly as long as boldt had been homicide boldt had taken the request to malvone directly knowing that penetrating ocs hierarchy could be difficult at best olson glanced quickly toward the mens room door as if expecting an interruption she then turned on the water in the sink to increase the background noise boldt felt his palms sweat he dried them on a fresh paper towel the thing about oc she said were worse than internal investigations half the time we live by the covenant no one can protect you better than you can protect yourself its not so much about misinformation as it is disinformation when someone pushes a hot button we make sure that information is lost i pushed a hot button boldt said working with what she was telling him no ones going to give you this if im proved wrong so much the better but when i overheard your time constraints i decided to act maybe you repay the favor someday will if i can that signature youre looking for would come back for a ci civilian informant thats currently working a case for us no way anyones going to give him up for you and yours no one but you but me she confessed my sisters stepson here it comes boldt thought olson had the favor ready at hand hes on the buying end of a drug deal in the backseat of a car when the skel riding passenger decides to pull a piece and blow away a corner dealer cars pulled over and everyone in the car is charged with manslaughter except the shooter who wins himself a capital murder charge my nephews a good kid wrong place wrong time drugs he deserves a bad rap maybe some time but not the manslaughter boldt actually knew of the case he promised to look into it to do his best thats all i ask done this ci is planted deep its a joint effort inhouse with special ops us attorneys office and ins are even in on it but this signature you described i know for a fact hes into manicures she said meaning the extraction of fingernails the rope thats news to me she meant the use of rohypnol so maybe it just skews to him but isnt him i cant say that will be malvones justification in not sharing him with youif you ever bring it back onto us the rope is not part of his gig not on his sheet they can withhold him from you for this reason but the tape and the manicuresthats him for sure the case these guys are into everything lieutenant were talking fraud smuggling black market retail money exchange money laundering anything and everything to do with a buck no drugs no prostitution nothing for narcotics or vice but racketeering shit lieutenant this guythe boss im talking about not the ciwhen they wrote the definition for racketeering they had him in mind they run a fucking empire this guy is the fucking brando of the russian immigrant community and hes dangerous capital d that would be another reason they wouldnt steer you into this its a fucking oneway street to the graveyard to mess with these people our guy our plant hes a gold mine constantly funneling information reliable bankable good information compromising him would be a serious setback were picking up foreign networks massive laundering the mother lode thats how i know youll never get him out of us a crashing sound as someone banged into the door expecting it to open this was followed by a sharp knocking what the fuck came the complaint a name boldt asked his heart dancing in his chest the russian community shed said russian cigarettes from the ash found at foremans torture a russian name on a partial print from bernie lofgrin click click click went the pieces he loved this job she lowered her voice so that even boldt could barely hear her above the rush of water into the stained sink yasmani svengrad the sturgeon general sturgeon general boldt clarified the irregularity he imports caviar or did let me guess boldt said s g imports she leaned back impressed well yeah more banging on the door boldt shouted for the guy to cool it he said to olson your ci hes called malina alekseevich her lips parted in surprise she had nice teeth howd you know that hes sloppy boldt answered he told her to take a stall and lock the door hed knock on the bathroom door when the coast was clear boldt then unlocked the main door to a disgruntled detective who quickly changed his attitude in the presence of a lieutenant boldt hovered by the water fountain in the hall until this detective left the mens room boldt knocked and olson slipped into the hall walking quickly away never looking back the mother lode shed said and that was how boldt thought of it most of seattles former canneries and icehouses the brick boathouses and sailmaking workshops had long since been razed and replaced with coop housing restaurants or tourist traps a few structures remained some rusted some crumbling the majority along the northern shore of lake unions ship canal the last salty smell and briny taste of a history that would never return computer chips had replaced tins of smoked salmon software for softshelled crabs boldt rode in the passenger seat of john lamoias jetta as lamoia turned down an alley the southernmost boundary of ballard was a seawall containing the canal and the seagullwhitestained wooden pilings supporting it the empty lanes of litterencrusted blacktop running between vacant buildings were reminiscent of the tumbleweeded streets of the old west the wind that rose off the water whispered like sirens in boldts ear thats the place lamoia pointed out a set of barely legible numerals above a rustred door on the side of a corrugatedsteel building with a tin roof boldt removed his departmentissue glock a weapon that had replaced the beretta mm two years earlier he checked out the gun an uncharacteristic act lamoia had spent the ride over going on and on about his terrorism seminar part of a continuing education course once again expressing his concern over the devices believed to be in terrorists hands nearing the end of the course he had one last session late afternoon that he described as a field trip to watch demonstrations of some of the explosives and triggering devices but the weirdest weapon puts out something called electromagnetic pulse emp lamoias enthusiasm could make anything sound interesting you tried to explain this before boldt interrupted he was interested in technology only if it fit his own needshe didnt need to try to understand everything that was out there he dumped water on lamoias flames before suffering an explanation of emp thankfully the water rolled off lamoias back liz was sleeping with this guy david hayes boldt said six years ago when it all fell apart on me that was hayes theres a videotape a sex tape this guy svengrad may have it so if that comes up in the discussion thats why i dont want you looking surprised lamoia sighed glancing away uncomfortably youre allowed to be surprised now i am it would be nice to keep it off the internet off the evening news out of the banks next board meeting i imagine it would and you might think thats why were here i might it isnt were here to bring alekseevich in for questioning we have a partialnever mind that its inadmissible doesnt bother me we not only have a russian brand of cigarette but as it turns out s g svengrads company has the exclusive import contract for the entire west coast what we want what we need is to put a pack of those cigarettes into alekseevichs pocket that and the partial give him to us he might come voluntarily right boldt said with a snort thats a strong possibility if things go south in there no matter how badly this goes we talk our way out we walk out the people behind thisand maybe thats svengradhave gone to great lengths to avoid class a felony charges that speaks volumes i think theyre not going to hassle two cops theyre extremely careful we do our job we grab up alekseevich if hes in there and we leave not my style lamoia said id rather shoot it out despite the various burdens weighing on boldts shoulders he found room to laugh youre a bundle of laughs sarge thats what they say no thats not what they say boldt flashed him a look then what do they say i think id like to keep my job with that lamoia popped open the door and headed toward the building as they approached through a light drizzle boldt said seventeen million reasons for lying to us dont forget you think lamoia asked wondering if the embezzlement trail led to this rusting building well find out soon enough lamoia knocked and they entered a small office area containing a pair of ancient gunmetalgray steel desks loosely shaped into an l a woman receptionist in her late forties with big hair and red nails some whiteboards on the wall scribbled with colorful reminders and four large color posters all showing busty women with pink tongues caviar ads but oddly targeting readers of playboy the receptionist called through on the telephone boldt could hear an extension ring out back silicon valley lamoia said pointing to one of the girly posters a nearly naked black woman barely out of her teens working a jackhammer on a city street the implants grafted to her chest accounted for lamoias comment she wore a yellow hard hat that bore the american flag the words above her read if it smells fishy the jackhammer aimed into the seam of a superimposed can of caviar beneath which it read youre in the right placesvengrad beluga negro they were admitted into a cool warehouse that smelled sour with fish their escort was a welldressed darkly complected man in his early thirties with a fairly thick accent not alekseevich according to the sheet in boldts inside coat pocket steel mesh shelving was crowded with carefully arranged cardboard boxes the shiny gray concrete floor was marked with bright yellow lane lines courtesy of osha while overhead mercury vapor lights lent human skin a sickly green tinge to boldts disappointment the warehouse was quiet void of human activity it isnt every day we get a visit from seattles finest their escort said he had the right lingo and had done a good job of wearing down the edges of his accent all of which told boldt hed probably been in the states for some time the nice suit was somewhat unexpected though not surprising given beth larossas description of the two who had pressured her husband the man led them across the warehouse floor to a glass box of an office from where a muffled recording of a sopranos voice carried boldt liked opera their escort opened the door for them but did not enter himself the office reminded boldt of his owna space within a space and little more it was a place of business heaped with paperwork the man behind the desk was broadshouldered with pinprick black eyes a barroom nose and a saltandpepper beard carefully trimmed he too wore a dark tailored suit but a pair of more workmanlike rubbersoled black shoes revealed themselves from below the large leathertop desk a piece of furniture incongruously out of place boldt knew better than to automatically assume this man was svengrad a manager perhaps an employee fan lines edged his eyes as he rose and introduced himself general yasmani svengrad he made no offer for them to sit down and remained standing himself let me guess he said youve lost something boldt picked up a trace of british in his speech the man sucked air between his two front teetheither a tic or an attempt to fight a painful tooth boldt felt taken aback and slightly intimidated not an easy feat svengrad was a perfectly proportioned enormous man he stood six foot four or five with hands like baseball mitts but where some men looked big svengrads proportions confused the eye a trompe loeil of a man like someone from alice in wonderland but it was more than the personage prior to coming here boldt had taken what little had been passed him in the mens room and had dug first into s g imports and then into its notorious owner quickly reading up on the man courtesy of the internet the picture that unfolded explained ocs desire to turn an employee as a states witness and catalog the steady flow of information that resulted yasmani svengrad would not fall easily a decorated naval officer svengrad had proved himself a shrewd politician as well with the collapse of the former soviet union svengrad had unexpectedly transferred to oversee naval operations in the caspian sea considered an undesirable posting without political clout it was only later his true motivations had been recognized as the senior military officer in charge of the caspian he had seized control of its waters and filled a power void as management of the caspian slipped from mother russias firm grasp with no fewer than five newly formed governments claiming rights to the caspian and her allimportant sturgeon svengrad brutalized his way to dominance quickly owning the caspians lucrative multimilliondollar caviar business svengrads friends back in moscow allowed this even encouraged it as poachers nearly ended the caviar trade by slaughtering immature fish for their famous eggs and pushing the sturgeon toward extinction no doubt svengrad made sure his friends in moscow both ate and lived well for allowing a monopoly that continued to this day from what hed read boldt considered svengrad both a man of vision and one unafraid of using force to get what he wanted many a poacher vessel had been lost at sea during the early years of svengrads power grab hed settled in the united states seven years earlier and had been granted citizenship not twelve months ago a discovery that made boldt suspect either the intervention of diplomats or the exchange of hard cash svengrad had nonetheless never personally been arrested had never spent a single night in so much as a drunk tank most such teflon thugs found themselves targets of federal or state undercover investigations at some point and as far as boldt could determine svengrads time had now come boldt played it carefully they came without a warrant and he kept this firmly in mindif asked to leave they would be obliged to do so lost something were just a pair of public servants doing a favor for ins a seattle police department lieutenant and sergeant doing a favor for ins so the man knew how to read he handed back the credentials still not offering them chairs you dont think our captain doing a favor for the feds is going to send a detective to see you do you he could see that svengrad actually considered this though not for long how long do we keep this up svengrad asked boldt threw his hands out in an inquisitive gesture that asked how should i know if you have business here state it svengrad said or should i play along what can i do for ins gentlemen he asked this in a schoolgirl voice that instead of comical boldt found threatening remind me dont you need a subpoena a writ a warrant should i call a lawyer why so jumpy were here informally lamoia said jumping into the fray you are at that said the man wearing the designer suit as he looked them over do you press those yourself or send them out lamoias infamous blue jeans finally took a direct hit if boldt hadnt been working to understand and possibly undermine svengrad he might have celebrated the moment boldt calmly removed malina alekseevichs ins sheet and placed it in front of svengrad youre listed as the employer of record as i should be svengrad said not batting an eyelash were that i was boldt thought he was actually doing oc a favor by making alekseevich into a suspect and therefore above consideration as a double agent never mind that entities like oc and special operations and the ins liked to run control on their civilian informants boldt didnt see much harm coming of this svengrad continued malinas a hard worker a good man he might even have avoided being laid off if fish and wildlife had played fair laid off lamoia inquired boldt paled played fair fish and wildlife depending on when alekseevich had indeed been laid off his job they had little or no way to connect svengrad to the tortures of hayes and foreman even if alekseevich were responsible svengrad would simply claim that unemployed alekseevich had resorted to his old ways mores the pity boldt quickly looked for a bridge that might keep himself and lamoia in the room long enough to stir the pot he didnt see anything obvious he drives for us or did before layoffs svengrad answered lamoia he has not gone and gotten a parking ticket or something has he the man grinned smugly date of terminationbecause thats the next thing youre going to ask yes ninetythree days you may ask the fish and wildlife department he met boldts surprise not ins fish and wildlife they will tell same date ninetytwo days boldt said misquoting him you track all employees with such enthusiasm or is alekseevich special to you ninetythree days lieutenant we our caviar is under a lockdown forbidden from making business big mixup on governments part and yes i do keep track certainly when this affects ones livelihood one keeps count of such things a lockdown boldt repeated spinning on his heels to look once again at the quiet warehouse behind them svengrads explanation fit the human emptiness of the place svengrad flipped through a rolodex and fixed on a card we have the same addressfor the home of alekseevichas does ins he handed boldt back the sheet of paper have a nice day lieutenant you said we were missing something boldt said my mistake fedor will show you out something or someone most people shrank some from a cops gaze not this man svengrad fixed his attention onto boldt and asked you like dirty movies lieutenant it wasnt often that boldt had to contain himself from striking out at a man svengrad said i find them quite a turnon myself the home movies on the internet are the best crude lighting the women always trying too hard to look sexy the men trying to look hard much better than cheap porn dont you think gives reality tv a new meaning he added but to answer your question no something not someone boldt asked do you get these films off the internet or do you have the originals i have my sources svengrad said mature women are the best dont you think they know what they wantwhat it takes for themand they arent afraid to say so boldts stomach squirted some bile into his esophagus he coughed through the burning and swallowed it down hed have bloody stool if he continued to keep this tension inside ulcers the size of golf balls where would i get such a home movie lamoia shifted on his heels uncomfortable he whispered sarge boldt did not so much as look in his direction john boldt said still eyetoeye with svengrad ask the guy out there for a cigarette would you please lamoia withdrew from the room though reluctantly once he was on the other side of the glass his attention remained on svengrad and boldt as did the attention of svengrads man you like caviar svengrad asked boldt ignoring boldts inquiry he swept his arm to encompass the warehouse no boldt confessed i never acquired the taste too bad your wife where do her tastes lie i will not now nor at any time discuss my family boldt said and neither will you to misjudge me in this regard would be a terrible error on your part i thought we were already discussing your family svengrad said or at least home videos boldt kept the death stare on him no matter the other said even if i wanted to i could not give your wife our best beluga negro this is because of some very good forgeries of my companys labels these have caused the interruption in my business the feds can be a real bother sometimes boldt said indeed they can counterfeit caviar boldt asked seriously paddlefish eggs the general answered gravely serious we never heard about it until your fish and wildlife service discovered them bearing our label paddlefish at four dollars an ounce mixed in with our eightydollar beluga like cutting cocaine with powdered milk i wouldnt know boldt said about either i am the victim here but because i am russian i must be big mafia guy his attempt to come off as an innocent bordered on comical paddlefish eggs bearing my label perhaps when this small problem is resolved we can work out an arrangement that is mutually satisfying the most i can do is look into it dont underestimate yourself the right motivation its amazing what a man can do this late in the week boldt reminded im unlikely to make much headway what a shame for a moment there i thought we had a real connection a knock on the glass window where lamoia held a pack of cigarettes to the glass proletarskie the general saw this as well russian brand we import them along with half a dozen others alekseevich smokes this brand boldt said malina smoke i do not think so too athletic sell a lot of this brand do you enough to justify importing it svengrad replied the kids at the raves the colleges they love russian cigarettes much stronger they make camels look like virginia slims how many cartons cases a week you bring a warrant ill gladly turn over this information otherwise no reason to let my competitors know my numbers im not your competitor boldt said sure you are boldt understood the generals tactics then gun and run he struck an area of boldts vulnerability the video and then came back with his own needsthe lockdown of his caviarand then got defensive when his cigarettes came into play boldt might have enjoyed this more had liz not been directly involved you like birds lieutenant the winged variety boldt asked wondering what came next the magpie will watch the same bird nest for hours must seem like forever a brain that small patient like a saint the mother bird leaves that nest even for a moment and the magpie eats her eggs right there in the nest boldt felt a warmth run through him like hed peed in his pants he pictured the yellow yolk spread around the birds nest the same way the blood had been spilled around the cabin svengrad made sure his message was received you like art lieutenant some i collect wpaera charcoals its a sellers market right now smart time to watch for forgeries svengrad sat on the wordan elephant on an egg the limitation of imitation he said its good of you to have stopped by dismissed boldt thought he meant to say back in the jetta boldt loosened his tie lamoia said its not so much the salty taste that bothers me but the way they pop between your teeth smelling like low tide doesnt help boldt said so what happened after i was excused i had to do that i understand lamoia said but his voice betrayed him he wasnt going to threaten me in front of someone and did he not exactly no he wanted to cut a deal his import business back for the video of liz and hayes damn lamoia said he pulled the jetta out onto wet streets the sky this time of year was worse than a leaking faucet his caviar business is important to him we can assume thats where the seventeen million came from in the first place some undeclared profits you think it was his money i think it was but his main message was a story about magpies whatpies birds he took the long way around to explain to me that the hayes crime scene the cabin is a cheap imitation his guys turned their backs and somebody took hayes you buy that theres a second interpretation this may just be me being paranoid lamoia waited liz and i drove the kids out to kathysmy sistersin the middle of the night tuesday night we literally took them out of our nest maybe i blew it maybe we were followed maybe hes warning me not to try to move them again or hell take action the next time maybe he doesnt know where they are and hes looking for me to panic and lead him to them we both know the russians have a reputation of working the family when the going gets tough boldt recalled an unsolved child murder and the suspicion of russian involvement holy shit lamoia breathed thats why im likely to make a call asking about the possibility of lifting this lockdown and im going to talk to bernie about crosscomparing every single piece of evidence from that cabin against danny foremans crime scene i think what just happened in there was that yasmani svengrad confessed to us that alekseevich is our guy but that he didnt do hayes at the cabin my bet is svengrad wants hayes as badly as or worse than we do the merger the deadline thats it boldt said but his main thought was that this still put liz squarely in the center fourteen liz couldnt spend time in the house with the kids gone shed left for work earlier than usual wrung out by waiting for the phone to ring and by the eerie silence of an empty home lou called with an invitation to lunch it hit her hard because they were both too busy for such extravagances which meant this had to be of the utmost importance it also occurred to her that she was probably the last person in the world her husband wanted to sit down to lunch with and this both broke her heart and made her all the more curious and fearful of his reasons somewhat typical of lou he chose batemans a semiunderground lunch joint that made the freshest turkey sandwiches in the city but at the expense of atmosphere she walked to the cafeteria despite a light mist in the air that others might have called rain not only aware of but glad for the man and woman in trench coats who followed behind her bobbie gaynes and mark heiman were both familiar faces to herand yet seeing them surprised her for they were among the very best of lous detectives by assigning these two to watch her lou sent her a message intended or not of just how serious he took the threat to her safety as the three of them reached the restaurant gaynes peeled off and crossed the street entering a mystery bookshop from where she would watch batemans and any activity on the street heiman followed inside and ate at a table nearby a cell phonewalkietalkie on the table in plain view but not too nearby lou wanted his privacy after moving through the line they took a table well away from heiman so the detective couldnt overhear liz worked on a bowl of chili picking out chunks of meat and setting them on the plate lou deconstructed a turkey and cranberry on wheat and dug into it with a plastic fork it struck her that neither of them could simply eat what had been served he spoke in the practiced voice of a man used to talking in the third row of a courtroom while the trial was under way you and i have barely had five minutes to catch up his tone suggested apology and so she braced for more bad news not the kids she thought presuming he would not wait for a lunch meeting if whatever it was had to do with them lou pushed some cranberry jelly onto a piece of white meat and ate the combination he washed it down with hot tea we dont know how it all fits together or for that matter even if it all fits together but there are some things you need to know he told her about the blood evidence at the cabin and how forensics would be the clincher but that he couldnt say exactly what had gone on out there he warned her that if her latent fingerprints surfaced they would have to deal with it that such a discovery might signal the end of their keeping the affair secret and that he wanted her prepared for that eventuality the tape danny foreman shot that tape of you two she calmly set down the spoon either the chili had landed on an empty stomach or this news was about to make her sick its a surveillance tape that he suppressed lou explained he didnt think it relevant at the time which is cop speak for his not wanting to get you in trouble he told her the lab had discovered both paul geisers and danny foremans prints on the outside of the cassette and another partial that belonged to an ins green card holdera russian he covered the difficulty of connecting a partial print legally to an individual but how the discovery of a russian cigarette ash at the foreman assault had helped confirm suspicions and led them to a distributor this without naming names what you need to know liz is that this man this importer he plays rough the russian mafia is famous for coming after ones family as a means of pressure the larossas she said yes the russian i saw him late yesterday told me this talethe storys unimportantthat may mean that he they im not sure followed us out to kathys may know where miles and sarah are he lowered his head she felt made of stone frozen both from motion and in terms of cold she knew exactly what he was telling her and yet her mothers sense of protection tried to reinterpret whatever it was so that it wouldnt come out the way it had sounded the way he meant it she finally said i want to hear the story its not important he repeated i want to hear the story i screwed up liz im sorry i did everything i could to avoid being followed she understood then that he took this as a failure on his part she wanted to forgive him placing little importance on how it had happened but then reconsidered and felt angry hed let them be followed it felt so wonderfully good to deflect the blame for some of this onto himeven if only briefly but within seconds she felt awful about gloating over his shame knowing these problems had nothing to do with him and everything to do with her own past and this realization and the combined guilt ate into her all the more deeply she pushed the chili aside distastefully the story she said again he took a moment to explain the tale of the magpie waiting for the empty nest we cant be sure he added quickly that it has anything to do with the kids it could very well have been his way of denying responsibility for what happened to hayes at the cabin we know danny foreman was lured away from the cabin its not inconceivable that this man im talking about his guys were lured away as well or even followed foreman when they should have stayed on hayes its not clear i want to emphasize that weve got to get them out lou had the audacity to shake his head no thats not an option shed never felt this kind of cold even through her illness never anything close to this sense of removal and distance why kathy can take them somewhere boise reno someplace far away if theyre being watched itll do no good only take them farther from us look they may simply know our kids are gone and be using this to trick us into leading them to miles and sarah this cant be she said too loudly heiman turned his head slightly and then thought better and returned to his sandwich liz suddenly felt as if eyes from everywhere were upon them it felt claustrophobic to her oppressive we dont know lou said firmly we cant jump to conclusions it does no one any good but at the same time we have to be wise about this we have to rethink everything not really listening to him she said weyoucould send police cars a whole phalanx of them middle of the night get them out of there use dummy cars like they do with the president they cant follow them all then its kathy they go after he said meeting eyes with her his were filled with pain or your parents or you or me even maybe they wait six months a yearand then go after the kids the point being if this was meant as a threatand we dont know that for surethen theres no way to beat it you dont beat these people liz not at their game this is not a game you know what i meant there must be a way for the time being we cooperate he stunned her with this announcement her eyes searched the various tables the people working the sandwich line wondering if they were watching them right now are you saying the moneys tied to these people we dont know that either youre just a wealth of information arent you its fluid he said she disliked that term he used it all the time he said we work on a couple of different assumptions one is that they may know that miles and sarah are with kathy the other is that it may have been their moneythis russians money it makes some sense because his business is in trouble with the government right now and hes probably cash shy it makes that seventeen million all the more tempting he hires hayess new lawyers gets him out on parole and puts him to work what have i done she asked a desperate sadness permeating her you cant beat them at their game he said in that lou way that suggested hed already thought this through to where he was now ahead of it she knew this about him loved him for italways looking around the next corner but could hardly see clear to understand what he meant we beat them we make it safe by either playing along or putting the whole lot of them in jail weve already taken certain steps and theres more i have planned but in the meantime no matter what you play along that was the message i took away from there thats something i wont even share with my own team if you get a call when you get a call you call me first and we decide how to play it whether or not and how i include our guys i dont know yet that doesnt sound right its not right he said but its necessary i just go back to work now just another day at the job you have a reception to plan she couldnt believe hed said that her expression told him so theres a second interpretation to the story about the magpie an interpretation that is further confused or maybe supported by physical evidence i dont see how you can be so calm about this she blurted out either danny foreman or a dpaa deputy prosecuting attorneynamed paul geiser could have been partnered with hayes could be behind the crime scene we found theyre the magpie stealing hayes out of the nest and away from the russians and david is there a body yet lou didnt answer that its incredibly important that should you hear from either foreman or geiser regardless what either may tell you you must come to me firsteven if he makes a convincing argument to the contrary dont believe anyone but me liz she nodded confused unsure whether david hayes being alive or dead benefited her family more amazed to be in a position to even think such a thought lou reached across the table and took her hands in his to her surprise his were colder than her own fifteen deputy prosecuting attorney paul geisers office reminded boldt of a librarians or research assistants with its untidy stacks of papers covering every horizontal surface the dust the unsavory smell of old food he knew geiser by reputation a courtroom bully opinionated to a flaw outspoken hed languished in the prosecuting attorneys office significantly longer than even the prosecuting attorney himself destined to never be recruited by the us attorneys office the proper career track because his mouth had made him more enemies than it had won friends the question on boldts mind was whether geiser could help him learn more about the federal case against yasmani svengrad and what if anything geiser knew about lizs affair with hayes given his prints on the tape if boldt were going to attempt to sting the very investigation he found himself a part ofthis in order to protect his family from svengradhe had to know all the players their roles and their weaknesses a man who probably sweated in his sleep geiser wore a sheen of perspiration as if hed showered too quickly after a run he was said to be an expert in the martial arts and this rumor was now confirmed by a group of photographs on the wall one of which a triptych showed him breaking a small concrete brick in two with his bare hand gripped in a fist he was said to play the bars for the young impressionable women new to jurisprudence scoring more often than not considering himself a real ladies man though boldt doubted real ladies ever looked his way lieutenant geisers voice sounded sadly misplaceda nasalprone adolescent stuck in a fortyyearolds wellconditioned body a voice useful in court no doubt but lost on conversation you mind boldt asked indicating geisers door judging by his eyes geiser did mind though he nodded boldt shut the door moved a pile of papers aside without asking and took a seat by moving that pile he wanted geiser to understand he was taking charge as a rule attorneys believed they could win any argument boldt was here to prove that wrong youre familiar with david hayes boldt began i convicted him whats this about are you aware we found blood evidence in a cabin north of the city that we believe will come back positive for hayes yes i am have you found a body yet no boldt fought the urges that rushed to the surface forcing an artificial calm in their place believing it a mistake to confront geiser on his prints being lifted from the videotape because according to foreman geiser didnt know the content of the video there was no sense in bringing his attention to it boldt toed a tentative line between exploration and revelation i could use a favor he said beginning to walk that line attorneys loved negotiation what kind of favor geiser wore frameless glasses a thin length of silver wire hooking behind each ear hed lost two front teethto the martial arts perhapstheir unnatural white giving his ironic smile a glint that drew boldts eye boldt did not find him handsome but saw how some might he had an intensity about him the type of man who might go unnoticed when entering a room and yet would later commandeer the conversation at the dinner table not exactly charming but not feckless either you must have associates within the usao for instance with whom youre on good terms boldt knew geisers failure to reach the us attorneys office had to weigh heavily on the man and tried to say this in a tone that did not imply he was taking a shot at him go on i need a case looked into quietly if at all possible theres a situationit could help us boththat apparently involves a federal ruling in favor of a position held by fish and wildlife you must know a few people over there yourself geiser said not to be fooled boldt thought weve both been in this work a long time eh lieutenant yes of course i do but an inquiry coming from me is completely different than one from you not necessarily it depends on the request yasmani svengrad boldt said watching intently for a tic or other reaction trying to drop it like a bomb so that geiser couldnt protect himself knowing full well that experienced attorneys taught themselves to never visually react to any news no matter the surprise the sturgeon general geiser disappointed boldt with his placid expression you are in the shit if youre messing with svengrad im not messing with anyone im exploring the strengths and merits of a federal injunction preventing svengrad from importing and selling caviar so the question that needs to be asked is why would you a seattle police lieutenant of some note care what happens to the alleged don of this citys russian mafia boldt opened the bomb bay doors and dropped number two i think svengrad may be the one whose seventeen million went missing this won only a protracted stare from geiser how certain are you entirely speculative but if i if we you and i could use the lifting of that injunction as a carrot something to bring to the table i have a feeling we might win more than we lose irs wants him on tax fraud the injunction is nothing but a stall while they sharpen their pencils then youre familiar with the case that internal revenue is investigating s g and svengrad yes but dont ask me in public because ill deny it as to this other possibility youve just now surfaced no thats news to me interested interested enough to keep listening do you know svengrad by reputation geiser clearly felt boldts accusatory tone one of his guys surfaced as our primary in the radley trevor case boldt along with everyone else in seattle law enforcement knew the radley trevor case a twelveyearold boy found buried alive presumably held hostage for ransom boldt remembered now the whispers of russian mob during the course of that investigation his chest seized with the thought of his own children do you believe it possible that the seventeen million was his anythings possible lieutenant the irs plays it close to the vest but lets assume their case revolves around laundering or offshore accountsthat would dovetail nicely with your theory we know for a fact that david hayes intercepted at least one wire transfer from a dummy account at westcorp intended for a bahamian bank that would fit what youre suggesting im under the impression that if we get the injunction lifted svengrad will provide information concerning several assaults were working might possibly even hand over a suspect this wasnt boldts impression at all but instead that if the injunction were lifted if liz cooperated in transferring the seventeen million then his family would be spared bloodshed until he found a way around this a solution that might keep liz out of it he pursued the obvious im not sure how that helps the prosecuting attorneys office exactly geiser said my interest is we prosecute a man responsible for tearing the fingernails off of at least two individuals and quite possibly for holding the larossa family hostage your wife is going to help them isnt she lieutenant geiser dropped a bomb of his own svengrads turning the screws is he since when does a homicide lieutenant recommend aborting a multidepartmental federal investigation in order to apprehend a subordinate some thug who slapped a few people around since one of those he slapped around was a state investigator danny foreman and i discussed running your wife lieutenant he detailed to me the contact made by hayes both by phone and in person and we agreed that your wife remained our best bet of busting open this case now you show up in my office just after our primary suspect disappears in a pool of blood looking to help a mobster who may be behind the whole case what exactly is my reaction supposed to be boldt experienced the rare sensation of being pushed back onto his heels he was usually the one doing the pushing not the other way around my wifes cooperation is not out of the question at this point if svengrad got to you lieutenant the right and proper course of action is to seek protection i can help with that as can the usao what you do not want to attempt is to manage this yourself physician heal thyself dont believe it thats a mistake if you came here seeking my help if youre concerned about confidentiality i can assure you that as of this moment i can and will consider you a client boldt realized he had to push back now whens the last time you spoke to david hayes an individual identifying himself as hayes telephoned me night before last he said he wanted to cut a deal and suggested we should meet why this matched with what foreman had told boldt and did you meet up with him it wasnt hayes i couldnt confirm it was hayes calling me in light of these assaults i thought it a more prudent course of action not to take too many risks i reached the rendezvous but then left ahead of time left quickly i never met with hayes danny foreman received a similar call are you aware of that i am you look puzzled hayes makes pleas to both you and foreman and within hours is bludgeoned or tortured perhaps to death is there was there wire surveillance in place on that cabin im unaware of any but foreman is certainly in a position to have bypassed me and gone directly to an assistant us attorney my federal colleagues are far more facile when it comes to granting surveillance if not a wiretap boldt said intentionally not completing his thought yes i see geiser said then either foreman or i would have been the source of such information to whoever did the punishing one of us leaks that hayes wants to cut a deal and someonelets say svengradsteps in and teaches him a lesson in loyalty or kills him boldt said or that which makes that person party to capital murder nothing had gone as boldt had foreseen or hoped he wasnt any closer to lifting the injunction against svengrad and instead of pinning down geiser he felt as if he were coming away partially trusting the man his detectives sense told him it was time to check both foremans and geisers alibis for the night hayes had been assaulted so if you passed on the offer to meet hayes that left you where two nights ago are you accusing me of something lieutenant geiser seemed genuinely amused im offering to protect you and youre accusing me of what bludgeoning david hayes im a black belt lieutenant if i wanted to hurt or kill david hayesor anyone else for that matteri would never make such a mess of it you just bit the hand that was feeding you im going to ask you to leave now i will keep what we discussed in terms of you and your wife in confidence but i warn you again do not take on yasmani svengrad by yourself in all likelihood thats what david hayes seemed to have tried does it not and just look what it got him we dont know what it got him not yet we dont and if svengrad doesnt want us to then we never will boldt and liz were just sitting down to reheated gourmet dinners from the whole foods in the u district when the home phone rang neither knew when or even if the call to liz was coming so each ringing of the phone brought its own sense of dread boldt answered lieutenant sergeant szumowski front desk yes sorry to bother you with this but i just got me a caller asking for your mobile or home number when i refused to give them out this individual made me write down a message for you word for word you want the message read it to me please okay here goes szumowski cleared his throat as if auditioning for a part has your wife watched any good movies lately if so you might want to let me have your numbers when i call back he waited through a good deal of silence lieutenant did you get a callerid sergeant by agreement with the phone company every call that came into spd showed its callerid even if the line owner subscribed to callblocking but not every callerid number was written down i did yes run that number and get back to me the moment you have a location yes sir szumowski paused as to that other thing sir how should i handle that giving out your numbers and all if he calls back before you get back to me then yes give him my mobile boldt recited it for the man sparing him the need to look it up in the spd directory right back at you lieutenant szumowski hung up lou looks like im going out boldt told liz ill ask gaynes to come inside with you thatll still leave the cruiser and heimans unmarked out front i dont need babysitting not up for discussion boldt said and the air froze between them a moment later the wall phone rang and boldt answered he scribbled down the physical address for the phone that had made the strange call a bar in fremont only a few minutes by car from the boldt home he now knew where the call had come from the caller didnt know he knew he felt a flutter in his chest they may have made their first mistake boldt told liz who appeared frightened but then he saw it not as fright but doubta keen and penetrating doubtand as he replayed this statement in his own head even he found the sound of it foolish fire codes required all commercial businesses to provide a minimum of two points of egress no cop in his right mind walked through the front door of a establishment like tankers tavern when looking for a possible suspect even in blue jeans and a dark windbreaker as he was currently dressed boldt knew he stuck out indelibly marked cop not to mention that whoever had called for him had the advantage of knowing what he looked like boldt entered the bars back door off an alley marked by dented dumpsters and stacks of beer bottles awaiting recycling the door opened onto a narrow hallway offering a mens room and womens room marked tanked and tank tops a battered pay phone and an empty cigarette vending machine missing a front leg someone had keyscratched the words black lung across the glass of the vending machine boldt moved furtively down this narrow hall alert for someone to spring out from the mens room unexpectedly attempting to grab him up the miles he wore as lines around his eyes accounted for years of experience qualities that could never be taught at the police academy or in college classrooms they eventually instilled themselves as instinct a kind of sixth sense of knowing when danger loomed boldt was not big on belief in a sixth sense and yet he possessed the unusual ability to see crime scenes through the eyes of the victim a faculty that he kept to himself knowing others would not understand he moved ahead with heightened senses smelling the stale beer disinfectant and cigarette smoke hearing the background grind of rock and roll behind loud conversation seeing the spinning overhead fans in a kind of slow motion the flickering television screen playing a football game the bartender patrolling his narrow aisle between the regimented bottles and the cronies on stools bent on elbows glued to the wooden bar that separated them from their spirits mixed into this clamor the faint but distinguishable ring of a telephone a sound that boldts brain elected to single out and bring to the forefront of his consciousness why he wasnt sure he stood with his back to a corner the barroom now open before him pinball and a video game in a small room to his left circular tables mostly full in front of him glassyeyed men drinking beer women of every type from fully available and advertising to withdrawn and hurt relationships forming and disintegrating before him from the din a word so incongruous in this setting that at first he fully ignored it believing his brain was playing tricks on him or perhaps not hearing at all not feeling the events of late had numbed him like a limb falling asleep and tingling without the ability to feel or stand boldt a male voice called still his brain refused to process the information correctly boldt again he turned toward that voice the bartender his mustache and curly hair reflected in the mirror behind the bottles he held a phones receiver standing at the end of the bar by a waitress with more cleavage showing than necessary a tray filled with empties in her hand boldt wondered if by identifying himself he marked himself for abduction and a manicure or if the call were actually a call meant for him then it slammed home hed been led here like a dog in heat the caller to the police department knowledgeable enough to know how boldt would proceed that he would request the callerid information and investigate and if not what then he wondered believing a second or third call would have been placed and eventually contact would have been made but the caller had wanted this on neutral ground someplace boldt could not easily or quickly trace and that implied either a substantial conversation or a threat that one wouldnt want recorded the first name to pop into his head was svengrads the sturgeon general when he accepted the phone and heard the metallic distorted sound of voice synthesis he felt caught offguard the caller was using a voicealtering device readily available from radio shack that made his voice sound inhuman like a robot well done lieutenant the darth vader voice said it sounded vaguely comical and had the circumstances been different he might have experienced it as such as it was he suffered under the realization hed been suckerpunched not svengrad boldt decided immediately he couldnt see the russian wanting to obscure his identitysvengrads power and authority came out of his personage why hide it boldt resented his being so predictable so easily baited why the cloakanddagger you have fortyfive minutes to retrieve the software carried by tony larossa when he collapsed in the bank lobby i need your cell phone number ill contact you i dont think so boldt hung up the call the bartender flashed him an expression that asked if he was done with the phone boldt held up a finger begging more time he asked if this bar phone was used a lot by customers the bartender replied that the one in the hall hadnt worked in over a year anyone make a call from here about an hour ago boldt asked i dont pay much attention you paid attention to me boldt said i dont know you know most of your customers do you part of the job boldt said including the guy who used this phone about an hour ago the bartender offered a smug look boldt flashed his shield and the mans composure wavered he pulled out a twenty and then another and laid them both on the bar put it away the man said somewhat apologetically i came on thirty minutes ago i have no idea who used the phone an hour ago someone we can check with boldt inquired listen its so damn busy in here between five and seven theres no way anyones going to be able to help you i dont believe that okay listen the bartender stood within inches of the bar and leaned toward boldt truth is officer the hall phone is kinda wired into the house line it dont ring there it rings here but customers dial out on the hall phone and the house pockets the money from the pay phone something like that hey im not the owner so unless you were in the hall you wouldnt know who used the phone thats about it the phone rang the bartender reached for the receiver but boldt held him off this is for me boldt yanked up the receiver boldt that same synthetic voice said your wife has nice hands you hang up again shes wearing gloves for the next six months and her little pussy dance is on the evening news i dont talk to robots boldt said inside he decided hed gone too far he wasnt sure what had possessed him to hang up the first time to feign a lack of cooperation except that it went so against his nature this was he decided the call liz had been expecting except that the first step was apparently to collect the coveted software boldt had read two department emails on the analysis of the larossa disk the first expressed optimism that the password cryptography on the disk could be cracked the second explained in some detail the sophistication of the security protecting the software contained on the disk and how it was never going to be compromised the bartender overheard boldts comment twisted his face and walked away to service a customer fortyfive minutes your cell number boldt repeated his cell number into the phone you do this alone or it all comes back on you and yours tomorrow next week next monthlisten youd better keep looking over your shoulder if you bring others in on it or do anything but what i say you dont know me very well boldt said again wondering why his mouth got ahead of his brain the line went dead boldt hung up the receiver the guy was smart and that worried him he called pahwan riz the special operations commander before he even reached the crown vic hell if he was doing this alone he could smell a trap a mile away discovering himself the target of a surveillance operation left boldt with mixed feelings he couldnt remember ever having been on the receiving end of such attentions and he found it offputting the arrangements were made hastily primarily because of the time restrictions imposed by his anonymous caller but the brilliance of some of these guys never ceased to amaze him and by the time he bumped the crown vic into the restricted parking garage attached to the public safety building the operation was already well under way suspecting but not quite willing to believe that whoever had called him might have civilians paid off within the departmentspieshe obeyed pahwan rizs choreography to the letter the crown vic was already equipped with gps transmission equipment because like patrol cruisers it carried a mobile data terminal on the dashthe equivalent of a builtin laptop computer that allowed text to be sent to and from the car limousine services and some taxis parcel delivery and express delivery vans all carried similar equipmentand all contained the satellite tracking device allowing dispatchers to locate any vehicle at a moments notice the trick was to get some of this same equipmenta small gps and a voicerecording deviceonto boldt without him being descended upon by technicians rizs solution was to leave the equipment in a mens room stall and to direct boldt to visit the rest room upon his arrival at spd which he did from the bathroom now wearing the two devices he proceeded directly to property and signed out for the bright red disk that had been in the possession of tony larossa as hed collapsed from his heart attack he took the mans bank id access card as well already foreseeing its future use with boldt being lieutenant in charge of crimes against persons there wasnt anything the property sergeant was going to deny him he signed the requisite forms accepted the plastic bags bearing the chain of possession all carefully detailed in indelible marker and returned to the crown vic at a slow jog moving a few uniformed officers out of his way while checking his watch on the fly ten minutes in which to reach the exit of i north whoever had planned this for him had timed it to within seconds he knew immediately that the drop was to be just as perfectly timed that he would be pushed right to the limit to accommodate the demands as it was he hit the street with the pedal down builtin grill and window lights pulsing the blinding blue light clearing traffic eight minutes to go it would be a miracle but he just might make it several miles above him in the cold black void of space satellites tracked his every turn and pahwan rizin the steamcleaning van with a team of four unmarked vehiclesfollowed at a distance never letting boldt out of his sight sixteen the knock on the back door sounded like a gunshot as it banged off the walls of the kitchen and ran through liz like a jolt of electricity its okay said bobbie gaynes a wire in her ear leading from a walkietalkie its officer foreman bci ill get the door you sit tight liz had made them both some red zinger tea and she noticed the steam in the light of a lamp as it swirled and tried to follow gaynes dissipating a few inches from the cup she felt this way tooher energy fading the longer lou stayed away first the kids then lou she felt as if all the love in this home had lost its way she blew on her own tea and took a sip and returned the mug to the coaster noticing that it shook slightly in her grip and wondering how much more of this she could endure she heard danny foremans sonorous voice interspersed with the female chimes of gayness and a moment later the back door thump shut foreman entered the living room asking if she had a minute he carried what looked like a silver palm pilot in hand and kept it in his lap as he sat down he looked tired and worn he glanced over at gayness mug of tea grabbed hold and drank from it savoring the taste she found his brazenness disturbing and thought it some kind of sign a signal that she should have interpreted more clearly where to start he asked peering over the mug as he took a second noisy sip lous not here she said im up to speed on that im not not exactly hes busy well that certainly clarifies things its to our benefit hes occupied is it what im about to tell you is strictly confidential i can only assume that a banker knows all about confidentiality and i can only hope that despite what i presume to be your loyalty and devotion to your husband you keep this confidential message received she made no agreement extremely careful of her word selection lou had warned her to expect such a meeting how he anticipated such things was beyond her but she was glad for it now it affects us all liz and is not to be taken lightly do you think im taking any of this lightly foreman returned an unsympathetic stare i know how painful the past is for you danny were alike in that way i think were both stuck and ill tell you something im not going to help you or lou or anyone with this investigation for the sake of the investigation i want to get unstuck thats all i care about so if youre looking for a helping hand youve picked the wrong time for me paul geiser and i were behind the disappearance of david hayes he threw it out and let it wrap itself around her until she found it hard to breathe he continued we had to get him off the radar of a major player a guy you dont need to know about but it had to be done hayes wanted to cut a deal to turn states witnessand if you or lou or anyone else questions paul i guarantee you hell pull a sergeant schultz on you hell deny any knowledge of any of this as well he should hayes has agreed to recover the missing money and to implicate the man whose money it was were assuming that youve been compromised either by hayes or this bigger player and i dont need you to answer that either way but the reason lou is not being included in on this is just that because we believe youve been compromised lou is so bythebook that we didnt trust hed agree to let you run this software for hayes im here to plead with you to do just that in a very short time hayes will have the software necessary to pull this off once he does we can assign a government account as the destination account you can wire that money over to the government instead of risking it disappearing again do so and its done hayes gets his plea the player goes away and your life gets back to normal he paused to let her absorb the scenario sunday night before the reception you will receive the instructions either here at your home or on your cell you follow them to the letter and its over liz wasnt sure what to make of danny foreman she felt a wild pounding in her chest like shed run or swum underwater a great distance and only now stopped for a breath we faked a bloody crime scene foreman said and called lou out to it had to be convincing if it convinced lou and i think it did then weve established a perimeter of protection and youre telling me this because she fished for the logic behind it then answered the question herself because regardless of the destination account number im given you want the money wired back to this government account you set up thats it exactly would you have let darlene do something like this if it put you at risk i wouldnt ask you to do this you must know that liz she snorted involuntarily i dont believe that i believe youd do anything necessary to get at this money whatever your motivation she watched his nostrils flare saw the effort involved in holding himself in check he could ill afford to allow his emotions to show to raise his voice with her this reserve in him had the odd effect in her of reversing her own sense of helplessness he needed her they all needed her she and her access to the ass were the key to the investigation danny foreman would have tried every way possible to circumvent her participation and thereby risk lous involvement this was a desperate man in the midst of a desperate act liz had seen this situation a hundred times as an executive and had taken advantage of her position more often than not only as foreman contained himself did she regain her strength hayes believed you could be trusted maybe he was wrong you can do better than that danny what are you willing to do about this liz how much are you willing to risk his question cut her to the quick scandal embarrassment her job her family she found it her turn to cover what she felt inside and quickly realized the game of give and take that was under way a tingling sensation raced up the back of her neck as she realized the power she held over this man and also what was at stake the survival of her marriage and her family i dont know to whom youre referring david it doesnt matter who were talking about foreman said its what we call the juice that counts what it is they have the tape she felt herself blush danny foreman had certainly viewed the tape as it had once been in his possession hed seen her naked doing things somehow shed blocked out this truth and the sudden realization shook her even frightened her in a weird kind of way he had the juice on her too how was he looking at her now without her clothes engaged she felt sick to her stomach thing is foreman continued would lou risk his career to save you i think he would as he said this she saw through cracks in the veneer danny foreman resented lou whether because danny had lost his own wife to cancer or because lou had achieved that rare reputation in law enforcement of being one of the best and a decent man at the same time dannys own career had suffered following darlenes death liz said lou would never bend the rules even for me and you know it thats what bothers you isnt it you cant get to him this isnt about lou its about you you can handle it you can put these people away paul geiser and i are your answer your only way out of this i promise you think through whatever it is that lous telling you and youll come back to this time and time again david hayes is working for us and as long as hes working for us we control it not lou not even hayes himself and so you fool lou with the cabin torture to what keep the straight arrow out of your game its all about leaks foreman said its hard enough to contain something like this with three people do you actually think i wont tell lou i think youll do what you have to lou is a cop a good cop liz you give him this kind of information hes going to run with it will he let you do this finish this i doubt that but if you do it without himif you divert the funds into this government account then its over the players name is yasmani svengrad liz a hardcore criminal who rolls over anyone and anything in his way hes a heartless son of a bitch just ask beth larossa you think you can work with him what happens if you do when youre done getting him his money do you think it will end then you think that tape will get destroyed that hell forget all about it hell own you and lou hell know your weak spot because it worked once plus hell have evidence against you for helping him and hell use it against you to do another transfer another wire establish a fraudulent account you roll a rock like that downhill and you will never stop it but i can stop it for you me liz not lou do you think i can do anything without half of spd knowing about it how many layers did you have to pass through to see me tonight theyve built a wall around me im not doing anything going anywhere without lou knowing it and lou wont have it even if i wanted to danny she tried to make it sound as if she did want to but this was far from the truth lou had something going she knew him well enough to know this damned if i do damned if i dont she muttered more to herself than anything he checked that palm pilot in his lap slipped a folded piece of paper out of his shirt pocket his cell phone number he explained hayes was putting this together as they spoke if he or hayes contacted her the account number given would be the government account if anyone else directed her what to do she was to call foreman immediately dannys offer sounded tempting despite everything lou had warned her about hide the money from the thugs put everyone in jail wasnt that what lou wanted remember to call me foreman said and let himself out seventeen boldt pulled into the wedge of white hash marks separating the northbound lane of i from the ne th street exit ramp leading into the u district believing whoever was behind this was ingenious for his choice of locations the highway traffic to his left moved at sixty miles an hour or better the exit traffic to his right only slightly slower given that it was a multiplelane ramp the spd car following him was forced to drive past remaining on i by the same token whoever was behind this could also drive right past boldt never the wiser he thought it more promising that his mystery man was parked with a good view of his position monitoring him interpreting the degree to which he was willing to cooperate if this person wanted him off the highway he could direct him to exit right if he wanted him back on the highway that was possible too boldt waited he answered his purring cell phone with a steady voice despite the way he felt inside pahwan riz spoke his rank lieutenant im assuming you lost visual boldt said thats okay reece affirmative give us about three minutes well have someone break down in the opposite lane too obvious let me do my job my terms that was the agreement which is why im doing the service of calling you riz explained a commander riz was not used to taking orders youll have to do better than a breakdown in the opposing lane thats all im saying theyll spot that in a heartbeat his own heart beat somewhat frantically boldt longed for a cup of tea it never failed to settle his nerves weve got you on radar riz said meaning the global positioning system well stay with that for the moment circle the wagons and let you come to us boldt found this acceptable riz would establish perimeter surveillance positions and wait for boldt either to drive past one of his people or to provide the team the color of a car or a description of the individual who showed up to receive the encrypted computer disk boldts cell phone beeped in his ear indicating call waitingan incoming call he told riz to sit tight and answered this second call placing riz on hold in the process the synthesized voice named another location i south the boeing access road exit pull into the wedge between the highway and the exit lane and await instructions you have seven minutes the line went dead an unreasonably short amount of time boldt jerked the wheel right getting off the exit in order to cross and return in the southbound lanes once onto the highway hed have to invoke his siren and dashboard bubble flasher if he were to make it on time he switched the phone call back to riz im heading south toward boeing field weve got you riz said again boldt believed he meant they could see him on the gps system visual boldt asked negative will have any minute im signing off for now hang in there lieutenant the phone clicked and riz was gone somewhere somehow this man who ran him intended for boldt to pass the disk or make a drop but with rizs team lurking a short distance away it seemed unlikely a runner could get very far without becoming a target of the same surveillance boldt brought the crown vic up to eightyfive miles per hour on his way toward the bridge even in light traffic hed have to slow somewhat when he reached the narrowing stretch of highway that ran through the city he wondered how the drop would be engineered confident in the abilities of rizs team boldt understood better than anyone the precarious situation he was in he had to control hayess software in order to ensure the recovery and transfer of the money if he were to safeguard his family he still hadnt settled on a way to allow liz to help svengrad but no matter what this software was the key his inclusion of special operations was mandated by the fact that someone wanted him to make that drop in the first place if svengrad or hayes were behind this plan then why not just have boldt remove the software from the property room and hand it over to his wife why bother with this elaborate and risky scheme the first answer that came to boldt was that svengrad or hayes had determined a way to get the money out of the bank without lizs involvement hethey needed the software but not liz this didnt make a lot of sense since svengrad had taken an enormous risk by pressuring boldt for his wifes involvement and if not svengrad or hayes then who and why boldt couldnt make the drop without knowing this and he couldnt know this without special operations the second thought that came to him was this elaborate plan was simply a way for svengrad to protect boldt from being seen as cooperating a way to tangle up the investigation handing the software to liz would signal the endgame would give investigators a head start on surveillance of every kind boldts cooperation in that event might be construed as a criminal act at some point boldt would answer for that a shiver ran through him as it occurred to him that svengrad had wanted to protect him merely because he was a police lieutenant a homicide lieutenant at that and a good cop to have in your pocket had this drop been orchestrated merely to make boldt look less culpable than he really was this idea hit him hardthat he was now seen as an asset by the russian mob a turned cop worth preserving he slowed and stopped the car in the triangle of paint that separated the highway from the exit ramp he wiped his brow with a starbucks napkin raindrops on the windshield grew in size boldt switched on the wipers a semitruck rolled by the concussion of its wake rocking boldts car he pulled ahead a few feet and angled the car slightly pointing in toward the highway traffic his mobile phone rang the callerid read out of area no number to trace he answered the call but the reception made it impossible to hear wait he shouted into the phone afraid he might miss an instruction his eyes fixed on the flickering small black bars indicating reception he hurried out of the car into the rain running up a slight embankment his head aimed up looking hopefully at the phones signal indicator as it moved from one bar to two and then three he clamped it to his ear and said is this any better dont fuck with me the eerie electronic voice warned im not boldt shouted websters the voice said its a bar just south of northeast fortyfifth on brooklyn ill find it leave your phone on and come alone the line died boldt was still looking up into the wet night sky eyes searching for a cell towers blinking red light when something winked at him through the rain binoculars boldt moved his head trying to force that wink to appear a second time and there it was another wink of light from a spot slightly above the overpass some spy looking down perched in a tree beyond he wondered but then he saw it again not a person at all a camera lens mounted high atop an aluminum light post a traffic cam he was being watched but from a distance cell phone in hand he wanted badly to make a call but thought better of it not knowing if in the rain and the dark that camera could see him or not but not wanting to test it he headed back to the car at a run slipping once on the wet grass smearing his knee down into the muddy incline and jumping back up he hurried toward the car realizing the traffic camera if accessible from the internet which he was guessing would prove to be the case allowed those running him to look for ground surveillance while at the same time confirming boldt did exactly as he was told big brother and in the hands of the wrong people back in the car yanking the wheel to make the exit ramp so he could reverse directions and return to the very exit where hed been parked only ten minutes earlier boldt pulled the phone to his ear to report his situation but the idea that the person on the other end of these calls might not be svengrad or hayes stayed with him and for a moment he resisted connecting with riz the idea of a third party an unknown instilled fear on some level boldt believed he could fight the enemies he could seebut was he putting the kids or liz even further at risk if this proved to be an unknown he took a moment to think as he drove he typed the bars name into the mobile data terminal to confirm its existence after a long hesitation the computers tiny screen returned do you mean webstirs ne th street yes no boldt pushed y and the terminal offered to compute the quickest course but boldt declined well aware that i was the fastest way there webstirs he realized was an internet bar and now he raced to conclusions weighing risks he nonetheless called pahwan riz and caught him up to date on the traffic camera and his next destination being an internet café before boldt was off the phone riz had confirmed that the traffic camera hed seen was one of about fifty viewable live on the states highway website whoever had arranged this was able to watch boldt move place to place in the comfort of his living room it made him feel all the more like a pawn and brought his blood pressure considerably higher im not liking this riz said an internet café get it boldt was no technowizard unless it related to the crime lab an area where few could outdo him no ingenious how so david hayes webstirs an internet café that means a small office network hub a router simple stuff for a guy who could probably hack the pentagon kids stuff hell hack the computer network at the bar boldt said feeling his way through this he has long since hacked the network hes established drive sharing on one or more of the machines this guy is good riz said with a distant respect what hes going to do is direct you to a particular machine youll insert the disk and the rest will be history hell take it from there hell enter the correct password that we could never determine copy the disk reformat it destroying all its contents brilliant can we stop praising him and start figuring out some way to prevent this no riz answered not unless you simply refuse to show up thats not an option im aware of that hes got us boldt asked hes got us riz confirmed youre about to turn over the software to him the crown vic screamed over the bridge through the pouring rain boldt bothered not only by what he heard but by something else something intangible indefinable like a moving shadow highways he wondered cars websites something in the back of his mind that he couldnt quite pull forward riz on the other hand proved prescient and for the first time a tingle of suspicion entered boldts thought that a police insider like riz could mastermind all of this from behind the scenes no one ever the wiser make it all seem like the work of someone else while this person manipulated events for his own personal wealth this thought churning inside him boldt parked and walked a wet block to webstirs a glass and tile ultra hip ultra modern interior with colorful graphics and odd shapes hanging from the ceiling that boldt assumed were meant to be art a twentysomething bartender with slickedback hair and blackframed nerd eyeglasses served foodcoloringhued mixed drinks in exotic plastic stemware james bond on a budget the beer looked like a dark amber the crowd was a surprising mix of women and menboldt had expected all men for no reason other than his own prejudices the women showed their navels above their pants waists as provocative as the waitresses one of whose buttocks cleavage showed when she bent to retrieve a fallen napkin his phone rang again and for a second or two boldt debated what riz had said debated not answering it or walking out of the bar altogether but it was not to be he answered the call stuck the phone to his ear and was dictated a simple instruction machine in the corner when it comes open insert the disk into the drive bay and walk away an asian girl occupied the machine at the moment boldt wondered if the caller knew that and what it meant if he did boldt scanned the rooms ceiling for security cameras and spotted two in opposite corners wondering if a hacker could gain access to these as well his world felt smaller and more claustrophobic everywhere he went people watching the girl looked over her shoulder at him and smiled and he wondered if she were a plant or an innocent then he wondered if there were any innocents anywhere taken in again by the sexual casual dress of these kidsfrom his angle it was nearly impossible not to look directly down the shirt of this asian girl he turned and walked toward the bar keeping a fuzzy eye on her in the smokedglass mirror behind the bar get you something the bartender asked hot tea to go two doors down the owner was not stupid enough to go up against the coffeehouses something soft boldt said the guy ran off a list of pop drinks and bubbling waters boldt requested a ginger ale the asian girl spun out of the chair impossibly tight pants wrapped around a firm body she headed in boldts direction he felt ancient in this company he wondered if she were a messenger a spy a twentysomething prostitute she walked right at him her young nipples showing darkly through the tshirt the notsogentle sway of her hips emphasized by the low cut of the corduroy pants the straightcut black bangs so classic and timeless lieutenant boldt she asked he felt a spike of heat deciding someone had sent her perhaps believing boldt in need of a computer coach he doubted immediately theyd ever trace the twenty or fifty he believed hed find in her pocket to a suspect at every turn the person behind this proved himself clever and that pointed increasingly away from svengrad and toward hayes in boldts mind no way he had died in that cabin horror she said im ming lee a junior at the u your lecture series the application of the physical sciences to the detection of crime i made criminalistics my major boldt felt catapulted into another realm this bursting package of primal youth a person he felt sure connected to the case nothing but a secret admirer what are you doing at webs she inquired then she blushed glanced around and said in a forced whisper that proved just as loud as her normal voice are you undercover or something oh my god how totally cool is that she stepped closer and again he looked away for as short as she was his aerial view left little to the imagination did i just blow this or what nothing so dramatic as that boldt lied i live near here and our home computer went down thats all missing some email you gonna have a drink she asked and he expected that the next thing out of her mouth was going to be her coming on to him and he didnt know what to make of that socalled badgers came in every age every ethnicity but usually went for the young hard and handsome men in uniform nonalcoholic he said im on duty immediately regretting the pat response i thought you said your home computer went down then she blushed again oh my god she repeated covering her mouth im so sorry now more convinced than ever shed interrupted an undercover op can i sit with you i think not boldt said i wont say a word better not boldt said we can discuss this at the next lecture after the next lecture she pressed and there was no mistaking that look in any womans eyes even a woman this young he felt his face flush and his groin stir another time he said good to meet you ming he stepped past her leaving a whole other world behind him and wondering why a collision like this would present itself just now other than during his occasional teasing with matthews no woman had openly flirted with him in at least a decade certainly not a child the repartee with matthews had ground to a halt once shed attached herself to lamoia the implied interest of this girl nearly derailed his thought long enough for him to forget himself but he moved to the computer terminal in the corner sat down on the warm stool reminded once again of his eager student and leaned to slip the disk into the machine within seconds the disk drive began to whir with it in boldts mind a resurrection yes david hayes was very much alive driving home twenty minutes later the disk coming out of the machine blank as riz had anticipated and boldt momentarily blank along with it boldt crossed i in the crown vic catching sight of the painted triangle where hed been pulled over and waiting for a call only an hour before he yanked the wheel hit the emergency flashers and pulled over in traffic on westbound ne th command riz answered the phone the fortyfifth street exit off i north boldt said without further introduction is there a traffic cam that watches that location as well as riz checked boldt ended the call and crossed the busy street and peered over a low rail at the interchange in question his mind whirring he had briefly held suspicions that riz or another spd officer was involved in this it was certainly not beyond the realm of yasmani svengrad to turn a cop through extortion or threat or to entice a cop with the smell of that kind of big money now watching the highway traffic stream past boldts phone rang and it was riz affirmative riz said they had you in plain sight for both stops they discussed the possibility that hayes might have been able to access webstirs video security cameras and riz confirmed this possibility depending on the firmware theyre using working on the notion that the obvious is always the solution to a certain level of crime and rarely the solution to sophisticated crime boldt placed a call to his departments traffic division he felt like a spider carefully laying out his web while knowing all along his predatory victory amounted to little more than haphazard chance the fly had to be in the room for the web to be effective boldt requested any and all reports of breakdowns or accidents for late afternoon into the early evening hours of wednesday on highway the day hayes had apparently been torturedand foreman had allegedly been stuck in traffic on state highway a few minutes later he received the report he disconnected the call and hurried back to the crown vic his phone purred as he climbed back inside behind the wheel its me liz hey everything okay in a manner of speaking he or someone else has the software now he did it smart and were not going to trace it he we believe its hayes theres only one thing left they need now access she said her yes thats why im calling she said she detailed foremans visit leaving out nothing including the palm pilot they made it look like torture and then they hid him dannys convinced they can bring in whoevers money it is and then thats that he suspected id tell you but needs it kept confidential says geiser will deny knowledge of any of it sid found tooth chips an excessive amount of blood and pieces of two fingernails at that crime scene boldt told her that doesnt fit with what youre telling me they wanted it to look right maybe boldt allowed foreman and geiser would both know the details of the other tortures it suddenly explained to boldt why hed felt so uneasy about the hayes crime scenethe lack of cigarette ash and shoeprints among the missing pieces the thing is liz said if i am involved if i do make this wire transfer for someone and i send the money to an account danny specifies wheres that leave us if danny doesnt catch svengrad the tape the kids you said these people are not to be toyed with thats right boldt said his head throbbing as he tried to set this straight in his thought once the tape went public their livesquite possibly their childrens liveswould never be the same ill think of something danny was off lou wasnt himself pressuring you couldnt have been easy it was right of you to tell me boldt figured geiser had put him up to it paul geiser was pulling the strings now thank you for that you dont sound convinced youre going to get the call he said we have to prepare for that theres not much to prepare for i wait and see what it is they ask me to do theres a call i need you to make boldt said itll have to be from your cell phone whats going on lou not now he said imagining his home line tapped call me back from your cell phone he took a moment to sign off politely and cradled the mobile phone in a cup holder he no longer trusted his own people there had been a time when rousting lamoia morning noon or night would have been easy here was a cop who seemed to approach the job each day with youthful enthusiasm the tougher the work the better the more risky the better but home life had changed all that and boldt resented daphne matthews taking that part of lamoia from the job now lamoia wanted to be home with daphne and margaret a toddler who seemed destined to be swallowed by the states child protection laws despite the loving care she was receiving from matthews whod been assigned temporary guardianship only a state government could consider over fourteen months of daily care temporary but lamoia felt the pressure along with matthews of the child possibly being taken away and the result was a man who never wanted to leave his loft condominium boldt finally laid out his suspicions to lamoia in a desperate act hed hoped to avoid it wasnt his way to voice those suspicions until he had more to go on than hunches but none of this was going his way and so he resorted to outright manipulation knowing lamoia wouldnt be able to resist two visits in the same day to what do i owe the pleasure dressed in blue jeans and a plaid flannel shirt paul geiser looked nothing like the attorney who occupied the small office in the justice building hed become so predictable in his gray suits white shirts and conservative ties that this alter ego at the front door surprised boldt geiser looked at them over a pair of dimestore reading glasses perched on the end of his nose he admitted boldt and lamoia with no reference to the late evening hour no questions on why the surprise visit beer coffee tea for you lieutenant he motioned for them to follow him when they failed to answer geiser might have lost the suit but not the swagger of confidence that epitomized prosecuting attorneys the room smelled of airplane glue a potent odor that took boldt back to his youth models close geiser said impressed that boldt had picked this up at such a distance the trio passed through another door and into a leatherandmahogany paneled library that belonged in a faux english manor not in this clapboard twostory with aluminum windows the builtin stacks ran floor to ceiling a trick chair unfolded into a small ladder in the far corner but all of it looked purchased from a catalog instead of inherited it was a wouldbe world in the heart of middleclass suburbia a dark leather globe stood in a stand next to the reproduction desk newsprint had been laid down to cover the desk atop which a green glass bottle rested on its side the first pieces of a ships hull could be seen inside it a set of long tweezers lay at rest accompanied by a magnifying glass spools of thread a small pile of dark wood the size of toothpicks a razor knife and a stack of woodsticked cotton swabs who is she boldt asked easing into an uncomfortable leather captains chair facing the desk lamoia fit himself into the other looking all around the francis and elizabeth seventeen fortytwo rotterdam and deal to philadelphia impressive lamoia said unconvincingly geiser picked up the magnifying glass and studied the beginnings of the ship inside the bottle then set it down and addressed his visitors i apologize for continuing this but i cant stop in the middle i have glue drying he scooted the reading glasses back up his nose picked up a pair of forceps and displaying impossibly steady hands delivered a structural element to the side of the tiny ships hull our glues drying too paul and we cant stop in the middle either so talk geiser said never taking his eyes off the model questioning a dpa about his personal involvement on a case was dangerous ground and boldt knew it we need to know where hes being kept who eyes on the model we need to know now boldt said we cant do the dance not tonight how can we even dance if you wont share the music i dont know what youre talking about lieutenant there was no forcing the man so boldt thought he might try to break him down a piece at a time this had not been entirely unexpected lamoia was in attendance primarily as a witness it occurred to boldt that geiser had figured that out already and if so he was already on notice that boldts visit was formal what did you leave out about the proposed meet with hayes i told you it failed to materialize geiser said am i supposed to waste your time a legitimate reply but not to boldts satisfaction you said something came up lamoia said you didnt even watch the bridge like from a distance or a building or something i did go to the bridge in fact i parked where i was told to park but when foreman informed me he was stuck in traffic i got the hell out of there boldt asked do you happen to remember if danny told you where he was when he let you know he wasnt going to make it you want me to provide an alibi for danny foreman incredulous geiser carefully wiped the tips of the forceps with a cotton ball and solvent he placed them down and looked up at boldt for the first time or perhaps you want an alibi for me as well eh lieutenant boldt felt himself flush with heat he told geiser what the man knew already sid is processing the cabin good for them geiser went back to his model boldt repeated did foreman mention where he was when he was stuck in traffic he was on highway fivetwenty i think construction backup rush hour a breakdown in the opposing lane same old same old this roughly matched what boldt had been told in another witness boldt would have questioned the degree of accuracy the level of detail but attorneys guarded their facts the pine street overpass your choice or the voice that called you geiser hesitated either to attend to his model or because he was considering how to answer and this bothered boldt the man bothered boldt the resolute calm are you laying traps for me lieutenant do you not trust me that didnt answer the question but for boldt to press a dpa treating him like a suspect would be a mistake geiser sat up and pushed back from the desk admiring his handiwork the model still a long way from looking like much listen cant you people check this kind of thing looking between the two cops he said im sure foreman mentioned construction and something about a car in the breakdown lane somebodyll have that right foreman had mentioned traffic problems to boldt as well and boldt had already made the call but geiser didnt need to know that boldt stuck his neck out as far as he dared an attorney and an investigator working together could make a whole hell of a lot of trouble if they wanted one hell of a team lamoia said now wait just a goddamned minute geiser said not taking any time to catch on to the suggestion lamoia said they could sequester a state witness for instance boldt added covering their tracks by leaving a bloody crime scene behind but with the body missing geisers narrowing eyes tracked back and forth between the two give me a break do you have any idea of the hoops wed have to jump through to pull that off do you honestly believe the us attorneys office or my own office would condone misleading an investigation in order to sequester a witness he could see on the mens faces he wasnt gaining ground we start down that road and when would we ever mend that fence huh you tell me spd would never cooperate with our office again not ever and who could blame you listen im not saying we might not try something like that its pretty ingenious you ask me damn good ruse but it would be in concert with you guyssomeone in your department would catch wind of it well before it ever went down youve got to see that right it made sense to boldt but he was loath to admit it horrified even to think that his captain sheila hill or some other gold badge would cut a deal with the attorneys and leave him in the wind but his wife was involved and that might account for any number of things a sense of near panic filled him was his own department running him around in circles while they had plans of their own he found himself believing geiser and it bothered him he said i need to know if something like that is in play i imagine you do do you believe danny foreman was stuck in traffic at the time he called you well now were getting to the heart of it arent we lieutenant the hell of it is theres no way i can know that is there would you know if hayes had cut a deal for protection i should it should go through my office absolutely but it wouldnt have to it could just as easily go through the us attorney maybe more likely you think about it the usao can negotiate with treasury for witness protection i cant offer that danny foreman told my wife that you and he had hayes under protection and that youd deny it til hell freezes over well hes right on one account isnt he geiser said he scooted his chair up to the desk again and met eyes with boldt youd better move before your glue dries gentlemen you can find your way out paul geiser was in the middle of a tricky bit of business on his model when his kitchen doorbell rang only minutes after boldts departure angry that boldt would play the oh i forgot something technique on a seasoned attorney geiser hurried through the house to the kitchens back door ready to give boldt a mouthful his glue was indeed drying he yanked open the door already midsentence this is the oldest game in the book but cut himself off not recognizing the two men in the suits who faced him fbi by the look of them treasury he thought reminded again of the discussion of witness protection boldt had been followed or the house had been watched fucking feds were full of such tricks seeing two strangers at his back door was jarring he had expected boldt and lamoia in those few seconds it took his facile mind to clear the slate and begin again one of the two stepped through the door and hit him with two open palms squarely in the center of his chest not federal agents after all the impact not only threw him across the kitchen like a puppet it froze his lungs and vocal cords in a nervedeadening spasm one of them spoke to the other his words clouded by an unfamiliar accent only then did he fully register what was going on only then did his thought finally catch up to real time the specter of boldt and lamoia fading like the orb left behind by a cameras flash thugs goons a dozen different names geiser called them apes around the office one was dropping the blinds while the other was shoving a damp and smelly kitchen rag down geisers throat pulling him by the hair and standing him up while wrestling his arms behind him if his feeling had returned sooner he might have fought them both given his training the interrogation was conducted by mobile phone so that geiser never saw his questionera walkietalkie feature that allowed use of a speakerphone so that it didnt need to be held to geisers ear and so the two men could follow instructions where necessary as well the advantages of modern technology his back ached from the way theyd bound his torso to the chair sitting up so perfectly straight hands out in front of him also taped to the arms of the chair theyd moved him into the basement by simply throwing him down the stairs part intimidation partly a way to keep him physically stunned they knew their work well when he answered questions incorrectly the big one shoved the musty kitchen rag back into his mouth as the smaller guy pulled a leatherman out of a belt case and worked the polished metal multitool device into a pair of pliers please no geiser gagged tape wrapped around his head holding the rag in his mouth his words came out as only deep grunts nearly indistinguishable except in volume from the cries of pain that followed where is he the voice asked over the phones thin speaker geiser shook his head he had no idea nyet the ape said for the sake of the interrogator which caused geiser to loosen his bowels the voice on the other end of the phone wanted answers he didnt have he understood the frustration of such a position from his years of working as a trial attorney there were times hed wanted to use these same methods on some of his unforthcoming witnesses wild with desperationthat ape stepping closer the pliers extended like a prosthesis designed with only one purpose in mindpaul geiser understood that it promised to be a long night eighteen when boldt dropped lamoia off at his building john offered his roundtheclock services an expression of fraternity that implied there would be no overtime filed for nothing on the books if boldt wanted it that way this reaching out by his former partner a man boldt had personally trained to follow in his path meant the world to him i may take you up on that do it and i can safely volunteer matthews as well boldt found it amusing that john still referred to daphne by her last name he was about to pull away from the curb when a womans figure stepped out of a doorway and headed directly for his car boldt couldnt imagine prostitutes working this neighborhood but he prepared his shield to display and drive her off to another corner the woman opened boldts passenger door and he had dropped his credentials wallet onto the seat and had his gun in hand by the time he recognized her maddie olson she reminded him we met in the mens room if i were the paranoid type boldt said id say you were lying in wait for me word gets around she said drive please boldt pulled the crown vic into traffic and started taking random turns through an old part of town where traffic was moderate youre not serious he said when she failed to instigate conversation about knowing id show up sure i am i knew you had snatched up lamoia im telling you therere no secrets geiser he guessed is in the emergency room at swedish med center central district i was with him an hour ago our guy the same guy youre never going to speak to alekseevich boldt supplied got word to us that the shit was flying geiser had been scheduled for a manicure foremans up next if they can find him damn boldt was not surprised to hear foremans name hed just fed it to geiser himself you dont sound surprised she said two nights ago danny foreman led me to a crime scene he went on to explain the blood in the cabin it made me suspicious of him because danny had missed an important meet claimed he was stuck in traffic gave me the same excuse that he gave geiser i made some calls followed up on those calls just now we look for patterns right i had one i thought worth pursuing and come to find out the highway where danny was stuck in construction traffic while watching a car get towed turns out to be an area watched by a traffic cam we live and die by the details danny tried too hard said hed seen a brokendown car to both me and geiser too much information when geiser gave me that my antenna went up reporting what he saw on the traffic cam allowed him to pretend to be somewhere he was not by the look of it yes and where was he in fact this is all just speculation he cautioned but my guess is he was doing a damn good job of imitating your mr alekseevich so wed take the bait meanwhile i thought he was sequestering our primary suspect for the us attorneys office that is thats the direction i was going until what you just told me and now if they hit geiser they dont have what they need maybe danny tortured hayes for information and then dumped the body it will pan out the geiser manicure foreman being next and youre telling me this because my sisters kid i made a call about that he said defensively thinking she was accusing him of not having acted i know you did she said what goes around she added i guess so said boldt the next corner is fine she said pointing boldt slowed the car for a red light glad for the extra minute or two you said geiser is in emergency what about danny we rolled a car to geisers following the tip probably should have kept it off the radio in hindsight because chances are they were scanning and knew we were coming found him in the basement in a bad way very fresh foremans off our radar so far are you so sure her words had sparked an interesting idea in him we havent found him she repeated missing boldts meaning and boldt was in no hurry to correct matters i need you to arrange a meeting for me alekseevich no can do pretty please with caviar on top id love to help out lieutenant but i get off the bus here five minutes ten max not possible then tell your people this sunday night one way or another im delivering svengrad on the front steps so they better stop your guy from crossing into canada or boarding a flight because were all going to need him if were going to make the charges stick theyll go ballistic i give them that she sounded a little desperate now herself weve been building a case for the better part of a year now you cannot do this lieutenant im not asking permission detective im trying to give you a headsup and if i can get you the meet with alekseevich she asked wheres that put all this now youre listening he said pulling the car to the curb as shed directed boldt knew hed won the meeting your name never comes up in any of this i dont know whether to kiss you or throw a punch she said popping her door open he made sure she had his cell phone number and then headed back into traffic confident hed led her away from her own very good idea and wondering if he could now turn it to his favor liz was half out of her mind with impatience and the claustrophobic sense of being watched and guarded lous lastminute request before hed left had nearly floored her but she knew to trust his judgment and instinctswhen it came to planning few were his equal to her surprise the third shop she phoned was open late on friday nights the effeminate male voice on the other end trying to crosssell all kinds of extras she didnt need she made this call in secret as lou had suggested from the kitchens portable but in the bathroom with the water running while bobbie gaynes babysat her in the living room leafing through magazines and constantly adjusting the ear bud that linked her with dispatch liz had heard lou talk about such operations dozens of times over the course of their marriage but being the centerpiece of such a thing proved exhausting despite her doing nearly nothing and going nowhere the nervous energy alone drained her of physical strength and threatened paranoia pickup and delivery of a costume was arranged she reviewed the arrangements twice making sure there were no misunderstandings lou had given her specific orders and she meant to carry them out everyone okay in there mrs b it was gaynes knocking lightly on the bathroom door out in a minute theres another upstairs liz added its not like that gaynes said she didnt need a toilet she needed her charge back in her chair in the living room cops were territorial animals liz willed her mobile phone to ringto engage her give her something to do other than worry she would not have expected being so eager to be involved so ready for it at that point in time if someone had asked her to clean fish she would have done it anything to relieve the stress of waiting she kicked herself a moment later for not thinking the way lou thought for not realizing her environment and how to handle herself she left the bathroom and by her way of thinking did a pretty fine job of returning the kitchens portable phone to its wall cradle but a moment later she looked back to see gaynes striking a pose in the doorway shared between the kitchen and living room one shoulder on the jamb one leg crossed before the other no gaynes said into the portable phone just checking if youre open she hung up the call with the press of a button she had pushed redial she had realized what liz was up to in the bathroom and had gone straight to work upon the phones return whats up with the costume shop mrs b i think youd better come over here and sit down liz said this may take some explaining i didnt think youd take me up on my offer so soon lamoia said from the passenger seat less than thirty minutes had elapsed since boldt had dropped him off i just barely wolfed dinner lamoia carefully picked at a thick brownie nibbling off tiny amounts and savoring each bite boldt couldnt remember when hed last eaten he currently had the remains of a hot tea warming the cup holder boldt caught lamoia up on the surprise visit by maddie olson but did not mention her by name or division within the department referring to her only as a female officer best kind lamoia said his teeth black with chocolate it presents two very different scenarios boldt said driving faster than he normally did and knowing that john recognized this but was too cool to acknowledge it either foreman stung us by faking the torture and stashing hayes for the us attorneys office or he actually tortured hayes himself and put it off on others lamoia reacted sarcastically one of the only emotional responses he allowed himself oh well that second ones certainly a dandy pissed at the system he decides to take the money for himself it might account for svengrad going after geiser and him why do i sense were not out for an evening drive lamoia asked popping the last bit of brownie into his mouth and rolling his eyes as he chewed boldt had just run a red light these things might come from a box he said licking his fingers but matthews has it down the trick is undercooking them the martha stewart of homicide lamoia adding a southern twang said and damn proud of it boldt explained first thing i did was try the sheriffs office looking for danny because this cop mentioned having danny on our radar and i think without meaning to reminded me that all the mdts mobile data terminals track realtime location of the cars same as ours do and you got a fix for his new ride the escalade not exactly youre driving as if you did boldt suppressed a grin the first faint acknowledgment from john it was worth cherishing ive got a fix but it wasnt courtesy of the sheriffs office is this supposed to be twenty questions or something he eyed boldts tea still smacking his lips you mind if i have a swig of that finish it boldt said lamoia knew perfectly well that boldt did mind sharing both drink and food this was lamoias attempt at being polite while he got what he wanted sheriffs office only keeps realtime information and they currently have nothing on their screens for foremans escalade means the engines turned off theyll call me if that changes we call them motors sarge lamoia corrected but ill forgive you this time motors because theyre engines that move you john was a gearhead of the first order boldt should have known better than to wander into his territory do you want to hear this lamoia not wearing his seat belt had slumped back in the seat as if tempted by a nap despite boldts erratic driving the man had some old west mannerisms like thisthe town sheriff tipped back in the spoke chair outside the jailthat he wore effortlessly and that fit him well he reminded boldt of the best of steve mcqueen as if boldt had already briefed him lamoia said im way ahead of you the new escalades offer an onsat service package that gives you twentyfourhour road assistance electronic mapping live operators he paused for dramatic effect gps twentyfourseven youre about to tell me onsat maintains gps data for some specified amount of time im guessing between six and twentyfour hours that way they know where youve been and this helps their operators look good when you ask for a nice restaurant or motel nearby he gave boldt a smirk voilá the wheres and whens of danny foreskins comingsandgoings over the past whateveramountoftime he looked over at boldt ponderously and when boldt failed to contradict him slid further down in the seat saying wake me when we get there daddy i need to close my eyes a sec boldt felt as if hed had his pocket picked the location is nearby southeast in sodo foremans escalade has been in this area three times in the past twentyfour hours its not a firm address but its got to mean something when youre right youre right lamoia said i stole your thunder didnt i sarge his eyes remained closed yes you did good whys that good boldt asked after a long period of reflection to consider this because then youre probably pissed off at me he said am i right mildly irritated and if youre pissed off at me then your juices are flowing and were going to need our juices flowing by the time we get there and what about your juices sarge this is me were talking about one of these days john yeah i know a stifled yawn well practiced i know lamoia asked about the escalades current location according to onsat boldt said it was last recorded at the edge of a rail freight yard nearly directly west of their present location and why arent we looking there first because that if anything would give us foreman and we want hayes why are we so anxious to get to hayes sarge this was the question boldt could not allow himself to answer for it would reveal too much of his upcoming plan in his own unique way lamoia had wormed into the heart of the matter drilling for the truth and ripping boldt open in the process there was little these two men had not shared over the past decade and boldts silence suggested a line not to cross for lamoia and the man was briefly but clearly hurt lamoia placed a call from his cell phone interrupting himself to ask boldt for the address where they were headed which boldt then supplied begrudgingly wondering what he was up to he spoke to a woman judging by the way he flirted and she apparently did everything he asked because he kept continually thanking her he disconnected the call clipped the cell phone back to his waist and sighed sometimes i wish i wasnt so smart oh yeah boldt said theres a problem now lamoia would make him drag it out of him unlike bernie lofgrin who had to bore you to death explaining everything in excruciating detail lamoia never volunteered his information his little game southeast of sodo was a nomansland of brick and cinderblock chain link and rusted signs a dmzlike stretch between the city and boeing field sidewalks sprouted weeds broken windows called attention to themselves for a while gangs had used the area moving in and then driven out like livestock crossing neighbors property lines momandpop shops burger houses delivery businesses and car repair had started the process that would lead the former warehouse and light industrial space into offices and retail storefronts the unstoppable evolution of neglected urban space under pressure even an unpredictable economy couldnt stop the city from growingthe bacterium had grown immune to antibiotics okay i give up boldt said why are you so smart theres a building within a block of where the onsat put foremans car thats on bcis impound list law enforcement agencies spd included took possession of assets in narcotics raids and rico convictions often to offset taxpayers for a particularly expensive or timeconsuming investigation vehicles boats homes commercial properties were all impounded most of the time these were put on the auction block and the proceeds returned to the public coffers once the court case settled on occasion a vehicle or boat would be impounded and later put into service by the agency of possession real estate in particular typically lagged in the process sometimes staying on the books a year or two before auction locked and chained and standing vacant they dotted the urban landscape tracked by some bureaucratic auditor on occasion as appeared to be the case now an arresting agent later came to believe the car or boat or commercial real estate in fact belonged to him or her as long as no one was using it lamoias discovery of such a property within walking distance from the various locations where foremans parked escalade had been tracked suggested anything but coincidence lamoia checked an address written in pen on the back of his hand and indicated a turn to boldt a moment later they parked and climbed out place was a print shop supermarket coupons some counterfeit lottery tickets sports tickets went on bcis impound list a year ago september they faced a sturdy steel door looking up through a rusted steel fire escape boldt said i asked both the onsat people and bci to call me if they saw foreman on the move especially returning to this neighborhood who knows if theyll oblige us so we stay ready to be surprised lamoia said you want to take it alone have me play sentry or do we do this together together well call for backup if we manage to get inside i saw you looking at the fire escape lamoia said yes you did you want me up there we take the dime tour first aware of the fact that svengrad may have already gotten to foreman if so svengrads people may have arrived ahead of us or could even be on their way right now they got to him once i dont see that happening a second time foreskins got more sense than that dannys playing lone ranger that makes him vulnerable to all sorts of mistakes if im svengrad i want to know where foreman is at all times that is if danny isnt working for svengrad seventeen million can go a lot of ways point taken they walked along the front of the building and then down an alley where they spotted a distinct architectural division that designated a change in structures a second fire escape led down here in the alley lamoia said i could maybe get up there you see that thirdfloor window several panes of glass in the window were broken out maybe i can get back down to the first floor from inside the impounded print shop had occupied the entire first floor and the basement according to johns information we dont have a warrant and good luck getting one when its a bciimpound property without involving bci just go ahead and imagine that nightmare foremans working an investigation and were interfering thats how the prosecuting attorneys office and bci are going to view this especially if foreman ends up making bci look bad weve got a bci agent gone missing and an informant telling you he may have met foul play that informants not on the books and is never going to put herself there but that right there is probable cause to enter a place our missing guy may have visited several times in the past twentyfour hours lamoia added ill tell you what the sturgeon general sure as shit is not waiting around for a warrant if foreman or hayes is inside this building we gotta get swinging on some ropes here sarge after hours boldt thought not the greatest time to go hunting down a searchandseizure mahoney could expedite this for us boldt said dpa lehla mahoney and boldt had forged a good working relationship over the past few years and shed proven willing to go out on a limb for him he took a moment to call her while lamoia began his ascent of the fire escape toward the broken window an act that required them both to push a dumpster beneath the fire escape to give lamoia a leg up boldt had to leave a callback number on mahoneys service but to his surprise she returned the call within a minute lamoia had reached the second floor boldt detailed their situation and the attorney listened closely interrupting with a number of interrogatives along the way in conclusion she said shed try to get boldt a paper bag warranta verbal warrant from an onduty judge known to be slightly to the left of ralph nader boldt warned her that he and lamoia considered time a factor and were therefore going to kick it counting on mahoney to come through she didnt like that the initial information came from an informant working for the us attorneys office through spds organized crimes unit seeing that a possible obstacle and warned boldt they might not get their warrant yes boldt said but at least i called thats got to count for something not much mahoney replied in fact officers could and did kick doors based on probable cause without ever applying for the proper paperwork boldt knew that maybe sixty percent of the time evidence collected in such raids actually made it to court he didnt want to lose evidence but he didnt want to leave foreman or hayes inside this building another minute and so he made a hasty and difficult decision to give lamoia a thumbsup from his place below the man in the alley part of his reasoning should have included that they werent even sure they could reach the impounded property from that broken window and that argument might have held up if it had been anyone but lamoia climbing that fire escape but as boldt gave the signal he moved immediately back toward the buildings locked front door knowing that at any minute lamoia would appear there a shiteating grin on his face a wisecrack ready on his lips welcome to the hyatt may i check your reservation lamoia asked i knew youd have something cute you just cant leave it alone can you i have a reputation to live up to lamoia said boldt stepped through into a vast empty space that smelled of cat urine and feces a poured concrete floor stained from spilled ink papered with litter it was dark both detectives used small maglites to light their way the central space looked to be about the size of a basketball court but beneath a low ceiling boldt experienced an immediate sense of dread an earlywarning sign hed come to trust over the years and felt inclined to do so now this sense usually proved to be no sense at all but his picking up on evidence subliminally evidence that didnt jump out at first when boldt stopped walking to take in the vastness of the space lamoia knew better than to challenge him or even speak boldt trusted the man to put the wisecracks away and knew it would be so despite all his antics lamoia was a serious cop on the inside lamoia squatted also looking around sweeping his own flashlight across the floor lamoias light stopped moving illuminating a wedgeshaped cone of concrete is that what youre looking for his light held on two thin hash marks black like skid marks from a bike tire not one but two of them and nearly parallel good work john the men followed the irregular black lines across the floor fat to narrow long to short boldt discerned the direction of movement from their shape and pattern heel marks he said following them across the cavernous space a body being dragged boldts temperature increased and he worked to control his breathing to fight the adrenaline that wanted to own him the deeper they moved into this room the darker the more dependent they were on the small flashlights boldt knew they could be following the markings of a machine being dragged across the print shop or a cart with black rubber tires or a hand truck but he believed otherwise a body his internal voice cautioned the body of david hayes his first thought this is spd turf and that gives us jurisdiction to investigate that busted window were cool sarge this isnt coming back on us lamoia said all this for himself knowing instinctively as did boldt that they were on to something and not wanting to face that they could lose by technicality whatever lay at the end of these skid marks but both men had experienced such loss enough times to know the truth theyd taken a gamble the admissibility of whatever they might discover here remained in question they followed the skid marks around a wall to a missing door and a wide set of steel and concrete stairs leading down reflexively lamoia grabbed for his handgun checked the weapon for operability and gripped it along with the flashlight both hands extended before him boldt remained half a step back avoiding any line of fire but did not take up his weapon he checked it once hooking his sport coat behind its bulge so that he could withdraw it at a moments notice and only then if lamoia needed backup john lamoia was a crack shot if anything moved down here without fair notice boldt knew the outcome the bottom of the stairs presented them with a closed door and lamoia tugged it open standing to one side to screen himself a pitchblack space faced them slowly illuminated by their flashlights this basement level was crowded with discarded printing presses stacks of white plastic fivegallon drums junk of every shape and size all stacked together without logic or organization the floor failed to yield the telltale skid marks of a body being dragged and so the two split up boldt heading to the right lamoia to the left using hand signals they communicated a rendezvous point at the far end of a space that remained so dark that the light they carried died in blackness before reaching a distant wall the operating theory was that it had to end somewhere and when it did they would find each other meanwhile boldt kept glancing over his shoulder to keep track of lamoias everdimming light the junk was piled in heaps that created a few aisles to boldts left and the larger aisle that he continued to walk he squared a corner discovering a side wall and felt tempted to call out to lamoia when at that same instant he felt a vibration travel up his legs resonate through his body and he guessed that a vehicle had either just passed by the building or had parked alongside boldts skin prickled as he hurried his pace checking a number of side storage rooms he had his weapon out now in hand and wasnt sure when that had happened he reminded himself that he had a kevlar vest in the trunk of the crown vic and that miles was almost seven and sarah just four and that they deserved to have a daddy well into their childhoods he also reminded himself that he had applied for the lieutenants shield to raise his pay but that liz saw it as a means to keep him out of situations like this and he struggled with the irony that liz herself had put him into this situation it seemed it was always at moments such as these that memories and considerations tried to overrun his thoughts an involuntary invitation of images that challenged his ability to stay focused and made the job all the more difficult as a young cop such images never plagued you experience had its downside the fourth door that boldt tried failed to open and his flashlight revealed a shiny new hasp and padlock at head height he whistled once and lamoia whistled back and at the same instant a muffled voice came from the other side of the door and boldt felt his bowels rumble when it came to victims homicide cops rarely dealt in the living the muffled cries continued from the other side of the door you feel the shake and bake lamoia asked in a forced whisper coming up behind boldt i did boldt said snapping on a pair of latex gloves before tugging on the lock visitors we knew it was a possibility boldt added it could be our own guys trying to catch up to us and update us on foremans status lamoia nonchalantly located a section of pipe amid the debris as they talked leveraged the lock and hasp and split the wooden doorjamb as the screws pulled loose and the hasp gave way still locked to itself the hardware hung from the door boldt twisted the doorknob and eased the door open an eighth of an inch aware there could be trip wires rigged to an explosive or incendiary device if the work of foreman as an investigator he knew to destroy evidence and leave a few surprises for visitors lamoia leaned in close as boldt held the door and without a word of instruction searched the open space carefully with his flashlight held to the crack nada he said boldt pushed the door open another two inches and lamoia reached inside this time his fingers gently inspecting the gap he shook his head no both men paused as they heard the unmistakable sound of someone entering the building upstairs lamoia whispered you did lock the door behind you right sarge boldt nodded whoevers up there had the key not our guys lamoia said trying it out as a joke or releasing tension or both the flip remark bothered boldt who pushed and held the door open another three inches allowing lamoias head to fit through lamoia sized up the rooms interior still looking for booby traps its hayes he said softly looks in decent shape the door clear lamoia said tapping boldts hand and swinging it open further boldt glanced only briefly to confirm it was hayes the man was gagged and bound to a metal chair in a room filled with cluttered shelves his left hand had been roughly bandaged and his mouth and face looked bruised and swollen what about our friends lamoia asked exits boldt asked he slipped past lamoia leaving him to guard the room he freed hayes but did not untie the mans mouth unsure whether the man would keep silent he heard footfalls overhead and guessed there were at least two of them he didnt need or want a confrontation where the prize was a man capable of delivering seventeen million dollars those kinds of stakes made men stupid and stupid men did stupid things i passed one yeah lamoia informed him though i cant vouch for it lets go boldt pulled hayes out of the chair by the arm the man stumbled under cramped legs and lamoia stepped inside and took the other arm the room smelled of excrement and urine and boldt realized hayes had fouled himself long before motherfucker lamoia said getting a close whiff as the man came out of the chair they guided hayes through the door his weight hanging between them like that of an invalid boldt saw the first sweep of light on the stairs and motioned lamoia to lead them they turned and hurried down an aisle created between the stacks of industrial junk boldt could feel the pressure of whoever was back there knowing they drew closer with every step he shook his hand vigorously pointing ahead trying to pick up their speed and lamoia responded by carrying more than his fair share of the weight lamoia steered left at the end of the long aisle boldt checked behind him to see through the tangle of metal what appeared to be two lights theyd reached the bottom of the stairs and now faced the same indecision that he and lamoia had faced only minutes before one light went left and one right in a mirror image boldt looked ahead hoping for an exit sign but couldnt see more than a few feet lamoia trained his light toward the concrete floor as did boldt all three of their heads aimed down in order to overstep obstacles and avoid making noise the visitor on the left turned the same corner that boldt had and when he called out it was in what sounded like russian and boldt felt his legs suddenly move that much faster he didnt consider himself scared of anyone hed spent too many years on the job for thatthey were usually afraid of himand yet the sound of that particular language associated with all means and methods of violence turned his blood cold and he experienced a pang of fear lamoia no coward to anyone or anything picked up his pace as well perhaps it resulted from the burden of hayes carried between them and their vulnerability but whatever the motivation they moved in unison even hayes seemed to find his feet with the first echo of that foreign tongue the three reached a rusted steel door bearing an emergency warning not to open it and boldt wondered if it was to be their luck that the one thing that still worked in this building was the emergency exit alarm built into the box attached to the door no matter what their attempt to open this door promised to make noise old rusty steel didnt move quietly presently subterranean they had to hope the stairwellthat presumably led up into an alleywas not also piled with debris either blocking the door or preventing them from climbing out once through lamoia checked with boldt in the dim light his right hand on the doors panic bar he was looking for permission from boldt and with the moment of truth at hand boldt wondered if this was indeed the best course of action without a doubt their departure would attract attention to do so unnecessarily seemed a ridiculous risk to take but as the light to the right flickered and died far closer to their aisle than boldt had imagined he gave the nod and lamoia shoved on the tarnished panic bar the door came open with a horrormovie groan of metal on metal not merely calling attention but shouting lamoia swung it open and it stuck he let go of hayes threw a shoulder into it and won enough room for them to pass the shouting from behind also rose in russian followed immediately by hurried footfalls boldt the last to pass through braced himself for the sting of a bullet or the pain of a club to his head lamoia awaited him with a bent and battered discarded trash can that looked like an oversized crushed beer can he rudely knocked boldt out of the way and braced the can beneath the doors outside handle wedging the door shut they hurried up the stairs the first loud bang on the door and the agonized sound of the trash cans tin bending boldt didnt like the idea of running from thugs and he knew without asking that lamoia felt the same the thing to do was ditch hayes and stand their ground and make arrests based on breakingandentering but if these two were backed by two more if spd backup failed to arrive quickly with seventeen million on the line things could get dicey so lamoia asked hopefully nowhere near as out of breath as boldt felt we cant boldt said hayes got his feet under him and no longer needed much assistance his mouth remained gagged silver tape holding the gag in place bugeyed he shouted to communicate but neither boldt nor lamoia was interested where to lamoia asked the slumberjack boldt proposed naming a runofthemill motel that spd used occasionally lucky you lamoia said forcibly taking hold of hayes now by his collar and throwing him ahead to keep him moving free hbo and the taxpayer pays its not exactly how its going to work john boldt informed his sergeant his mind already playing through his and lizs needs over the next fortyeight hours im paying for this one lets keep it between the three of us foremans got to have access to anything were doing either officially or through his pals we cant risk that these lies came so effortlessly now he nearly believed them himself he wondered if they made it past lamoia as well hayes appeared nonplussed at the mention of foremans name leaving boldt to wonder who had been responsible for the mans abduction that or foreman had thought to use rohypnol to erase the mans memory of the event and to further tie the abduction to the earlier tortures boldt had slipped the name into the explanation hoping for a response and felt the wind knocked out of him when it failed to register hurrying toward the crown vic boldt dragged along this man whod had sex with his wife his only real wish to find a legitimate excuse to kick hayes squarely in the balls start kicking and never stop nineteen boldts cell phone plugged in and recharging cut a shrill tone through the bedrooms darkness at exactly am liz stopped snoring and sat up as if hearing a fire alarm still in a dream state the kids she asked boldt who was already out of bed then she remembered the state of affairs sank back to her pillow and said oh as she realized it was only another of his latenight summonses another part of the same nightmare a womans voice said into boldts ear hell talk to you and your guy but only you and your guy no wires no tricks half hour from nowtwothirty hell give you ten minutes tops nothing on the record she named the locationthe pink ladya strip joint on first avenue if theres no objection well see you there after some struggle he identified the voice as that of maddie olson he said no objection both he and lamoia could reach the club within fifteen minutes she disconnected the call without ceremony boldt dialed john he felt tempted to go it alone but lamoia was streetsmart willing to play tough off the books and handy to have around as backup he had to consider the possibility however remote that olson was leading him into a trap matthews answered and passed the phone to lamoia and from somewhere inside boldt came the need to look across through the gray haze of a dark bedroom and see his wifes head on the pillow the sight pleased him and it occurred to him that he didnt harbor any hatred or resentment for her affair with hayes at least not at that moment he worried over the videotape and what it would do to miles and sarah if their teachers and the parents of their friends saw pieces of it on the evening news there were no secrets for anyone in public service especially a veteran homicide cop whom so many would love to see knocked off his pedestal but something about dragging hayes from that abandoned building about placing him in the motel under the watchful eye of bobbie gaynes had lessened the mystique surrounding the man bloodied and beaten down hayes had struck him as a sad excuse a pitiful kid gone bad but sarge lamoia whined a downtown strip joint how about someplace a little less distracting boldt marveled that even just wakened lamoia not only had his sarcasm intact but was willing to say such a thing in front of matthews fifteen minutes boldt hung up without dignifying that with a response the pink lady seethed neon lighting and loud music a sweetandsour smell of male excitement and cheap cologne mixed with the tang of saltrimmed margaritas it was nineteenyearold girls not women in negligees serving drinks and another up onstage naked and with a shaved pubis rubbing herself against a stainless steel pole and trying to look anything but pained to be there maddie olson wore a tailored black leather coat and a turtleneck that flattered her her jeans hugged her bottom the seam running up her crack and boldt was surprised when lamoia didnt trip on a small step because he hadnt taken his eyes off their hostess they were led to a red leather corner booth with a large formica table anchored to the floor alekseevich looked about nineteen himself he wore a nice suit probably paid for by svengrad dark gray but hed lost the tie for the afterhours entertainment he wore a gold chain around his furry neck that if real was worth several months of boldts salary he held a proletarskiethe smoking gunand had large hands with clean nails but several cuts and bruises his razor couldnt keep up there was a shadow across his cheeks and down his neck he used gel in his short hair and a tooth whitener but it was the outright contempt in his blue eyes that struck boldt first he looked disgusted to be in their company thanks boldt said adopting an unusual opening to this particular chess match alekseevichs face softened some just a kid under there somewhere you like baseball boldt asked football soccer he corrected himself having used the european term first mls he said i follow colorado but seattles trying to get an expansion team my boy plays soccer boldt said and piano alekseevich said turning boldts stomach pretty good your boy stepping in to cover boldts shock at this knowledge of his son lamoia asked who holds your passport malina you or the detective here the mans face burned lamoia said the lieutenant has a little tit for tat you understand tit for tat not tit for twat you gotta pull your mind out of the gutter for a moment maybe stop letting your eyes drift over my shoulder at beaver cleaver because youre going to want to pay attention here alekseevich tried to look bored and disinterested but lamoia had gotten to him boldt said i need some information from you theres not time to verify it so ill have to take your word if i get your word if i like the information then im going to give you a headsup that will save everyone a lot of trouble if i read you wrong you dont get the information the man checked his watch seven minutes lamoia said go on be like that tough guy he shook his head pulling fingernails off people who cant fight back the shit does not work like that here the lieutenant here has some good juice to give you and you keep playing like you dont give a fuck then were outta here and thats that youre the tough one is that it good cop bad cop again alekseevich feigned boredom you dont even want to go there lamoia said leveling a gaze on the man that could have frozen water tonight were both bad with lamoia you got what you saw and at that moment he was all testosterone and adrenaline alekseevich offered a mock shiver lamoia had the last word with a subtle grin that maybe only boldt understood but one that left no doubt that if he let the two go at it out back lamoia would prevail a street fighter with an absurd amount of confidence and a tolerance for pain lamoia was not to be messed with alekseevich directed his attention away from lamoia and focused on boldt and yet he held the unsure expression of a little old lady on the sidewalk gravely concerned about the approaching mutt unleashed and with its ears back a waitress showed up to take their orders she wore a sheer translucent nightgown tied around her waist with a purple ribbon her breasts were high and small her nipples dark as chocolate and her pubic hair shaved low and narrow like a mohawk lamoia took it all in since her chest was at his head height due to the raised booth he ordered a domestic beer the girl took the rest of the orderfor boldt a ginger ale for olson an iced teaand then reminded lamoia that she and all the wait staff were available for lap dances she made it sound like a bank teller reminding a customer of home loans alekseevich tried to win her attention but she was impressed by lamoia and didnt give the russian the time of day boldt loved the look on the russians face as the girl went to get the drinks so alekseevich said to boldt you were saying no i was asking boldt corrected a certain individualand to humor me lets just say that individual is you and that i can prove itassaulted a man named david hayes and later a state bureau of criminal investigation officer by the name of foreman tonight we got word that a man named paul geiser lost a few fingernails and that foreman was on the list again as well alekseevich shook his head in denial and looked to olson for help what is this his indignant tone fell falsely flat olson said this is you talking to them this is me buying you a break and risking my assignment to do it youre supposed to be the wise guy right so wise up im not asking if you did those assaults boldt said i know you did what detective olson knows is that regardless of your arrangement with other law enforcement i now have enough evidence to arrest you for those crimes alekseevich tried to look as if this didnt surprise him or upset him but an actor he wasnt what i need to know is if you did david hayes night before last and i urge you to think real clearly on this matter in terms of your discussions with foreman and geiser i want it verbatim if possible word for word boldt explained in case his vocabulary went over the others head what im offering you and detective olson and her colleagues is the chance to keep this little charade of yours going this snitching of yours for the government olson looked troubled boldt said i have two options one as i mentioned is to arrest you the second less ideal for you is to tell svengrad who his mole is and let him discuss this with you directly the waitress returned with the drinks and practically put her breast into lamoias face while leaning over the table boldt waited for her to leave the ginger ale smelled of dishwasher soap and tasted flat he pushed it aside it lays out pretty simple boldt continued so why dont you start talking right now five minutes lamoia said turning alekseevichs own arrogance back onto him the rooms shifting neon lights threw red across their table alekseevichs skin took on a crimson tone nearly matching the leather boldt looked at his watch and said four minutes he then met eyes with the russian youve got a lot of ground to cover alekseevich looked over at olson as if maybe she could fix this boldt hated to burn her goodwill as it had gotten him to this point but for him it came to liz against alekseevich and that made it no contest olson sat back in the red leather heaved a sigh of disgust and said start talking call them alekseevich instructed olson she looked across at boldt her anger building boldt shook his head she told the man next to her i cant call them he repeated this meeting isnt happening boldt reminded not in her world not in ours so how can she make a call shed have to acknowledge arranging the meeting and shes not willing to do that neither are we by the time she places the call were out of here and youre left with either arrest or svengrad alekseevichs blue eyes jumped between the three his indifference losing some of its starch care for an extension lamoia asked boldt pulled out his detectives notebook and a pen in an act of overt confidence alekseevich began his debriefing i do what i am told i am immune as long as i give report immunity olson provided for boldt and lamoia not from us boldt repeated were running out of time here lamoia reminded boldt took a risk lets do it this way ill fill in the blanks and youll stop me when im wrong behind them some patrons cheered boldt didnt want to know why but he briefly could imagine it was for him given the choice hed just offered alekseevich alekseevich pursed his lips and nodded slightly olson pulled out a narrow pad of notepaper versions of which were in both lamoias and boldts coat pockets birds of a feather he thought lamoia signaled the waitress accomplishing what the russian had failed to do he ordered a vodka on the rocks for their subject boldt translated what hed brought in his head as questions into statements and carefully laid them out like a card dealer turning over cards in a poker game both he and lamoia looked for tellstics or mannerisms indicating the suspects knowledge of events or his reluctance or unwillingness to share few were practiced enough not to involuntarily reveal something of their inner workings alekseevich had a language to overcome the late hour the few drinks hed already consumed boldt worked him slowly focusing almost entirely on paul geiser and danny foreman alekseevich tried to mask his curiosityhed clearly been expecting questions about david hayes foremans on svengrads payroll boldt stated for the man about halfway into his laundry list no alekseevich was working through the vodka a little quickly a tell that revealed his discomfort the answer surprised boldt it had seemed the most obvious explanation you know this or youre guessing but when olson shook her head he realized hed asked a question not made a statement hayes disappearing you tried geiser thinking he was behind it and got it wrong geiser gave you foreman yes this reminded him of the game twenty questions that hed played as a kid on long car rides with his parents thinking of his parents made him think of his sister and thoughts of his sister made him think of his children he didnt like doing business this way but he stayed with it because olson wasnt objecting he stated foreman threatened svengrad extorted him for hayess return i not know about that alekseevich said breaking away from his monosyllabic answersan extremely good sign that he was either growing more comfortable with the process or was becoming more drunk lamoia looked ready to say something thought better of it and whispered into boldts ear boldt felt bad about using his friend about not revealing the bigger game he had planned but only he and liz could later be held responsible he wasnt dragging lamoia into the consequences of what he had planned he believed lizs safety depended on this secret you found foreman boldt stated tonight i mean yes geiser was persuaded to make a phone call for us foreman took the bait foreman gave you the location of the warehousewhere to find hayes and your guys pursued it yes who tortured hayes out at the cabin if not you not me alekseevich confirmed i dont know who someone else you work with no it would have been me the man said indirectly confirming hed done the others regardless of gaining some clarity boldt felt pushed more deeply into the labyrinth rather than finding a clear way out he then asked the question that lamoia had posed to him converting it into a statement paul geiser is on svengrads payroll alekseevich hesitated looking over at olson she said youre dipping into privileged territory lieutenant its not privileged because its not on the record detective she nodded back to alekseevich perhaps the russian said thats not good enough it is best i can do i have seen this man geiser only but once out at the whidbey house alekseevich was slowly working away from plain answers and olson to her credit was making no attempt to stop him boldt asked olson about the whidbey house and she informed him this was the svengrad residence a palatial estate on the southwest shore of whidbey island boldt said geiser was supposed to help get the injunction liftedget svengrads caviar out of federal impound the man shrugged i do not know olson explained malina happened to see geiser in a hall over at the us attorneys office during a grand jury prep it was a flukea dedicated elevator stopped and opened on the wrong floor malina looks out and recognizes geiser from seeing him at svengrads estate we never connected the dots any further than you just did assuming the meeting had something to do with the caviar but weve been careful to shelter ourselves from the prosecuting attorneys office thats why were dealing with the us attorneys office insteadbecause of this thing this turned boldts world upside down he now believed that for the past several hours hed had foremans and geisers roles reversed none of this fully ruled out that hayes had been hidden by foreman as part of a cooperative deal between the states bureau of criminal investigation and geisers office as foreman had told liz it seemed entirely possible that the two agencies might have discovered alekseevichs informant status and wanted to protect the ownership of the hayes case by keeping alekseevich all to themselves turf wars could make monsters out of a common investigation even if it proved true that geiser had taken a bribe or was still on svengrads payroll it might involve nothing more than working on hayess parole and the injunction on the caviar svengrads knuckle man wasnt going to have the answers to these deeper questions the bottom line was that boldt could trust neither foreman nor geiser he knew svengrad was seeking answers to some of the same questions that he had meaning the race for the money still seemed to be on which kept liz squarely in it this both excited and terrified him does svengrad plan to kidnap my wife boldt asked the big man shrugged and boldt accepted the answer believing svengrad unlikely to include his subordinates in his longterm plans it didnt confirm or deny the possibility the comment about my son and his playing piano boldt said distracted from his intended line of questioning is svengrad willing to play that card my children a police officers children boldt felt a bubble in his throat olson tensed this was clearly news to her lamoia looked unruffled but boldt could feel his concern like heat not me alekseevich said i not harm children this man from bank the one with heart problem this was not me he meant tony larossa and the abduction of larossas family boldt pushed but svengrad is willing to play that card alekseevich stared across the table and took a long sip of the vodka draining it answer the question olson told him more vehemently than anything shed said yet but alekseevich already had answered the question whether shed picked up on it or not that cocksure silence of his spoke loud and clear what now alekseevich asked never breaking eye contact with boldt that was boldts question as well twenty the saturday before the gala reception and the ceremonial switchover from westcorp to mtk proved the longest day of lizs life the waiting for the phone to ring the surveillanceprotection by both uniformed and plainclothes spd officers some of whom lingered in her living room the temptation to call kathy and the kids versus lous determination not to make any contact whatsoever for fear of svengrad somehow tracking it the only break in the day arrived in the form of a briefing pahwan riz the director of special operations asked for a meeting with liz and lou to discuss what was expected of her in the event she was contacted lou agreed to the meeting in part because he had to in part because she was looking to relieve the tedium and monotony of waiting for the phone to ring but lous primary reason for taking the meeting was to gather as much information about rizs plan as possible in order to thwart it if the combined efforts of seattle police and bci prevented svengrad from getting his money wired out then the video was certain to surface damaging if not ending both their careers quite possibly miles and sarah would be put permanently at risk lou had to defeat his own people while figuring out a way to protect his family if he could doublecross svengrad in the processso much the better whatever riz planned played into that lou briefed her before the others arrived im cooking something up i thought so its complicated it is isnt it she enjoyed the irony though lou seemed to miss it its going against my own guys youve got that right her faced knotted in concern you cant do that lou not for me not for anyone the kids he inquired silencing her going against the very people who are about to be in this room which is why its important you go along with anything they tell you it doesnt mean you will go along with it but for now youll tell them you will she nodded cringing at the idea of his turning against his own team danny foreman is not to be trusted the deeper i look into all this danny keeps showing up and hell be here i suspect he will i told you he seemed off when he paid me that visit she said the point is i dont want us giving anything away to danny or any of the others something they could use later on or something to tip them to my plan so for now im keeping some things from you and i just wanted to be up front about that so noted lou took in a lungful of air and held it and she knew this to signal something important about to be said she felt herself brighten with anticipation he said but you need to know that john and i took hayes into custody last night she felt faint unable to speak private custody not downtown we got him out of a difficult situation and im hoping hell repay us by cooperating thats a work in progress she clarified you got him out of a difficult situation thats what youre saying however improbable its true private custody what does that mean the point is im working on something i never doubted that lou i just regret he interrupted its a long shot in all honesty it probably has only a faint chance of succeeding but for right now its all ive got and its already in motion in all honesty she repeated his words with desperation in her voice her own lack of honesty had brought all of this upon him she hated herself at that moment to her surprise a man named marc obrien ran the meeting she didnt recall having ever met the man and his attendance reinstalled her sense of violationthat some stranger had at least in his mind taken control of her life was here to dictate to her what had to be done and how to do it judging by looks obrien belonged in an irish pub with a pint in hand to fuel his glowing cheeks and bubble nose his loud voice supported his demeanor of reckless overconfidence here was a man who on a sinking boat would announce to anyone who would listen what a great day it was for a swim his nextincommand pahwan riz the darkskinned malaysian tracked lizs every reaction her every movement with his crisp green eyes like a cat watching the family dog lou john lamoia and daphne matthews all sat stiffly on the same couch together matthews in the middle lined up like kewpie dolls at the county fair maggie the infant child under matthewss legal guardianship slept in a car seat propped up between two chairs in the kitchen turning the new mothers head that direction whenever an errant sound surfaced danny foreman looking worse for the wear two fingers of his left hand bandaged occupied a needlepoint bench against the wall that fronted the stairs leading to the homes second floor unseen up there a police officer sat near a window keeping watch another indignity she could not get used to the castle keep foreman sat forward resting on thick forearms that pressed into his thighs he lifted his head every so often looking as if he might speak but apparently not finding the strength to do so she knew that if hed had his way lou would have kept foreman out of the meeting but as hed explained it to her he couldnt block bci from sitting in on the briefing and he didnt have anything more than circumstantial evidence to bring against foreman not to mention that one cop charging another cop was fraught with bureaucratic red tape and could not be done without the inclusion of the very highest brassand lou wasnt prepared to go that route given that he was planning to endrun his own department himself riz announced the purpose of this meeting is that at some point in the next twentyfour to thirty hours we expect that the conversion of funds resulting from the merger will necessitate an attempt to move the embezzled seventeen million out of the bank that will apparently require your participation he told liz your cooperation obrien said we believe you will either be contacted or abducted he said this loudly and in a way that to her sounded grossly impersonal she felt shivers ripple up her arms riz clearly felt the mans insensitivity as well he lowered his voice looked directly at liz and continued we dont know where or when we dont know how our intel is basically nil on this case all we have is you mrs b and its time we laid down some ground rules liz had hoped to sit around as a spectator a listener to avoid any direct participation in this meeting to let lou do the talking for her but she felt her mouth move and out came words yes well i dont know how many of you have ever been on the other end of this kind of surveillance but i find it claustrophobic invasive and oppressive so the sooner its over the better riz and obrien ran down a number of possible scenarios for her abduction or participation liz said you must be aware that there are at least four other people with security clearance to access the ibm as s pahwan riz said detective foreman danny foreman came awake like one of miless toys that reacts to sound lou had mentioned that danny had been tortured a second time but there was no evidence of that liz bci has had its eye on those of you with access since the day hayes was paroled you and larossa are the only two theyve contacted and larossa is now in icu and not an option that is not to say we arent paying attention to the others of course we are but the bets are on you he sagged his head again the doll back asleep he sucked down his coffee as if it were juice obrien said our play is that youre their target keep in mind that we are substituting one of our people for you so there is basically no situation in which we see you in any kind of trouble but we must take precautions our primary concern is what actions we take as a group and specifically you as an individual if we in fact experience an acl to brief you on the various proactive responses at your disposal all contact lost lou had coached her on some of the abbreviations all of which she felt sounded childish and unnecessary the secret codes made it more serious to them but more ludicrous to herlike a bunch of kids up in a tree fort planning a raid obrien had begun the meeting laying out the difficulties of surveillance of hostage situations raising the possibility that her surveillance team might lose track of her at some point the moment he said that she realized a pawn had no choice but to move where and when the player dictated if i carry one of those tracking boxes theyll search me and find it right she asked i mean assuming they realize theyve got the wrong woman and then somehow get hold of me riz explained that there were other smaller devices available that could be rigged inside her bra or in a hem the toe of a shoe or even her underwear or on her person which she took to mean a body cavity and she felt briefly ill riz added with the smaller devices transmission distance is considerably reduced he made it sound like he was selling her a vacuum cleaner so put one in my clothes im okay with that fine riz said lou met eyes with her admiring her she appreciated the gesture but realized that at that moment he had little idea what she was going through your options include obrien listed your playing by their rules and waiting it out your attempting to give us some way to locate you or escape lamoia said interrupting consideration of escape is not an option matthews said objecting trying to outrun organized crime singlehandedly is simply not an option again husband and wife met eyes wasnt this exactly what lou was proposing to her wasnt this the solution he had planned again words left her mouth youre saying it is not an option she made it a statement matthews said delicately thinking about it focusing on it is not an option theyll pick up on it hostage situations require the abducted individual to loosen the hold of the keepers one does this by playing into whatever it is theyve asked of you by cooperating not disobeying you surprise them by your willingness your eagerness to cooperate this has been proven over and over again to be a hostages most effective way to gain enough physical freedom and emotional detachment to invoke a causal action that either reconnects with surveillance or provides an opportunity for intervention taking a phone off the hook for instance riz said if we suspect a general area youve been taken to well look for that kind of thing a phone line left open for a minute or more obrien added you can accidentally turn a stereo or television on too loudly if theyve got you in a car you might bump the emergency flashers might even turn them off yourself apologizing riz said activate the rear wiper if its not raining toss litter from a window all these things are potential helpers but what you dont do matthews said is try anything too overt dialing the lieutenants number or from a telephone or mobile phone that would put you at risk even if you see the opportunity check that riz said interrupting matthews if you dial from a land line even if you hang up immediately weve got you so dont rule that one out completely same with a pay phone a car phonea cell phone he said glancing at matthews anything you can get your hands on liz took note of the contradiction and sided with matthews riz and obrien sounded more like they wanted her to keep the game going than to protect herself try to stand out of the crowd whenever possible obrien said if theyve got you moving and they very well may then cross on the red lights jaywalk use the stairs avoid the crowds its the simple little things that allow us to stay with you better the computers foreman said suddenly from his bench he glanced at liz he had told her his and geisers intentionsthat she wire the money to a government account regardless of what people like riz told her to do yes riz said should you find yourself logging on to the as about to gain access first please type either miles or sarah as your password the server wont allow you access but youll try again using your correct password and youll be in by doing so you drop a handkerchief for us to follow a handkerchief liz inquired not appreciating the analogy it made her into a victorian woman trying to garner attention we could tell you more but wed have to kill you a smiling obrien joked before thinking the comment sobered and silenced the room obrien apologized and said we believe hayes possesses some way to erase all record of whatever he has you do while inside the server if you signal us ahead of time using miles or sarah it greatly increases our chances of tracing whatever it is you initiate she fought herself to not look over at lou it has to do with network ip addresses and things i dont even understand but white collar crime made it clear that they need you to send us the smoke signal if theyre to have a chance riz said miles sarah spelled exactly as they sound with the numeral following we thought theyd be easy to remember you type in either password and were piggybacked with you as you go in its like uncoiling a ball of string as you walk through a maze foreman said lifting his head again and meeting eyes with her he didnt want her giving them that string to follow he wanted her doing this his way message received liz found herself in a staring contest with danny matthews broke in you need your rest were done here not long thereafter everyone left the house she and lou rounded up the coffee mugs so he asked ugh she said lou put on some musicplaintive jazzand gently steered her by the elbow to a dead space in the room that offered no clear line of sight through a window despite all the shades being drawn he whispered and it caused her shivers i cant imagine what youre going through they mean well for what its worth not much she said is it possible what they said about tracking you inside the bank servers oh yes she replied if key tracking is present then every time i touch a key theyll follow it he considered this for a long moment then whatever you do you mustnt enter those passwords they gave you you mustnt turn on the key tracking they dont know david she said immediately regretting the intimacy that implied on her part he glanced up into her eyes she saw disguised hurt she explained hes far too sophisticated a programmer to leave any of this up to human error yes anyone using the as would have to log on to do so and to move the money out will require routing information and an account number and its possible though not certain that account data will have to be manually input but would he allow a keytracking program to run absolutely not my value to him is that i can get past the physical security to reach the as and i have a password that will allow access into it but do you think he would allow their software to record whatever account numbers are input hes smarter than that lou even if i type one of those passwords david will have already thought of a way to defeat it trust me theyre not in his league lou she added i dont mean for that to be hurtful its good information he said though his voice cracked belying his true emotions danny gave me this look she said hes still expecting me to transfer this money where he says to transfer it its not danny im worried about its the idea that whoever gives you an account number risks your remembering it by phone by note it doesnt matter how its deliveredits your recalling it later they cant afford they are typically enormously long strings she said doesnt matter lou returned youre a banker they cant rule out that you have a head for such numbers and if you memorize the destination account the money can then be traced and found right she nodded understanding immediately the subtext and why her husband was reluctant to say it aloud if im around to repeat it she said lou did not look at her nor did he speak directly to her comment instead he backed away and mumbled something about needing a cup of tea this she realized had been his fear all along are we going to talk about this plan of yours she asked the two of them eating ham sandwiches at the kitchen table lou had stayed at the house following the meeting something she hadnt expected but found comforting at first shed thought him exhausted and in need of the rest but she amended that opinion as he then spent two hours working over a yellow legal pad he said its occurred to everyone that youd be at extreme risk we know for a fact that my guys will expect me to insist you use a standin i will demand it of course i have already they will never in a million years believe i would arrange for you to doublecross them so theyll expect an undercover woman to play my part and well go along with that well go along with it on the surface anything else would be out of character so its kind of a race she said if we play it right thats exactly what it comes down to yes the real liz beats the fake liz to the ass and we accomplish that how she added we beat them off the starting line we deliver the unexpectedsomething they didnt plan for its not easy to fool the fooler not when they have as many as a dozen undercover officers watching our every move but i know their training i know the contingencies they plan for our bigger concern is svengrad he lost hayes and the software he lost everything he knows that you are needed to accomplish this its inevitable that he comes after you remember that none of the people here this afternoon except lamoia knows i have hayes locked away gaynes does she said playing devils advocate and immediately regretting it for she saw the consternation it caused she wasnt here for the meeting and shes on our side anyway she wasnt sure why she corrected him this way as she so often did to gain the upper hand to show him who the clearer thinker was to be noticed in the short term it felt good to correct him but within a few seconds she typically wanted to crawl and hide knowing her timing was terrible she apologized to him saying i do that all the time and im not sure why lou winced stung perhaps by her sincerity were going to make it through this you think taking him into custody humanized him for me there was no asking about whom he was speaking he went on for a moment talking himself out of any feelings of superiority that his abducting hayes accounted for discrediting any moral supremacythat he worked the side of good and david the side of evil he was telling her that hed overcome some hurdle and she was listening she wanted to tell him that he shouldnt risk his career by pulling a sting on his own people but in many ways it seemed too late for that if the tape was released his career and his family would suffer but if he were caught tricking his own people he might lose his pension as well with her actions she had put him squarely into unworkable options and now she forced him to look for some way out she told him as much expressing her remorse as sincerely as possible she said i dont think this kind of thing can be undone using legal pads youd be surprised legal pads come in very handy were going to joke about this what choice do we have a woman is going to take my place out there you realize the danger we put her in she asked allowing her real anger to surface now never mind all the secret codes that i can use to leave crumbs for your people to follow what about her what codes is she going to use when these peoplevery nasty people according to you and yoursrealize theyve got the wrong liz boldt lou held up the pad of legal paper she saw inked handwriting and boxes and arrowsa complicated diagram resulting from a conflicted mind he said the best defense is a good offense you cant be oblique right now im not up to it it never gets that far never gets how far your surrogate i agree we cant let that happen you can stop it timing he said but theyre ready right now theyve got some standin ready around the clock to take my place thats what they said right did i miss something theyre expecting you to receive a call everything hinges on them listening in to our land line and both our mobiles you get the call and a clock starts a substitution is plannedhere at the house if possible in the field if not but how has that changed she asked still puzzled you arranged for the costume to be delivered to my office did you not i did it took her a moment to realize he intended that as his explanation not a question for her to answer the costume she said lou pointed to the top of his yellow pad and a box there so heavily outlined the ink had smeared it all starts with the costume she didnt know what that meant not exactly but resolved herself to the fact he was now calling the shots he saw some way out of this however dim no matter that she struggled to have faith in him and his yellow pad she was bound to him body and soul he ran the early part of the show and she committed herself to doing exactly as he instructed even if it struck her as an exercise in futility which it currently did the later part of the show inside the bank was all hers im never going to sleep tonight she said yeah lou agreed i know twentyone liz went to church sunday morning and boldt went with her both out of a longing to be near her and a desire to protect her over her objection she carried her mobile phone set to vibrate if called and the two sat on the aisle so that she could jump up if it rang boldt didnt mind the services appreciated that there were two readers instead of a minister that the sermon derived from the bible and an interpretive work not the pulpit and preaching the hymns sung robustly often ran gooseflesh down his arms praising love and promising hope of all things dear to boldt hope was perhaps the greatest he reflected on his motivations for becoming a cop all those years ago aware that hope factored into it a belief in a moral code and the knowledge that someone had to uphold that code other cops had brothers who had been shot sisters raped homes vandalized all valid reasons for signing up but for boldt it had amounted to something far less visceral a cause a calling the church and its parishioners represented the community he felt he was there to protect and so the service was filled with irony for him as the person who needed the most protection was his own wife and for reasons of adultery and what the church would call sin in the past few days he had worked his way to a form of understanding that made their time together tolerable he felt forgiveness a long way off a firefly at the end of a very long tunnel but a necessary step toward a full healing between them whether he and liz made it fully back to sharing love or not there was no abandoning the family what if id gotten the call last night she asked over a salad at a sandwich shop after church you didnt but if i had he shrugged off the question you roll the dice you take your chances we werent ready the costume was delivered to my office late friday he said i checked he said when she gave him an inquisitive look after we talked last night i thought id better check so whys it so important she asked the costume or arent you going to tell me you have enough on your mind thats a lousy excuse he stabbed his salad a little salty for his palate too much anchovy in the dressing she eyed him across the table annoyed by his avoidance so we were ready she asked adding if id gotten the call he said the complication was no delivery on sunday i had to find a way around that johns gone to help us out then again maybe it wont be you at all maybe youre a diversion nothing more maybe phillip is inside the bank at this very moment making the wire transfer youd have heard wouldnt you she sounded deeply concerned and he realized that she was already exhibiting some hostage traits involving herself emotionally to the point that if someone took her place it registered as disappointment instead of relief i would have he confirmed worried about her once again his concern came in waves but he noticed a tendency for the troughs to run lower as the minutes ticked on if the call had come early my plan wouldnt have flown he admitted by prior arrangement they both knew what came next liz was to throw herself into it while special ops looked on in befuddled confusion if all went well for a brief few minutes daphne matthews would play his wife there had been a time when he would have welcomed that thought he now understood far better the pain such fantasy represented what are you thinking she asked youve gone silent over there for over six years he had kept a secret and now it seemed there was no room for such artifice her past had been stripped off her without choice dogs tearing at the hem of her clothing until exposed the process had allowed boldt to remain sanctimonious when in fact he had his secrets too the woman i slept with the onenight stand when we were separated i dont begrudge you that she said interrupting i was running around with david you were hurt weve been through this it was daphne he said identifying his partner for the first time crushing liz judging by the surprised look on her face she gently placed her fork down onto the edge of her plate some salad still attached the dressing now dripping onto the table too salty he thought as she quietly excused herself from the table and walked toward the rest rooms a full ten minutes passed before she returned solemnly to the table her face and neck glowing red as they did after a hard cry boldt had paid she stood there by the table never making any move toward the chair ready she asked she turned toward the door before he answered and he followed resisting her effort to make him feel bad for telling the truth in his mind there was a time and a place for everything and this had been both he felt he needed to explain daphnes willingness to go along with this to put herself and her job at risk he felt obligated to be as honest with her as she had been with him and there was just no good time for such revelations they came when they came and his had come in a sandwich shop after church and the call for redemption in the beautiful hymns the other thought on his mind the one he dared not share with her was that he might be in jail by the end of the night and that if he were arrested the one person he could count on to fight for him was daphne matthews and that liz should understand the connection they all three shared the truth could hurt no one our strength is not lessened by giving utterance to truth one of the readers had read that line during the service and it had stuck in boldts craw as he had realized all the pain she carried for bearing the burden of her truth while his own truth remained guarded no more he had not said this to wound her despite what she might think he told her because he had a bad feeling about the events to come and he needed to bare all before their arrival she kept to their bedroom for the first few hours of their return to the house and he left her there to deal with it she ventured out only once stopped in the doorway and said to him its all right what you did telling me i mean its my problem not yours if you believe that were in trouble if you believe were not in trouble already youre fooling yourself she fired back danny foreman said id get a call sunday evening tonight that the call would arrange for me to pick up davids software that id make the transfer and the money would go to a government account boldt had expected the conversation to remain on his brief affair with daphne matthewsthat liz would make him pay for that but now he realized she was looking for a way out of that morass while at the same time attempting to remain clear about what was expected of her he picked up her lead and explained danny is the one wholl be making the call danny must be the one with the software im guessing he was the one who ran me on my goose chase the palm pilotwhen he was talking to youwireless internet access he was following my every move in the car that night according to geiser there is no deal between him and danny foreman which means either geiser is lying as danny said he would or danny is pulling a lone ranger in order to make these arrests and recover the money the third possibility is that dannys planning an early retirement by keeping the money for himself i dont want to believe that the one who got burned by hayess disappearance is svengradand hes also the one with the long reach the one to watch which is why he directed that you would be using his account for the transfer and no one elses but what account wheres the number he should have given it to me by now he cant he knows pahwan would stick some electronic glue onto that account number and that he svengrad would never be free of us hes too smart for that boldt asked so the question is how and when will he get the account number to you and why has he waited until now boldt felt a flash of heat pulse through him as if hed accidentally grabbed a live wire past conversations percolated through him like groundwater rising during a flood he answered because he knows you arent in the bank that you arent anywhere near that server it hit him so clearlyit explained so much hes watching me having me watched she said suddenly looking left to right as if expecting to catch someone staring the tumblers fell into place and the truth unlocked for him he felt an immense sense of relief wondering at the role of random chance and whether he or liz would have reached this same place made this discovery had he not confessed to her he continued by saying listen carefully to what im about to tell you twentytwo sunday at pm boldts cell phone rang as if hed set an alarm clock he and liz were sitting in the living room the shades drawn she on the couch he in a chair she pretending to thumb through a catalog he monitoring the surveillance radio channel via an ear bud for the past thirty minutes no words had been exchanged as the clock moved toward the bank reception a thirtyyearold female officer whose name boldt had already forgotten remained within earshot at the kitchen table liz continued scanning gift items as he answered the call didnt succumb to the gravity of the moment boldt terminated the call and said to her theres a taxi out front the drivers on his way up to the door with a box liz checked her own phone then glanced up at boldt before he turned his attention to the kitchen where the officer was already receiving orders over the secure walkietalkie boldt jumped up and waved liz into the bedroom and the backup officer out of sight cradling his handgun behind his back and moving toward the front door all for show liz knew this taxis arrival was lous doing he waited for the doorbell to chime gave it an appropriate pause and opened the door the cab driver sounded half indian half arab happy birthday to the missus he said the box was wrapped in a flowerprint paper torn and untaped on one side the driver explained i dont deliver nothing without seeing whats inside but its okay only clothes forty bucks for a fivedollar fare what the hell he added theres a note pointing out the unaddressed white envelope taped to the top boldt stepped back leaving the door ajar and told the driver to open the box empty the contents listen mister boldt displayed his shield and repeated himself the driver tore off the paper and nervously upended the box a pile of black and white clothing spilled out boldt instructed him to shake out the clothing which the driver then did boldt returned the gun to its holster tipped the man ten dollars and attempted to send him away at which point the driver said hed been instructed to wait for the fare to take her where boldt inquired the man shrugged i wasnt told listen you want me to take off no boldt put on his best face of confusion for the sake of the backup officer he sent the driver to wait in the cab and then pushed the door shut he held up the first of what turned out to be several oddly shaped pieces of clothing a nuns habit boldt locked the door called the command van and suggested they doublecheck the cab number to verify it was legitimate he quickly filled in riz on the little he knew of the situation and promised more to come boldt carried the box and the note into the living room summoned liz and the officer and placed everything on the coffee table boldt handed liz the note that he himself had printed out the envelope was not sealed she slipped out what turned out to be a movie ticket this is them she said again for the sake of the plainclothes officer yeah we can still call this off he offered as she sized the clothing they dont gain anything from hurting me as i leave the house they need me inside the bank willing to cooperate the plan called for officer malone already dressed identically to liz by prior arrangement to switch out and take her place ahead of lizs arrival at the banks merger party there were several contingencies available to accomplish this at present malone remained on her stomach in the back of lizs minivan in the boldt garage that could change as needed but those changes would take time and boldt had the advantage now special ops had expected a phone call with an account number theyd gotten much more boldt heard over the radio that the cab was legitimate he checked the window and confirmed it remained parked at the curb engine running no minivan she said yeah i know boldt said so well have to do the switch somewhere else right he confirmed making sure the woman officer overheard all this liz moved into the bedroom and donned the nuns habit over her existing clothing a smart black cocktail dress sheer pantyhose and a pair of low heels the officer pointed out shed have more mobility if she lost the heels but that malone wore the same shoes and so shed better keep them on liz agreed boldt hung up from a cell phone call its a singalong like rocky horror costumes twenty bucks a seat trying to make light liz said id make a better maria dont you think the officer reminded her that her bra contained a tracking device and assured her that theyd never be far away husband and wife met eyesa covert exchange that the officer was not allowed to see liz added a starched white section over her shoulders boldt helped secure it in place with velcro liz donned a flying nun headdress he found it odd that a few pieces of clothing could add so much innocence and virtue her face looked peaceful and beautiful not a strand of hair showing even as pale as shed been lately next to the stark white fabric her skin looked italian olive healthy and vibrant all lies they met eyes in the mirror boldt forced a smirk if youre thinking of making a joke dont he grinned and nodded youll be fine boldt answered his cell phone and heard danny foremans voice foreman occupied his cadillac escalade parked down the street from the boldt home riding alone boldt walked into the living room to take the call in private knowing that at this same moment homicide detective mark heiman was at onsat keeping track of the location of foreman and his car boldt still didnt trust foreman despite hayes having no recollection of who had beaten him foreman asked what the hell is going on some kind of attempt to spoil our game plan i imagine boldt explained the movie ticket and the nuns costume does that sound like svengrad hayes maybe boldt put it out there playing as if he didnt know any better he wondered if foreman had returned to the warehouse yet if he knew hayes had escaped he boldt had to play it as if hayes were still at large this juggling act of lying to foreman misleading the surveillance team in hopes of springing liz tricking the officer assigned to their home by allowing her to hear rehearsed conversations between him and liz all took their toll playing several roles at once boldt felt scattered and schizophrenic liz appeared from the bedroom i dont like it foreman said what if its someone elsegeiser for instancetrying to manipulate liz for his own gain making that kind of suggestion could get you in trouble danny i could accuse you of the same thing he let that hang there then where would we be he heard foreman breathing into the phone foreman said theyre going to want her at the reception not at some threehour movie you cant let her make this play boldt had expected a similar argument from pahwan riz the embezzled money had to be wired out ahead of the merger and the chaos of the vip reception appeared to offer the best opportunity a person could argue that liz should ignore the nuns habit the movie ticket and head straight to the reception due to start at but to his credit riz accustomed to the fluidity of a special operation had so far issued no such directives thats reeces call not mine boldt told foreman you leave it up to me liz stays home tonight watches reruns and goes to bed early riz had a good plan all worked out malone subbed for liz during the most exposed part of her itinerary from the minivan on in case liz was abducted meanwhile liz would be transferred under tight security to the banksafe once inside and able to access the as through the security requiring her palm print it was a plan boldt could not allow to happen because of the cards svengrad held reece has a good plan boldt reminded doesnt include this foreman complained we adapt right danny im just saying i dont like it so noted boldt disconnected the call so far so good riz had not thrown up any roadblocks miles sarah boldt reminded her as he approached he didnt want her using these passwords under any circumstances but had to appear otherwise he stepped forward to hug her and she whispered into his ear is this going to work stay with the plan boldt said into her ear she kissed him on the cheek it felt strangely foreign to him he felt like kissing her back or hugging her but inexplicably did neither instead he opened the door for her and watched as she walked toward the waiting taxi he had calls to make arrangements his complex plan to beat his own people without breaking laws and without being discovered suddenly seemed so fragile so easily broken seeing the taxi drive off he wished hed said something more to her longed for a second chance before sending her off without so much as a dress rehearsal if svengrad or foreman had a plan to abduct liz boldt had just beaten them to it hed abducted his own wife by arranging the costume by buying the ticket to the sound of music ahead of time by having it delivered by taxi however tenuous he controlled the strings now though for how long was anyones guess lamoia felt awkward dressed in his black funeral suit a white shirt dark vest stewart plaid bow tie and gray felt hat with his hair pulled into a small ponytail and tucked down his collar even his colleagues were unlikely to recognize himwhich was of course the point fifth avenue seattles most posh shopping street was crammed with traffic the sidewalks overflowing with both the dinner crowd and theatergoers the th avenue theatre stood directly across the street from the westcorp bank center the four seasons olympic hotel occupied the opposite corner he stood in a line of several hundred people families kids fullbodied coeds in tight colorful shorts all dressed from various scenes in the movie women in full skirts and high heelsmaria men dressed as boys in lederhosen with its latzbund and schlitzfleck more nuns than in a convent but the real shocker was the uniformed nazisenough to run a concentration camp it was as if the film had given an excuse to the white supremacists to play dressup lamoia was one of only a handful of max detweilers giving him the feeling that hed chosen the least inspired costume in the bunch for her part matthews as always looked astonishingly perfect as a rosycheeked maria turning more than a few heads as she and lamoia had found their places in the long line that awaited a slow box office the earpiece from his cell phone alerted him to the arrival of liz boldts taxi just west of the theater pahwan rizs team had followed her but were scrambling to get people costumed and on the ground in order to stay with her the sarge is a genius lamoia told daphne he pressed his hand to his ear to isolate the voice in the ear bud the flying nun just entered the ticket holders line behind us reece is about to blow a valve daphne said get seats near the back ill tell her to look for your hat you be careful its not me they want daphne said thats what worries me he said nothing stupid agreed lamoia couldnt see over a couple of nazis ahead of them so when they made it inside and daphne split off toward the womens room he lost sight of her liz boldt pushed past in her nuns outfit close enough for him to reach out and touch her lamoia kept his hands to himself liz loitered by a trash bin in front of the womens room where a line had formed the theaters lobby teemed with costumed moviegoers hungry for popcorn and to be seen by friends the din made it hard to think bumped from behind she turned to face daphne matthews who looked strikingly beautiful in her maria outfit she felt her face flare behind the emotions of looking at her husbands former lover an identity kept secret all these years the sickening combination of disinfectant perfume and hairspray overcame her as they moved into the rest room a strong waft of marijuana overcame the other odors she hadnt seen a bathroom so crowded since her high school prom and all the women dressed as one of three or four characters she rubbed up against the baroness only to see the stubble of beard through the cosmetics somewhere in heaven the von trapps were as nauseated as she walltowall costumed freaks liz realized some were on drugs or boozed up anything to lower their inhibitions and allow them to croon through the threehour film thinking they were pavarotti or sills the volume of talk in the tiled room proved deafening the air thick with too many conflicting odors again daphne bumped her from behind adrenalized and mildly claustrophobic she felt tempted to scream out at the woman instead the two pushed into a toilet stall together and daphne turned quickly to lock the metal door you liz said not sure why it came out this way he briefed you didnt he daphne asked oh he briefed me all right liz said finding the opportunity impossible to pass up reaching behind for her own zipper daphne looked back at liz curiously we should get started liz made no effort to undress embarrassed beyond belief to have to show her body to the other woman she said he told me it was you the affair the onenight stand daphne looked as if shed been punched as if she needed to lean past liz into the toilet bowl she said yes well this isnt the time all these years she said your coming to our house always playing so sweet and considerate how did i miss it liz whatever you two are working through im not part of that weve got enough going on here without this okay this is designed to buy you time were wasting that time its more insidious than what i went through with david she said you see him every day interact with him every single day how can you do that without thinking about it i dont think you can you dont do you so you think about it and you both share it even though its years behind you thats kind of sick for a psychologist dont you think she didnt understand why she clung to this except that the last thing she wanted to do was disrobe in front of this woman and engaging her seemed a way to stall daphne pulled the dress off her shoulders revealing first her substantial cleavage and then a white bra and finally the smooth tummy of a woman who had not given birth flawless like something from a magazine and only then did liz glimpse the depth of what lou had gone through to suffer her own affair with david hayes liz felt herself an awful combination of humiliation regret and anger her emotions bubbled to the surface the stall was so small that daphne switched places with her passing closely enough that their chests touched daphne sat down on the toilet in order to keep the dress from touching the floor pulled down past her underwear to her knees a waxed bikini line liz asked that she be allowed to undress in private daphne looked at her as if she were crazy and said there are fifty women out there all waiting for a stall liz please now i cant do this dont be ridiculous she wanted to say you slept with him you were naked with him ive had cancer ive had two children but she understood how petty and trite that would soundespecially aimed at a woman offering to take her place in a dangerous situation and one in which daphne was to go unmonitored daphne was preparing to trick her own colleagues risking all kinds of future discipline she said nothing but stood paralyzed by the situation undress now daphne said sharply thata girl a strangers voice shouted from an adjacent stall daphne sat down on the toilet in bra tights and shoes working to get the tights off liz turned around and asked daphne to help with the velcro to the various pieces that made up the nuns habit which daphne did daphne said you can bunch the top of your dress at the waist the skirt is longer than yours so you can wear the lbd under it little black dress liz got the habit off she felt cold fingers as daphne unzipped the cocktail dress for her and helped her half out of it she would need the dress for the reception lou had chosen it in part because it would hide underneath the maria dress bras daphne reminded liz felt nauseated she was being asked to bare her chest in front of daphne as they switched bras in order to move the concealed tracking device there was nothing left to her chest wizened by nursing two children flattened by gravity corrupted by the starvation of cancer treatment she turned her back on daphne and then passed the bra back wiggling her arm until daphne claimed it the one that was handed her was a bigger cup size she swam in it and she found this humiliating liz reached for some toilet paper mumbling this is embarrassing daphne struggled to adjust lizs bra straps the undergarment barely contained her breasts fitting uncomfortably hand me the rest of the habit she requested i get two dresses you get none liz said turning now as she stepped into the maria dress thats about right that thinga couple velcros is all to close it youre going to fall out left and right luckily its dark daphne said how can this possibly work liz asked having trouble with the zipper and once again needing daphnes help we switch pursesthe one thing that identifies youand i find a seat and watch the movie the hook is baited everyone our own people included are watching for a nun leaving the bathroom with your purse i hide the purse and theyll never confuse me with you youll fail to show daphne pulled a redheaded wig from her own bag we get you into this you join john near the back the two of you leave together at intermission two people leaving together not a single a maria not a nun he walks you out by which point youre headed for the receptionbetter late than never youre in the bank while special ops continues sorting through nuns trying to find you lou looked at this thing from every way possible its not perfect but its as close as were going to get how do i get in the bank were assuming the bank is being watched arent we one thing at a time daphne said johns got that covered thats all youre going to tell me liz said sounding disappointed they exchanged purses liz placed all kinds of symbolism into this act and thought that as a psychologist daphne could probably sort through it all but had no desire to discuss it and if my cell phone rings if they give me instructions that go against this plan of lous he worked this out with you didnt he liz felt deflated he had in fact walked her through this a half dozen times but shed wanted to hear it again she now realized the absurdity of this desire given their current location daphne instructed go out there and find john thats all you focus on right now its a zoo out there find john and follow whatever he says hes at the back of the theater she repeated the back of the theater liz felt inadequate ashamed of her behavior over the past few minutes responsible for people putting themselves at riskall because of her past but she could not find it within her heart to thank the woman she helped velcro daphne into the habit skin showed and flashes of underwear they transferred the contents of the purses liz making sure she retained the two bank ids she carriedone supplied by louher wallet lipstick and mobile phone all set daphne asked daphne looked good even with just the oval of her face showing jealousy brewed inside her once more she nodded daphne added for what its worth john and i are happy together its not worth much liz said quickly and uncharitably but im working on it good daphne indicated the stall door and the two women spilled out into the din and clamor of the rest room among a dozen competing odors womens voices crooned offkey the hills are alive daphne joined in at the top of her lungs as if having the time of her life the back of the habit hung open slightly exposing her bottom she never missed a step a clear perfectly pitched voice on top of everything else liz thought she might be sick she stepped into a world where people lay in wait for her and this thought terrified her she wanted to be home with him she wanted another chance at whatever it was they now called their relationship marriage companionship parenting she pushed away the thought that an organized band of criminals perfectly willing and capable of submitting to violence needed her services first and her lack of memory second she held off the thought that boldt believed danny foreman had turned against them all and represented an uncontrolled unchecked piece of the equation seemingly willing to take matters into his own hands her feet moved forward steadily as she trained her face to look to the floor exposing as little of herself as possible containing her new redheaded identity but she knew even the most welltrained man would have a hard time keeping his eyes on her given the busty nun in the loosely attached habit who split off and headed down an aisle and took a single seat in the middle of the theater daphne matthews and her flashing backside had every eye in the lobby no doubt all part of lous plan liz pushed her way through the thick crowd tolerating the close contact her claustrophobia began to work against her she hated crowds she took up a rhythmic chant in her head scanning the seats for sight of john lamoia only a few more minutes a few more minutes there he was waving a box of milk duds at her his arm around the empty chair she would soon occupy a gorgeous babe to his right spilling out of her dress while openly flirting with him john lamoia in heaven liz felt a sense of dread sweep through her as if a thousand eyes followed her down the row she felt those eyes boring into her studying her looking to identify the face beneath the wig and she regretted not having used the toilet while shed had the chance liz never sang a note for an hour and a half lamoia seemed to enjoy himself an ear bud planted in his left ear as he monitored the surveillance teams radio traffic he crooned through the songs as if hed rehearsed the parts but she saw his eyes tracking the room like a secret service agents nothing got past him he faked a few smiles for her and she appreciated that but he felt as nervous as she did lou was the only one who knew fully what was going on and she found her trust in him the only comfort within moments of the intermission announcement just as the room erupted into applause and people jumped from their seats throwing the auditorium into chaos her phone buzzed and tickled her right hand and she touched lamoias shoulder to get his attention he nodded and she answered it plugging a finger in her left ear a low mechanical sterile voice said its time the line disconnected she felt all the color drain from her all warmth she existed in another realm where all motion slowed around her and all sound stretched and distorted lamoia asked whats up but her brain barely processed the inquiry its time she managed to say what about the phone call lamoia asked misunderstanding its time she repeated explaining that this had been the message delivered the room spun she locked on to the armrests in order to slow the carousel she wanted the movie back she didnt want to go anywhere do anything as childish as she knew it to be she wanted nothing more than to stay right where she was lamoia leaned into her ear im going to tell the sarge but not until were out of here this is our chancethis craziness you gotta get up we gotta get moving i dont think i can ill carry you if i have to but were outta here that got her moving she stood and followed him out into the throng lamoia motioned toward a side exit where a number of people were already lighting cigarettes as they stepped outside she and lamoia cut through a row of seats toward these open doors and as they did she felt the eyes on her once more and the seeds of distrust and fear fought to take root yet again up the street the westcorp bank center loomed i dont know that i can do this she said to lamoia i dont think you got a choice he returned hang with me were almost there but in her heart of hearts she knew this too was just another lie they had barely begun twentythree boldt worked the case like a fire juggler with too many torches in the air he had recused himself from direct participation in lizs surveillance surprising no one by declining an offer to take a seat in the special ops steamcleaning van electing instead to drive himself around and listen in on the radio riz warned him politely but directly that he didnt need any rogue operatives during his effort to keep liz safe and boldt lied assuring riz that he would keep his distance he took up a position parking across the street from the bank buildings north entrance a place that included a view of one of the two entranceexits to the highrises private underground parking facility his biggest concern remained svengrad and men like alekseevich into the mix he threw foreman whom he knew to be operating solo but whose motives remained unclear and therefore his danger to liz difficult to assess somewhere out there boldt believed olson and organized crime were keeping watch now that alekseevichs status remained so closely tied to this case and boldts decision making his job was to trick special ops into sitting on a decoydaphne matthews or one of the several dozen other nuns in attendance at the moviewhile lamoia smuggled liz out of the theater and put her in play svengrad had made it perfectly clear that no substitutions were to take place and as yet boldt felt unwilling to challenge the man the second part of his job was to allow liz to transfer the money without danny foreman messing things up or getting selfish ultimately he had plans beyond this but early into the chicanery his focus remained his wifes safe transfer slipping her past the watchful eyes of special ops bas in bankpost a group of three technicians who currently occupied a seattle postintelligencer panel truck conveniently parked over an open manhole with unseen video trunk lines running into the bank through the floor of the truck from that truck the three could monitor every surveillance camera in the building could directly communicate with bank security and could even listen in over the public address systems microphone during tonights reception he knew his one advantage was that unbeknownst to anyone but him and a trusted few he was working directly with his nemesis david hayes hayes was the wild card he intended to play to its fullest as much as boldt was loath to admit it hayes could run circles around all of them yo boldt heard in his ear after answering his mobile phone lamoia informed him that liz had received a call just after the start of intermission a synthesized voice again short and to the point foreman boldt thought finally beginning to sort out the various roles being played assuring boldt that he and liz had slipped away successfully lamoia concluded by saying were happening translation they were about to cross the street to the westcorp bank center callwaiting chirped in the phone and boldt signed off with lamoia accepting a call that turned out to be from heiman at the onsat navigation offices foremans escalade was on the move heading downtown interesting timing boldt muttered this too fit into an expected pattern he called gaynes into action posing as a waitress she would now join the reception a stopgap and final line of defense known only to him hayes was to be guarded by milner one of lamoias trustworthy soldiers boldt ended the call expecting to see his wife at any moment wondering if his plan could get her into the bank without her being seen or detected and identified by the elaborate electronic surveillance already in place he counted on david hayes to help him if indirectly in fact lizs survival now depended on him in the midst of a light drizzle and traces of ground fog that swirled between the highrises like smoke from a fire a darkened figure stalked through the rain toward the west pedestrian entrance to the westcorp bank center shopping complex a lowerlevel mall that sat below the bank police radios quiet for the past several minutes drew attention to this visitor the mall stores had all closed at pm though access to parking and the tower elevators remained open not one pedestrian had entered the shopping complex in the past half hour raising suspicions as this figure approached the b unit commander dennis cretchkie jockeyed his team directing an undercover wheelchaired officer to enter the facility behind this visitor cretchkie called for reports off fifth on university the town car set jammed the olympic hotels ushaped driveway the hotel doorman blowing his whistle for taxis stacked along the curb a small group of white seagulls flashed in the black sky and shrieked noisily overhead a homeless woman pushed a supermarket cart laden with soggy blankets and aluminum cans uphill leaning into her effort a streetcleaning machine lumbered slowly up university brushes spinning eliciting the complaint of car horns as it hindered traffic the undercover officer in the wheelchair reported that the unidentified pedestrian was a woman carrying an umbrella that obscured her face as this unidentified subjectunsubapproached the west entrance of the underground mall the cop in the wheelchair worked furiously to intercept her hoping she might hold the door for him and thereby give him a good look at her face his effort failed monitoring surveillance activities over the police radio boldt sat forward in the front seat of the crown vic the steering wheel pressing into his chest every action every move by special ops was crucial to the success or failure of his plan boldt was parked with a view of the north side of the blocksquare complex with no view of the unidentified woman who had just entered westcorp center with the announcement of her entering the mall pahwan riz one block east with a view of the th avenue theatre pressured his detectives and operatives in the audience for the exact location of the mark liz i want a positive id riz said and i want it now damn him boldt thought riz had always been one of the smarter ones boldt phoned daphne matthews to warn her that rizs team was inspecting the patrons more closely in order to obtain a positive id a moment later matthews said i see them its brandy and klinderhoff each coming down an aisle judging by her suddenly muffled voice he pictured that shed bent forward head to the theater floor but its crazy in here i need at least ten to twenty minutes daffy he heard a loud cheer and music in the background the purse boldt shouted make sure they see the purse he knew how a cops mind worked the purse would convince either brandy schaeffer or howie klinderhoff as easily as if either saw lizs face daphne disconnected the call and boldt was left with indelible melodies swimming in his head he saw a wsdot metro bus pull to its stop on fifth avenue the arrival of the bus won the attention of cretchkie and his b unit because it briefly and effectively blocked cretchkies view of the complex an undercover officer was dispatched though too late cretchkie shouted across the radio get the fucking buses off fourth and fifth avenues all eyes on anyone and everyone coming off that bus riz cut in demanding once again that liz be identified in the film audience the umbrella woman entered an elevator and rode it one floor to ground level where she had to switch elevators in order to continue into the office tower the wheelchair officer followed on the next elevator car reporting every few minutes the bus pulled away scattering pedestrians most of whom stayed on the westcorp block requiring cretchkie to account for them in all of the commotion little if any attention was paid to the homeless womans abandoned supermarket shopping cart now canted into the wall just outside the entrance to the banks underground parking garage boldt fixed upon that shopping cart a smile crept slowly across his face liz was inside liz struggled to clear her head during the walk with lamoia at intermission he directed her across the street and down into a sunken courtyard plaza that fronted a japanese restaurant there she jettisoned marias frock covering her little black dress with a street urchins salvation army wardrobe lamoia indicated a street persons shopping cart packed with aluminum cans and some other junk it had been secreted into some bushes in the courtyard he then smeared her face with some brown base making her look street dirty theres a damp towel in the cart use it to clean this off lou had planned all this carefully in advance she found it difficult to hold up under the pressure david hayes had put her here and the level of her resentment briefly stole all thought and clarity despite her usual christian thinking she vowed to have some kind of revenge against him ultimately recovering the money would be the revenge and she steeled herself to make it through the next hour of her life and to put things straight when the bus pulled up at the very minute lamoia had told her it would she pushed the junkladen supermarket cart against the concrete wall and slipped into the shadows of the underground garage already planning her metamorphosis she kept only the damp rag fatigue took a physical toll on her leaving her feeling spentdespite the clamor of her heart in her chest she headed directly to the glassedin area that contained the elevators and stairs it was from this garage that she had first sneaked away to a rendezvous with david hayes from this garage that she had left on maternity leave as she heard the distant hiss of the bus brakes releasing she reached into the waiting elevator and tripped the button for the ground floor then jumped back out of the car as she pulled open the heavy door to the fire stairs immediately adjacent to the elevators she heard the elevator doors slide shut behind her she stepped inside the stairs and began to undress immediately she cleaned her face in the reflection of a fire extinguisher box lou believed her sending the elevator up might distract the minimumwage security team whose job it was to monitor television screens in a darkened room somewhere in the building dressed now in her black cocktail dress liz climbed the stairs the garage stairs deposited her into the main lobby she still had to pass through security in order to reach the main bank of elevators liz said hello to dilly the portly security man with whom she was friends as she did so she used tony larossas id card on the turnstile in front of the metal detector through which she would pass lou had no doubt that pahwan riz had cued securitys computers to watch for lizs entrance to the office building it was even possible the security computer had been set for a special notification when lizs id card entered the system lous gamble that riz would not have given the same consideration to tony larossas card paid off the light turned green the turnstile moved and liz passed her purse to dilly while she stepped through the metal detector dilly looked shellshocked to see her she stepped up to him physically closer to the man than shed ever been and whispered clearly into his ear i know youre supposed to report my arrival dilly believe me i know all about it and thats a decision you will have to make but if you do what happened to tony larossa will happen to me she kissed him on the cheek took her purse and walked away not looking back the elevator typically required the use of an id card to reach the restricted floors including the twentyfifth floor and its data processing for the sake of the reception that requirement had been overcome by stationing a security guard as an elevator operator to shuttle guests this came as an unexpected complication lizs way around being seen by this security guard was to use the stairs once again for one reached the stairs before the bank of elevators she climbed twentyfive floors in less than ten minutes her heart and lungs burning her calves aching using tonys security card she entered the floor at the end of a hall that had been taken over by the caterers the roar of conversation and the smell of chicken satay greeted her a moment later she was just another little black dress in a reception with dozens of invited guests lou had taken it on faith that hayess software would reach her she felt less inclined to believe this knowing david was under watch and believing that without his direct participation the transfer would not happen but it was lous show and she played her role as directed in her head an imaginary clock continued counting down the minutes to the corporate switchover boldt called gaynes on her cell phone and asked her location heading into the lobby from the shopping area they saw you enter they put guys on it the mark gaynes asked meaning liz shes in oops gaynes said gotta go looks like im about to be caught she disconnected the call before boldt could remind her that if her cover as a staff waitress for the caterer failed she should use her police credentials against the banks rentacops and that if confronted by cretchkie or riz she should pass blame back onto him boldt who in turn would argue that it was his wife and if he wanted to slip his detective inside the bank then it was his prerogative it was in fact not his prerogative but he could live with a brief dressingdown from riz if it came to that he encouraged his cell phone to ring awaiting confirmation that liz had reached the twentyfifth floor even if the emptyelevator ploy got securitys attention boldt expected no drastic action to be taken by the bank no one in his right mind was going to shut down this merger reception as the couple approached their wedding bed boldt put his head back against the headrest understanding but not quite accepting that he had to wait it out like a director in the wings watching a play then when the phone did ring it was only heiman reporting from onsat the escalades moving south the voice said heading through fremont at the moment if i had to guess heiman said id say hes still heading downtown having tended once again to her hair and lipstick centering the strand of pearls she wore around her neck liz rounded the corner into the open area of the twentyfifth floor and immediately spotted phillip crenshaws graywhite mane across the crowded room she elected to steer clear for the time being phillip had been carefully briefed on all aspects of the embezzlement case by liz the police bci and the prosecuting attorneys office liz didnt want him seeing her and then making phone calls to check up on her if they crossed paths fine she would tell him in private that shed been run through what now appeared to be a ruse but still had not taken possession of the software nor had she been given the account numberall true it surprised her how well the data center transformed for the event her staff had done a terrific job several transit posters announcing the merger had been placed strategically to hide unsightly workstations helium balloons grouped in threes livened up the place champagne flowed as waiters and waitresses circulated it appeared that most if not all of the forty to fifty invitees had shown up fingerfoodsized crab cakes and cheesy hors doeuvres laced the air and enticed lizs empty stomach she recognized any number of faces and said short hellos to various groups as she passed making her way to the registration table manned by several of her staff the overall mood was festive canned jazz playing and champagne lifting voices into peals of laughter a lot of money was being made off this merger not the least of which went to the attorneys a cabal of suits who hovered near the wine bar like a school of barracuda charlotte liz smiled at the attractive young woman behind the welcome desk there you are charlotte bent over and reached below the table she handed liz a name tag that bore a small blue ribbon a touch that liz didnt care for but something phillip had insisted upon the ribbon identified liz as cohostess and made her feel cheap as if she were throwing a pampered chef party instead of a reception for a multibilliondollar merger this came for you charlotte gave her a plain manila envelope a plain white label bore her name and nothing more it was the right size and shape and thickness for a computer disk howd you get this it was messengered to the lobby desk dilly sent it up when was this charlotte heard the concern in lizs voice and reflected it just before we got going a few minutes before eight why liz backpedaled sorry shed suggested there was any problem oh no reason she forced her face to soften its just in time thanks she glanced to her right where the end of the room was sectioned off by polished steel beams and thick unbreakable glass and looked right at one of the twin ass a black solid block of computer the size of a washing machine behind the server and out of view was a small desk holding a large flatpanel screen and a keyboard the placement of this workstation intentionally screened the operator in order to prevent any eavesdropping or spying from without the machines twin sister sat to the right in a small office of its own this more private room was where most of the heavy lifting was done by programmers and maintenance this was lizs destination to reach it she would have to pass through a palmscanner as well as an id reader she would be under the glare of the overhead lighting visible to all she would stick out given that there was no activity at that far end of the large room her entrance to the space would alert security and in turn the surveillance team the cake had been lous idea his solution to part of this dilemma and only then did she think to follow up with it asking charlotte about its readiness its here charlotte replied but were saving it for after the switchover right that had been lizs original instruction but now that had to change for the sake of timing she could feel special ops close on her heels the switchover is actually just ceremonial phillip mr crenshaw will throw a switch yes but the final exchange of data wont occur until after midnight then our servers are offline for good right charlotte clearly wondered why liz would explain what she already knew so what can it possibly matter when we serve the cake the point being that once the switch is thrown the party peaks and maybe folks dont stick around for the cake just admit it mrs boldt charlotte said nearly stopping lizs heart i know your real reason for changing plans liz felt the color drain out of her face and her hands go cold chocoholic anyone charlotte cracked up confess your sins mrs boldt liz felt nervous laughter escape from her throat caught she said her knees weak and actually trembling me and chocolate you got me let them eat cake how soon lets give the hors doeuvres another few minutes and then surprise everyone liz kept one eye on the end of the room and the brightly lit secure office and dont forget the candles and the room lights phillip wants this to be dramatic charlotte beamed ill tell the caterers ill do it liz said wanting both the excuse and the opportunity to avoid circulating as much as possible if anybodys getting an advance taste of that cake its me charlotte grinned and liz left before her mouth got her in real trouble shed never been a good liar even through the months of the affair with david had lou not been so consumed at the time he would have caught on sooner the caterers from wild ginger had usurped both the galley kitchen and a small conference room across from it down a hall near the stairs that liz had climbed only minutes before asian odors of pickled ginger and plum and cinnamon thickened with her approach it took her a minute to locate the woman in charge a woman with whom shed had dealings their meeting in person was cordial and businesslike liz asked that the cake be brought out earlier than originally planned and the caterer saw no problem with that asking for five to ten minutes to clear the hors doeuvres and to orchestrate the change liz said charlotte would dim the lights when signaled knowing full well there was no dimming the overhead fluorescents the entire floor would be briefly dark the guests attention fixed on the candles and the cake this would be the moment liz needed halfway back down the hall she stepped into an empty office and pulled out her cell phone lou answered right away im in watch for the lights five minutes maybe ten theyre searching the theater riz is going to have this figured out soon if he doesnt already theyll think you were pressured into this but theyll still expect one of those two passwords from you miles sarah she didnt intend to use either there would be no alerting pahwan riz to the actual transfer ive got bobbie inside as a waitress lou continued when youre done in there you need to call me hed stressed this need to call him about a dozen times and it annoyed her that hed repeat it yet again i got that lou she regretted the tone not knowing herself hoping that whatever woman shed become over the past few weeks would not stick okay boldt ended the call liz slipped the mobile phone back into daphnes purse and spun in the chair preparing to leave i thought that was you a deep male voice she recognized before looking up danny foreman blocked the doorway wouldnt miss my own party she said who were you talking to just now he asked lou how much did he hear she couldnt remember what shed said on her end of the conversation the manila envelope that contained a disk remained inside the purse how much does he know i dont remember your name being on the invitation list she said half of special ops is looking for you in a movie theater at this very moment not you not me i wanted to make sure we still had our understanding protect the states investment in this investigation if the money went anywhere but the svengrad account her children werent safe she thought that by now danny foreman probably understood this as well she said i wonder what pahwan riz would think of your being up here lou for that matter couldnt just your presence here blow this im here to make sure you get out safely that gave her chills lou had warned her no one would want her remembering the account numbers her thoughts poured out of her before she could stop her mouth its not a government account is it danny never was this is about darlene for you injustice this is something between you and david and this guy svengrad youre at serious risk once this transfer is made from whom whats your plan danny how safe am i youre mistaken liz horribly mistaken it is a government account i told you before we need that money as evidence if were going to get a conviction its as simple as that simple she asked can you actually say that she didnt know how to read him half in shadow danny foreman wore an intractable expression should i call lou or special ops and thank them for sending you should i ask security to call someone to let them know youre here at the reception how do you want to play this she felt the seconds passing by and her chance to sneak inside the as room escaping along with it im going in with you he said ill input the account number myself we wouldnt want your nerves causing you to mistype a number this was completely unplanned for wiring the funds requires an account number an aba routing number and a name for the account its foolproof danny i wont mistype it im going in with you look at it this way in the event of a trial it will protect us all if i witness your actions ill be lucky to get in there myself alone two of us no offense danny youre not exactly dressed for the occasion of the guests assembled in the room not twenty feet away half wore tuxedos foreman looked as if hed slept in his clothes for the past week im going in there with you she looked for some way to circumvent him it dawned on her thena possible way to lose foreman but she would need a head start she would also need an alternate plan the answer to which lay with loulou and bobbie gaynes a wild card whose presence here remained unknown to foreman because it remained unknown to special ops as well okay she said you win foreman first looked surprised then satisfied with himself until she spoke again do you know how to tie a bow tie danny he frowned then caught on to the suggestion weve got to get you looking right she said let me see what i can work out with the caterer im the one who hired her in the first place she had him cornered and they both knew it ill come with you he said she wanted to object but didnt feel confident lying to him fearing hed see through the lie she nodded acceptance her mind working to see a way out of this danny foreman an albatross she could ill afford thinking more clearly than she he said ill take your cell phone she reached into her purse and took hold of the phone offering it but not yet passing it to him will you and what will you say to svengrad when he calls you need his wire information or you dont have a case against him isnt that right you must have that information by now i do not she told him wondering as his face tightened further if shed given him too much information this was lous world danny foremans world not hers she started her phone back toward her purse but foreman took it from her all the more reason you need me he said pocketing it she needed the phone special ops would be watching all calls from and to the banks phones she didnt want to be caught dialing lous cell phone number she also still expected the call from svengrad not to mention lou there are security cameras inside this room with the servers foreman said riz has cameras aimed at both keyboards in case the keytracking software fails liz realized he was just talking this through he was right shed been briefed on the locations of these cameras as well lou worked it out didnt he she waited to see what he was getting at larossa gave hayes a way to monitor your security cameras he said theorizing svengrad hasnt called you because he knows youre not in the restricted room yet hes waiting for your move he paused you did or did not use your own id when you entered tonight liz had thought her use of tony larossas id had been to hide her from special ops not from svengrad only now did she sense that lou had this second motive in mind as well she clutched her purse as foreman reached for it she felt an urgent need to protect lous plan whatever it was there is a security camera in this hall i do know that youll be on camera if you come with me this may take me a minute she tore herself free from foremans grip she turned and stepped out and foreman followed together they walked down the hall to its deadend firestairs door lizs mind raced to find a way around this foreman remained a half step behind her and to her left she couldnt turn and outrun him she needed a break a way to put even a few seconds between them seconds in which he would not miss her at the galley she introduced foreman to the caterer as a law enforcement officer liz explained he needed a cover and that shed thought of his taking the place of one of the waiters for just a few minutes hed need a white shirt and tie the woman replied im aware of that liz said thats why were speaking to you the woman sized up foreman like a fashion designer she said let me talk to michael hes about your size a few agonizing minutes later foreman faced a young man carrying a white shirt and bow tie well use the office foreman said indicating the door down the hall wait here he said to liz foreman and the waiter moved down the hall and entered the office to exchange shirts and let foreman tie the tie he left the office door ajar to prevent her from slipping past liz winced a smile the mouse had walked willingly into the trap all of his own accord liz drew the caterer close and whispered when he asks you tell him you had your back turned and didnt see which way i went before surprise had a chance to fade from the caterers expression liz gently pushed against the stairway doors panic bar then threw her hip into pushing it open and slipped out cool air slapped her face her limbs and chest went feverish with adrenaline at the bottom of these stairs was freedom and for a moment that temptation weighed on her like gravity before she reached the first landing she heard a flurry of footsteps from below someonesecurity probablywas coming up coincidence she wondered a random security check or had larossas id triggered a fullscale search if a search they wouldnt be busting through the front doors of a formal party but using the stairs as she now heard so clearly she debated returning to the relative safety of the twentyfifth floor behind her the footfalls continued to climb toward her and at a pace that indicated someone in shape reinforcing her belief it was a security guard at last with nowhere to turn she stiffened her posture took hold of the railing and descendedwalkedone hand on the rail she was one of the five most powerful people at westcorp and this building belonged to westcorpat least for a few more minutes bobbie gaynes rounded the landing in the blackandwhite uniform of the caterers mrs b she said clearly surprised whats wrong danny foremans up there she explained her predicament and what she needed from gaynes speaking quickly and in a hushed voice okay then gaynes said when liz had finished you cant get onto twentyfive without an id cardfrom this side the stairs its restricted access so ill pound until someone opens up gaynes said if that doesnt work liz fished into daphnes purse and passed gaynes the larossa id telling her to use it but only if no one opens the door for you and if danny asks if you saw me foreman doesnt know me ill just be a waitress who sneaked out for a smoke and got locked out she added hopefully the caterer goes along with that the women reached out and grabbed each others forearm at the same time it seemed an awkward gesture to liz somewhere between a handshake and a hug but she was grateful for the contact five minutes tops liz reminded got it gaynes bounded up the stairs effortlessly liz turned and hurried down to twentyfour believing she still had a chance to accomplish the transfer on time floor twentyfour lacked the security of the data department immediately above liz passed into a darkened corridor switching on the lights and running through the maze of hallways inside the pounding of her heart counted the passing seconds the lighting of the cake and the darkening of the room were only minutes away when boldt saw the first set of lights appear in the windows on the twentyfourth floor his first thought was housecleaning but then another string and a third string illuminated and the short time between them suggested someone in a hurry and his blood rushed to his face it looked as if security were chasing someone he thought of gaynes and liz at that same moment the policeband radio sang with exchanges between the command van and special ops officers who had failed to locate liz inside the theater frustrated and limited in their effort by the darkness and the audiences penchant for jumping to its feet in spontaneous song judging by the growing agitation in rizs voice he sensed hed lost his mark and feared his surveillance had failed which in turn reflected directly on him and his ability to lead riz was a smart capable cop soon hed be checking with his people already in the bank those assigned to watch the security monitors how much longer until liz was spotted and what would the repercussions be the string of lights now stretched entirely across the twentyfourth floor boldt craned his neck and put his face to the windshield to see unable to tolerate another minute of this and understanding the need for someone to distract rizs people from seeing liz on a security camera boldt left his crown vic and marched through a light drizzle toward westcorp center well aware that as he did so he became a target of his own surveillance liz reached the elevator bank on twentyfour and called an elevator the wait excruciating she knew that by now foreman would be frantically searching for her probably dressed as a waiter and moving through the guests tray in hand use of the elevator meant risking identification by the security guard operating the car her hope that the car might arrive filled with smokers or late arrivals that she might meld into the mix proved too optimistic the doors opened and she boarded an otherwise empty carshe and the guard he stared at her well briefed yes its me she said once the doors had closed the one floor ride would be over quickly i thought so he said they probably didnt tell you about this part she said he said nothing dont blow it by saying something she said just as the doors came open she walked out glancing directly at him once more to show him the strength of her conviction as the doors shut behind her she had no idea if her ruse had worked but she didnt have the luxury of worrying about it by the time the guard reported her and the announcement went up the chain she needed to be sitting in front of the as making the transfer liz moved through the main door charlotte at the table to her right looking for a tall african american waiter so she could steer clear of him elizabeth boldt a heavily accented voice asked from her left she turned to see a big man with a beard and dark piercing eyes she lowered her sight to the name tag stuck to his lapel his name written in a casual cursive not the calligraphy that her staff had arranged and paid for yasmani svengrad the man introduced himself extending his hand she found herself rooted frozen in place she did not offer to shake his hand and a moment later he lowered his own s g imports were a private banking customer he said naming westcorps elite customer program that required sevenfigure net worth phillips staff not hers had handled the invitations to the private banking customers eight ounces he said excuse me we donated some caviar to tonights event very lastminute eight ounces of beluga another eight of osetra this explained his receiving an invitation this man who had watched her children who had threatened to expose the videotape said we have interests in common you and i he had yet to take his eyes off her holding her with that steady stare she felt weak almost faint whatever lou foreman and riz had thought none had prepared for this moment rather than show her weakness she fought against the urge to step back stepping forward instead nearly touching him i share nothing in common with you she said while looking him squarely in the eye a grin parted the graying beard and mustache svengrad was amused by her nothing more a few minutes of your time is all elizabeth he lowered his head to where she felt his voice as it warmed her neck i love how you look in satin he said standing erect again he regained that confident smile he raised his voice yes id love a tour please lead the way liz caught a signal from charlotte who was no longer at the reception desk but standing in the doorway that led back to the hallway where shed just been with foreman and the caterer charlotte moved her fingers to signal she was about to kill the lights and liz nodded holding up a single fingerone minuteknowing her moment had come she walked away and svengrad followed they passed through a few knots of conversation until liz heard her name shouted out she processed it as phillips voicea summons from the boss she turned waved and quickly pointed toward charlotte then tapped her wrist indicating time to her relief this proved enough to stop the man in her peripheral vision she picked up danny foreman an empty tray held high and carried in front of him without making eye contact she hurried on svengrad following she imagined that behind her foreman was now plowing through the cocktail party to catch up with thirty seconds to go she navigated past a group of workstations reaching the glass barrier that contained the first of the ass she turned in time to see foreman in his waiters garb his bow tie crooked on his long neck hurrying toward them lizs left hand hesitated above the green screen of the palm reader a booksized device mounted by the door to the glass room her own id card ready in her right she slipped the edge of the id card into the card reader the lights went out the guests cooed and turned to face the candlebright cake that appeared in the doorway at the opposite end of the room liz pressed her hand to the screen and watched a small red light turn to green she heard the click of the electronic latch svengrad was now pressed up against her physically contacting her wait foreman called still a few steps off the room was all ghostly shadows and cutout silhouettes the only light from exit signs and the distant glow of the cake visible in the reflection off the doors security glass a smaller image appeared behind foremans tall silhouette agent foreman the female voice said detective gaynes spd youre interfering with a surveillance op liz used the distraction to pop open the door and slip inside but with svengrad immediately behind her and coming through as well she turned quickly and bumped the man out of the way and hurried to push the door shut a satisfying click rang out just as foreman turned from gaynes and lunged for the door the thick glass muted whatever foreman said to the detective but even in the limited light liz saw his fury liz hurried to the door of the neighboring server room got it open and turned to pull svengrad through behind her just as the overhead lights switched back on a dull electric hum filled the room the server was a brushed dark gray it looked much bigger close up than she remembered she went to work immediately having no idea how much fuss danny foreman might make how much trouble he might cause her she dropped the manila envelope on the floor slipping the optical disk it contained into the server grateful that such operations required little of the operator the disk autoloaded a few small lights on the server flashed and liz intently watched the screen awaiting its instruction to input the wire information input user id password this was her moment without her the server would not permit access lou had been clear about how to play this moment and she rose to what she considered the most important performance of her lifetime without me this doesnt happen she told svengrad you didnt go to all this trouble just to change your mind the video youll have it yes i will she said and you will have your company back and your passport reauthorized when i do whats this from my husband quid pro quo you understand latin mr svengrad he said to tell you that he talked the government into releasing your product but he also had ins make your passport invalid for travel outside the country it all depends on the return of the tape enter your password he said lou had stepped her through this carefully believing the conversation would take place over the phone in person she found it much more difficult to say it with conviction your company and your freedom for that tape she said your word on it my word he said she didnt believe him lou had insisted she bargain with svengrad despite her repeated arguments that he held all the cards its complicated had been lous reply who went on to say he couldnt tell her everything that was in play she typed in her user id and then her password which appeared as a series of asterisks svengrad pushed her out of the way and sat down in the chair and liz did not attempt to fight him she told him i was going to use whatever account information you gave me you could have trusted that svengrad watched the screen as various commands were announced and small graphs indicating loading time moved like the mercury in a thermometer marking progress he said only this is better one of the loading instructions caught her eyean account number she recognizedand for the first time she understood what david had done to hide the money brilliant she almost said aloud finally the screen they had both awaited presented itself a preprogrammed menu offering wire transfer options svengrad instructed her to stand back from him he slipped out a piece of paper pulled the keyboard into his lap leaning over it and carefully input the information into the machine she wondered if he knew about the camera looking down from above or if his instincts were nothing more than blind luck either way she thought hed probably used hayess knowhow to cut off the surveillance the entire process passed quickly liz marveled that all these weeks of agony had culminated in a few keystrokes and no more than a couple minutes of time svengrad hit the enter key the screen hesitated then delivered a graphic announcing the transfer was complete done he said looking at liz with a triumphant look lou had fed her several lines making her repeat them carefully on the off chance svengrad left the phone line open as he gave her wiring instructions she said them now yes well i for one never trust david when it comes to his programming svengrads triumph suffered a momentary twitch of concern you and i saw that money get wired for your sake i hope it goes where you think its going david hayes knows better than to cross me yes liz said thats exactly what i thought the screen indicated the drive was reformatting david had programmed the disk to erase itself and all traces of the transaction after the wire transfer was complete looks like he thought of everything liz said moving to the door ahead of svengrad who took a moment too long to come out of the chair she pushed through to the sister server room and quickly out the secure door back into the office area svengrad now right behind her danny foreman and gaynes watched them danny fuming but to lizs surprise he stepped aside and allowed room for them to pass gaynes who held danny by the elbow never took her eyes off foreman lou had explained to liz that dannys motivations were in question and it seemed possible that in these few minutes gaynes had given him a choice of options liz had nothing to say to danny foreman she wanted her children back home and at the very least the semblance of an ordinary life returned she wanted out of this party out of this building and nothing more than to be home in bed though she knew it could not possibly be that simple for her gaynes said whatever you did in there security crashed special ops is on their way up foreman and i are going to try the stairs you mr svengrad i would suggest should return to the party you try to leave now theyll question you mrs b its you theyre after im afraid it helps us all if you can delay them a little liz nodded the group broke up as phillip approached mr svengrad the ceo said in his best host voice he didnt look comfortable all of a sudden i see youve met elizabeth yes svengrad said she was just explaining some of the complications of the switchover to me he said eyeing liz quite impressive phillip eyed liz and looked into the server room there was no telling what might become of her when suspicions and the inevitable interviews began phillip stepped closer to liz throwing an arm around her hell of a party liz well done he looked at svengrad you have any more questions mr svengrad why dont you address them to me at that moment four undercover detectives rushed from an elevator turning the heads of many in attendance liz felt choked with emotion when she saw lou among them his eyes searching the room and finding her he then registered svengrads presence as well and a triumphant look overcame him proud defiant whats this phillip asked looking suspiciously at liz this liz said this is my husband twentyfour liz and boldt stood inside the front door of their home lamoias jetta parked and running at the curb it was five in the morning a pale hinting of the sunrise rimmed the horizon theyd both been up all night she in debriefings with special ops boldt writing a report that was mostly lies i told them exactly how david did it liz explained he split the money into tens of thousands of tiny amountsa few cents a few dollarsand tacked those amounts onto trades as securities and exchange commission fees it worked because the sec account is one of only a very few accounts that we dont audit unless the government files a complaint david kept the funds moving through the system these tiny amounts charged as sec trading fees impossible for us to connect or follow only the software knew where that money was on any given day my guess is that at the end of the quarter just as the sec fee funds were about to be wired to washington the seventeen million was collected into the sec fee account we hold for the government giving david a chance to find itshe drew the quotesand wire it out it would be safe there for a few weeks a few months even years he got locked up and it just stayed in the system looping around impossible for our auditors to identify the merger meant our sec account would be closed the balance paidall this happens invisibly and automatically each quarter the government being paid what its owedbut the merger forced him to wire the money out or lose it forever the government would have eventually reported the overage and maybe then wed have finally figured it out boldt said they could only grab the seventeen million four times a year im guessing yes he wouldnt have wanted it to be lumped together for very long nor very often auditors might have spotted that though even thats doubtful the whole purpose was to keep it moving and no one reported the incorrect sec charges on their statements how many investors are going to question a few cents more on an sec trading fee thats a charge they probably dont pay attention to anyway he did the smart thing he hid that money out in the open she changed the subject asking what do you do if he doesnt give you the tape john has one of his wild ideas hes been studying terrorist technologies for the past two weeks and typical of him has borrowed a device youll be careful it was a sentiment impossible for her not to express but boldt wished she hadnt he didnt want to think of this upcoming meeting as dangerous though he knew otherwise judging by svengrads tone of voice he had already been hit with the surprise boldts mission was to deflect and redirect the blame its more ridiculous than dangerous he said of lamoias idea youll have backup speaking the lingo now im a fast learner she said and dont avoid the question not officially no he told her honestly that would mean answering all sorts of questions at some point questions you and i dont want to answer forget that she said id rather answer questions pay a fine go to jail than be stupid about this john will be there outside hell call for backup if needed its a meeting is all he said trying to reassure her we expected this he corrected himself i expected this its not worth it lou it is he said its very much worth it not if youre at risk its not like that honestly if i thought it was i wouldnt do this hes not going to arrange a meeting if he plans on torturing me his goons are going to bust in here and do it he has questions thats all we gave him his money he should be happy absolutely boldt said trying to keep the lie out of his eyes maybe he wants to thank me she leveled a look onto him and he knew then that she knew he saw the first twinges of realization sink into her what did you do she closed her eyes then looked at him fiercely you couldnt leave well enough alone could you the trouble with marriage was that all that familiarity the years of arguments and discussions of practical jokes and conspiracies meant that ones barriers became invisible to the spouse easily penetrated liz looked through him and read his thoughts effortlessly oh my god she said you conned a con man lou speak to me i followed my conscience on this one it was all done lou we did it over the children she pleaded as either her concern or her anger glassed her eyes exactly boldt said im not saying i did anything but if i did i did it for the children no lies right this had been their mutual agreement going into parenthood to lead by example the comment struck deeper as he knew it would theyd been living nothing but lies for too long and for him this was a fresh start instead of a continuation he kissed her goodbye without saying anything more he had no sense that he was heading into anything more dangerous than on any other day of work a meeting was all she accompanied him to the front door an unmarked police car still watched the house boldt hoped this meeting with svengrad might end the need for such precautions she touched him once lightly on the arm as he opened the door the tenderness of that gesture cut him to his core and he felt emotions ripple through him he had explanations for everything hed done for what he was about to do but they would have to go unspoken he hoped they might go unspoken for a very long time he smiled at her and let her shut the door behind him drive he said and lamoia pulled the jetta away from the curb and out onto the street boldt looked into the empty backseat its in the trunk lamoia said things about the size of a microwave oven boldt shook his head lamoia said im telling you sarge it works great forget it okay no way you gotta let me do this if nothing else we put this guy back into the stone age every computer every phone every disk every tape zeroed hed explained it to boldt in trying to sell him on the idea the box in the cars trunk emitted an electromagnetic pulse essentially a blast of radio waves that rearranged any magnetic charge the military had been developing the technology for yearsfirst discovered as a side effect of an atomic blast a pulse of energy that while not radioactive interrupted and defeated anything with a memory chip the technology remained fairly bulky and heavy still too conspicuous to be smuggled onto an airplane though this and other uses were believed possible prospects for terrorists down the road i think well do this the oldfashioned way boldt said leave james bond for the movies he added im going to talk to him thats all hell never give you back that tape probably not all i do is plug the thing in and turn it on it uses the wiring in the building like a huge antenna the pulsea radio wavegoes down that wiring and like an antenna anything within fifteen to twenty feet of any wall that means anything plugged in or not is zapped bam erased zeroed its fucking phenomenal cell phones pagers calculators in your pocket in a chair even inside a safe refrigerators have memory chips in them did you know that i think well leave his refrigerators alone this time no matter what he tells you hes going to keep a copy of the tape you said so yourself then hes got his finger on you he owns you sarge boldt shot his sergeant a look he didnt like this talked about in that way this thing will erase it its magnetic anything and everything in that building gets erased doesnt matter where it is zap fried tomatoes well do this my way boldt said thats fine sarge but if i find an outside outlet im popping the trunk and plugging this thing in my suggestion is leave your cell phone in the car boldt knew he meant well and initially hed even supported the idea because the effectiveness of the technology sounded convincing but if the contraption workedand he was beginning to think it mighthe thought it unwise to be meeting with svengrad when tragedy struck he explained this to lamoia and saw the mans enthusiasm sink lamoia dropped boldt off outside the corrugated steel warehouse and wished him luck boldt did in fact carry his cell phone and it was set to dial lamoias phone with two pushes of the same button boldt would hold his hand on that phone in his coat pocket ready to call the cavalry if needed although lamoias instructions were to call for backup and to wait until it arrived boldt knew hed never wait that was fine with him yasmani svengrad sat behind his desk in the office area built into the refrigerated warehouse space boldt saw two other guys one of them alekseevich who looked a shade paler than when boldt had last seen him neither man made so much as a gesture that might telegraph their prior introduction boldt had been searched his weapon and his cell phone temporarily confiscated his plan to signal lamoia disrupted the magazine had been removed from his weapon which now sat useless next to his phone at the far corner of the large desk boldt kept his eye on the phone if he dived for it he might be able to get the signal off boldt sat down in a chair this time not waiting for an invitation where is it svengrad asked hed trimmed his beard recently possibly for the reception now less than twentyfour hours behind them where is what one of any cops most practiced skills was the art of lying interrogations required hours of playing straightfaced to the most challenging situation boldt knew he excelled at such subterfuge confident that he could go oneonone with the most heinous murderer for all his experience as a military man yasmani svengrad was out of his league you do not want to play such games boldt knew he was supposed to feel the chill of such a statement but it struck him as amusing instead he allowed nothing to be revealed from his expression he couldnt be sure svengrad wouldnt conceal a tape recorder to later try to use to extort him so he had to tiptoe around outright admission then again lamoias machine would erase such tapes as well still looking for that money is that it i wired that money out of the bank myself svengrad said at which point boldt knew no tape recorders were operating he felt free to talk openly now i know that where is it youre the one who wired it you just said so yourself the police intercepted it that was not part of our agreement if wed intercepted it youd be wearing orange coveralls it would be frontpage news and i would know about it but you know that as well so ive got to think that the first thingthe first namethat popped into my head also popped into your head svengrad opened a desk drawer and placed a black videotape on the blotter in front of him we had an agreement he said sliding the tape toward boldt who didnt believe the gesture for a moment this and how many more copies the only copy i dont believe that svengrad shrugged suit yourself what is it you want no svengrad said its what you want he met eyes with boldt glanced over to make sure the office door was closed and said softly ill give you alekseevich physical evidence also you give me immunity ill even give you a witness to the tortures this was an unexpected and exceptional offer but boldt showed nothing of his surprise he eyed the videotape wondering if it could possibly be the only remaining copy and in return his location hayes anything you know about where he is that and if you have him then you call off the dogs for a few minutes send them out for coffee you think he did this to you again intercepted the wire transfer would he do that hes not stupid and even if he did do you think hes anywhere any of us could find him boldt allowed a grin he did it again svengrad was not amused you know where he is boldt shook his head you have him in custody why else did you lock up foreman hayes is cooperating with you foreman is being held by treasury for questioning nothing more no charges have been filed in the end theyll determine he has done no wrong a little overeager is all clearing this case took him over he beat the tar out of hayes to get to the truth and then tried to cover his tracks it happens svengrad wore a look of contempt id hoped we could help each other he placed his hand on the videotape and drew it back toward himself let me ask around its the original tape svengrad said picking up on boldts line of sight boldt knew that already the neatly typed surveillance title on the spine of the videocassette told him as much i thought you were giving it to me the prior agreement its still possible but you will have to do this other thing for me boldt suspected this would go on the rest of his career the tease the request for another favor again he considered lamoias device how would alekseevich be handled he inquired offering svengrad the first glimmer of hope however you want wed let you know where to find him youd pick him up id deny any accusations id need the letter of immunity beforehand that was never going to happen but boldt nodded as if it might the identity of the government snitch would remain protected i can make some inquiries a location for hayes is all i need one phone call boldt retrieved his weapon and cell phone and left he walked out to lamoias jetta through a light mist and sat down into the passenger seat so blackmail he wants hayes the wire never reached his account imagine that lamoia said knowing boldt had arranged this had kidnapped hayes from the warehouse in order to accomplish this its only the two of us you understand that three of us you have to include hayes boldt nodded yeah he said for a minute there i debated giving him up he offered me alekseevich in return a lot of good that would do us lamoia said as angry and frustrated about the protection surrounding alekseevich as boldt he was incredibly calm about it boldt said i thought hed be much angrier violent even thats good that means he hasnt connected it to you or liz hes going to use the tape boldt said i sat there and i looked in his eyes and i knew that hed take me down at the first opportunity he wants to believe hayes did this to him but hes not one hundred percent convinced i dont think hell burn us just to get back at me in case i had anything to do with it it was a hell of a stroke sarge manipulating him to input that account number himself its the only thing saving us he can convince himself that liz didnt cross him because he typed in those numbers himself and who else but hayes could intercept that wire lamoia said admiration for his lieutenant in his voice right i found an outlet lamoia said there are a couple on the west side of the building do me a favor and go home and spend a night with your family dont do anything on this until tomorrow you cant take this kind of risk alone john message received just go home and sleep on it would you he added listen if i do this the sturgeon general will be sure it was hayes you know he will the grand jury will sit thursday alekseevich testifies a week or two from now and svengrads in lockup so take a vacation i dont want you doing this alone i heard you the first time so so boldt said after a moment of thought im coming with you whats going on liz asked from the warm side of the bed boldt in the familiar act of dressing into street clothes in the dark said ill be back within the hour are you going to tell me she asked in a groggy voice no he said better if i dont better that you could answer questions honestly questions from whom internal investigations that silenced her for a moment im sorry she said sensing her own role in whatever it was he had planned me too he said but maybe this is the end of it if only she said is it dangerous i dont think so not particularly its not worth it if it is he stood over her at the side of the bed he could just make out her face in the gray light that leaked around the perimeter of the window blinds you never woke up he said never noticed me missing from the bed if youre trying to scare me its working he left the room stopping in the kitchen to make a traveling cup of tea lamoias jetta was parked behind an art supply store in ballard as planned yo the detective said as boldt slipped into the passenger seat lamoia looked like it was twelve noon they drove to within a hundred yards of svengrads warehouse in complete silence then lamoia pulled over and withdrew a drop gun from the glove compartment not spd issue and if shots were thrown it wouldnt be traceable to lamoia i dont like the look of that boldt said get over it youre nervous i have no idea what that thing in the trunk is going to do what i do know is that im not parking anywhere near that warehouse because cars these days are all about computer chips and that thing fries computer chips so heres the deal youre the wheel man you drop me off wait exactly two minutes and return to pick me up i cant keep a phone or radio on me the thing will fry them too so its all about timing you hear shots fired id appreciate some backup youve got the roles reversed boldt said if anyones putting himself at risk that would be me i got briefed on the operation of this thing lamoia said besides youre technically challenged operating a toaster for christs sake two minutes boldt said he came around the car lamoia popped the trunk so that it was already open and boldt drove them toward the warehouse he glided the car into position lamoia directing him with hand signals lamoia flew out the passenger door lifted the trunk then left it unlatched as he slapped the car to signal boldts retreat as boldt pulled away he saw lamoia struggling with what appeared to be a very heavy metal box it looked like a miniature windowmounted air conditioning unit three blocks away he reversed the jetta so it aimed back toward the unseen warehouse one eye tracked the second hand on his wristwatch while he divided his attention focused on the darkened street before him all at once boldt heard a loud explosion and his foot went to the accelerator faster than conscious thought he removed his weapon and laid it in his lap as he drove at a breakneck speed down the rough potholed roadway he caught sight of the orange glow in the sky and the smudged black plume of smoke billowing from what turned out to be a phone pole an electric transformer on the pole was afire raining viscous drops of flame down onto the crusted blacktop below like some medieval cauldron boldt saw lamoia by the side of the building embracing the bulky steel device in both arms the car rocked as lamoia deposited the device into the trunk the detective hurried around to the passenger side and said go although he was only partially inside boldt hit the accelerator hard and the jetta raced off no sign of any trouble behind them as both men strained toward their respective doormounted mirrors shit lamoia said he was sweating and breathless little kink theyre going to have to work out i hit the button and that transformer blew like it was part of the plan so it worked boldt said somewhat astonished apparently so the transformer that could help us whatever happened in that warehouse maybe it gets blamed on the transformers problems you think its designed to do that lamoia asked suddenly beaming behind a smile yeah i suppose thats possible he said power company gets blamed for it i like that thats what they get for raising our bills every six months only then did it fully dawn on boldt that the master videotape of his wifes indiscretions was now erased and that at the same time svengrads import company had been dealt a serious setback losing all their business data he heard sirens behind them responding to the burning transformer thing scared the shit out of me when it blew like that lamoia said reliving the moment he was twisted around in his seat trying to get a look toward the fire but he gave up and came back around facing the windshield definitely not something we want terrorists to have he explained himself saying the way i see it i was just doing a little homework john lamoia the good student boldt suggested why doesnt that work for me give it a rest sarge as boldt drove the sun brightened the eastern horizon boldt would be in bed before it was fully dawn thank you john said to the windshield but as sincerely as he could make it i love shit like that blowing stuff up setting shit on fire my pleasure sarge believe me lamoia chuckled to himself besides what are friends for boldt searched the papers the following morning for any mention of an unexplained power outage in south ballard he found a paragraph about the transformer fire hed been placed on administrative leave pending a full review of the special ops at the theater and westcorp center pahwan riz and marc obrien were too experienced not to recognize internal interference when they saw it proving it would be next to impossible given the loyalty of daphne john and bobbie gaynes boldt would ride it out as hed ridden out other challenges in the past danny foreman was taking early retirement no charges filed liz returned from a meeting at the bank that tuesday afternoon boldt having gassed up the car and packed it for the drive to wenatchee they were to pick up the kids there and keep driving sun valley yellowstone with the tourists gone they would loop around on one of the most beautiful highways in the country on the western border of montana and on up to coeur dalene where theyd spend most of the next week doing nothing boldt didnt know how it would go he wasnt great at doing nothing liz was quiet for the early part of the drive shed climbed in with a stack of papers her purse and a newspaper whats going on he asked im not going to be offered a contract with mtk youve been fired this news hit boldt in the center of his chest not only did liz love the job but shed been one of the top five officers in the bank thered never been any question of her being worked into the merger the tape maybe she said you think again he felt the wind knocked out of him no or maybe danny got me in trouble trying to save himself i would have heard about that boldt said though he wasnt so sure all of a sudden fired phillip doesnt trust methats at the bottom of it nor should he ill get a good letter i keep the pension its an honorable discharge she said trying to make light of it he knew how devastated she had to be and admired her for her display of courage i seriously doubt it was the tape he said then asked are you okay with this no but i am ready for a change consulting maybe more time at home afternoons she added philosophically you never fully undo something like this if theres one overriding lesson for me anyway its about the repercussions of our actions maybe theres some closure now ive carried thisweve both carried thisfor a long time it would be nice to get it behind us boldt glanced into the rearview mirror the road receding behind them and he nearly mentioned the symbolism to her but thought better of it he kept it to himself he hoped svengrad would be jailed over tax evasion but he wasnt sure hed ever stop looking over his shoulder svengrad had a long reach he kept this to himself as well liz was quiet for a few minutes looking out her window as if the sights there were new to her then she reached down and unfolded the newspaper and opened it fingering through to the business section did you read this mornings paper he had but he claimed not to have nothing got past her she turned it over to below the fold tell me about this boldt kept driving eyes on the road an adoption agency an innercity soccer program was i supposed to miss this he adjusted the rearview mirror still saying nothing six million dollars in anonymous donations between the two how much longer until another eleven in similar donations makes the news she said you must have forced david to do it because this isnt like him we negotiated certain conditions to his receiving protection its true testimony on dannys behalf is part of it danny wasnt trying to make himself rich he was trying to clear a case that no one else cared about he went about it the wrong way but hayes overheard some important statements that danny madesome while beating him geiser will roll on svengrad itll come down like a house of cards you didnt rescue him to save him she said figuring some of it out on the fly you needed him to intercept the wire for you you make adjustments as you go all seventeen to nonprofits lets just say that kplu will be playing jazz for a long long time he switched on the radio oscar peterson he felt liz staring at him could hear her mind churning as she debated what to say what to ask finally she just sighed opened the paper and began reading the adoption agency was a nice touch she said its the one beth and tony used yeah boldt allowed i thought that sounded familiar youre never going to admit this she said even to me when the statute of limitations has run out well talk seven more years together she said i like the sound of that me too boldt admitted taking the wheel firmly in hand and changing lanes twentyfive boldt had not felt this nervous since the birth of their first child who now sat inside the room behind them theyd flown down as a family lizs sisters kid in her last year of graduate work at uc berkeley had offered to take sarah to the exploratorium leaving boldt and his wife on an uncomfortable wooden bench in a hallway that reminded the lieutenant of waiting outside a courtroom liz had busied herself with projects since leaving the bank the garage was spanking clean when she offered to index his jazz albums he knew it was time she found work again for his part he was back at work though staying behind his desk hed even booked himself back into the jokes on you playing jazz piano during happy hour he felt at peace each evening from five until seven from the room behind them they heard miless inspired piano playing boldt recognized the song a monk ballad the boy had picked up from boldt by ear it had been difficult the past month they had not made love yet and he wondered if that was going to happen or if they were doomed to one of those marriages of living together but not fully loving together he didnt want that she asked do you think yes he interrupted knowing as only a husband can know that this question had to do with the child on the other side of the wall the kids were the sinew that bound the muscle of the marriage that muscle kept growing stronger with exercise theyre going to tell us hes unusually gifted and its going to be left to us to accelerate that talent or let him develop like any kid his age she nodded he knows it all intuitively liz ive never seen anything like it our little mozart its going to mean tough choices he said financially sending him away they dont have to be tough she said well just listen for whats right he wanted badly to reach down and take her hand just then but something stopped him it struck him as too sentimental or maybe an act of forgiveness that he couldnt yet afford they heard singing from the other side of that wall a pure golden voice right on pitch amazing he said well work it out she said you trust that dont you this was a much larger question than she let on i do he said the words indelibly reminding him of the original vows they had made to each other id like to hold your hand he admitted then why dont you she offered him hers i dont know he said still unable to take hers up well well start there she said placing her hand back into her lap the music grew behind them the clear voice penetrating through the wall and they both turned to face each other at the same instant the song pushing through the wall was edelweiss from the sound of music his sons voice so pure and simple boldt caught
