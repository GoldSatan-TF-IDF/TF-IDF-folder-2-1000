john lescroart the second chair the tenth book in the dismas hardy series to jack sawyer lescroart almost all our faults are more pardonable than the methods we think up to hide them fran√ßois de la rochefoucauld part one prologue only four minutes remained in sixteenyearold laura wrights life as she came out of the bathroom of the small apartment on beaumont street in san francisco her eyes glistened with the residue of recent tears but in the bathroom shed splashed water over her face and washed away the smeared mascara and makeup and now her skin glowed a damp tendril of blond hair hung over a broad unlined forehead she walked through the tiny living room and over to where mr mooney her drama coach leaned over the kitchen table making some notes in his neat hand in the margins of the script they were rehearsing at her approach he straightened up in the brighter light of the kitchen lauras eyes picked up some of the turquoise in her blouse mooney wore a kind face projected an easy manner ten years before hed been leading man material and now though still trim and goodlooking in a conventional way his hair had thinned and gone slightly gray a hint of jowl marred his jawline he smiled down at her better he asked she nodded still too emotional to trust herself with her voice the two stood facing each other for a moment and then laura reached out her hands and stepped into him after a minute her shoulders began to shake and mooney holding her moved his hands over her back the smooth fabric of the silk its all right he said its going to be all right i know i know it will be her face was buried into the hollow of his neck it is now mooney said she nodded again i know just just thank you she stepped back a little away and looked up at him i didnt mean to get this way the way you are is fine im just glad you found the courage to tell somebody holding that inside can be so hard i figured i could trust you you figured right i know but what was that mooney crossed to the window looked out to the street nobody nothing laura sighed a deep exhalation i didnt think andrew could be back already i dont know if im ready to face him hell be upset if he finds out i told you first i mean its his baby too maybe i can just say i started crying right after he left and you asked what was wrong which is exactly what happened she nodded i know but andrews been a little funny about you and me you and me what about you and me our relationship yours and mine we actually broke up about it once mooney had to suppress a laugh about what exactly he thought i had a crush on you i did in fact you had a crush on me when we started the play yeah rehearsing here a little he was just so jealous and then i got so mad when he accused me of what you know having a thing with you now mooney did allow a small chuckle well by now i hope he knows that didnt happen and besides this is about you its your body you get to decide what to do a pause and you know it might not be the worst idea in the world to talk to your parents no way she said shaking her head theyd kill me they wouldnt want to be bothered trust me this i know her eyes began to well up again mooney stepped near to her and brushed a tear where it had fallen onto her cheek its okay he said in a few months this will all be behind you its just getting through the tough part i so hope youre right i feel like such a fool for letting this happen i mean it was just the one time it only takes once mooney spoke gently you might want to keep that in mind though in the future dont worry she said its locked in but again her composure slipped tears still threatening she stood looking helplessly up at him do you think i could get one more hug as a special request one short one he put his arms around her she pressed herself against him squeezed hard then all but jumped back out of his embrace as a knock came on the door oh god she said theres my great timing again thats got to be andrew what if he saw us mooney held her at arms length laura he said andrews a great guy you dont have to worry about him and even if he saw us he knows you love him really you just take care of yourself and do what you have to do and everything will be fine i promise mooney didnt know it but his last words were a lie another knock sounded and he moved to get the door hello amy wu please this is amy you sleeping i wake you up no just lying down for a minute so friday afternoon youre not at work no right im not feeling too well who is this anyway hal north you remember me of course mr north how are you howd you get my home number you gave it to us last time remember right thats right i gave it to you so how can i help you andrews in trouble again im sorry to hear that what kind of trouble big trouble the police just came and arrested him for murder you still there yeah did you say murder andrew yeah i know but right two of em actually im sorry two of what what did i just say you paying attention murders his teacher and his girlfriend where is he now they took him to jail i mean to the youth guidance center hes still not eighteen or it would have been the jail is that where youre calling from the ygc no me and linda we got a benefit tonight so were still home for another two hours at least we could probably be late to the thing and make it three if you i could be over in say a half hour good well be looking for you wu checked herself in the bathroom mirror no amount of makeup was going to camouflage the swollen bags under her eyes halfchinese and halfblack wu had a complexion that was dark enough as it was and when exhaustion got the better of her the hollows around her eyes deepened now between the crying jags the lack of sleep and the hangover wu thought she looked positively haggard at least a decade older than her thirty years why guys would hit on her looking like this she didnt know but there didnt seem to be a shortage of them not since shed started going out almost every night to find whatever the hell she was seeking in the four months since her father died still prepping herself to visit hal north she did her best to make herself presentable it wouldnt do to look unprofessional this was a legal matter and she knew the potential client had made millions from his chain of multiplex movie theaters at least he had been worth millions a couple of years ago when hal norths corporate attorney a classmate from law school had recommended wu for criminal work and shed represented his stepson andrew for a minor joyride beef shed gotten him off with a fine and some community service the fees at her hourly rate had come to a little under two thousand dollars but when the judge came down with his wristslap judgment north wrote her a check for ten grand she wasnt sure if she should be flattered or insulted that he assumed he should tip his lawyer from now on north had said in his forceful manner she was his lawyer that was all there was to it andrew whod been sullen and distant throughout the entire proceeding even broke a rare smile and concurred shed told them both that though she was flattered that they liked her work all in all it would be better if the family wouldnt need a criminal lawyer ever again they both conceded that she probably had a point she lay down on the bed for two minutes timed with ice wrapped in a dish towel over her eyes when she got up she dried her face and started applying eyeshadow mascara lipstick her hand was steady enough which was a nice surprise this morning brushing her teeth after shed gotten home from whateverhisnames place a little after dawn shed dropped the toothbrush twice before shed given up called work for the fouth time in four months very bad to say she was sick and crashed for a moment she considered calling north back and making another appointment for tomorrow after all the norths had a benefit tonight it came back to her now they always had something going on and theyd be in a rush and she really did feel horrible she wouldnt be as sharp as she liked but hell that was getting to be the norm wasnt it no sleep no focus she hated herself for it but she couldnt seem to stop feeling that it didnt matter anyway of course it mattered she told herself as her old boss david freeman never tired of saying the law was a sacred and beautiful thing and wu hadnt dreamt of a career in it for five years then studied it for three and now have worked in it for five only to lose her faith and become cynical about it that wasnt who she was not at her core but it was who she acted like and felt like all too often lately the truth was her bad angels kept telling her that you didnt really have to be as much on your game as shed always taken as gospel since law school shed proven that clearly enough in the past four months when shed essentially sleepwalked through no fewer than ten court appearances no one not even her seeall boss dismas hardy had alluded to any problems with her work she could mail it in which was lucky since thats what she had been doing the clients were always guilty anyway it wasnt as though you were trying to get them off cleanly acquitted no what you did was you squeezed a little here flirted with a da there got a tiny bit of a better deal and everybody was generally happy that was the business she was in it was a business and shed come to understand how it worked mr north had said that his son had been charged with murder and if this were true it would be her first but her experience led her to believe that it probably wouldnt turn out to be a righteous murder charged as such if it wasnt simply confusion with another person at worst an accident it was probably some kind of manslaughter and of course the norths would want to get an attorney on board if wu went over now at least she would get a feel for the case some of the salient details it would give her the weekend to get her hands on some discovery if it was available yet and if she could keep herself straight and productive for two whole days in a row the norths home was a beauty near the embassy row section of clay street in pacific heights old trees shaded the sidewalks on both sides and most of the residences hid behind some barrier a hedge or fence or stucco wall at a few minutes past four oclock wu got out of her car to push the button on the greentinged brass plate built into the fauxadobe post that held the swinging grille gate to the driveway when she identified herself she heard a soft click then a whirr and the gate swung open for all of the security there was very little actual room between the gate and the house wu got inside then turned left before she came to the garage the driveway was quite narrow as it passed in front of the house but widened into a larger circle near the entryway and this was where she parked the area deep in shadow getting out of her car she could see blue sky above her through the trees and hear a steady shush of april breeze but here in this small leafy enclosure it was still briefcase in hand she drew a breath closed her eyes for an instant to gather herself then went around her car up the steps to the semienclosed brick porch and rang the bell hal north was in his early fifties a short wiry man who tended to dress as he talked loudly today he answered the door in a canary yellow opennecked shirt that revealed a robust growth of chest hair into which was nestled a thick gold chain white slacks penny loafers with no socks he hadnt aged one week since wu had seen him last he wore his thick black hair short and basically uncombed the tousled look his face was notunattractive slabsided with a strong nose and piercing blue eyes that sized wu up afresh as he crushed her hand thanks for coming he said you dont look too sick he backed away a step you remember linda sure wu stepped over the threshhold and extended her hand nice to see you again mrs north linda north was at least three inches taller than hal and in another age would have been called a bombshell blond buxom thin and longlegged she had always struck wu as one of those freakofnature women over whom age and experience seem to pass without leaving a scar a line a trace though wu knew that she was somewhere close to either side of forty shed delivered andrew when she was just a year out of high school in her jeans and tennis shoes and mens tshirt with her hair back in a ponytail she looked about seventeen herself ellies got some coffee going hal was already moving shooing the women before him down the short hallway from the foyer into the dining room ellie he pushed open the door to the adjoining kitchen in here okay he turned around motioning to the women sit sit shell be right in he pulled a chair next to his wife and sat in it threw a last look at the kitchen door where ellie would presumably soon appear then came back to wu really he said we appreciate you coming out we just cant believe this is happening linda said its just a total shock i mean out of nowhere you didnt expect something like this never linda said complete blindside hal was shaking his head his lips tight they kept saying andrew wasnt a suspect they always say that you know why so you might not think you need to have a lawyer with him she paused so im assuming you let him talk to the police of course linda said we thought it would help to be as cooperative as we could the couple exchanged a glance why dont we start by you telling me what has happened wu said starting from the beginning the crime she turned to hal you said hes accused of killing his teacher and his girlfriend linda answered for her husband mike mooney and laura wright they were in the school play and what school sutro wu wasnt surprised to hear this among the citys private schools sutro was a common choice among people with real money okay they were in the school play yes linda said andrew and laura were the leads and theyd been rehearsing nights at mr mooneys house rather than the school then the night it happened somebody just came and shot them down luckily andrew had gone out for a walk to memorize his lines and wasnt there when it happened or he mightve been shot too luckily or too conveniently wu thought but she moved along and andrew got arrested when they came by about twelvethirty one oclock school is out for spring break and they just took him i was at work hal said or i would have tried to slow them down at least then its probably better you werent here wu was sitting beyond linda at the table and could see them both at once when did the crimes happen february linda said midfebruary wus face showed her confusion whats the problem hal asked her i guess i dont understand how two months have gone by and all that time with the police coming by neither of you thought andrew was a suspect he said he didnt do it linda said as though that answered the question i know he didnt he couldnt have ellie came through the door and the conversation stopped while she set out the coffee service as soon as the door to the kitchen closed back behind her wu began again mrs north you just said that andrew couldnt have done these killings why not do you mean he physically couldnt have done them because for example he wasnt there does he have an alibi i mean beyond the walk he took but he did go for that walk linda said theres no doubt about that besides she added andrews just not that kind of person wus experience was that anyone if sufficiently motivated could be driven to kill and hal shed noticed had stopped talking was looking down into his coffee cup mr north she said whyd they decide just now after two months and after theyd talked to andrew several times did something new come up do you have any ideas he raised his eyes to her made a face well the gun he whispered thats nothing lindas eyes flared and her voice snapped thats not even been definitely connected to andrew hal muzzled shut up and shrugged at wu who then spoke gently to linda i dont believe ive heard anything yet about a gun she was prepared to answer this was early on in the first week or so the police asked hal if we owned any guns and hal told them he had an old registered weapon ninemillimeter glock semiauto hal said again linda snapped whatever and when hal went to find it he couldnt she turned to her husband but you know youre always misplacing things it didnt mean andrew took it wu touched lindas arm but the police think he did linda looked at hal who answered for her they found a casing in his car so what wu asked without the gun you cant have a ballistics test it was just a random piece of junk under the seat linda said it might have been there forever it was nothing wu tried to look sympathetic so the police didnt specifically refer to that when they came today no they just said he was under arrest they had enough evidence they said something about a lineup she added he stood in a lineup you let him do that who was trying to identify him hal north bristled i dont know some witness someone identifying andrew obviously and wrongly linda said although wu phrased it gently as you say he was there at mooneys place so someone might have seen him yes yes but linda slapped at the table hal reached out and put a hand over hers look he said to wu were not sure why any of this is happening we dont think andrew did this linda slapped the table again we know he didnt do this okay okay thats what i meant hal said he turned to wu but they must have built a pretty impressive case against him if they got all the way to arresting him wouldnt you think wu more than thought it they had a case and since andrew was the son of a wealthy and prominent man it was probably a strong one a gun in the house a casing in andrews car a positive lineup identification what she had here she was beginning to believe was a young man whod made an awful mistake what are you thinking hal asked her abruptly nothing wu said its too soon i dont know anything yet you know hes innocent linda said we know that of course wu said other than that though by sunday afternoon when she met with hal north again wu knew that they had a substantial problem she also thought she had a solution this time it was just she and hal in the large bright and highceilinged living room hal sat in the middle of a loveseat while wu perched on a couch linda had gone to visit andrew and would be gone for at least two hours wu had been lucky to get a couple of folders of discovery on andrews case from the das office before close of business on friday she had spent all day saturday going over what the police had assembled it looked very very bad whats so bad north asked wu sat all the way forward on the couch hunched over in tension her folders rested unopened on the coffee table in front of her where do you want to start it could be almost anywhere theyve got a good case it looks like he did it do you know anything beyond what we talked about on friday north shrugged i figured the gun was a problem but i didnt know how theyd tied that to him they didnt find it did they no still no weapon but theres plenty in here she tapped the foldersto prove to me that he had the gun with him that night you want me to go over it piece by piece north waved impatiently i dont need it if youre convinced itll be good enough for a jury he slammed a palm against the side of his seat i knew he took it goddamn it i knew he was lying to me smoldering north sat forward with his shoulders hunched his elbows resting on his knees head down finally he looked up at wu what about the lineup the man upstairs saw him leave just after the shots positive id north slumped again shook his head from side to side wearily came back up to face her so he did it not a question well maybe he wasnt taking that walk to rehearse his lines lets say that jesus this is going to kill linda she really believes him were talking faith here not reason i thought that alibi story was like the ultimate in lame myself but once andrew came up with it he had to stick to it i just wish he would have invented something else almost anything else north shook himself all over then straightened his back and threw wu a determined pugnacious look okay counselor what do we do now wu was ready for the question and suddenly glad that linda wasnt here hal would play much more into her plan that shed reluctantly come to believe was the boys best hope albeit a defeatist and cynical one because it was based on the absolute fact of andrews guilt as a good lawyer with a difficult case before her hell as a good person she knew she should have been consumed with getting andrew off that was in many ways the definition of what her job was all about give her client the best defense the law allowed and myriad defenses insanity psychiatric diminished capacity some form of selfdefense or manslaughter were always available a veritable smorgasbord of reasons that homicide could be if not forgiven entirely then mitigated but all of those defenses and strategies involved huge expense for her clients family a year or more of her lifes commitment and tremendous risk to her client should she fail or even not completely succeed on the other hand assuming that andrew was guilty in actual fact and every other client shed ever defended had been wu knew that she could get him a deal that would give him a life after he turned twentyfive years old eight years from now and this when the best result she could reasonably expect under the other various defense scenarios was ten years and probably many many more and so though it was a terrible choice she had convinced herself that all things considered it was the best possible strategy in these circumstances i think our primary goal she said ought to be to keep andrew in the juvenile system not let them try him as an adult why would they do that hes not eighteen its eighteen right right at eighteen its automatic hes an adult but that doesnt mean the da cant charge younger people its a discretionary call depending on what the criminal history of the person charged the seriousness of the crime some other intangibles she took a breath held it a moment let it out i have to tell you ive already talked to the chief assistant da his names allan boscacci and as of this moment theyre planning to file andrew as an adult why that makes no sense this is his first real offense hes a little hard to talk to sometimes okay but its not like hes some kind of hardened criminal or anything yeah but two killings pointblank pretty serious theyre even talking special circumstances multiple murders in fact again its automatic special circumstances youre not talking the death penalty no you cant get that no matter what if youre under eighteen at the time of the offense north quickly cast his eyes around the room okay so what happens when hes an adult different i mean wu knew she had to deliver it straight and fast if she was going to get north to agree with her strategy she had to make it look as bad as she could for andrew as quickly as possible a couple of major issues first most importantly if hes an adult life without parole is in play if hes a juvenile its not the worst he can get as a juvenile is up to age twentyfive in a juvie facility but north not too surprisingly was struck by the worstcase scenario jesus christ life without parole youve got to be shitting me no sir if hes convicted okay then he doesnt get convicted last time you got him off clean its not even on his record last time sir with all respect he borrowed a car for half an hour thats a long way from murder yeah but im paying you to get him off you cant do that ill find me somebody else who can wu expected this denial anger threats she held her ground you might find somebody wholl say they can she fixed him with a firm gaze theyd be blowing smoke up your ass youre saying you cant do it no sir im not saying that if thats your decision ill sure try i might succeed like i did before get him a reduced sentence maybe even an acquittal but nobody and i mean nobody can predict how a trials going to come out anybody who says different is a liar and the risks in this case given just the evidence weve seen so far are enormous she reined herself in took a deep breath what i can do maybe is avoid the adult disposition if andrew goes as a juvenile the worst case is hes in custody at the youth farm which is way better than state prison believe me until he turns twentyfive then hes free with his whole life still in front of him okay so how do you do that avoid the adult disposition well thats both our problem and our solution to have any chance of convincing the da at all wed have to tell him andrew would admit the crime north snorted that id like to see thats not happening wu shrugged and waited content to let the concept work on him north did his quick scan of the room again sat back in his loveseat frowned finally he met her eyes shook his head no fucking way he said okay shit yes sir ill never get linda to go for that shell never believe he did it all right but what do you believe i dont know what i believe the kid and i never bonded really well you know what i mean i dont know him hes all right i guess i love his mother id kill for her but the kids a mystery but whether he could kill somebody he shrugged helpless i dont know i guess i think its possible id bet hes lying about the walk he took i know he took my gun and hes lying about that too and whyd he take it if he wasnt going to use it thats a good question wu kept her responses lowkey not wanting to push north she was sure would come to his conclusions on his own as she had at least that andrews situation looked bad enough to make the risks of an adult trial not worth taking still in a matteroffact tone she said they dont usually arrest innocent people sir no matter what you see in the movies then she added im not saying andrew is guilty but last time if you remember he started out saying he never took the car never drove in it at all didnt know what the cops were talking about he swore to it just like now north was slumped back in his chair his palm up against the side of his head this is going to kill linda he said again well if he really isnt guilty wu let the words hang north shook his head even if he isnt hows a jury going to like the eyewitness and the gun and the motive jealousy right wu had read the testimony of one of andrews friends alluding to the jealousy motive he evidently thought the teacher and his girlfriend were at least on the verge of starting if not engaged in an affair but it was the first time north had mentioned anything about it and the independent unsolicited confirmation was a bit chilling still wu restrained herself from trying to convince she believed that forceful men like hal north stuck far more tenaciously with decisions that they reached on their own so she changed tack heres the thing mr north hes up at the ygc now they havent filed against him as an adult yet so practically speaking hes being treated as a juvenile they have to hold whats called a detention hearing right away ive already checked and its tomorrow to decide if theyre going let andrew go back home under your supervision no reason they shouldnt do that except for the fact that hes killed two people she thought but she only let out a breath and said in any case as long as hes considered a juvenile administratively theyve got to have this detention hearing that might give you some time not much admittedly to walk through some of these other issues with linda and even with andrew he shook his head no shell talk to him but maybe i can make her see whats happening wu drew another breath and came out with it she was going to need her clients approval before she took her next gamble and this was the moment in light of everything weve been talking about here mr north id very much like to try to keep him in the juvenile system and avoid an adult trial if theres any way at all to do it but that means he admits guilt right now immediately not maybe i tell the da he will admit and clear the case in return they let him stay in juvenile court he sat stone still for a long beat then nodded once ambiguous enough but wu took it as an acceptance do you think you can get your wife to go along with that i want you to understand clearly that if andrew admits there wont be a trial either in juvie or adult court hell just be sentenced but the worst sentence he could get is the youth farm until he turns twentyfive eight years he said his shoulders slumped around him eight years jesus christ thats the maximum the actual sentence may be less with the crowding at the youth work farms and time off for good behavior he might not be as old when he gets out as when hed finish college north may have been starting to see it but the pill wasnt getting any less bitter he rubbed his hand against the slab of his cheek still were talking years wu nodded soberly yes sir but compared to the rest of his life even if i could plead him to a lesser charge as an adult say second degree murder or manslaughter hell do at least double that time she came forward and it would be in an adult prison which is like it appears in the movies but if we can get him declared a juvenile which is not certain it seems to me weve got to do that at least try for it i can do it but ill have to move quickly she consciously repeated herself you might want to talk to linda first he gave it another few seconds of thought then nodded again spoke as if to himself andrews stubborn but hell come around when he sees the alternative if he goes adult and gets convicted linda couldnt handle it she really couldnt tortured he looked across at her so what do we do im afraid thats got to be your decision he blew out heavily in frustration and when is this filing decision adult or juvie soon it might have already happened except that andrew got arrested on a friday afternoon and boscacci is off on the weekend but by sometime tomorrow morning probably tomorrow morning his eyes seemed to be looking into hers for some reprieve but the situation as they both sat there seemed to keep getting worse and once a decision comes down then what i mean is it appealable or something you mean once hes declared an adult no then hes an adult god damn he shook his head side to side side to side this isnt possible at last he seemed to gather himself so if they decide hes an adult tomorrow were screwed well we go to trial yes but you might be able to talk to this guy boscacci before then id call him at home today if you want me to and that gives us a better deal she phrased it carefully less of a potential downside lets say that and thats definite i mean we go juvie hes out at twentyfive yes sir thats the best deal we can get dont you think as a sure thing yes sir all else being equal i do but i dont want to hurry you in any way this is a huge decision and right now andrew stands presumed innocent if he admits that changes north shook his head dismissing that concern his stepson with whom communication was so difficult whod screwed up so many times before had done it again he was a constant burden and strain and now he was putting his mother through more and more heartache but north couldnt yet admit out loud what he might believe and so he simply said he might be innocent okay but tell me theres a jury in the world thats going to see it a sigh at least hell have a life afterwards when he gets out wu watched the second hand on the mantel clock move through ninety degrees then spoke in a gentle tone so do you want me to see what i can do a last long agonizing moment then yeah i think youve got to sitting back on the couch she let herself sink into the deep cushions okay she said okay deputy chief of investigations abe glitsky was sitting in his old office in homicide on the fourth floor of san franciscos hall of justice he was talking to the details lieutenant marcel lanier when another old homicide chief frank batiste had finally been appointed chief of police the previous summer hed rewarded glitsky his longtime colleague with the plum job of deputy chief though glitskys civil service rank was lieutenant for the year preceding his appointment he had labored unhappily in a sergeants position as head of payroll now as deputy chief and still a civil service lieutenant glitsky supervised captains and commanders and of course every one of the two hundred and forty police inspectors in the city as deputy chief glitskys role was important but nebulous the investigations bureau had taken a very public hit about six months before when the chronicle had run a weeklong feature exposing the fact that of all the nations largest cities san francisco came in dead last for its police record in arresting criminals and solving crimes of all types the article had revealed that during the previous four years over percent of all crimes committed in the city had gone unsolved many criminal acts even violent ones such as street muggings were never investigated at all and with others residential burglaries and the like the investigation would consist of one inspector making one phone call to the victim asking if anyone would like to come down to the hall of justice and file a report on what was missing though the scathing report had not yet seen print at the time batiste had of course been aware of the dismal numbers the lackluster performance and generally low morale of the department as a whole and hed brought glitsky on to galvanize the bureau to kick ass and take names and above all to see that more bad guys actually found themselves arrested it was true that many inspectors had fallen into bad habits but this was not always because they didnt care about their jobs in many cases budget cuts to the pd had eliminated overtime pay for interviewing witnesses or writing up incidents more systemically a culture had arisen in the das office sharron pratts legacy that placed a premium only on cases where the evidence was so overwhelming that a conviction could be guaranteed and that encouraged assistant district attorneys to ask officers not to arrest suspects until they had the strongest possible case if they had a guy cold on one count for example they should wait until they could get him for three or four as that would make conviction more likely this kept that particular scumbag out on the street when in most other big cities he would already have been locked up glitskys first few months on the job had been characterized by his rather forceful presence working over the bureau collaring inspectors in the hall and even patrolmen in the precincts or out in the streets on surprise inspections hed put a friendly and unbreakable armlock on one of his troops and get right in his face i know youve got suspects and youre waiting till they do something more but i say lets put em in jail and i mean today glitsky also set an example by showing up at work no later than seventhirty and staying until at least six oclock and not putting in for overtime he believed that the badge was a calling and a public responsibility more than it was a job he made it clear to the people under him that they would have greater satisfaction in their work if they came to share that view and ironically after requests for overtime fell off slightly glitsky started getting more of it approved by batiste the investigations bureau was still far from perfect but things seemed to be improving a fortuitous sidelight that had opened up as a result of glitskys flexible schedule was that he found himself free to stroll down the hallway from time to time as he had this morning and keep up on the workings of the homicide department from his earliest days as a patrolman glitsky had viewed homicide as action central this was where he wanted to be these were the crimes that mattered the most for twelve years hed been an inspector with that detail and for another eight the head of it it wasnt ever going to get out of his blood when batiste had offered him the post of deputy chief hed almost countered with the suggestion that hed be happier back running homicide fortunately before he said those fateful words hed recognized the faux pas they would constitute any response but an unqualified yes to batistes thoughtful and generous offer would justifiably have made him appear to be ungrateful and would have driven a wedge between him and the new chief if glitsky had requested the job in homicide not only would he never have gotten it hed never have left payroll the chief had picked him out from far down in the ranks and elevated him above many others to a truly exalted position glitsky even had his own driver so reluctantly hed accepted the new job believing this meant that his time in homicide the work he had always loved the best was behind him forever but now here he was less than a year after his promotion sitting with his feet up in his old office discussing a particularly baffling murder case with lieutenant lanier who woulda thunk but hed take it a middleaged happily married slightly overweight white housewife named elizabeth cary had been shot at her front door about a week before to date inspectors had found no clues as to who had killed her or why and you sweated the husband hard glitsky asked wasnt his alibi soft robert yeah lanier said he says he was driving home hes the one called nine one one but pat belou you know her shes new but good anyway she had him in there the interrogation room on the other side of the homicide detailsix hours last thursday then we did him again four hours the next day russell in with her this time doing good copbad cop he shook his head nothin abe if he did it hes good belou and russell both say they couldnt break him plus no sign of another girlfriend on the side the guys not exactly casanova bald fat old how old sixty she was fifty glitsky shrugged bald fat old guys can get girlfriends marcel not as often as you think abe and not robert i promise they were redoing their wedding vows for their twentyfifth anniversary next month doesnt mean they couldnt have had a fight about what i dont know maybe they couldnt agree on the guest list and he really wanted this old friend of his to come but she hated him the friend so he had to kill her glitsky scratched his cheek all right maybe not so who else could it have been one of the kids i dont think so theyre all wrecked ive talked to all three of them myself nobodys that good an actor especially the young one carlene i think shes eleven besides they alibi each other all watching some action video in the back of the house never even heard the shot must have thought it was part of the movie plus finally he sighed no motive in the whole world they loved her i really think they did you should have seen them theyre all just completely fucked up around this excuse me the french glitsky waved off the apology he disliked profanity but hed heard all the words before and at the moment his mind was taken up with the case what about her friends shes got a regular book club and this group of other mothers from the neighborhood that meet every week or so but weve talked to every one of them all shocked stunned nobody had even a small problem with elizabeth everybody came to her for everything and she never said no lanier had reconfigured the office pretty much back to the way it had been when it had been glitskys one desk took up most of the center of the room and he sat behind it with glitsky across from him his feet up his fingers templed in front of his mouth i went to the funeral on saturday abe he continued huge crowd everybody loved this woman somebody didnt lanier conceded the point well whoever it was did it right took the gun with him touched nothing one shot pointblank to the heart you checking phone records glitsky asked maybe she had a boyfriend were looking money lanier spread his hands not a problem she was frugal robert makes enough that theyre okay they went on vacation every year houseboat on shasta glitsky brought his feet to the floor so your absolutely typical average american housewife answers the door on a tuesday evening and somebody shoots her for no reason right thats what we got its unlikely agreed lanier came forward look abe if youre not so subtly hinting that youd like to talk to some of the players here yourself i would invite any and all input belou and russell are stumped and have other cases with better chances of getting solved so if you want to jump in on this have at it glitsky was standing if i get the time i might like to have a word with the husband knock yourself out lanier said to avoid the gauntlet of sixth street south of mission perhaps the citys most blighted stretch of asphalt and hopelessness dismas hardy chose to drive the ten blocks or so from his sutter street office to the hall of justice only eighteen months before his expartner david freeman had been mugged and killed when he chose to walk home from the office one night rather than drive freemans attackers hadnt come from the ranks of miscreants and drugaddled denizens of sixth street true but the old mans death had brought home to hardy in a visceral way the literal danger of the streets you entered certain areas at your own risk and the greater part of valor was avoiding them if at all possible as he crossed mission today in his flashy new silver honda s convertible on his way to what was sure to be a controversial meeting his thoughts as they did with an exhausting regularity went back to the events surrounding freemans death events that had been the proximate cause of another far more profound change in hardy and several of his closest friends for the attack that killed david had been the penultimate escalation in a pattern of violence that had begun with the murder of a pawnshop owner named sam silverman and continued through the deaths of two policemen then to an attempt on hardys own life when he and his best friend glitsky learned that a man named wade panos was behind this vendetta they had of course taken their suspicions to the proper authorities the da the police the fbi but panos owned a private security force sanctioned by the city and the lieutenant in charge of homicide turned out to be on panoss payroll as well hardys and glitskys accusations fell on deaf ears and before they could take it to the next level of legitimate authority they had both received threats to the lives of their families to protect themselves and their loved ones out of time and frustrated by the law theyd both sworn to uphold the two of them along with hardys brotherinlaw moses mcguire his partner gina roake and his client john holiday found themselves forced into a shootout with panoss men at a deserted pier near the abandoned waterfront in a brief but furious gunfight in pure selfdefense they had killed four of panoss men including lieutenant barry gerson and had lost one of their own john holiday the four survivors hardy glitsky mcguire and roake were physically untouched and made a clean escape but there was much collateral damage if hardy had considered himself cynical about abusing the letter of the law in his practice before now he was past entertaining any qualms at all he still considered himself a good guy whatever that meant but he also recognized that a kind of a scab had grown over the wound his softer instincts had sustained hed been doubted betrayed lied to threatened and abandoned both by those in whom hed put his trust and in the system hed believed in intrinsically now he wasnt about to squander any more emotional investment in a process that hadnt worked for him when hed needed it most he did what he did and if sometimes it was ugly well sometimes life was ugly get over it he didnt care if everybody liked him anymore sometimes he didnt like himself very much either as he turned into the allday lot at the end of the alley across from the hall of justice he found that his hands ached from gripping the wheel so firmly his jaw throbbed from the constant pressure hed been putting on it his appointment was with the district attorney clarence jackman he was here to cut a deal for a client he despised whom he wouldnt have gone near a couple of years ago in those days he would simply have declined to take the case in his earlier career hed turned down business many times when he didnt personally like a prospective client but more often than not lately he found himself inclined to choose to profit from his squeamishness and would take the case at double or even triple his normal rate it was all a game anyway and if he didnt profit from it when he could he was a fool so when an excop named harlan fisk now a city supervisor came to hardy the fixer to talk about peter chase a bigtime property managerdeveloper whod been caught fondling his elevenyearold nephew hardy forced himself to listen chase was one of fisks big donors hardy heard the facts and said hed see what he could do to keep the case from coming to trial but it would cost chase fifty thousand dollars up front now he had done his homework and perfected his pitch he delivered it to jackman in his thirdfloor office in the hall of justice also in the room were supervisor fisk chief of police batiste and celia bonham a representative from the mayors office winding it up hardy said look clarence i dont like this any better than you do but im just the messenger jackman a physically imposing africanamerican was a powerful and charismatic figure when sharron pratt his predecessor as district attorney had resigned in disgrace three years before mayor washington had appointed jackman to fill out the remainder of her term and jackman had hired a team of aggressive prosecutors who much preferred putting criminals in jail to understanding them and their problems he was running for election in his own right next november and was ahead in all the early polls now sitting behind his desk his hands clasped in front of him his voice mild he said im of course happy to hear the mayors position on criminal cases but there was a victim in this case an innocent little boy and this office has his rights to protect are you telling me his abuser should go unpunished youll pardon me for speaking frankly diz but im a little surprised youre taking this tack this discussion is beneath you hardy controlled a grimace took a breath you should know hes reached a financial settlement with his sister the boys mother clarence will that make up to the boy for what he did to him will any amount of money address the human issue no it wont but it will pay for counseling for the victim and then perhaps help with his schooling and even college in return the family has agreed to my proposal to the mayors proposal really he cant want us to drop the charges diz even if the victims family agrees im inclined to pursue them were a tolerant city god knows but not for this kind of stuff not on my watch hardy turned to share a glance with fisk then came back around to the da im not talking about dropping charges clarence he remains charged the case stays open jackman frowned then what do you want i want the case to stay open thats all my client gives you his word that nothing like this will ever happen again ever he remains in counseling in perpetuity he goes to meetings every week his life changes it has changed he is always in treatment and if he ever does cross the line again clarence youve already got him charged you just pull him in if i may ms bonham said im at this meeting because mayor washington wanted his feelings known he has been acquainted both personally and professionally with mr chase for many years and while he in no way countenances his behavior in this case he sees it as a onetime failing of an otherwise good man with a real sickness a disease if you will who may have let the stresses of his work get the better of him jackman listened with interest to this extraordinary little speech then nodded and looked at chief batiste frank he asked whats the police position here i serve at the mayors pleasure clarence as you know if the mayors okay with holding off on a trial he let the sentence hang jackman brought his eyes back to hardy this is a nonstarter diz and you know it whats really going on here this was getting to the meat of it as you know clarence mr chase manages several city properties in the blocks surrounding city hall beyond those he also holds the contract for the police departments motor pool he leases all the city cars what hes proposing is a yearlong moratorium on rents for all these properties starting this month in a long legal career jackman had fielded a host of bizarre settlement offers but this one rocked him he blew out a lungful of air pushed his chair back got up quickly and walked over to his windows he was close to losing his temper something that he had not allowed himself for years so mr chase wants to buy his way out of child molestation charges why send you diz why not a plain envelope stuffed with hundreds delivered by some hoodlum in a dark bar he actually spoke more softly i wont be bribed diz and im disgusted that you think i could be he looked from eye to eye at the assembled legation i think you all had better leave hardy stood up put out a restraining hand to the others crossed over to where jackman stood look clarence i said at the outset that i knew this stinks the guy hired me because he figures i can pull a personal string here and i have the right to be as insulted as you do but i think youve got to do this listen washington says the city will make about three mil on this deal if you wont do it hell just cut the difference out of your budget youre being extorted clarence plain and simple squeezed by a child molester and a venal political hack behind him he heard ms bonham make a kind of gurgling noise he was talking loud enough for her to hear and this was getting rather more raw than shed expected but the bottom line hardy concluded is i think theyve got you hardy knew that three million dollars was about percent of the das already lean budget the office had already made deep cuts and three million more would be a catastrophe jackman would have to lay off percent of his staff and because most of his nonlabor expenses were fixed salaries were all he had to work with clarence hardy concluded lowering his own voice now believe it or not im here as your friend because nobody else would have told you what was really going on i think you have to do this hardy walked back to the couches jackman returned to his desk and sat back down in the heavy expectant silence after a moment he looked up and nodded if he so much as spits on the sidewalk ill have him hauled in and fasttrack him to superior court is that clear to each and every one of you yes sir they intoned as with one voice all right you make sure the paperwork is tight and have it back here by this evening for my signature ms bonham while im talking about signatures i wouldnt mind his honors position in writing at his and your convenience of course other than that he pointed toward his door ive got a couple of appointments scheduled i appreciate you all coming to talk to me about this problem bonham fisk and batiste were through the door when clarence called out for hardy to stay behind a minute after the door closed he sat looking down at his desk when he spoke the words came out with a scalpellike precision i accept you came here as a friend diz but as a friend never come here with a deal like this again not ever understood understood with more than just a bad taste in his mouth hardy went into the bathroom in the hallway outside jackmans office there he leaned over one of the sinks for a few seconds his head hanging as though from a thread then he turned on the cold water and threw several handfulls into his face drying off with a paper towel from the roll he suddenly stopped and stood studying his face in the mirror for a long moment the conversation with jackman had netted him and his firm fifty thousand dollars and though he told himself that it was a decent deal all around his body was telling him something else his head was light his heart pounded a wave of nausea made him hang his head again when the dizziness passed he ran his palms over his face trying to recognize the person he was staring at would clarence ever forgive him he asked himself would he forgive himself could he continue to live like this i have no choice he told himself dont confuse a job with a vocation this is a job you do it you get paid for it thats what its about its not about you its not personal dont lose that focus if it gets personal you lose when he got his breathing and the rest of his body under some degree of control he rode the elevator up one floor looking in at the suites of administrative offices that opened onto the lobby he noticed with some surprise that the reception area was empty he stood inside the double doors for a moment making sure no one was guarding the entrance then reached behind the waisthigh wooden door by the reception desk and pressed the button that admitted visitors to the inner sanctum in a few steps silently hed passed through the outer office then the conference room neither of the deputy chiefs was in their adjacent offices the room to his left was glitskys office far from the norm at the hall his office was expansive nearly as large as hardys own and almost as well furnished windows along the bryant street wall provided lots of natural light the bookshelves behind his desk testified to glitskys love of books a knowledge junkie he stocked hundreds of paperback novels a full set of the encyclopedia britannica an abridged although still enormous oxford english dictionary there was a shelf of history another of forensics criminology the compendium of drug therapy and other medical references one whole section was devoted to patrick obrians seafaring books glitskys ongoing passion now for the past few years and the other highly esoteric reference books that accompanied these novelslobscouse and spotted dog harbors and high seas a sea of words a biography of thomas cochrane whod been obrians inspiration for jack aubrey on these shelves too were a number of personal artifacts a football signed by all of his college teammates at san jose state pictures of him and his sons on most if not all of the pop warner teams hed coached his old patrolmans hat a menorah glitsky was half jewish and half africanamerican lots of policethemed bricabrac from citations hed been awarded classes and conferences hed attended decorations and medals hed acquired the walls were covered with even more citations including police officer of the year in plaques diplomas the premature obituary that jeff elliot had written about him after hed been shot there were also two family photos one about twelve years old featuring his thenyoung boys and his wife flo before shed died the other taken only last december with treya and their baby rachel treyas twentyyearold daughter raney and his three nowgrown young men isaac jacob and orel in glitskys new position he spent a good portion of every day going to meetings holding press conferences to manage the spin on police issues representing the chief at various functions hardy assumed hed been at such a meeting this morning and saw no reason not to take advantage of his friends absence to inject a little lightness into his afternoon he walked behind the desk and opened the top left drawer which as he knew was filled with peanuts in the shell quickly looking up lest one of the gatekeepers bust him he pulled the drawer all the way out and set it on the desk he then took out the righthand drawer pens postit pads business cards paper clips and inserted it into the lefthand slot when the peanuts were in on the wrong side he checked his handiwork and saw that lo it was good glitsky the control freak would go into fits hardy made it out of the administrative offices without running into a human being when he got back on the elevator going down his good humor had mostly returned and he was whistling to himself hardy pulled his convertible into the garage of the freeman building underneath the law offices of freeman farrell hardy roake when freeman had died he had left the building that bore his name to his fiancee gina roake and the firms business to hardy and theyd formed a new firm keeping freemans name in it immediately and almost without discussion the arrangement had somehow seemed foreordained now with the top down hardy parked in the primo spot next to the elevator that was reserved for the managing partner for a moment he sat listening to the terrific interplay of guitar bouzouki mandolin violin and vocals of nickel creeks sweet afton a song from the cd his daughter rebecca had recommended it did his heart good to know that this old poem by robert burns had somehow attained a kind of limited hipness again it was a mostly acoustic country group after all melodic and musical so it didnt exactly rule the airwaves but his daughter and her teenage friends loved it for a that here alone was reason to have hope and faith in the next generation he thought it wasnt all rap and crap he set the brake took off his sunglasses and pushed the button that got the roof back up in under six seconds a little more than the time it took the car to hit sixty on the open road in another minute he exited the elevator into the main lobby on the second floor and was gratified to hear the steady thrum of activity it was nearly ten am and most of the fourteen associates had already been here since at least eight oclock on their way to billing at least eight hours of their time as they did every day at an hour from where he stood hardy could see three associates meeting with some clients in the solarium the firms large glassenclosed conference room directly in front of him at the receptionists workstation phyllis seemed to be answering five calls at once the hallway to his right bustled with mail delivery and some other associates talking with their secretaries or paralegals the xerox machines were humming in the background hardy crossed the space in front of him and poked his head into the office of norma towne his office manager a humorless woman of uncertain vintage who had conceived an affection of sorts for him in spite of his tendency to crack wise she pulled her eyes from her computer long enough to give him a little wave to ask if he needed anything an oil well would be nice he said if youve got a spare everything okay here it was and he proceeded to his own office in the past year hed moved down to the main floor from the one above bequeathing his old office to his new partner wes farrell as managing partner hardy felt he ought to have more of a presence in the daytoday workings of the firm and hed ensconced himself in a room directly next to david freemans old office a year ago hardys current work space had enclosed a fourdesk paralegal station the stationery room and the semiwarehouse where the firm had kept the old physical files now with a couple of interior walls removed and twentyfive thousand dollars worth of interior decorating it was a large airy and imposing executive suite he had his own wall of law books several somber original oils suitably framed a sink and large wet bar and two seating areas with persian throw rugs like the one in front of his custom cherry desk he did bring the dartboard down from upstairs but now it hid behind a pair of cherry cabinet doors the only hint of its presence was the thirtyinch slat of dark teak set into the oak hardwood floor exactly seven feet nine and onequarter inches from the face of the dartboard similar cabinet doors also hid his entertainment center audio system and huge television set hardy pushed the button on his espresso machine and crossed to his desk just in time to respond to his buzzer phyllis announced that his ten oclock mrs oliva had arrived he crossed to the door paused to take a breath and get his smile in place then walked out to meet his client the area over by the bar and the law books was the more formal of the two seating arrangements the other had a loveseat and upholstered wing chairs and mrs oliva and hardy sat kittycorner to each other on stiffbacked empire chairs she had taken a cup of espresso too though it rested untouched on the low table in front of her not yet thirty years old she was carefully made up and as well dressed as walmart could make her she was explaining why she supported the charges the da had filed against hardys client her exhusband james a san francisco policeman i completely understand hardy said when shed finished i dont know if you can i realize it sounds ridiculous i mean a box of baby wipes she smiled almost apologetically at the absurdity of the words but the reality was too serious to allow that shed called police alleging that james had gotten angry during a scheduled visitation with their oneyearold amanda from a distance of less than five feet he had thrown a full box of baby wipes at his estranged wife the force and surprise of the thing had knocked mrs oliva down broken her nose blackened both eyes hardy thought he could still detect halos of bluish bruise under her foundation the issue isnt what may or may not have been in the box the issue is that he threw it in anger at you as though curious she cocked her head to one side youre not trying to defend it call me oldfashioned hardy said breaking a small grin but im opposed to guys hitting girls throwing things at them too if you want to get technical his voice went dead sober im acting on behalf of your husband mrs oliva but not trying to defend what he did ive suggested he get himself into an anger management program and hes done that but what he did to you he and i both agree is completely inexcusable he wants you to know that thats how he feels mrs oliva digested this unexpected viewpoint for a short moment she seemed to remember the demitasse on the table and reached down picked it up took a sip so if thats the case why are we having this meeting she asked why are you defending him well as ive indicated im really not there yet defending him i mean in the legal sense at this point hes retained me and im representing him if this case eventually comes to trial ill probably advise him to seek other counsel she carefully put her coffee cup back down and faced hardy her lips now tight what do you mean if this case goes to trial the das charged it and theyre planning to go forward i know that of course hardy sat back crossed one leg over the other but i wanted to talk to you in person and ask you if in your heart you really wanted jim to go to jail over this im sure youve heard stories about what happens to cops when they go to jail her mouth worked but she didnt speak hardy pressed her moment of hesitancy im not suggesting that jim not be punished or that if he does go to jail he wouldnt deserve whatever happened to him there what i am saying is that id like you to consider what that type of punishment for him would do to you he uncrossed his legs and came forward if jim gets convicted mrs oliva he loses his job which in the here and now means no income for you and no child support i understand hes been good about those payments up until now she nodded her face showed that this was something she hadnt considered the possibility of losing that precious income clearly struck a nerve hardy continued hes not trying to duck his responsibility to you mrs oliva or even his punishment which he knows he deserves he lowered his voice to near inaudibility i doubt if he would want anyone to know about this but i sat across from him in this very seat two days ago and watched him break down in remorse for what hed done to you hed never harmed you physically before this one incident had he no suddenly one of mrs olivas eyes overflowed she made no effort to wipe the tear away hardy handed her a kleenex from the box on the table beside him his voice a caressing whisper he lost his temper mrs oliva he never meant to hurt you and certainly not so badly he says he thinks you know that is that true no i mean yes i dont think he meant to do it but it was so so violent and in front of amanda i know amanda shes his main concern too whats going to happen to her if jims in jail and youve got to be working to support the both of you whats that going to do to her living in a succession of daycare places as opposed to her having her own mother he stopped her tears flowed over her cheeks and she dabbed at them with the kleenex she sat straightbacked under rigid control mrs oliva hardy said jim is more sorry for this than he can express he plans to write you a formal apology beyond that he doesnt want the baby you had together to be brought up by strangers he understands that youre not comfortable seeing him for a time or having him around amanda but these anger management classes can work wonders ive seen it happen many times in the meanwhile at my suggestion jim has agreed to double his monthly child support payments to you which will be a burden on him but one that he accepts would gladly accept if youd agree to it and ask the da to to drop these criminal charges hardy knew that it was up to the da to press or drop the charges jackman felt continual pressure from womens groups to go to the max on every case such as this one nevertheless with the victim on board hardy thought he had a good shot at getting his client into some kind of program that would result in the charges being dismissed jackman might not like these diversion programs where nothing substantive ever really happened but he was stuck with them and sometimes as in this case they served a purpose you know your husband hardy continued basically hes a good man hell honor his debts especially to amanda you know he will but he needs to keep his job he needs to go back to work for all of your sakes every day under his dress shirt and tie wes farrell wore a tshirt with a message he was buttoning up now having just shown hardy todays dyslexics of the world untie now farrell religious in his avoidance of good posture had gotten himself comfortable sideways and slumped in the loveseat his legs up over the armrest he said for this twenty minutes you made five thousand dollars hardy had his cabinet open and was throwing darts in an abstracted manner now he turned to face his partner it was grueling work but it wasnt any twenty minutes more like fifteen fifteen minutes and whats this the fifth one this month the fifth what whatever you call it facilitation i love that word hardy threw a dart but i dont keep track of the numbers its bad luck counting your money at the table he threw another dart more than a couple anyway and this one shes calling the da today thats the deal and her husband doubles the child support and also pays you five grand hardy felt enough guilt about it himself he didnt need to get an extra dose from his partner dont look at me like that hes still better off its way cheaper than if he went to trial i didnt do anything unethical everybody wins here if you believe that i believe you farrell said im just trying to figure out how i can get some of that action well im not really sure i do believe it to tell you the truth but it seems to be what im doing lately nobody really wants to go to trial anyway its too expensive and timeconsuming youre kidding when did that start farrell stood and walked over to the dart board from which he extracted hardys last round all twenties although if memory serves those pesky trials are the traditional way we establish guilt or innocence hardy chortled short dry mirthless uh huh and ive got this bridge id think that you wes of all people might harbor a little skepticism about that issue a few years before in a highlypublicized murder trial farrell had made his reputation as a defense attorney by getting an acquittal for his best friend who as it turned out and unbeknownst to his lawyer had been guilty as hell i should also think hardy went on that instead of this show of unseemly envy you would pause to admire the finesse with which your friend and partner has mastered the fine art of fattening the firms account and hence your own without having to resort to the tedium of hourly billing farrell threw a dart im constantly in a state of high awe hardy nodded there you go someone knocked and his door opened amy wu stood for a moment in the doorway all but gaping partners with darts she said now you know why phyllis guards the door hardy said i waited until she took a break farrell threw bullseye both hardy and wu turned the dart was nowhere near the center of the board made you look farrell said you guys are weird you know that wu looked at hardy i dont know if youre still interested in these things sir but ive got a question about a case you know the law ive heard of it hardy said can wes stay and listen wu cast a baleful eye at farrell if he can spare the time cant farrell said duty calls well whispers he threw his last dart and headed for the door hardy closed up his dart closet and went around behind his desk he stole a glance at wu as he passed her she projected at least the illusion of efficient competence but he wasnt fooled wus performance had slipped since her fathers death shed also missed a lot of work really an unconscionable amount for someone in her position but he believed shed make it up by the end of the year she was having a hard time and understandably all in all hardy felt that it was much preferable and far easier to pretend that all was well when thats what it looked like and wu certainly still looked the part of hotshot young associate she wore her hair short and cropped around her ears her alwayscrisp business attire couldnt be faulted besides with an iq of around one fifty wu could be firing on only half of her cylinders and still blow away a great deal of the competition or so hardy chose to believe certainly he didnt want to inquire too pointedly about her personal life that was neither his job nor his inclination but he was her boss and at the very least he should be awake to nuances that might affect her performance the real problem he knew was that he was having some nuances himself hed be damned if he was going to think about those much either but wu had missed another day of work on friday if she kept her absences at anything like this rate much longer she would have some difficulty making the firms annual hourly billing minimum he really felt he had to say something he sat back in his chair hands folded in his lap youve got a law question he said yes sir well before we get to that can i ask you a bit of a personal one her face closed up of course how are you holding up fine she answered automatically i noticed you were out on friday i saw a client in the afternoon the case i wanted to ask you about in fact ah he scratched at his desk i just thought that if you wanted some time off you could ask and get it you know even an extended leave if you felt you needed it sometimes thats a better idea than taking a day at a time piecemeal im fine really okay im not meaning to pry just making the offer the firm places a high value on you and your work and if you feel like youd be more productive after a bit of a break wed be happy to give you one thats all i dont think i need that im just working through some stuff sir she tried a game smile getting used to the new world order okay but if it gets tough and you change your mind you can come in here anytime thank you wu half turned her head to the door behind her but maybe you could mention that to phyllis first just in case a ghost of a smile played around hardys mouth you said you got by her this time yes but i cheated and watched from my office until she left her post and went to the bathroom hardy nodded his smile genuine now you know he said when david was still with us sometimes i used to do that too id be hiding on the stairs just out of sight and wait for phyllis to get up off her phones then id zip across the lobby and get inside davids lair before she could stop me she hated it it was great but i must say he went on since then ive gotten some appreciation of why he kept her around in spite of that slightly witchlike quality the gatekeeping does serve a purpose me im trying to emulate how david did things keep an open door but he didnt keep an open door exactly except when he did hardy came forward and linked his hands in front of him on the desk he always said that if it was important enough to make me figure out how to get around phyllis it was important enough for him it was a challenge and a question and wu nodded seventeenyearold kid up for double murder hows that if thats the case you wanted to ask me about id say its good enough hardy sat back his own face tightening down tell me about it wu settled into her leather chair and gave him the short version when she finished hardy didnt move for a while then he brought himself up to his desk ready for business you say the teacher was with this girl how old was he forty forty hardy said and laura sixteen what a lovely world and they picked up your client andrew when last friday hardy nodded so nobodys rushing to judgment homicide must have worked the case pretty well looks like wu hesitated also and you might find this interesting andrew bartletts stepfather is hal north is he now hardy no stranger to the power players in the city nodded with approval so where are you now well ive talked to boscacci theyve got a witness who picked andrew out of a lineup no question first try beyond that andrews on the record with half a dozen lies plus he stole his fathers gun a ninemillimeter automatic which in this case is bad luck oh and they found a casing in the car andrews car okay and the boys story he didnt do it he didnt even realize he was being considered a suspect until the police came and put the cuffs on him he liked mooney he loved laura when she mentioned the alibi hardy asked immediately without inflection anybody see him while he was taking this walk no sign of it what does he say wu shifted in her chair well i havent talked to him yet gotten his story hardy cocked his head you havent talked to him yet its been what four days ive been going over the discovery sir talking with the parents and negotiating with allan boscacci ive met andrew before i defended him for a joyride a couple of years ago and didnt see any immediate need to go and introduce myself again okay hardy said sorry to jump but the fact remained that in his opinion wu had slipped again one of the fundamentals was that you went and talked to the client but wu seemed oblivious anyway the point is that boscacci wouldnt have arrested andrew if his alibi held up and it doesnt the eyewitness all right but if they just hired you on friday whod andrew have with him all the times when he talked to the homicide guys since february nobody no lawyer anyway his parents saw it the way he did and really didnt believe he was a suspect they just let him talk and talk and talk hardy shook his head how deep a hole did he dig hes pretty well hit china well then it looks like youve got your first bona fide murder case congratulations i think if youve come to me for my imprimatur youve got it as managing partner hardy approved all of the firms new businessalthough im not sure youll wind up thanking me for it murder trials can kill you ive heard she said but im not planning to take him to trial no hows that going to happen i think youll be happy amy said my idea is to keep him in the juvie system how old is he did you say seventeen hardy sat back last i heard seventeenyearolds got filed adult around here mr jackmans been a little rigid on the topic jackman had very publicly adopted a very tough stance on juvenile crime a seventeenyearold whod killed two people did not elicit much sympathy from the new prosecutors in the das office youre telling me boscacci has already filed him juvie yes sir she paused after i told him andrew would admit but hardys expression grew perplexed hes going to admit how do you know hes going to do that you said you hadnt talked to him yet i talked to his stepfather okay all well and good but the one who pays the bills isnt necessarily the client hardy scratched behind his ear interrupted wu as she started to reply no wait he said and what if in fact he didnt actually do it wu came forward with some enthusiasm obviously feeling that this question put her on firmer ground he did though she said look we know homicide took two months building the case they played it slow and steady he did it sir and specials as an adult puts him in prison for the rest of his life hell admit to avoid that but you just told me he says hes innocent wu shook her head they dont arrest innocent people anymore its happened to clients of mine yes sir all two of them i believe right actually three well the exceptions that prove the rule three is more than an entire centurys allotment right there hardy wasnt really amused but he broke a small smile i hate to mention it but they were last centurys cases now were working on the new one when andrew sees the evidence against him hes going to get religion you watch i promise really sir this is a sweet deal for everybody i cant believe boscaccis going along to avoid the trial why not he gets two convictions out of this so he wins wouldnt you take the deal hardy thought if he were boscacci he might but depending on the evidence he might not though there was always an incentive among administrators to clear docket time a highprofile murder case often sought its own level and provided potentially positive intangibles such as name recognition for the politically ambitious and even if wus strategy worked it wouldnt be without its drawbacks wu sat back cocked her head spoke in a measured tone what im doing here sir is making sure that andrew gets out of custody in eight years instead of never hardy unsatisfied glanced at his watch all right he said getting up out of his chair he pulled some papers on his desk together im hoping youre right in every respect meanwhile ive got another client coming in so may i be so crass as to inquire about your retainer this is still criminal law and you get your money up front words to live by how much well she said the plea wont take too long to get processed i figured it was worth about five grand at the figure hardy stopped his paper gathering looked up with another question on his face worry in his eye even if everything went exactly according to wus plan and she was uncommonly lucky and hardy thought neither of these was a lock then she would certainly spend at least forty hours and maybe as many as sixty in the next week or so preparing andrew convincing him that it was in his favor to say that he was guilty of murder so that he could avoid being tried as an adult hardy had been doing a lot of math in his head lately and immediately sensed that five thousand dollars wasnt close to wus standard rate of an hour he punched at the adding machine in front of him it was worse than hed thought youre only planning on putting in thirtythree hours on this i figured that was about what it was worth she fidgeted with her hands opening her purse hardy shook his head so you were going to put in the extra time without billing it which would not only be cheating you but the client and the firm and she pulled the check from her purse interrupted his rebuke so i told mr north id take twenty down thousand that is she put the check face up on the desk hardy looked down at it up at her nodded okay wu he said youre starting to get it into the phone hardy said i would have bet your office was a veritable fortress of solitude i would have too but i guess not glitsky said i even thought of dusting for prints except everybody who works in the hall was here for the open house when i took office you dont have any idea who it was i cant imagine anybody whod take the chance i mean im the deputy chief they get caught theyre toast whod risk it hardy was standing behind the desk in his office the shades were down cutting some of the afternoon glare but his eyes were twinkling his color high hed had a martini and most of a bottle of pinot grigio at lunch at sams with a plate of sand dabs hed reeled in another client from the bottomless pool of troubled police persons and now for an unexpected bonus he was getting to console glitsky on the terrible breach of security in his office somebody moving his drawers around the way it was going hardy thought there was some small chance he could talk abe into paying him to put an private investigator on it but then glitsky said well it was probably some stupid prank anyway the opening was just too wide and hardy couldnt resist stepping into it i dont know abe there are some bona fide crazies in your building at least i might send a sample of the peanuts to the lab and throw the rest out you think better safe than dead how could i get dead around this i dont know was there any powder in the bottom of the drawer glitsky snorted yeah but theyre salted in the shell peanuts so the trained inspector in me thinks the white powder is probably salt and if it was anthrax its too late already did you taste it no just a minute yep salt hardy clucked your tongue goes numb in five minutes do me a favor and call nine one one and id still send some of the goobers to the lab you never know ill consider it you dont sound sincere you remember the song found a peanut the guy in that song died if you recall im serious thats what worries me that youre serious glitsky sighed can we leave the peanuts please i didnt call about the peanuts anyway all right its your funeral so what do you want i wondered what time you might be going home ive got a five oclock meeting with batiste that just came up and treyas got to be home at the regular time because ritas never mind the point is if youre staying a little late maybe i could bum a ride with you your driver ought to take you to and from work my driver works the day shift i come in too early and go home too late i think ive mentioned this to you before i probably didnt pay attention so what time glitsky said sixthirty or so and hardy told him it was his lucky day he had his own meeting after close of business with amy wu about this double homicide she was handling that would be andrew bartlett glitsky said it wasnt a question doesnt it get boring when you already know everything hardy asked but i bet you havent heard that boscaccis filed him juvie sure he did and next year im quarterback for the fortyniners ill expect great tickets but its true boscacci i mean silence then how did that happen wu is having him cop a guilty plea in exchange for juvenile sentencing and jackman agreed jackman who likes to say if youre old enough to kill somebody youre an adult that jackman the very same and ive heard him say the same thing but wu says its a done deal id make sure before i go real large telling anybody like the newspapers well thats what wu and i are going to be talking about so ill let you know the name youth guidance center or ygc had an avuncular ring to it as though the juvenile detention facility were some kind of a counseling haven for wayward children a rest stop filled with soft stuffed chairs and couches pastel colors new age music in the background and in reality in simpler times when the place was new it had pretty much been like that kids who stole hubcaps or smoked a joint or played hooky from school would wind up at the ygc and receive counseling maybe a day or so of lockup to impress upon them the serious consequences of breaking the law nowadays these relatively petty crimes never hit the radar of the police department juvenile felonies were commonly every bit as serious as crimes committed by adults so in todays san francisco the ygcs primary function was mostly to lock up seriously dangerous criminals who happened to be under the age of eighteen true the center had a suicideprevention watch it also held a few dozen abandoned or abused children while they awaited suitable outplacement to foster homes but in the main the cottages as the jail facility was called housed murderers rapists and a varied assortment of vandals robbers muggers and burglars most of the inmates were awaiting or in the middle of their respective trials or hearings which occurred in courtrooms on the premises just adjacent in the administrative wing wu hated being late this morning between boscacci and hardy she had also talked to hal north told him about her success with boscacci and scheduled what she thought might be a relatively lengthy appointment with the north family before the detention hearing they had a lot they had to go over she particularly wanted to hear more about the results of hals discussions on the admission issue with his wife and stepson about which hed been disconcertedly vague telling her that he and linda hadnt had as much time as he would have liked to talk because of an event they had to attend at the yacht club wu shouldnt worry though he told her hed have it all worked out with andrew and linda by the time they got to court this was wus first formal court appearance at the ygc and she had gotten lost on the way up then caught in traffic after the uphill halfjog from down the street where shed managed to find a parking place through the admin building and up the steep walk to the cottages she fought to catch her breath for a minute just outside the gate in the razorwiretopped cyclone fence a bailiff appeared in response to her ring and escorted her without a word into the building proper a onestory structure that reminded her of a cross between a military barracks and an innercity high school drab and institutional and depressing as hell she thought the bailiff led her to a pocked wooden door in the hallway and opened it sitting in an oldfashioned school desk in the opposite corner of the tiny room next to the one outside window andrew bartlett lifted a hand about an inch in a halfhearted greeting here she is hal stood to wus right leaning back against the wall arms crossed and clearly unhappy at last hal linda shot a frustrated look at her husband then turned and smiled at wu its all right youre here im sorry terrrible traffic i even gave myself an extra half hour she lied then showed some more teeth took a breath turned to her client its good to see you again andrew how are you holding up the boy dropped his head lifted it shrugged kay confident and prepared wu smiled at him good she said dont worry well get you out of here today linda piped in you think we can do that oh i think so really hal asked probably she said the hearing today is about whether they keep andrew here until hes sentenced and i dont see why theyll need to do that so what happens he asked what about bail wu shook her head no i thought id explained that juveniles dont get bail the judge either lets andrew go home with you and linda or he orders him kept here detained just like that linda shot a hopeful glance at her son one way or the other yes and in this case look what weve got both parents here showing support and concern a minor with no previous record who poses no risk of flight youll both watch out for him right she turned to hal then theres your standing in the community sir beyond that if the judge wanted more assurance im assuming youd be willing to pay for whatever private security even a twentyfourhouraday guard that the court could want to be sure andrew stayed out of trouble he wouldnt need that hal said no i dont think so either so i think but andrew finally spoke up interrupting her what do you mean sentencing dont you mean trial wus startled glance went from her client to his stepfather back over to linda thats one of the other issues were going to have to discuss i thought you might already have hal cut her off i was waiting for you to get here to what andrew asked just talk about the case what about it the evidence your plea like that what do you mean his plea linda her voice suddenly very sharp backed up a step so she could face both hal and wu together his plea is not guilty it has to be not guilty right wu drew a quick breath well as i said there are a few legal issues three sharp raps sounded on the door to the room and it immediately opened to the bailiff time he said lets go cant keep the judge waiting then perhaps sensing the tension in the room he asked everything all right in here fine wu said she turned to linda and andrew well have all the time in the world to talk about everything after the hearing itll all make sense youll see linda looked to hal for support i hope so but the bailiff had his job to do sorry but youve all got to move out he said hearings in ten minutes he looked at andrew youre going to want to hit the can first and quick cant he walk down with us linda asked no maam hes in custody rules out on the pavement walking down to the admin building wu broke the uncomfortable silence that had been holding since the three of them left the visitors room the main thing she said is that were all in agreement as to whats best for andrew hon hal stopped and put a hand on her arm we went over all of this yesterday i know but i thought it was more hypothetical all this about andrew admitting something but in there you both sounded like andrew is going to confess and then go to prison how can he do that wu forced herself to look into lindas eyes to feign a confidence she didnt feel the fact is we have to face that as an option if we plead him out as a juvenile then theres no life without parole hanging over his head but hes not guilty linda repeated she turned to hal we talked about this every time the inspectors came by with some new thing didnt we and then this terrible lineup mistake the voice wore down he just didnt do this hal dont tell me you dont believe that wu was fairly certain that she knew what hal believed and stepped in to save him i dont think we have to discuss the actual fact of whether hes innocent or guilty right now mrs north the issue is that he saves the court the considerable time and expense of a trial if he admits in return the da agrees hes a juvenile and he avoids the lwop lwop linda asked whats lwop life without parole thats what he would get as an adult north let out a snort but its moot for now anyway hes not charged as an adult today right linda turned to wu hes not no maam thats why were here having this detention hearing so we have a chance to let andrew go home for a few days we can get it all straightened out there hal said at home well have plenty of time there still unsure linda blew out in evident frustration she looked back up to the cottages wrapped in their razorwire dressing and her shoulders sank okay she said with great weariness lets at least first get him out of here thats the plan wu offered her a brave smile really wu sat at the defense table awaiting the judges entrance in juvenile court proceedings the district attorney was said to represent not the people but the petitioner and the person accused of a crime was not the defendant but the minor this nicety functioned to preserve the legal fiction that youthful felons were not lost causes the district attorneys role was not to prosecute miscreants but rather to ask or petition the state to recommend a treatment for the minor that stood a chance to result in the childs complete rehabilitation back into society even if that treatment was six or eight years locked up at the california youth authority or cya it technically wasnt the same thing as prison although its inmates might be hardpressed to elucidate the precise difference to wus left at the petitioners table sat her opposite number jason brandt not yet thirty brandt already had four years as a prosecutor under his belt all of it here at the ygc brandt had a full head of neatly combed dark brown hair and wore a wellcut dark gray suit with a white shirt and muted blue tie affable quickwitted charming even he smiled a lot and made it a point to get along well with everyone including the defense attorneys against whom he was pitted wu herself had long harbored a bit of a secret crush on him theyd shared drinks more than once although his reputation was that as soon as the gavel came down he was nobody to play with suddenly brandt lifted his head like an animal catching a scent he caught wu in the middle of her surreptitious glance at him and nodding genially went back to his papers wu made it a point to continue looking about the room which was smaller than most of the courtrooms downtown at the hall of justice but had the advantage of natural light pouring in from large windows set high in one wall beyond brandt a very younglooking uniformed bailiff sat talking to a middleaged woman whom wu presumed was the court recorder there were no jurors juvenile trials did not have juries and yet a nice jury box held twelve perennially empty chairs there was no one in the gallery on the prosecution side for the protection of the minors involved the public was not admitted into the courtroom wu turned around farther in her chair and gave a confident nod to andrews parents the sole occupants of wus side of the gallery hal and linda sat hip to hip next to each other on the bench behind the bar rail they held hands and seemed to be leaning into each other wus eyes went briefly to hal and he inclined his head an inch then raised a finger and pointed to one side of the room where the door had started to open wu turned at the sound and watched as the bailiff from the cottages ushered andrew ahead of him into the bullpen as andrew shuffled toward her now handcuffed in his shapeless gray prisoners clothes he seemed to her utterly defeated stopping in front of her table he raised his head to look at his mother his eyes opened in a silent plea lips tightened down over a frankly quaking jaw she was afraid that in another moment he might start to cry and to forestall that she stood came around her table and helped him get seated he doesnt need to be handcuffed she said to the bailiff whats your name nelson the bailiff kept his hand on andrews shoulder and replied in some surprise he played no formal role in this proceeding and it was decidedly unusual for an attorney to speak to him for any reason well officer nelson this young man doesnt need to be handcuffed it didnt matter to nelson one way or the other thats up to the judge he said he did take his hand off andrew however and stepped aside a few paces he stood leaning against the front of the jury box facing wu sublimely indifferent which was almost more chilling to her than outright antagonism would have been wu reached over and patted andrews arm its all right she said itll be fine he turned his face to her then farther around back to his mother again mom he said then couldnt continue tears threatened to spill but he blinked them back raw vulnerability took years off his age the idea of this pathetic boy aiming a gun at a person and pulling a trigger not once but twice suddenly struck wu for the first time as incongruous her heart went out to him while at the same time she was a bit relieved to see the depth of his despair he would probably have to hit bottom and see that there was no hope in pleading not guilty after they got to talk and she showed him the evidence hed realize the futility of pretending he hadnt done it when the truth must be clear to him if he dared to look at it objectively andrew wasnt stupid she glanced over at him one last time confident that he would come to accept that he had to admit if he wanted to save himself now in his early sixties judge w arvid johnson had built a reputation as a reasonable and fair jurist with no particular ax to grind irreverently secretly and universally called warvid by the citys legal community johnson took the bench today with little fanfare and no formal announcement by the bailiff or court recorder suddenly it seemed he had materialized up there seated behind the slightly raised podium whitehaired and faintly jocular he projected an amiable solidity after a businesslike nod to both counsel he said all right to no one in particular pulled his glasses down to the end of his patrician nose and asked the probation officer to call the first case when hed done this the officer listed those present in the courtroom including the gallery for the record and then judge johnson began mr brandt comments on detention yes your honor go ahead brandt stood up behind his table his voice sounded clear and relaxed in the small room your honor as this is a murder case the petitioner requests that the minor be detained hes here under juvenile jurisdiction the judge said sharply the district attorney has decided not to file against him directly as an adult i have to gather that that was done on purpose am i wrong no your honor not at all brandt took the rebuke calmly probably because he had a ready answer and a good one we anticipate that mr bartlett will admit this petition and receive the maximum commitment to the ya the youth authority hell still be confined here at ygc of course rather than downtown for a brief period since hes under eighteen but we anticipate a quick disposition on two counts of first degree murder so naturally the petitioner considers this a detention case planted in her seat wu was surprised when brandt thanked the judge and sat down hed said what hed come here to say short and sweet judge johnson nodded and turned ms wu wu tried to swallow but her mouth had gone dry she knew that brandt liked to keep his opponents offbalance and that one way to do this was to mess with their timing but hed still surprised her catching her in midthought with such a barebones statement detained end of story ms wu johnson repeated would you care to make a reply she got to her feet im sorry your honor i was just she stopped herself willed her mind clear and started again your honor before we go any further id like to request that the handcuffs be removed from my clients wrists request denied i dont believe this hearing will take enough time to make the exercise worthwhile detention has been requested by petitioner johnson pulled his glasses down to the end of his nose and peered over them this is a double murder were talking about we detain on murder cases yes your honor i understand that wu said but mr bartlett can by no stretch be considered a danger to the community over at his table brandt cracked as long as we dont give him back his gun johnson whirled on him thats enough of that mr brandt im sorry your honor brandt said i was driven to it johnson frowned be that as it may see that it doesnt happen again yes your honor but no doubt as hed intended brandts interruption had blindsided wu again shed lost her focus and stood waiting for the judge to say something go on ms wu johnson said she threw a fast look over at brandt who let his mouth twitch a pastiche of a smile wu glanced at her client then back to johnson and finally found the thread your honor the fact remains that andrew is a minor not an adult a minor with no previous record your honor if i may brandt up again i spoke to mr boscacci on this very point not an hour ago and he informs me as ive already indicated to the court that he did not direct file as an adult based on the anticipation of a quick admission your honor wu said my client has no criminal history he does now brandt said johnson stared hard at the prosecutor a warning coming back to wu he pushed his glasses back to the bridge of his nose ms wu this hearing is concerned only with the continued detention of mr bartlett and im not hearing any argument from you on why i should overrule the petitioners suggestion your honor wu took a breath my client has been living a normal life for two months since these murders took place he has known hes a suspect for most of that time and has caused no civil disturbance of any kind nor has he tried to flee true johnson said but surely you are not arguing that knowing youre a possible suspect and actually being an arrested suspect are the same thing are you no your honor but his parents are here in the courtroom today waiting to take him home there is no reason they shouldnt be able to do that surely there is no risk of flight he has another two months in this school year and hes an excellent student surely he poses no worse danger to the community than he has for the past two months while hes gone to school and lived at home johnson showed nothing wu supposed hed heard the same argument a thousand times he straightened at the bench turned to the prosecutor counselor brandt stood up slowly turned to look past wu squarely at andrew bartlett then shook his head suddenly he pointed a finger at andrew his voice took on an edge thats not somebodys good little boy sitting over there thats a man whos killed two people already this year and the district attorney is not going to give him a chance to hurt anyone else andrew started to come to his feet but i didnt he cried out yes you did brandt shot back you damn well did the judge cracked down his gavel ms wu no more of that from your client mr brandt im warning you for the last time no more outbursts do you hear me you address your remarks to the bench yes your honor im sorry youve been sorry before too dont let it happen again johnson made a notation in front of him and came back fixing wu with an impatient and angry glare as if shed been the one abusing the courts protocol minor is ordered detained johnson said bailiffs take him back to the cabins and with that johnson tapped his gavel stood and made his exit out the back door to the courtroom so abrupt was the decision and johnsons disappearance that for a minute a dead calm settled over the courtroom wus hand went to her stomach where she felt a deep and sudden hollowness behind her she heard linda saying thats it that cant be it theyre not letting him out then as bailiff nelson approached the table wait a minute andrew the boy whirled around in his seat to face his mother wu held out a hand to the bailiff please give us one minute all right in the gallery linda north had left her seat and was coming forward she was nearly to the bullpens railing and then suddenly andrew too was on his feet nelson though had reached him he growled uh uh and put a restraining hand on his shoulder with enough force to topple the chair and send him sprawling with his handcuffs on andrew couldnt reach out to break his fall his head hit the linoleum floor and for an instant he lay stunned what are you doing linda was now at the guardrail and she screamed leave him alone linda hal north too was out of his seat coming up behind his wife the other bailiff the younglooking one whod been talking with the court reporter before the judge appeared came from nowhere and insinuated himself in the space between wu and linda blocking the mothers access to her son take it easy he said holding up both his hands easy thats enough enough then he turned to nelson you too ray ill take him i got him nelson said with some heat go easy then the second bailiff retorted its okay mom im okay andrew from the floor i got caught offbalance thats all im fine on either side of him the bailiffs seemed to have worked out their turf differences and now raised andrew to his feet let him go wu said you dont have to manhandle him the second bailiff turned and looked at her up close she saw that the face youthful and innocent from a distance was heavily pockmarked and held a pair of gray old empty eyes wu thought that in spite of his relatively few years the officer had already worked in the system long enough to become inured to the innate horror of it he was a jailer plain and simple a zookeeper and yet hed almost apologized to her and still appeared more humane than his partner for all that no ones going to hurt your client he said but wu checked him thats already happened i want that bump on his head looked at right away ill be along to see him in a few minutes and i want him to have seen somebody by then is that clear wu included them both in her sights and while were at it officer she said to the second bailiff whats your name cottrell he said ray cottrell she wrote it down on her legal pad looked up again at both of them with a question you just called him she motioned to nelson you just called him ray thats what his mother called him too what about it nothing wu realized and said im holding you both responsible her threat didnt much instill the fear of god in either of them the two men unmoved shared a glance but then it was nelson who touched andrews shoulder and said lets go easy andrew threw his mother a last look of despair then turned and started walking with the bailiffs back toward the lockup wu had been an attorney for five years during that time shed mostly done litigation work for freemans firm mixed with a steady if unexceptional flow of criminal cases that she picked up in the usual way the socalled conflicts cases she was on the list for court appointments and once a month she would appear in court while a succession of criminal cases were called and doled out mostly to the public defenders office every few cases though there would be more than one defendant accomplices in robberies or drug deals in these cases the public defenders office could not take on more than one of the defendants it would be a conflict of interest and so the court would appoint one of the onhand lawyers sitting in the courtroom on conflicts day to represent the other defendants in this way wu had represented a wide variety of clients and gotten what she had thought until today was a wellgrounded schooling in the nuts and bolts and even some of the intricacies of criminal law but shed never been assigned to a murder case never before had she confronted such a serious charge in fact until this weekend no criminal client had ever paid her directly her fees in the conflicts cases were paid by the court she was standing on new ground now and finding that it shook perilously under her feet shed blown her first skirmish badly illprepared and overconfident shed foolishly failed to prepare her clients for the worst in part because she didnt believe that the worst was going to transpire in her experience thus far deals were always a possibility now out in the hallway with the norths wu spoke up right away a stab at damage control ive got those bailiffs names and badge numbers and i want to assure you both that im going to file a complaint before i leave this building north spoke up i wouldnt waste my time andrew admitted he was offbalance the guy was just doing his job my question is what the hell just happened you told us youd get him out i said i thought it was possible it never seemed to get close to possible in there there wasnt any real discussion at all north wore running shoes jeans a blue denim shirt a corduroy sports coat but the casual dress was nowhere reflected in his posture or attitude the bulldog face was shut down expressionless the iceblue eyes fathomless it doesnt give me a whole hell of a lot of faith in all the rest ill tell you that hal linda put a hand on her husbands arm he kept his eyes on wu so where does this leave us im going to talk to the da wu said appeal the detention i would hope so north said i dont care what it costs i dont think the moneys the point sir well if it isnt that would be a first maybe ill go have a word with the man myself in an odd reversal wu looked to the wife for support but lindas eyes never left the door to the courtroom it was almost as though she still expected her son to walk out any minute wu came back to north that really wouldnt be a good idea sir look she said whatever the judge said in there the truth is that minors get out on serious charges all the time not this time he said no i know that linda spoke up so what do we do now before the fiasco in the courtroom wu had been hoping to get a chance to sit with andrew and his parents in the relatively comfortable environment of their home there she would show all of them the evidence shed already assembled from the discovery documents shed received that so clearly in her opinion would damn andrew if he went to trial as an adult with hal north in her corner and linda presumably already on board it would be the three of them against the son and wu would be able to orchestrate the talk that would result in andrews understanding that he needed to admit now with hal in a slowboiling fury at her failure to get the detention lifted with linda still woefully ignorant of the strategy wu had already put in motion and with andrew back in his cell wu realized that she had to change her plan on the wing if they all sat down together right now in andrews cell or anywhere else the threetoone odds in her favor would be closer to threetoone against with hal quite possibly unwilling to argue with his characteristic force for the need to admit and linda and andrew dead set against the dynamic had become completely skewed her best bet now as the most committed to her position was to take on andrew one on one win him over as shed won his stepfather the day before andrew didnt need to hear lindas arguments why he should consider the feasibility of an adult trial on the really very unlikely chance that he would get acquitted he didnt need that kind of support he needed to be frightened and convinced linda repeated her question so what do we do now now wu said i think its critical that i spend some time alone with andrew he needs to understand what hes up against that hes here for the long haul hes got to see the evidence theyve got mostly hes got to realize that hes in the system and that he needs his lawyer more than he needs his parents right now you dont think we should see him linda clearly didnt like the decision i mean while were already here this is a good time for us you can visit him anytime mrs north anytime you want but right now hes going to be pretty upset with me as i realize that both of you are i need to try to make that right with andrew though as soon as i can so we can begin to cooperate and work together she looked from hal to linda look i dont blame either of you for being frustrated but in a sense the hearing in there didnt change anything andrew still needs to be clear on what he needs to do she threw what she hoped was a meaningful glance at hal that hasnt changed i really think both of you need to talk so the next time youre with him you present a united front so were all saying the same thing she waited holding her breath from lindas perspective she knew that her words were probably close to indecipherable but she hoped that hal would understand her allusion and step in and he did shes right hon he said you held his hand all weekend he doesnt need any more of that now he needs some solid advice legal advice and amy here is right we need to talk too you and me about what this whole plea business at the mention of the topic again lindas eyes went wide with surprise perhaps with anger but hal cut off her reply i just said it needs to be discussed its complicated i dont even like the sound of it linda said wu stepped in thats why i think its important that both of you talk meanwhile this is when i need to go up and see andrew linda stood still for a moment then nodded turned and without another word walked off hal hung back another second dont fuck this one up too he told her then whirled and jogged after his wife but before she went up to see andrew wu knocked at the door to johnsons chambers and was told to enter he was out of his robes now standing at the side of the room a golf club in his hand ah ms wu just one second a black plastic contraption with a little blue flag in it popped a golf ball back across the rug right to his feet and he stopped it with his putter what was it wu thought with men and these games in their offices she got right to her point your honor im sorry to interrupt you but youll want to know what happened in the courtroom just after you left the bench when she finished her description of andrews mistreatment johnson sighed with resignation my bailiffs i call them my two rays of sunshine its a very little bit of a joke he leaned to pick up his ball pocketing it replacing his putter in the golf bag next to his desk he turned back to her and was all business ms wu he said i realize you must be a bit disappointed at my ruling in there although i dont know what else you could have possibly expected but given what you just told me that mr bartlett himself admitted that he got offbalance and fell what do you expect me to do the bailiffs are there to keep order in the courtroom sometimes right after a prosecution verdict for example or a ruling like today that takes some physical restraint youd be surprised ive seen kids turn on their lawyers even rush the bench it happens the bailiffs have to be if not primed for action then at least in a perpetually aggressive state of mind you said your client was getting up turning to get in physical contact with his mother that cant be allowed to occur your honor did you see mrs north she was coming up to hug her son she wasnt going to slip him a weapon maybe not but you sure cant treat people differently depending on what they look like can you it sounded to me like officer nelson applied a little force and your client lost his balance and cottrell if anything it sounds like he took your side wu shrugged i dont know if id go that far it wasnt like what had happened bothered him he just wanted to avoid the hassle getting any bigger right johnson raised a finger thats because officer cottrell knows how to keep things under control up here you know why cause hes been on the other side at wus questioning look johnson nodded this isnt a secret hes been featured in several articles when he was a kid he was at that same table as your client next to a defense attorney very much like you hes spent time in the cottages so he knows how it works up there the bailiffs done time he nodded juvenile time he slid from a bad foster care situation into the juvie system but hes the success story why we do this complicated fandango around rehabbing kids as opposed to punishing them sometimes it works often enough to make the effort worthwhile wu thought back to the courtroom to the look shed gotten at cottrells eyes with their strange flat affect shed attributed it to a boredom with the bureaucratic routines of his job but johnsons remarks struck a deeper chord the longterm denizens of the legal system had learned out of a sense of selfpreservation to live below the radar johnson reading her mind said most of these guys they know how to get by here youd be surprised how many juvenile veterans of the system get out and then when they grow up want to work in it its where theyre comfortable they know how things work so if somebody like cottrell goes proactive around a situation like today in the courtroom my bet is its because he wants to keep things on an even keel between nelson and your client not because hes some superaggressive sociopath i didnt say that your honor i didnt even imply it but the one bailiff the other one nelson it wasnt as innocent as all that i thought youd just want to know i do want to know johnson said of course i want to know and im grateful that you thought to come and tell me this time wu got to the attorney visiting room before andrew and so had a moment to take in some of its admittedly unpleasant flavor it reminded her of nothing so much as the deans office at her old high school linoleum floor pitted green metal table in the center of the room cork bulletin boards on both sides a gray filing cabinet that one window by the oldfashioned onepiece desk that andrew had used earlier a faint smell of disinfectant and sweat andrew came to the door escorted by a bailiff wu didnt recognize he wasnt handcuffed though and after hed taken a step inside the small room he stopped his head turning quickly from side to side wheres my mom he asked not here wu kept the explanation unadorned he let out some sort of disaffected grunt shook his head shrugged and slouched over to his desk throwing an arm over the back of it wu was aware that the bailiff had closed the door leaving them alone she looked back down to andrew who was busy barely acknowledging her he tossed the brown hair that hung over his forehead swiped at it with his hand when hed been in the courtroom hed appeared to be truly vulnerable and harmless here wu saw him in a different perhaps a truer light he was an angry young adult tall wellproportioned muscular traces of acne and a few days worth of stubble added to the picture wu asked about his head if it hurt where hed cracked it against the floor he told her it was fine staring down at his fingers he scratched at the desk the noise like a mouse scampering in drywall she continued to stare down and across at him until eventually he looked up brushed back his forelock again crossed his arms over his chest they held each others gaze so he said wu wasnt about to put herself through the same discussion shed just had with his parents neither was she inclined to start out on the defensive so she took a deep breath and came right back at him so heres the thing andrew with what just happened down there you might be starting to get the picture that youre in a world of hurt this isnt some situation where you pay the fine and do community service like last time and its all over this is murder this is as serious as it gets andrew started to open his mouth but i didnt she cut him off do it not the point right now i heard you say it in court then i heard it again from your mother just now maybe well get to it sometime what you did or didnt do for the moment though we need to talk about the evidence theyve got you know what discovery is yeah its when somebody finds something for the first time like columbus and america that kind of thing the little shithead was being wise with her she flared her voice harsh yeah thats right good guess she stood up grabbed her briefcase went to the locked door and knocked on it guard andrew tipped his desk over getting out of it what are you doing she ignored him knocked again guard wait a minute this time the bailiff cottrell came to the door his face in the barred window wu said open up and the sound of the key turning filled the room where are you going wait a minute she whirled on him i dont have a minute not for games you dont want to help me fine ill do it alone the guard stood waiting behind her the door now ajar no wait please wu motioned to the guard the door closed she turned around get wise with me again goodbye she said she pulled a chair to the center table hoisted her briefcase sat down stared at her client for a long moment eventually he righted his own desk squeezed into the seat waited an uneasy truce first she said lets talk about what youve admitted and see where we are after that you were in fact at mr mooneys the night it happened practicing for a play then sometime around nine oclock you left to walk around the neighborhood and memorize some lines you were having trouble with you were gone for about a half hour i was okay then when you got back you saw what had happened and called nine one one right wu came forward elbows on the table between them but you didnt wait for the police to come even though the dispatcher asked you to stay at the scene i was right down the street he shifted where he sat defensively and wu felt some gratification at least andrew knew that hed done something wrong that was certain i couldnt handle waiting inside with both of them there his voice rose more defensiveness what was i supposed to do they were just it didnt matter they werent going to move nothing changed in there wu sat back with an exaggerated calm crossed her own arms leveled her eyes at him okay then i think its time to talk about discovery leaving columbus out of it wu had her documents out on the table and she was popping andrew pretty hard with some of the facts they contained so you say here in this interview that you and laura were getting along great right wu flipped to another page shed marked then how come do you think lauras mother says you were close to breaking up i dont know he squirmed okay maybe we were having some troubles but nothing big having some troubles isnt really the same as getting along great though is it she pressed him so you lied about it why didnt you want the police to know thats pretty obvious isnt it then he added but i didnt know theyd talked to lauras mom thats not why you lied andrew she said its why you thought you could get away with the lie she paused then continued almost gently they talk to everybody andrew dont you understand that yet everybody family friends friends of friends neighbors acquaintances coworkers students teachers you name it and everybodys got a story when it doesnt agree with yours guess who looks bad but andrew was shaking his head still no way they can prove i did this he said i havent told that many lies maybe some small ones you mean like your car you call that a small one he threw a glance at the ceiling then leaned onto the back legs of his chair lifting then dropping his shoulders he stared into emptiness wu found her place in the documents read silently then raised her eyes to his when the police arrived andrew you told them youd walked to the rehearsal that night you remember that you dont call that a lie i couldnt have them go look at the car right then i went down to it after i called them you mean after your nine one one call yeah to get away from the scene i already told you i couldnt stand being in the room with them wu clasped her hands in front of her so instead of waiting just outside mooneys door for the police to arrive you walked what a block or two back to your car thats right and why again did you do that he moved his hair out of his eyes i already told you i bam she slapped down hard on the table between them cut the shit andrew right now she raised a finger and pointed it at him you went to the car to get rid of the gun and you lied to the cops because you didnt want them to look where youd hidden it isnt that it he stared at her openmouthed wu had truly frightened him now for the truth was that she hadnt read anywhere in discovery that andrew had ever mentioned the gun that night she had read nearly all of the eyewitness testimony and had come to the conclusion that hed just gotten rid of it and now his terrified visage verified that shed guessed right andrews hand again went to his forehead how do you know about that the same way the police do andrew they know there was a gun left in the room after the shooting and but how could they know it the upstairs neighbor told them whos he how did he know about any gun his names juan salarco another witness the cops managed to talk to also you might like to know hes the man who picked you out of the lineup i dont even know the guy she pulled some copied and stapled pages from one of her folders held them up for him to see you want to read his statement to the police or should i just give you the highlights but it wasnt really a question and she didnt wait for an answer he and his wife happened to hear the shots and right after they both saw you leave they saw me leave right after the shots she nodded both of em then theyre lying theyve got to be lying she had him running now badly scared and this served her purpose time to hit him again make him begin to see how really bad it was lying or not the fact remains that mr salarco did call nine one one from the phone at mooneys place she looked down at the pagesexactly six minutes and forty seconds before you called from the same phone and he later told sergeant taylor that while he was there making the emergency call he saw a gun on the coffee table which wasnt there when the first police unit arrived now she leaned forward her eyes boring into his do the math andrew only one person could have taken and hidden the gun and thats you you took it to your car to get rid of it later and thats why you had to lie and thats not a small lie its a whopper ray nelson escorted andrew back to his cell while cottrell led wu down the corridor in the other direction at the door to the cabins he held the door open for her thank you she said that turn out all right she stopped in mild surprise you werent in there too long before you wanted out he said sometimes thats a bad sign we just had to establish a few ground rules she said after that it went fine he was walking next to her on the short path that led down to the razorwire gate he doesnt want to admit does he theyd come to the gate and she stopped and turned to face him the walkway wasnt very wide she looked up into his face i cant really discuss that you know im sorry sure i understand he unlocked the gate pulled it open for her thats the hardest part realizing youre really in youre not getting out and going home with mom and dad yes well he held up a hand perhaps an apology if one was needed that hed made her uncomfortable just making conversation he said have a nice day ms wu realized that she didnt need to be such a hardass she extended a hand offered a smile im sorry my minds still back in there amy wu nice to meet you you too well im sure well be seeing more of each other ill watch out for your boy she briefly met his eyes id appreciate that she said he might need it thank you am i interrupting wu asked hardy looked up from the billing and utilization numbers report one of several similar management tools that norma gave him every week for his review and comments good enough numbers but numbers nevertheless he jumped at the opportunity to leave them closing the folder motioning with his hand i was hoping youd make it back today actually ive been back awhile hunkered down in my office wu motioned behind her i waited until attila abandoned her post out there probably a good idea he pushed his chair back from his desk stood up and stretched moved toward the bar counter you want some coffee a beer water a rare old bordeaux no thanks im fine just as well hardy said i dont have any rare old bordeaux david did though about this time of day id often come down and hed be halfway through a bottle of something outrageous you miss him a lot dont you hardy opened the refrigerator then straightened up he turned to her and nodded yeah i do then shrugging with some awkwardness he reached down and grabbed a bottled water turned back again so howd it go wu lowered herself onto the couch not perfectly im afraid the judge johnson detained him no surprise there it was murder they always detain i know but i thought maybe with his age and no previous record plus hal norths money if they asked him to pay for a private security guard for andrew anyway it doesnt matter i never even got the chance to argue that she paused again jason brandt the prosecutor he came out swinging and got all histrionic i guess it worked howd the clients take it they fire you she broke a bare smile not yet but every call i got this afternoon when i got back here i thought id throw up thanks for sharing but he grinned softening it so whats the status now well she said if theres any silver lining its a loud wakeup call for andrew the continued detention blew him away he thought north would somehow take care of it like he always has but when andrew realized that wasnt happening it gave me the chance to acquaint him with a few hard truths like like the evidence suddenly animated wu came forward on the couch it might have been the first time he actually realized why they arrested him so i went through what little discovery id seen which was a good start since it placed him at the murder scene with the weapon for example he didnt already know that she shook her head he thought hed gotten rid of the gun without having mentioned it to anybody which in fact he did but bad luck a witness saw it first i surprised him with what he must have done and sure enough he admitted it and this is to say nothing of five or six other evasions and outright lies or the id he didnt know hed been idd not the specifics though by the time i left him i believe he was getting a clue hardy sat back in his chair and how again is this a silver lining well it is she said it really is i want to believe you but traditionally its not good news for the client when the das got you nailed it is this time and why is that because andrew finally sees that they can put him away for life and thats good news maybe its semantics hardy said the meaning of good it is good it means andrews on his way to admitting i would hope so given the fact that youve already made a deal to that effect with mr boscacci havent you i didnt imagine that whole thing did i boscacci filing juvie all of that hardy chewed on the inside of his cheek added ruminatively although i still cant imagine why boscacci went for it wu curled a leg under herself on the couch because its all about numbers the public understands convictions jackmans gearing up for reelection if andrew admits jackman gets not one but two murder convictions on the books instead of a long messy trial with a sympathetic teenage defendant and a wealthy stepfather with ties to the media you would have done the same thing maybe but thats me and im notoriously softhearted right anyway i reminded allan how hard it is to get convictions san francisco juries blah blah blah i told him it was possible north might even be monetarily grateful at some time in the future for saving his son the extra fifty years in the slammer perhaps a slight exaggeration on my part i hope slight hardy said wu shrugged that away i dont think allan bought it anyway but he did buy the fact that this was a young mans crime of passion by the time andrews twentyfive hell be a different person rehabilitated by the juvenile system instead of hardened by the hard time and so on in other words you snowed him maybe i did pile it on a little but this is such a classically good move its actually got some moral underpinnings alway a plus hardy drank from his bottled water he put the bottle down on his desk took a deep breath let it out a longer silence settled in the space the plantation shutters over the office windows werent drawn and outside the shafts of early evening sun suddenly seemed glaringly bright in contrast to the muted office lighting finally hardy spoke i bet you can guess whats going through my mind her face tight with tension wu nodded but answered confidently enough ill be seeing andrew first thing again tomorrow morning and tie it up tight believe me he definitely got it by the time i left today he sees it hell admit im sure he will youre sure he will but allan boscacci thinks he already has is that right no not that he already has just that he will but boscaccis acted on that and hell expect you to do what you promised in return and i will andrew will hell see theres no other real option he already sees it im sure youre sure hardy cast his eyes at his ceiling brought them down and ran a hand over his cheek now he looked over at his young associate he knew that she was still suffering over the loss of her father laboring under who knew what other pressures the last thing hardy wanted to do was kill her initiative or micromanage her cases to death but for a moment he was tempted to have her call boscacci right there from his office clear the air with the das office at least let the chief assistant know that the deal might not be as solid as hed been led to believe later privately hardy could even plead wus pain and suffering to boscacci and this might somehow mitigate the consequences if things went wrong which according to murphys law they must since they could on the other hand he didnt want to send a noconfidence message to one of his bright young lights he himself had carved his own niche in san franciscos legal world by being somewhat of a loose cannon taking risks beyond those which he knew any responsible boss would have approved he strongly believed in the advice of admiral nelson always go right at em ask permission later thats what victorious sea captains and winners in general always did didnt they hardy gave his associate a last ambiguous look that mingled worry and hope and she responded with a quick bob of her head dont worry sir itll happen i tell you what wu he said im sure hoping youre right hardy parked on bryant street across from the hall of justice traffic was light and curb space so precious during the workday was everywhere behind him the sun was going down with a gaudy splash the usual sunset gale had started up off the bay and it whistled by the windows of his car throwing pages of newspapers candy wrappers random grit and other debris through the long shadows in front of him he checked his watch glitsky was ten minutes late hardy had paged him their signal before hed left his office he wasnt thrilled at having to wait it gave him too much time to think about what wu had done he pushed the knob in his dash turned up the latest fleetwood mac whod somehow managed to lift themselves off the oldies heap and get back in the game again wus situation it would play the way it played sorry im late glitsky opened the door and slid into the seat beside him lost in the music hardy hadnt seen him leave the hall or approach the car now he found himself mildly surprised by the sight of his friend in full uniform in the nearly dozen years during which glitsky had been the lieutenant in charge of the homicide detail he hadnt often worn his blues preferring instead the more informal look of khaki slacks usually a shirt and tie and almost invariably a flight jacket faux fur collar and all now glitsky was the picture of proper police protocol he wore the uniform his shield and decorations gunbelt and gun he held his hat in his lap at the moment and the rest of him and his gear seemed to take up more space than he had when he dressed more like a civilian hardy thought it interesting that even the face looked more at home and ironically less threatening with the uniform under it law officers were supposed to look authoritative and tough and glitsky with his hatchet nose cropped graying hair and the distinctive scar that ran through both lips looked like a working cop not like a scary citizen now the working cop fixing his seat belt shot a look across the seat saw hardys eyes on him and said what hardy turned the key in the ignition put the car in gear started rolling just admiring the fancy figure you cut in your uniform i cant seem to get used to it you catch the peanut thief he wasnt a thief he just changed the drawers somebody goofing with you maybe glitsky said knowing im such a big fan of practical jokes you are and to think that all this while i understood you favored the death penalty for practical jokes i do glitsky squirmed in his seat getting himself arranged these seats are too small for normal people you know that wouldnt one have to have a nodding acquaintance with normal to make that statement and if so how could you glitsky sat not exactly squirming but shifting in his seat after a bit he seemed to be probing with his right hand into the left side of his torso he took in a big breath and released it looking ahead quiet frowning you okay abe glitsky sucked in a breath again settled into his seat in another minute he sighed heavily my guts he said they drove another block or two in silence me i keep waking up hardy spoke without any preamble its not like i dont go to sleep after i drink myself into oblivion i do but then a couple of times every week i have these dreams always different but always with the same theme like somebodys closing in on me and ive got to shoot them but theres no bullets in the gun or the knife disintegrates in my hand or the cage theyre in the bars melt and then they rush me and i wake up i dont dream at all glitsky said but my guts hurt another block and they hit a light you ever think about seeing somebody maybe talk about it nobody can talk about it his tone made it clear this was glitskys last word on the subject the subject of course was the shootout since then each of the four survivors were suffering dealing in their own respective ways with the psychic toll of what theyd had to do gina roake whod been engaged to freeman when he died spent most of her time exercising in martial arts or shooting at the range her earlier and lifelong passion for defense work had all but dissipated and she came into work only sporadically she had completed a few hundred pages of a legal thriller that she said was going to expose the rottenness of the whole system hardys brotherinlaw moses mcguire previously a heavy but controlled social drinker had descended into a deep fog of alcohol he wasnt yet drinking in the mornings but hardy hadnt seen him close to sober in eight months hed gained thirty pounds he hadnt shaved or trimmed his beard and his hair hung down to his shoulders he and susan were having problems in their marriage hardy knew all about his own dreams his problems with motivation his feelings about the system he worked in the cynical machinations he orchestrated nearly daily the bibulous lunches then dinners then late nights he figured his problems too would pass in some ways the shaken foundations of his life seemed all of a piece with the world in general the terrorism and war and madness that were now part of the daily fabric and that for him at least hadnt existed since hed been in vietnam and that since those long ago days hed naively allowed himself to believe would never exist again and now abe and his guts nobody can talk about it glitsky repeated i heard you the first time hardy said then you worried somebodys going to find out someday youre not it crosses my mind from time to time its eating me up from inside as though to prove it glitsky pushed again at his side especially since my promotion they drove hardy said what does treya say nothing then i dont talk about it nothings wrong she doesnt need to worry about it ill get over it glitsky stared out the side window while pushing his right hand into his guts just above his gunbelt i dont understand this he said when bruce willis shoots somebody they roll the credits and everybodys fine hardy dropped glitsky a few blocks beyond his own house at the corner of lake and twentyfirst the deputy chief walked counting ten houses up to the address he stopped and noted the location of the garage to the side and a little behind the twostory standalone stucco house then he continued on the sidewalk and turned up the polished riverstone path that bisected a neat lawn up three steps to an unlit brick and stucco porch he stood on the landing and waited for a moment listening through the glass at eye level in the door he saw lights in the back of the house some shadows dancing on the walls he turned back and checked the street like glitskys own block it deadended at the southern edge of the presidio from what he had heard and read about the murder of elizabeth cary it had been just about at this time of day a week ago tomorrow still not exactly full night witnesses certainly could have seen something especially if they ran to a window as someone must have after hearing the enormous boom of amm handgun but no one had reported seeing anyone glitsky pushed at the doorbell the sound echoed in the house and a dog barked a dog glitsky hadnt realized there was a dog and didnt know if it meant anything still he wished hed read it someplace in one of the reports for a moment apprehension swept over him the feeling that he wasnt prepared enough for this interview that he shouldnt be here his role in the gunfight last year had forfeited his right to be here to be a cop at all it was just like he felt every day at his regular job deputy chief of investigations he didnt deserve to be where he was but then a figure was visible through the glass down the hallway glitsky put aside his own angst and stood straight arranging his face to show sympathy if the man he was about to interview was not a coldblooded wife killer then he was himself a victim whod recently lost his life companion to violence the door opened yes cary came as advertised he looked at least sixty was thirty or more pounds overweight and sported a thinning tonsure around a shiny dome of a head he wore rimless bifocals a white shirt and solid dark tie loosened at the neck glitsky knew that the man had worked as the head accountant of a mediumsized engineering firm located in embarcadero two for the past seventeen years from the look of him he didnt get out of the office much mr cary im deputy chief glitsky i wonder if you could spare me a few minutes of your time of course he said with a weary resignation then added sorry for no apparent reason he reached over flicked a switch and suddenly there was light in the living room and over the porch come on in glitsky stepped over into the house followed cary a few steps over to a couch where they sat the dog was a light brown mediumsized mutt with a lot of lab in him and he gave glitskys legs the onceover if youre not okay with dogs ranger can go dogs are fine glitsky gave him a little scratch behind his ears satisfied after a second or two ranger went over next to cary and sat against the couch his master began to pet him absently glitsky suddenly became aware of the smell of pizza just as cary said we were having some dinner but i wasnt hungry anyway do you need to see the kids too theyre back in the kitchen maybe after a while well see glitsky cleared his throat first i wanted to say how sorry i am about your loss you have my deepest sympathy cary managed to nod secondly i know that we the police havent made much progress yet but i wanted to assure you that we have no intention of letting up on the investigation he is out there and we still have every hope of finding him youre assuming it was a man then no i didnt mean to give that impression is there some reason you think it might have been a woman cary lifted his head and shook it no i was just reacting to what you said i have no idea in the world who it could have been he sighed scratched at rangers head im so tired of saying that but its true you had to know elizabeth she had no enemies really i mean nobodys perfect but she was a cheerful sweet he stopped blinked a couple of times finally completed the thought a cheerful sweet woman we keep hearing that from all reports sir and inspector belou tells me that the two of you were getting along as well no conflicts he didnt phrase it as a question cary shrugged then sighed there wasnt a trace of defensiveness about him we were a team he said thats how we always talked about one another i dont know what else i can say we may have had an argument in the past year or so but if we did i dont even remember what it was about we were a team he repeated we just lived a normal life glitskys original conception of this interview had been that he would start out slow and gradually grill the husband hard on his movements on the night of the murder and maybe find a hole in the story hed given to inspectors belou and russell but now in the small room seeing the man in such obvious allinclusive pain he found himself unable to get warm to the idea that cary was a killer i know the inspectors have gone over this with you sir but in the past few days i wonder if something else might have occurred to you some disagreement your wife might have had with i dont know a neighbor one of your relatives somebody from your childrens school maybe even something from a long time ago that you didnt remember in the first days of shock and grief that you originally didnt see as having any possible connection cary looked down at his dog stopped petting him and sat back on the couch he took off his glasses rubbed them on his pants leg put them back on no he said and shook his head what nothing im sure but he went on this really isnt possible i dont think but elizabeth does have i mean she did i mean hes still alive whos that one of her brothers shes got three of them but one of them ted is crazy he lives down south at lake elsinore he didnt make the funeral and hes what institutionalized no hes not clinically crazy i dont think just not completely right you know what i mean why dont you tell me glitsky had a small notepad out ted last name reed reed okay and how is he crazy i shouldnt say crazy thats just how we always refer to him he was born premature and always had lots of learning problems his iqs probably about eightyfive hes sad more than anything really i havent seen him in i dont know five years or more but elizabeth tried to stay in touch on his birthday and christmas like that thats the way she was she wasnt going to abandon her brother he sighed anyway i know she talked to him at christmas because she made the kids say hi to their uncle ted he yelled at us too glitsky looked up in surprise ranger ran over to the tall gangly boy of about fourteen hands in his pockets who had appeared in the hallway cary stood up scott he turned inspector this is my oldest scott hes sorry that he was eavesdropping scott inspector im sorry glitsky on his feet shaking the boys hand a good solid grip the boy even made eye contact nice to meet you sir cary raised his voice you other kids back there too in a second the two younger sisters were in the room both of them had been crying cary introduced them too patricia and carlene then apologized to glitsky again he waved it off and looked at the son so you were saying scott that your uncle ted yelled at you on this phone call yes sir i finally had to hang up on him what was he yelling about scott glanced at his father got a nod and went ahead all the presents i got what about them well he asked what id got for christmas and i started to tell him and go down the list like you know and suddenly hes all your mothers got that kind of money really yelling at me like if moms got all that money she could send some to him instead of spoiling us he turned to his father you think it might have been him dad no i dont know i cant imagine cary to glitsky now thats just the way he is he thinks because we have a little money we he just doesnt understand but hes really harmless i think just a little crazy hes a jerk the son said a total jerk carys face relaxed into something like a smile for the first time i cant really argue with that even elizabeth thought he was a pain in the ass and she liked everybody and he didnt come to the funeral glitsky asked thank god scott said no cary answered nobody could reach him so he might not have been down at lake elsinore i dont know i dont know if the other brothers have reached him yet i bet he did it the son of a bitch scott thats enough all right the rebukes tone wasnt harsh but it was firm and effective the boy still fumed but in silence cary turned to glitsky ive got an address and a phone number down there i can give you but id be very surprised glitsky shrugged you never know its worth following up ill go get it as cary went out to the hallway glitsky faced the children do any of you guys have any ideas of who might have wanted to hurt your mother the two young girls started crying again quietly ranger started whimpering around them and scott repeating over again that he bet it was uncle ted went over to join in the comforting glitskys own emotions began to roil and incredibly moved he had to look away for a moment then cary was back with teds numbers on a yellow postit he absently handed it to glitsky as he gathered his children around him telling them to go back into the kitchen and finish dinner then do the dishes and get going on their homework hed be in to help in a minute when theyd gone glitsky said youve done well with them theyre good kids all elizabeth he said im only here for decoration he sighed i notice the girls were crying again did something happen i asked if they had any idea of anyone who might have wanted to hurt their mother carys shoulders sagged thats just it no one could have wanted to hurt her he seemed to be searching for a way to express it more compellingly i mean she couldnt abide anything even remotely violent so what reason could anyone have to do this to her she refused to be in the same room with me when i watched law order because she said it reminded her too much of a murder trial she had to sit on a long time ago before i even knew her thats how she was so how could someone hurt a person like her it makes no sense but suddenly carys explanation had sparked a question what was this murder trial glitsky asked the one elizabeth was on i dont really know anything about it she didnt like to talk about it as i said it was before we were even together at least twentyfive years ago they found the man guilty and he went to jail you remember his name no i dont know if i ever knew it cary pushed at the bridge of his eyeglasses she really wouldnt talk about it at all it bothered her that shed been a part of putting this guy away forever she just felt tremendous guilt about the whole thing why didnt she think they reached the right verdict no it wasnt that mostly it was she didnt feel like she should have been sitting in judgment of another person even if he was guilty she wished shed never done it cary put his hand to his head and closed his eyes after a moment he opened them again was it here in san francisco glitsky asked a shrug i dont even know that for sure i think it must have been right after she got out of school college she went to santa clara she may have still been living down there maybe one of her brothers would know he pointed to the postit anyway ive included them in with teds number there but again he said i cant imagine his voice petered out it doesnt really matter anyway it wont bring her back will it even though it was a monday night by a little after ninethirty the crowd was four deep at the bar of the balboa cafe at the corner of greenwich and divisadero although the intersection had four corners and not three it went by the nickname of the triangle after the bermuda triangle where singles went to disappear for the weekend by ten oclock every night of the week the three major bars and the streets in front of them were clogged mostly with young professionals but also what gave the place its uniquely privileged character with the sons and daughters of the older generation of san franciscos elite society these people werent out slumming they owned the bars and restaurants and this was where they played with their friends but the influence and surface glitter drew a fast smart ambitious crowd local politicians music celebrities movie stars in town for a shoot or a party and of course all the others lawyers on the make lovelies of both sexes suppliers of different kinds of fuel and because so much juice flowed to this one spot a regular contingent of hangerson was also always on hand literally out in the street adding to the color two wellconnected extremely personable and relatively hip san francisco cops dan bascom and jerry santangelo had the best and most lucrative permanent assignment in the city eight to two they kept their squad car parked across from the entrance to the balboa a presence that only rarely required any muscle the two of them along with tommy amici the balboas chief valet hauled in cuban cigars tickets to every artistic cultural or sports event in the tricounty area business cards and introductions as though they ran clearinghouses the bay guardian had done a story on amici a few months before where he claimed he made eight thousand dollars a month to park cars bascom and santangelo also featured prominently in the piece refused to comment about their income or the other undocumented perks three and a half months ago amy wu had come here for the first time since then shed become one of the regulars tonight she had somehow claimed a stool before the nighttime mob had begun to appear in strength now two cosmopolitans down she sat sideways to the bar near the front door with her back held straight a lot of her crossed legs showed beneath her black leather miniskirt the noise wasnt jetengine level but between the canned music the buzz of the hundred or so customers in a space that could comfortably hold eighty and the televisions nobody here was sharing intimate secrets wu was half watching the giants game and half stringing along two guys wayne somebody and his friend the two of them couldnt seem to decide which one was going to make a move wayne wore a wedding ring and wu ached to tell him if he did come on to her that he might want to think about the ring next time but for the moment that was premature so far hed only bought her a drink wedged himself up next to her stool told her she was too pretty to be a lawyer only the thousandth time shed heard that one whatever it was supposed to mean so he was moving toward it but not there yet the crowd suddenly cheered and wu looked up at the tv one of the giants was in a homerun trot wu drank off half of her drink put it back down wayne had a fist raised as though hed hit the home run himself and under his arm a space opened in the press of bodies and she caught a glimpse of jason brandt as he pushed his way through the swinging door and he saw her flashed a genuine enough smile started moving in her direction in a minute really before she could do anything even if shed known what it was she wanted to do hed come up beside wayne pointed to wu and said to him excuse me thats my girlfriend and was standing at the bar calling over the bedlam to his good friend cecil to give him a double jd rocks then he turned to her still smiling hey hey yourself then to wayne hes not my boyfriend before wayne could respond brandt turned and looked him up and down are you married dude he asked and clucked disapprovingly then came back to wu that is bad form if hes looking to hook up the least he could do is lose the ring i wasnt trying to hook up wayne said i just bought the lady a drink im not looking for any trouble brandts own drink delivered in seconds was in his hand and he raised it to clink waynes beer glass then we my friend are on the same page can i buy you another beer he turned and yelled out over the noise cecil but wayne had already put the remainder of his beer on the counter and was gone brandt turned back to wu and cracked a grin predators scumbags got a wife at home with the kids and hes hitting on babes in bars there ought to be a patrol out for those guys publish their names and pictures in the papers wanna bet hes going across the street checking out the action at indigos suddenly he seemed to notice that wu wasnt smiling what thats what i want to ask you what are you doing jason chasing off somebody im talking to whats that bullshit he cocked his head you kidding you think that guy like wants to be your friend wus eyes flashed whatever he wants to be whatever i want him to be its none of your business how about that he drew his mouth into a pout picked up his drink and had some youre mad about today arent you this afternoon no he looked surprised youre not i would be she shrugged it was always a detention case i knew that going in okay so what are you mad about you are a little pissed off yeah i am pissed off you mean me chasing off that married dweeb his name is wayne oh excuse me wayne maybe you didnt hear me but i just offered to buy him a beer thats not chasing him off you chased him off you ever think about what if i liked him it never crosssed my mind did you like him i didnt not like him he seemed nice enough very strong if he meant that much to you i really am sorry i ruined your night you didnt ruin my night and thats not the point anyway the point is its my life and its got nothing to do with you brandt put a hand to his chest and i would be the last to deny it but all the books say you dont want to get involved with a married guy jesus jason he bought me a drink thats all thats not exactly involved its not exactly uninterested either did he let his hand however casually fall and rest upon any part of your body my shoulder one second leaning over to pay cecil that was all im sure but you notice i managed to pay cecil already without touching anybody did he tell you you looked good yes he did finally beginning to be worn down she broke a small smile he said i was too pretty to be a lawyer i love that like what they have an ugly contest to get into law school i know she said but guys say it all the time like its a compliment wow imagine that a woman with enough brains to be an attorney and yet not a total scag not even half a scag in your case not trying to kiss up or anything no calling me half a scag is not kissing up okay youre way less than even half a scag you planning to have another drink you buying one if you promise not to touch me youre safe she said for eighteen hundred dollars a month wu rented a twentybythirtyfoot studio apartment on the top floor of a large building on fillmore street north of lombard the unit was essentially one large highceilinged room with a small but functional open kitchen a tiny toilet and showeronly bathroom in the back corner a decent clothes closet the futon she slept on converted into a sofa during the day she also had an old upholstered reading chair next to an end table where she kept her magazines the only really nice pieces of furniture aside from a relatively new hightech television set were a japanese changing screen and a cherry dining table that her father had bought her when she passed the bar more often than not this doubled as her work desk the best thing about the apartment and the reason for the ridiculous rent was the windows two oversized ones along the fillmore wall and another couple over the sink and counter in the kitchen area from their vantage four stories up all of these afforded really nice views of marina park with the golden gate bridge off to the left marin county just a swan dive and a long swim away the builtin bookshelves on the opposite wall were filled to bursting with her cds and law books and a wide selection of hardbacks mostly nonfiction history biography political science but one shelf of novels a bright multicolored eightbyten rug covered most of the hardwood she kept the place neatly organized and very clean now wrapped in a heavy turkish nightgown she sat at her table with her briefcase open and her third cup of morning coffee in front of her the sun just up came in over the sink windows and sprayed the wall to her left shed been awake for fortyfive minutes had taken the hottest shower she could stand and gulped down four aspirins shed eaten a banana half a canteloupe and then three eggs scrambled up with soy and leftover rice two cups not demitasses but her old cracked mug of espresso the throbbing in her head was getting to the manageable state she thought but still she hesitated before opening the folder shed just taken from her briefcase she had picked it up newly transcribed interviews more discovery from boscacci last night shed never gotten to them instead like almost every other night for the past few months she had gone out to find a party for a moment there in the dead of the night with jason brandt it had almost seemed as though it would turn out to be more than that but by the time the alarm went off he had gone just as well she had told herself after the initial stab of realization that hed left probably just as well now that shed committed her client to admitting the petition against him she had a long moment of terror imagining that shed find something among this latest evidence indicating that andrew had not in fact murdered his teacher and his girlfriend she didnt believe it was likely but dismas hardys reaction had brought home to her the seriousness of the situation shed leveraged not just herself and her client but the reputation of the firm if she didnt deliver it would be bad finally she reached into her briefcase for the folder pulled it out and set it in front of her then opened it she sat with hal and linda at the dining room table again no sign of the maid this time the house was almost eerily quiet to wu after shed finished acquainting the norths with the most recent developments in the case she neednt have worried about finding exonerating evidence the new discovery was if anything more damning than what theyd seen so far the testimony of andrews best friend motives more about the gun tension between the couple was thick but transparent and to break it wu had asked if there was anything else about andrew that she might need to know you already know about the joyride linda said no wu replied i mean before that did andrew have any kind of history of misbehavior or violence anything like that no linda said nothing serious hal north cleared his throat well i said nothing serious linda snapped i didnt say nothing at all dont give me that look hal im not trying to hide anything im not giving you a look we just disagree about what was serious or not maybe it would be better wu interjected if you just told me everything and let me decide whether it seems important now or not i gather there were a few incidents years ago linda said literally when hal and i were first together what happened wu asked linda drew a labored sigh all right the one it was when i told him that hal and i were getting married i remember it was a saturday afternoon a nice sunny warm day and we had the windows open in the kitchen andrew was about ten and still at the age where he liked to sit on my lap you know she sighed again anyway alicia our daughter hals daughter really she was there too so we could all share the good news she stopped and what happened wu prompted her lindas lips were pressed tightly together as she fought for control he just he just lost his temper did he hit you when it became obvious that linda couldnt or wouldnt answer hal took over he hit her me alicia he went over to the sink and started throwing the dishes at us i took a couple of stitches in the face stopping him he touched a stillvisible scar along his jaw let out a deep breath it wasnt pretty but that was seven years ago linda said and it was my fault anyway i think i must have just been a terrible mother you are not but i was before you you werent there linda turned to wu you should know all this andrews father walked out on us both when he was three and i needed to work so i became a waitress then later a hostess you know beaulieu hal interrupted with real pride pointed at his wife hostess at beaulieu this was one of the citys premier dinner destinations and a magnet for the power elite wu wasnt surprised that linda bartlett beautiful witty and sophisticated had wound up with a highly visible job there but this was ancient history to linda and she waved off her husbands intended flattery anyway i was young and selfish and liked to have a good time i admit it though im not proud of it i had opportunities come my way and i wanted to take advantage of them anyway most of the opportunities came with men attached its okay hal she probably needs to know this its not like a state secret anyway linda sighed and continued in any event the men i saw often werent so nice to andrew and i didnt have the strength or understanding or simple will to do much about it so he came to hate the idea of my boyfriends she reached out a hand to her husband including hal im afraid at first at least he still simmers hal said maybe not at me specifically but linda remained defensive its just that hes got this mistrust he has trouble believing in people in general and thats me too my fault in the early years i was so bitter and mad at being dumped at the unfairness of the way my life had turned out i just wanted to make up for lost time and i took it whenever i got a chance andrew couldnt count on me so hes always expecting to be betrayed or abandoned or let down still wu asked to some degree linda admitted though kevin has helped hal added kevin kevin brolin linda said hes a psychologist whos been seeing andrew for how long all this time hal said on and off hes an anger management specialist fantastic wu thought a jury would love to hear about all these anger issues but she had to press on knowledge was power and she needed all she could get mrs north when you started to tell me about the day you and hal announced your engagement you made it sound like andrews tantrum was the first of at least a couple of incidents linda looked to hal who nodded and said alicias party he went on this was maybe three years ago alicias twelfth or thirteenth birthday party she invited five or six kids and we made her include andrew theyre only a year apart linda said anyway hal went on all the girls got into some playstation thing and evidently they all decided to gang up to beat andrew he shrugged i came home to a smashed bigscreen pieces of remote all over the place alicias lip was cut her eye linda came to her sons defense hes really passionate about video games thats normal enough nowadays but he also reads and writes beautifully hes getting solid bpluses at sutro and you already know hed gotten the lead in the play hals whole body seemed to slump his voice was deep depressed obviously he and lindas respective spin on andrews character traits was a festering wound and now here in front of the boys attorney its binding was unraveling he looked directly at wu he never laughs the boys just not happy in his skin he hates all team sports hes changed his haircut and color ten times in two years he wears torn tshirts with buttcrack shorts and combat boots the slab of hals face was a monolith of sadness persistent nearly pleading to wu linda started again he can play any musical instrument with strings on it but wont ever perform for anyone or take lessons wu had to call a stop to it i think i get the picture she said she sat perfectly still with her hands linked on the table in front of her the norths were avoiding eye contact with each other although hal caught wus gaze for a brief instant and rolled his eyes finally choosing her words with great care wu started to speak this issue weve got to deal with here is the likelihood of what a jury in an adult trial is going to do when confronted with the facts of this case the negative character issues we can avoid as long as we dont bring up anything positive what linda asked what does that mean its just a rule wu said character cant be used by the prosecution except if we bring it up first after that its open season do you think we want to go there mrs north it took her a minute but she finally shook her head i dont think that would be a good idea it was the first time that linda had acknowledged the basic problem that regardless of the facts the situation looked bad for her son wu played to that card no i dont think so either and that leads me to the really crucial question a quick glance at hal who nodded encouragement from what weve seen of the discovery so far and this means the whole gun question the pattern of lies to the police the eyewitness testimony and so on do you really think mrs north we should advise andrew to run the risk of an adult trial or try to talk him out of it if he decides to admit hal reached over and put his hand over his wifes it comes down to how it looks hon what a jury will probably do with the evidence they see linda sat with it for a long time finally she looked first to hal then to wu you dont think its possible that he actually did do this do you wu finessed her answer i think that eight years is a far far better sentence than anything hed be likely to get in an adult trial there are no other suspects mrs north andrew was the only person that we know was there when the murders happened and he had a gun and a motive another silence maybe we should let andrew decide hals voice was a whisper this of course had been wus goal all along when andrew got acquainted with the next round of discovery which she intended to show him today wu believed that he would be a fool to deny the hopelessness of his position and she did not think him a fool he would opt to admit with his mother opposed to that idea though urging him to fight for his innocence every step of the way he was much less likely to come to this obviously correct decision but if linda could be convinced not to object wu would have a clear field and convincing her client would be that much easier im going up to see him right after i leave here wu said maybe i should go up with you linda said i dont want to him feel like we think hes guilty that were abandoning him but lindas company was the last thing wu wanted when she made her pitch to andrew it might be better just to leave it to me mrs north this is really something your son is going to have to come to rationally and if youre there its going to be emotional if its just me his lawyer explaining that its not about guilt its legal strategy that will give him many more years of freedom hes at least going to look at it clearly then if hes in fact truly innocent and just wont admit no matter what well go to trial but if he doesnt think its worth the risk linda hung her head finally looked back up then that means he probably did it after all doesnt it well yes wu thought thats certainly what the evidence indicates doesnt it but she only said if he admits he admits thats all its about strategy not factual guilt or innocence hal leaned in his hand still over his wifes on the table its got to be his decision he repeated hes the only one who knows for sure another lengthy silence linda said but and stopped turned to her husband shook her head again finally she nodded q three two one this is homicide inspector sergeant glen taylor badge fourteen ten case number it is threethirty in the afternoon tuesday march th i am at the residence of mark and june ropke irving street with me are the ropkes and their son lanny caucasian juvenile aged seventeen lanny would you describe your relationship with andrew bartlett a he was is i mean my best friend q and how do you know him a hes in my class at school were juniors at sutro q did you also know a mike mooney and a laura wright a yeah mr mooney was my english teacher and laura was andrews girlfriend q okay did andrew talk to you about them a yeah he was a little jealous q andrew was of mooney a yeah q you want to tell me about it a all right him and laura andrew and laura i mean had been going out for about a year something like that a long time anyway then they got in a fight just before christmas break and broke up q do you know what the fight was about a i think it was sex q did andrew tell you that a kind of yeah i guess he was coming on pretty strong and she told him she wasnt ready for that yet so he got all pissed off sorry mad i mean and said she was just being a tease leading him on what was she making out with him for if they werent getting to that anyway it was a big fight and they broke up but then a couple of weeks later maybe a month before she got killed they got back together q did andrew tell you why a he didnt have to it was obvious but he did tell me he couldnt stand not being with her sex or no sex he was really in love with her q so what happened with mr mooney howd he get into this a he was directing the play and andrew and laura were both in it theyre i mean she was both of them were into drama so they started going over to his place together at night to do their lines and rehearse you know mooneys anyway one night laura told andrew that she wasnt driving back with him she was going to stay on awhile and do some more rehearsing and mr mooney would take her home q and what was andrews reaction to that a at first you know not much but after it happened again a couple of times pretty bad really bad i guess q in what way q female voice its okay lanny theres no hurry q male voice just tell him what youve told us its all right a he brought a gun to school q did you see it a oh yeah he showed it to me it was in his backpack it was a real gun and loaded q did he tell you what he was planning to do with it a yeah but he wasnt sure exactly q what do you mean a well he was carrying it around for a week maybe two i think just seeing how it felt you know he talked about killing himself mostly at first q but that changed a it just i dont know he told me he was going to find out for sure if something was going on with mooney and laura this was while they were broken up and meanwhile he sees her and mooney goofing at school all these little jokes they had with each other so basically it was this jealousy thing it was eating him up the thought of her maybe having sex with him after only teasing with him for so long i mean mooneys a grownup and andrew didnt believe theyd only be making out so he decided he had to find out for sure q and how would he do that a he was going to hang around after he told them he was leaving maybe make up some excuse and come back and catch them at it q and then what what was he going to do a well he said he hoped hed find out laura wasnt lying but if he caught them at something he hoped he could handle it he said maybe it would be a good idea if he didnt have the gun with him if he didnt maybe he wouldnt kill them on the spot he hoped he wouldnt do that q he said he hoped he wouldnt kill them a thats what he said although it was clear and sunny outside it wasnt warm by any stretch the small visiting room at the ygc felt to wu like a refrigerator she was gauging her clients reaction to his friends testimony and it seemed to have hit him pretty hard andrew was sitting back slumped in one of the hard wooden chairs at the table this time one elbow on the chairs arm and his hand over his mouth now he wearily dropped the hand shook his head this is bad she nodded correct he told me the cops had come and hed talked to them but he never mentioned anything about the gun you think lanny would have been smart enough nobody had to know about the gun its makes it look wu knew what it made it look like she asked you want to talk about the gun what about it well the guns kind of an issue you bring it to school and show it around not around just to lanny okay just to lanny although hes enough hell testify that you said you were thinking about killing laura and mooney and maybe yourself the gun is what you presumably would have used to do that so what were you thinking when you took it it was hals gun is that right his expression grew sharp i never said that no i know you didnt but another one of the interviews in here she patted the folder that held lannys transcriptis a discussion with your stepfather about when sergeant taylor asked him if he owned a gun and he said yes then went to get it and couldnt find it didnt hal ever ask you if youd taken it yeah he did and what did you tell him andrew gave her the bad eye okay then she said let me tell you you denied it maybe even pitched a little fit of indignation that hed accuse you of anything like that am i close she leaned in toward him over the table let me ask you this andrew why didnt you just put it back from where youd taken it if youd done that and if you in fact hadnt committed these murders dont you realize that you wouldnt be here right now his eyes werent quite to panic but they flicked to the wall behind her then to the corners of the room before they got back to her why is that she noticed that he didnt bother with the pro forma denial of the crime this time she let herself begin to believe that her strategy was working he was getting used to admitting the basic fact of his guilt because if we had the gun we could test ballistics with the slugs they recovered from the scene and prove that it wasnt the murder weapon she gave him a minute to digest this critical information then pressed on you told me you got rid of the gun i did do you think you could find it again no i dropped it off the bridge that would be the golden gate yeah wu checked a laugh perfect she thought i dont understand and i dont think a jury will understand why you did that if you didnt kill anybody with it i freaked out is all i told you when i got back to mikes mooneys and saw it there i figured the cops would be able to trace it back to hal and id be screwed and why is that i mean if it was the murder weapon his miserable look seemed to plead for her to understand i had to get rid of it but it wasnt the murder weapon was it i dont know i mean it might have been wu straightened up in her chair and faced him headon let me get this straight your theory of the crime and please correct me if im wrong is that while you were out taking a stroll and memorizing your lines somebody you dont know who or why knocked at mooneys door saw your fathers gun conveniently sitting out on a coffee table grabbed it and shot anybody who happened to be standing around thats it i dont think that good that would be a dumb thing to think but otherwise why get rid of the gun i told you andrew again cast his eyes around the walls wu could almost feel his panic searching for escape any escape finally he exploded slamming the table between them with the flat of his palm coming to his feet turning around trapped i already told you that he screamed dont you get it arent you listening to me i was freaked out i knew it was a mistake the minute i let it go suddenly his voice broke into an uncontrolled and wrenching sob he was crying pleading with her i mean theres mike and laura shot dead on the floor theyre dead my mind goes blank and i cant think of anything except to call emergency he gulped now for a breath tears streaking his face after that i dont know what i did except finally i turn around and theres my gun on the coffee table i cant leave it there can i i didnt think it out what i was doing i just did it didnt you get that at all andrew stood across the table from her hands limp at his side staring at her his breath still came in jagged gasps it was all she could do to keep from coming around the table and hugging him a knock at the door interrupted and wu crossed to it the unpleasant bailiff from the detention hearing nelson had heard a noise and was wondering if everything was all right she noticed he had a grip on his mace and she held up her hand palm out were fine when the door had closed and she turned around andrew was back in his chair leaning over his face down by his knees his fingers laced over the back of his head she went to his side of the table boosted herself onto it folded her own hands in her lap and waited he was still taking deep labored breaths but gradually they slowed and eventually he looked up seeing her so close nearly hovering over him he pushed the chair back six inches then hung his head again perhaps in shame im sorry he said im so sorry he brought his hands to his face said oh god and broke again a sob that seemed to sound the death knell to all the hopes of his childhood someone else witnessing the breakdown hearing the same words might have reached a different conclusion but to wu it ratified all of her preconceptions shed been expecting something like this andrews show of remorse for what hed done to her the apologetic words sounded exactly like an admission of his guilt she pushed herself off the table and went up beside him put a hand on his opposite shoulder and pulled the close one against her hip its all right she whispered its okay through the wired windows steep shafts of sunlight mottled the floor struck the backs of both of them the tableau held for nearly a minute an eternity in that setting andrews breath became more regular wu herself was nearly afraid to breathe hyperaware of the possible implications of the scene this proximity was unprofessional prompted at first by a genuine sympathy she remained out of an awkward desire to appear natural some small despicable part of her was also aware that even such a slight physical gesture a hand on his shoulder her hip against him might work to her advantage in the next phase of their negotiation finally he raised his head so what am i going to do she moved away a gentle extrication leaning back now against the table she didnt answer right away i dont mean to put you through any more agony andrew god knows youve got enough to deal with as it is but i needed to make you see and see very clearly some of the really powerful and convincing evidence that theyve got against you but its still please let me go on she paused count the ways she said theyve got an eyewitness someone who saw you at mr mooneys that night both before and after theyve got motive and lots of it your gun was there you were there walk or no walk theyve got the testimony of your best friend showing premeditation theyve got the gun that you threw away when if youd saved it it could have proved you innocent all this and then theres all the rest of their discovery we havent even seen yet lauras mothers testimony mr mooneys colleagues and associates forensics and medical reports your lies to the police she stared fixedly at him what if a jury doesnt believe all that he asked they dont have to believe all of it she kept her tone soft but let me ask you one andrew what part of it isnt true he bit at his lip ran his hand back through his hair wu drove home another point and even if a jury drew a slightly different conclusion from all this evidence say they came back with some lesser offense say second degree murder or even some kind of manslaughter youre still best case looking at a minimum of ten and maybe up to thirty years but none if i got off no she agreed not then but think about what weve just been over in the past two days thats just a part of what the prosecution is going to present think of how youd feel if you were on your own jury and heard what they were going to hear so youre saying it doesnt matter whether i actually did it or not of course it does its critical to who you are to the person youll be when you get out im just asking you to consider your alternatives with great great care weve got a hearing tomorrow and i have set it up so you can be done with all this and out of custody with your whole life ahead of you in no more than eight years i know that seems like forever right now but youll still be a very young man believe me with everything to live for but eight years she nodded no ones pretending this is an easy call i understand that talk to your mom and to hal if you want get their opinions my mom and hal he said with withering dismissal my mom and hal what are they going to tell me and whatever it is why should i listen they live their own lives if you havent noticed theyre not interested in mine thats not true andrew your mothers been in here to visit you every day so far hasnt she she loves you she wants whats best for you ive just come from seeing them yeah and what did she say she said this was your decision andrew snorted see shed love it if somebody else took care of me for eight years itd leave her and hal freer to party wu sat back shook her head i dont think thats true she said but its really neither here nor there whats important is that youve seen how hard it is to control the way evidence comes out what it looks like your friend lanny your own mistakes in talking to the police so you really dont think you can win wu empathized with his despair but it would be a disservice to sugarcoat his predicament i will try with everything in me andrew youre free to get another lawyer if you want but i promise you that i will live and breathe this case for as long as it takes if you decide to go as an adult but i want you to have a clear understanding of what were looking at it will be a long haul with no guarantees how long she drove in yet another nail it might go as long as two years before we can get to trial maybe eighteen months if were extremely lucky and all that time youre in custody anyway theres no bail so youre right here until youre eighteen and after that probably at the county lockup downtown two years he swallowed his eyes pleading two more years id try to speed it up of course but thats about the average wait even if i didnt do it even if they found me innocent im afraid so either way im sorry bailiff nelson again picked up andrew at the door to the visitors room if judge johnson had reprimanded him over his conduct in the courtroom after the detention hearing or even discussed it nelson gave no sign of it wu watched the two of them trundle off to wherever andrews cell was located back in the confines of the building she thought that having a goon like nelson monitor hell shadow your every move must be one of the most debilitating things about confinement here in the womens room down in the main admin building she fixed her makeup then found she had to gather her emotions for several minutes andrews disaffection with his parents had bothered her more than she could allow herself to show it so closely mirrored her now forever unresolved ambivalence about her own father how much had he really cared about her now she would never know maybe she thought andrews approach was healthier just go on the accumulated evidence of absenteeism and benign neglect and admit that there is no profound connection if you really believe that there is no parental love at all you dont spend any time searching for it either in your parents or in surrogate and successive sexual partners you dont keep trying to please them to live off the crumbs of praise or approval that you can then falsely interpret as a proof of their affection for you their esteem her next stop jason brandts office added to the volatility of the emotional mix she knew that she had to have a talk with the prosecutor and didnt want to acknowledge their physical intimacy of the night before in any way and though she might have preferred to believe for a moment last night that they actually had potential to connect as people brandt had put the lie to that by getting up and leaving soon after the sex proof positive she knew shed done the same thing herself that all it had been was physical two consenting adults thank you very much in fact rather than signal any kind of openness to see each other again she thought this might be a good opportunity to score a few professional points a payback for the grief shed taken from him in the courtroom yesterday brandts work space was a reconverted closet that held his desk and chair a bookshelf and nothing else the door could only be closed because somebody had sawed several inches off the corner of the desk one window high up and tiny provided neither light nor view a bare lightbulb hung from a cord four feet above his desk brandt was behind the desk crammed amid his books and filing cabinets the place was literally overflowing with binders case files periodicals for a moment while wu stood in the doorway he didnt look up when he finally did in the first two seconds his face contorted through several iterations of arrangement he was glad to see her he wasnt sure why she was here some kind of hope that they might get together again if it was that wu moved to quash it immediately dont worry im not stalking you i was just up visiting my client and wanted to ask you if you thought i could get a little more time to plead him out brandts face instantly grew stern why wu had decided upon a plausible explanation im having a slight problem with the parents i doubt boscacci would mind he would i talked to him just before the hearing yesterday and he was the soul of inflexibility really thats funny because when i talked with him he didnt seem awfully concerned about timing provided andrew admits right which he will shouldnt that be has tomorrow thats will beyond that im talking only a few days grace grace courtesy whatever word you want brandt leveled his gaze at her the word i want is now amy anything beyond now meaning tomorrow at the hearing first thing he admits anything else makes me nervous as hell why youre kidding right he stood up abruptly coming out from behind his desk excuse me he said squeezing past her looking both ways down the hallway what are you doing his voice was quiet yet urgent im making sure nobodys out here to hear us thats what he turned and faced her you ask me why im nervous if we get delayed do you remember anything about last night whats that supposed to mean he lowered his voice still further it means that when i walked into the balboa last night and saw you sitting at the bar you were a woman i had wanted to get to know for a long time the case we were both handling was settled so we wouldnt be squaring off in court anymore we could do whatever we wanted now youre telling me it might not be settled and you knew this last night and still you let us go ahead it wasnt just me if you remember jason no it wasnt but youre the one who knew we might not be finished in court if what happened with you and me gets out at all andor if this thing with bartlett gets delayed its my ass dont you realize that its my job and you knew it all along the strength of brandts reaction caught wu off guard no but if i did could you blame me after how you treated me in court he stared at her in shock i dont believe this youre telling me you set me up on purpose whats next you blackmail me for your silence about us come on jason youre overreacting it wasnt like that brandt said aloud to himself ive got to call boscacci im out of this right now then he looked at her with a new flash of insight but if i do that then you win too dont you you get your delay you knew this going in didnt you youve just been playing me no thats not true i but he wasnt going to be listening to any more excuses in a fury he put a finger to her face dont you dare try and sell me on whats true or not not after last night you may have gotten me okay you win one but thats the last time i swear to god the last fucking time he stepped back into his office and closed the door in her face glitsky had meetings all morning the first was the bureau lieutenants meeting held in department a courtroom on the second floor of the hall of justice that happened to be dark for the day since there were thirtytwo lieutenants within the investigations bureau and each was expected to present a short report on highlights in their respective bureaus since last weeks meeting this one tended to run long glitsky sat up at the judges bench and after his initial remarks reiterating his stand in favor of quantifiable progress in police duties arrests made citations issued investigations instigated victim assistance and followup and so on for almost two full hours he listened and took notes on everything from the auto detail and home burglaries to homicide and hate crimes from arson and the general work detail to bomb investigations and the gang task force from narcotics and vice to sexual assault domestic violence and psychiatric liaison all of this was numbing and tedious and glitsky suspected not really necessary in the long run he thought that within a few more months hed be able to let these meetings slide once he had clearly delivered the message to his bureau chiefs that investigators needed to make arrests take bad people off the street that was the basic job patrolmen in uniform made the vast majority of arrests inspectors followed up to put the finishing touches on these cases but the real inspectors job was to solve cases to assemble evidence and make arrests based on investigating crimes when no arrest at the scene was possible the new policy was showing signs of bearing some fruit but nine of his bureaus had not made one arrest in the past week there was still work to be done nevertheless there had been a total of eightyfour arrests in that same period up from seventyeight the week before this he supposed could be construed as progress but mostly the cynical part of him believed it would turn out to be simply the manipulation of numbers or cleaning out old solved cases that they hadnt gotten around to filing yet speeding up the pipeline a little to rig the stats after the meeting he stayed behind a moment with lanier of homicide passing along the postits with the names of elizabeth carys brothers lanier might particularly want to have one of his inspectors on the case pat belou or lincoln russell check out ted reed the crazy brother who lived down at lake elsinore if hed been in san francisco last week it might turn out to be something by tenfifteen he was up in chief batistes office for a meeting of the benefits board where he listened for another hour to the citys director of human resources talk in excruciating detail about the latest proposed improvements to the police departments pension and retirement plans and its health and life insurance benefits like what should be the deductible on sexchange operations like should alcoholism automatically be presumed to be a jobrelated illness entitling the officer to a full disability retirement for onthejob injury at eleventhirty he was driven to the mayors office smiling was a form of torture for glitsky but for most of another hour thats all he did while photographers took his picture with other local vips and the members of a russian delegation here to explore business opportunities in the city by the bay as far as he could tell there was no other reason for him to be present except that the mayor apparently believed that the russians tended to be impressed by the presence of highranking beribboned officers in uniform his driver sergeant tony paganucci nagged him about getting some lunch wasnt he supposed to try and meet up with his wife and clarence jackman and some other folks at lou the greeks but glitsky had run out of time he absolutely had to be back at the hall of justice for a one oclock press conference and that was in twentyfive minutes paganucci dropped him behind the coroners office glitsky came into the hall through the back door taking the stairs two at a time for his only exercise of the day rather than the elevators where someone would want to talk to him about something he breezed through the outer office unmolested in the office adjacent to his own the deputy chief of administration bryce jake longoria a whitehaired softspoken patrician was in uniform sitting at his desk working at his computer glitsky stopped in the doorway until longoria looked up smiled gestured at his monitor just trying to get some real work done squeeze it in during lunchtime i hear you id try the same strategy if i had enough time to boot up my computer which i dont glitsky took a step into the room but i do have a quick question for you if you can spare a minute one shoot say you know the name of somebody who served on a jury fifteen maybe twenty years ago do you know if theres any database you could access to identify the case longoria pondered a moment you dont know the date or the name of the defendant no just that it was a murder trial and they found the guy guilty a dry chuckle well if it was during the pratt administration you could just go and manually look up every one there couldnt have been more than three or four maybe less unfortunately i think it was way back before her maybe late seventies early eighties longoria clucked the golden years he took another moment then shook his head they may still have the physical records downstairs the cavernous basement of the hall larger than a costco that held many millions of documents shelf after shelf after shelf floor to twelvefoot ceiling from cases stretching back to the citys earlier daysbut first youd have to find them by going through every one individually thats the other thing glitsky said it might not have been here in san francisco well tell you what id find that out first if you had the case number the defendant maybe even the judge glitsky pursed his lips i know but i dont well then id say if it was a local case it might be doable but itll take you most of a couple of years if you do it yourself it would have to be pretty important and if it was id assign a goodsized team to it still it wouldnt be quick i dont know why it would be important at the moment its just a question but longoria had been a cop all of his life he knew that any given question could turn into something critical so he gave it some more time and passed on another thought heres a real long shot but maybe if your juror was foreman he might have gotten his name in the paper you could check other than that he shrugged sorry not a big deal glitsky said thanks closing the door to his own office glitsky went behind his desk and sat down he had eleven messages on his answering machine six on his palm pilot his press conference began in fifteen minutes its purpose was for him to explain why the police decision to allow a suspect in a gangrelated multiple murder to leave the state had been the proper one when theyd made the decision glitsky had had no doubt leshawn brodie considered armed and dangerous had already taken his seat on the greyhound bus to salt lake when theyd received the tip on his whereabouts rather than storm the crowded bus and possibly provoke a hostage crisis batiste glitsky and lanier had decided to alert nevada and utah authorities to follow the bus in unmarked cars and have officers pick the suspect up after he got off either in salt lake or en route as it happened leshawn got out to stretch his legs and play a few slots in elko and authorities picked him up without incident but it was now an extradition case and glitsky would be explaining all about it to the press having put on dozens of these shows by now he could imagine the questions already and none of them improved his humor did glitsky mean to say that the police knowingly allowed a dangerous criminal to ride for several hours with unsuspecting citizens did they have any assurance at all that leshawn wouldnt take hostages as soon as hed come aboard couldnt they have simply used a team of plainclothes cops and arrested him here avoiding all the extradition hassles why did they let him get on the bus in the first place why couldnt they have used tear gas or a sniper with tranquilizer darts or beamed him directly to a jail cell glitsky opened his middle drawer and popped three antacids pressing at the side of his stomach he checked his watch again he still had twelve minutes he hadnt eaten a bite since his bagel at sixfifteen he opened his peanut drawer restored to its original position and pulled out a small handful of shells placed them on his desk the phone rang and thoughtlessly he picked it up his secretary told him to hold for the chief and in two seconds frank batistes tightly controlled voice was on the line abe i need you up here right away the shits going to hit the fan whats up leshawn hes escaped when clarence jackman had first been elevated to the office of district attorney he came from managing a private law firm and was relatively inexperienced in city politics in fact this was one of the reasons the mayor tapped him for the job jackman was a proven resultsoriented administrator and this as opposed to an agendadriven zealot was what the office required in his early months the da had bridged the gap in his handson knowledge by convening an informal kitchen cabinet every tuesday to get and keep him current on issues he might not otherwise have considered the political implications of which he might not otherwise have been aware now gearing up for his first general election later in the year jackman had called together many of the original group again to feel out their respective interests in participating in his campaign he had pretty much decided he would be announcing at the end of the week and wanted to take the pulse of his core supporters on that timing as well the group assembled at the large round table at the back of lou the greeks a barrestaurant across the street from the hall of justice were all well acquainted dismas hardy sat between jeff elliot the wheelchairmobile reporter for the chronicle and allan boscacci relatively new to the group but apparently here to stay abe glitskys wife treya who had been with jackman in his old firm and now worked as his personal secretary sat on the other side of boscacci to the das left glitsky would have been welcome but obviously his work had kept him some of the old players were missing david freeman had passed away and gina roake had simply lost interest and theyd been replaced by a couple of city supervisors the young ambitious cheerily overweight harlan fisk and his aunt a birdlike spinster named kathy west but now the business part of the meeting such as it was had come to an end no surprise jackman had assurances of undying support from everyone hardy was going to host his fundraising kickoff party they thought that for the best buzz and food theyd have it at mooses in about six weeks fisk and west would begin calling in favors wheeling and dealing as necessary to try to get at least a majority coalition of support from the usually divided board of supervisors boscacci a political animal himself was going to hire and oversee the eventual campaign manager and funnel much of the daytoday administration of the campaign across the desk of the abundantly capable treya as a supposedly objective and nonpartisan columnist elliot could only promise that hed be inclined to continue and possibly even increase his sympathetic coverage of doings in the das office so long as jackman maintained the same policies and programs that had been working so well during his first term elliot would also do his damnedest to use his considerable popularity and influence to get the chronicle to support jackman come november something the paper would probably do on its own although it never hurt to have an inside advocate or two so everybody was on the same team and a convivial spirit reigned at the table as people finished their coffee hardy had exchanged some easy pleasantries with the chief assistant da when hed sat down but they hadnt talked to each other much since truth to tell hardy found boscaccis perennially florid countenance somewhat forbidding the collar at his neck always buttoned to the top and festooned with a bow tie seemed a half size too small this in turn seemed to stretch the closely shaved skin on his face to make his dark eyes bulge slightly so that it always appeared that he might be on the verge of a stroke fiftytwo years old he wore his thick black hair slicked with some kind of hair lotion and pulled straight back off his prominent forehead but hardy knew he could be an affable enough guy when he was on your side he took the opportunity as though hed just remembered it to thank boscacci for the courtesy hed shown amy wu yesterday in the andrew bartlett matter boscacci waved off the comment ah that was nothing shes an easy person to want to do something nice for then leaning in a bit and lowering his voice he added besides she didnt know it but she couldnt have timed it better for us us he included the group at the table clarence all of us we chalk up the two convictions before the end of the week when clarence announces he can say hes had fifty murder convictions so far this term not even four years youre kidding me is that the number with your associates two it is and fifty sounds so much bigger than fortyeight you know what i mean i dont know fortyeight sounds pretty good to me dont get me wrong fortyeight is a fine number but we figure fifty is easier for the man in the street to get his arms around pratts administration she didnt even charge fifty murders i remember it well hardy said i doubt if she charged fifteen boscacci lowered his voice twelve if you want to get precise which is one of the reasons weve got such great numbers between you and me were recycling some leftovers he grinned in triumph so anyway your ms wu comes to me with a reasonable and some might even say charitable request we find a way to make it winwin she says its not even out of the question the kids stepfather you know hal north north cinemas will be so grateful for saving the kid thirty plus of hard time he might want to express his gratitude to clarence in a more tangible way she mentioned the same thing to me but i wouldnt be expecting that check soon suddenly the forbidding aspect of boscaccis personality appeared his face darkened perceptibly hardy was halftempted to reach over and undo his bow tie let him get a breath but he spoke clearly enough without any difficulty why is there some problem north should be slobbering in gratitude thinking fast and realizing that hed inadvertently almost tipped boscacci to his own concerns about wus disposition of the case hardy said no i dont see any problem allan its just that eight years is eight years that his stepson is gone its not likely that norths going to see the deal in quite the same way as you do well boscacci said somebody ought to go and explain it to him given the case against his boyand its a deuce remember that it may be the best deal weve ever agreed to from a suspects point of view time we get around to serious fundraising for clarence id hope hed come to understand that id bet your ms wu could even have a little chat with him come fall if she was so inclined draw the picture a little more clearly he paused anybody could do it she could she put her mind to it i believe that woman could charm the skin off a snake youre lucky to have her but you already know that dont you hardy nodded affable as he could force himself to be its why we pay her the big bucks allan all that charm and a legal whiz on top of it if i didnt believe the cosmic truth that we were always on the side of the angels id say it was close to unfair a small jungle of dieffenbachia rubber trees and other more exotic plants thrived in the corners and against the back wall of the firms conference room opening to a sheltered outdoor atrium complete with grass and fountain the entire outer wall and part of the roof jutted from the line of the building creating a greenhouse effect and giving the room its nickname of the solarium now at a few minutes after six gina roake the buildings owner in a conservative gray business suit sat with a cup of coffee at the head of the large table that commanded the room roake was closing in on fifty years old but few people would have guessed it shed always had good skin and a youthful face a recent diet and exercise program had accented her chin and cheekbones and slimmed the rest of her down significantly though she remained a bit zaftig to her left dismas hardy emulating his old mentor freeman sipped some baystone shiraz from an oversized wineglass across from him wes farrell was trying to tell what had supposedly just been voted the funniest joke in the world but he was having some trouble getting to it who votes on that kind of thing hardy asked its got to be bogus nobody asked me for example gina anybody ask you no see and were both famous for our senses of humor farrell wasnt to be denied its a very prestigious group of joke researchers based in sweden or someplace they wouldnt ask people like you and gina so its a european joke hardy said which strikes me as pretty arrogantly eurocentric okay so now its like in some swedes opinion the funniest joke in the world those wacky swedes with the highest suicide rate in the world and all can i tell the joke farrell asked and then you decide all right hardy said but telling us up front that this is the funniest joke in the world its guaranteed to be forty percent less funny farrell persisted youll still get sixty percent of it itll be worth it i promise i cant wait roake said but hardy wasnt through yet did you laugh out loud when you heard it wes no but i never laugh out loud at jokes you laughed at dirty harold farrell broke a grin true i did so based on your own response this new funniest joke in the world isnt as funny as the dirty harold joke fucking lawyers farrell said everythings an argument whats the dirty harold joke roake asked hardy turned to her this little kid with a filthy mouth so the teacher wont ever call on him then one day theyre going through the alphabet finding words that start with a given letter and then they use the word in a sentence they finally get to e harolds hand has been up the whole time on every letter but she figures there arent any filthy words that start with e so she calls on him elf roake exclaimed smiling i know an elf with a big prick thats it hardy drank some wine farrell seized his chance so holmes and watson go camping and set up their tent and they go to sleep two hours later holmes goes watson what do you see and watson goes i see millions and millions of stars and holmes says and what do you deduce from that watson says i imagine each star has planets around it just like our own with a chance of life on each one and holmes goes watson you fool someones stolen our tent so roake maintained a poker face having heard the joke maybe now we can begin ive got a handball game in fortyfive minutes they were gathered for their monthly partners overview business after all and hardy spent the next twenty minutes going over the firms numbers the associates were all well utilized the firm was cranking along racking up substantial fees almost as though it were on automatic pilot hardys concerns about wus deal with boscacci might have been a legitimate topic for discussion on another day but so far nothing had actually gone wrong and he elected to keep his qualms under his hat under other business hardy mentioned the firms upcoming involvement in support of the jackman campaign which he considered an opportunity as good as any to broach the one sensitive topic they needed to discuss might the jackman candidacy entice roake back to work hardy wondered to something approaching regular hours roake straightened up in her chair her eyes flicked between the two men i resent the hell out of that question diz what i do with my time is my business hardys gaze didnt flinch he kept any sign of edge out of his voice im not arguing with that gina youve earned whatever time you feel you need but as a business matter for the firm youre drawing a decent salary for yourself and your own private secretary and youve got a big corner office thats essentially sitting unused roake clipped off her words how about if i just quit and start charging the kind of rent for this building that another firm would have to pay i could give up my decent salary and id still be making more money than i am now how about that hardy shook his head thats not what i want i dont think its what you want i wasnt speaking critically if you dont want to do any more billing youve got my complete support wess too but when we started up together we had a business plan that included the three of us bringing in business and billing our own time and thats not happening even with our otherwise good utilization were struggling to make those original numbers hardy came forward his hands clasped on the table in front of him his voice was still soft almost caressing im just trying to get a sense of your plans gina so i can know what were dealing with as it stands now youre an expense item and not a profit center and we didnt plan for that the firm has to come up with the difference which is not insignificant i owe it to us all to tell you about it times are good now but if they get tight we could find ourselves in a heap of trouble roake scratched at the yellow legal pad on the table in front of her staring down at her scribblings all right she said without looking up id like to think about this for a few days if you dont mind not at all hardy said and gina theres no wrong answer here the firm needs to know thats all weve talked about some capital improvements on the horizon weve got to know if theyre feasible that kind of thing i hear you roake said really i do then with a crisp smile she pushed back from the table gathered her notes and told them both good night after the door to the solarium had closed behind her hardy let out a long breath and met his partners baleful eye over the table okay then farrell drew a palm over his brow all in all id say that went pretty well you want to pour me some of that wine hardy put his briefcase down by his reading chair then walked down the long hallway in his house before hed remodeled it the old victorian had been in the railroad car style with all the downstairs rooms opening to the right off the hall now a large recently renovated kitchen opened up in the back and behind that was a family room and then the bedrooms for the two kids they didnt keep the television on much as a general rule so he was somewhat surprised to hear the low drone he poked his head into the family room whats on frannie looked over from where she sat on the couch abe he walked over and joined them whats that loopy guy done now on the tube glitsky frowned into a battery of microphones no thats not true he was saying i consulted with the chief and lieutenant lanier but the decision was mine at the time it seemed the best one no one could have predicted that mr brodie would escape and in fact the capture itself took place without incident the picture flicked back to the pretty anchorwoman who wore the same cheerful face whether she was reporting on terrorism or bake sales but in spite of deputy chief glitskys comments the fact remains that leshawn brodie still considered armed and extremely dangerous and a suspect in several local murders remains at large after he allegedly stole one of the officers weapon and engaged in a dramatic shootout with arresting authorities this morning in nevada critics are calling illadvised at best glitskys decision not to arrest brodie while he sat on a bus in the greyhound terminal in downtown san francisco early this morning and considering the suspects escape and record of violence its hard to disagree with them hard but not impossible hardy said when the male anchor appeared and it was clear that the news had moved on to its next sound bite he grabbed the remote and turned off the set you notice she never mentioned who the critics were did i miss that yet its hard to disagree with them he intoned in the anchors voice what kind of reporting is that bad vincent said they werent even listening to what uncle abe said how long was he on hardy asked long enough vincents voice was breaking with adolescence he cleared his throat and went on what did they want him to do shoot up the whole bus to get the one guy you got the gist of it i think frannie put a hand on hardys knee maybe you ought to call him though hes taking a lot of heat how was your day evidently better than abes though it had its moments he glanced at his watch you think hes home but he was already punching numbers on the telephone this is your best and possibly only true friend hardy said and if you get this what monitoring your calls i see you would too its been ringing off the hook tvll do that instant fame great but i dont want to be famous theres your problem youre the only person in america who doesnt the media doesnt know what to do with you maybe you ought to get a new makeup guy wipe away those frown lines did you know you had a scar through your lips im sure they could airbrush that out too there was a pause then glitsky asked are you calling for any real reason not exactly you were on the news just now i thought youd enjoy the sound of a friendly voice also for the record vins on your side at his side hardys wife said frannie too i heard that glitsky said tell them both thanks frannie squeezed hardys leg ask him no wait let me she grabbed the phone abe what are you and treya doing tonight ive got a big pot of spaghetti sauce going why dont all of you come over here get away from these people who dont love you like we do wu had planned all along to get back to andrew get the plea locked up before tomorrow she wasnt about to enter arvid johnsons courtroom in the morning with any sort of question still hanging about her clients disposition but before she went in to see andrew again she found that she still needed some time to gather herself she sat at a table in the street window of what had probably once been a nice little boutique espresso shop half a block from the ygc but the place had been servicing the juvenile hall clientele for so long that it had given up hope and lost whatever charm it may have once possessed now the bulletin board by the door bristled with lawyers business cards photos of missing kids ads for bail bondmen and private investigators stacks of assorted newspapers lay piled on a table by the sugar and cream a pit bull chained slept on the floor in the back of the shop behind the counter a young woman with a peg in her tongue and a ring in each eyebrow was wiping down the back counter putting things away outside long shadows stretched up the hill but the faces of buildings across the street glowed in the last blast of blinding evening sunlight the wind had picked up and was all but howling flinging any trash that weighed less than a pound along the nearly deserted street wus day from waking up hungover and alone to her meeting with the norths then andrew then the fight with jason brandt seemed to have lasted about a week so far and the hardest few moments were no doubt still ahead of her well maybe not the hardest for a combination of guilt anger and shame she knew that it would be tough to top the half hour or so after brandt had stormed away from her what made it even worse was that she found she couldnt even blame him for it was true even when shed first begun flirting with him the night before she had known that her deal with andrew wasnt consummated if she wanted to have any claim to calling herself an ethical attorney she would have disclosed her conflict about andrew to brandt first thing you simply did not have sex with your courtroom opposite number sipping her coffee she was still sick with herself appalled at what shed done and at the situation in which she and brandt now found themselves a situation that she had orchestrated she had risked both of their jobs still risked them if the truth came out to satisfy some undefined and pathetic need to connect it was beneath her she knew or at least beneath the person she had been until her fathers death had kicked the foundation out from under her turned her into the kind of unstable needy manipulative dangerous woman shed always hated and resolved never to become and the scariest thing was that the lapse with brandt had completely broadsided her shed never even considered discussing andrews case with him there had been that spark the attraction and lubricated by drink shed just gone for it never mind that he was a colleague a good guy a nobullshit attorney she felt she could really come to like and admire someday maybe more than that of course now all of that possible future was out of the question and that too the waste of it the sheer stupidity made her sick and now she looked at her watchright now she had to face her young client and wrest a final agonizing decision from him one that shouldnt have been his to make in the first place she should have left the original disposition to fall where it would with andrew filed as an adult then there would have been an adult trial and hed all but certainly have been convicted of some degree of murder but it all would have been according to the system now because of her arrogance stupidity blindness she had placed the entire burden of choice on an unhappy miserable kid she wondered if it was a burden he would have the strength to bear earlier when hed broken down shed even viewed that as a positive thing hed be persuaded to do what she wanted but what if he simply couldnt deal with it she shook her head finished the last of her coffee and left the mug on the table as was the case with jason brandt this was yet another example of where shed acted committed herself really before shed considered the implications of what she was setting in motion she could only pray that andrew was in fact guilty as shed assumed and believed all along as shed convinced his parents that would make andrews admission though still difficult acceptable even preferable as a strategy as she turned up the walkway to the cabins she stopped and looked up at the razorwire fence after she got andrews admission sewed up tonight she vowed she would change and never put a client in such a position again but first she had to get his admission first that then begin work on fixing herself but she couldnt lose sight of her objective in the short term too much was already riding on andrews admission she couldnt let the accumulation of this days terrible events weaken her resolve or blind her to her first duty dont wimp out now she said aloud to herself and started up to the cabins who was that frannie took off her reading glasses and put down her pd james she was in bed propped against her reading pillow she had let her red hair down and now it hung to her shoulders and shone in the rooms light hardy turned from his desk by the rooms door amy frannie checked the clock by the bed at elevenfifteen she didnt want me to worry and lose any of those precious minutes of sleep that are so important to men of a certain age what were you going to be worried about that now youre not i presume he spent a minute filling her in on his concern that wu might find herself having to renege with boscacci but she just got back home from what must have been a marathon session with andrew down at ygc she wanted me to know that she had nailed down the plea well theres a relief i would have tossed all night frannie went to pick up her book stopped it took her twenty minutes to tell you that to do it justice and how old is this boy seventeen frannie made a sad face seventeen a nod and unfortunately a killer a double killer actually eventually apparently he gave that up to amy confessed you mean well agreed to admit the petition which is pleading guilty and since thats the deal amy cut with boscacci im glad he finally got religion around it so what was the deal with boscacci hardy filled in the particulars for his wife concluding with the comment that amy had been smart to keep andrews parents away while she put the pressure on the kid why is that frannie asked because hed been telling mom and dad he didnt do it but he did yep if hes pleading which he is so then tell me again why he wouldnt agree to plead guilty if his parents were there hardy stopped and turned by the closet because my love he continues to scam them the dads paying the bills first he can be a good boy and assure them to their face that hes innocent then he can save his own skin by telling amy the truth and the real beauty of it all he can then go back to his parents and tell them that amy talked him into the whole thing she coerced him it wasnt his fault he didnt really kill anybody hes a good boy a long moment passed his wife staring into the empty space in front of her you are so cynical life makes smart people cynical he said its a sad but true fact not all of them frannie let out a deep sigh a shadow of distaste crossed her face cynicals not so bad hardy said it saves a lot of heartache down the line right i know thats what you think she closed her eyes for a second drew a heavy breath weariness bleeding out of her i guess im just worried about you me moi i tightening her lips biting down against some strong emotion she said never mind and turned away from him that was a little humor frannie just trying to lighten it up her chest rose and fell twice finally she faced him thats what im worried about everything being a joke he tried to keep it light josh her out of whatever it was thats funny he said i wish more things were jokes when suddenly none of it was a joke at all anymore she threw off the covers and was out of bed nearly running across to the bathroom closing the door behind her the lock clicked hardy stood stockstill his head down after ten seconds he went over and knocked whispered fran are you all right he thought he heard a sob whatever it is im sorry he waited a moment no more joking if you come out promise finally in a minute it was more like ten he was lying on the bed hands behind his head he barely dared look at her afraid he might scare her off the two of them hadnt had a cross word since before the shootout nearly a year and half ago he didnt want anything to be wrong between them now he said nothing while she got into her side of the bed pulled the blankets up over her i didnt mean to be so dramatic she said im sorry you can be dramatic anytime you want he waited for another minute perhaps two a very long time finally she sighed i dont mean to be critical of you she said its just that i am so worried about you you dont need to be im fine maybe you are but youre not the same person you always said you wanted to be she shook her head im not saying this right okay take your time im not going anywhere she wrestled with it for another minute or more finally she sighed i just dont know if theres anything you care about anymore i care about you and the kids no i know you love us but i mean with yourself with your life are you happy with your life a million glib answers the usual grab bag sprung to his mind but that of course was what she was getting at he sat up and half turned away from her am i happy what makes you think im not its not what i think but something just now made you ask she reached over and touched his back its not just now and maybe its the same something thats making you not answer he shifted to face her i honestly dont know what that is frannie then i dont feel like im doing anything different you dont no not consciously anyway no what about this boy amy just called you about andrew what about him youre happy with him going to jail for eight years another shrug it beats the alternative which is life in prison its also the deal amy made it seemed like a good one if hes guilty hardy shrugged amy says hes admitting so he probably is either way though the deal gets him out not much later than if he went to trial and got acquitted anyway so eight years for an innocent person is okay with you well first as i said hes probably not innocent and second hes already in the system so hes looking at a year or two minimum before anything shakes out anyway which leaves six years in six years your own little boy is twenty hardy ran a palm over his cheek so this is about andrew bartlett frannie shook her head its about she started over it just seems everything you do nowadays has to do with manipulating the rules somehow its all just cynicism and money and cutting the deal hardys voice hardened perceptibly maybe you dont remember last year too well frannie when you and i tried to play by the rules and got polaroids with gunsights drawn on over our kids the experience hasnt quite paled on me so yeah i guess ive gotten a little jaded on the whole playbytherules concept if im good at bending them and that makes life easy im a sap if i dont thats what you tell yourself he turned now frankly glaring yes it is and i do very well at it frannie glared back and thats also why you drink all the time now because it helps you forget how youre living what im doing is supporting this family frannie the best way i know how frannie watched a muscle twitch in his jaw look she said you cut a deal on this child molester guy the other morning when you know there was a time you wouldnt have gotten within a mile of him that was fifty thousand dollars worth of stop then you go to lunch have a few drinks and make a deal for your firm to help elect the da then you have some wine at your partners meeting and try to cut a deal to make poor gina come back to work when you know that her hearts gone out of it let me ask you this frannie tell me someone whose heart hasnt gone out of it especially after he let it hang frannie waited until he met her eyes again i dont mean to make you mad i just dont believe that the person cutting all these deals is who you really are who i am his laugh rang dry and empty who i am is a guy whos lost faith in the process but the bills keep on coming the kids college is around the corner what am i supposed to do just stop maybe you could do something you care about she moved over toward him put her arms around his shoulders here she said lie down with me close your eyes you dont have to make any decisions right now tonight but a blind person can see how unhappy you are how its all frantic and manic and going going going just to keep busy eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die she kissed him youre not going to die tomorrow she felt him growing calmer next to her his breathing more regular he put his arm around her and she lay up against him after another minute he said i think maybe i am drinking a little too much she noted the repetition of the disclaiming qualifiersi think maybe a little but it was nevertheless an admission of sorts and she hoped a start after another couple of minutes his body seemed to settle next to her sleep trying to claim him im tired he said then im worried about abe too the words were a barely audible mumble then he was asleep back at her apartment wu changed out of her lawyer clothes and chose a black leather miniskirt a diaphanous red shirt over a skincolored bra a heavy leather jacket against the cold wind fifteen minutes after shed hung up with dismas hardy she was among the packed bodies at indigos another bar at the triangle at a dinnerplatesized table twirling her first cosmopolitan of the night with a wellmanicured hand she perched herself on a high stool and showed a lot of leg the volume of the music an endless bass and drum loop made conversation impossible but she didnt mind she didnt want to talk she didnt want to think about jason brandt either or andrew bartlett wu shrugged out of her jacket put it across her lap straightened her back and turned to survey the groups of men who were drinking and laughing all around her she caught one of the guys goodlooking in a grungy way long blond hair couple of earrings checking the assets she so artfully displayed he was very much interested she smiled slipped off the stool got her drink in one hand and her jacket in the other and moved in to cut him out the wind blew itself out overnight but it was still unseasonably cold a high clear sky bright sun a rare city frost bloomed on every patch of green admittedly not many of them that wu passed as she drove up market street her hands shook and her eyes burned but she was still thankful about the timing of the hearing this morning the ten oclock call meant she didnt have to go by the office and check in before driving to the ygc and this had allowed her to grab an extra hour or two of sleep badly needed after all the cocktails that had gone with last nights adventure she hadnt made it back to her apartment until sometime after am she hadnt fallen asleep until nearly dawn and was jarred awake by the alarm two hours later disoriented depleted wrung out still by the time she entered the holding cell behind arvid johnsons courtroom the mixed jolt from the dexedrine and the espresso had kicked in handcuffed andrew sat on a cement bench built against the wall he seemed subdued and nervous shrugging a greeting of sorts then going back to studying the pattern in the floor between his feet wu put on a brave face sat up close next to him he smelled of disinfectant and soap are you holding up all right did you get some sleep how do you feel now are you still comfortable with our decision to each question she got a shrug a nod she tried a few more conversational gambits telling him that the judge was going to want to hear him admit the petition himelf all he had to do was follow her lead and it would all be over before he knew it he nodded some more then at last shut her up with a curt i know what ive got to do she had to take that as an assurance he was going to be okay hal and linda north were at their place in the first row holding hands wu nodded to them got a response from hal nothing from linda but a blank stare on the opposite side of the room jason brandt directed his complete attention to the contents of some binders that were open in front of him he avoided any eye contact with wu the two rays of sunshine had taken their respective positions again nelson by the back door to the holding cell cottrell in the otherwiseempty jury box the court reporter and probation officer chatted amiably and then suddenly the door to arvid johnsons chambers opened and the judge in his robes was on the bench again there was little sense of ritual the probation officer simply got a nod from the judge stood and began good morning this is petition jw the matter of andrew bartlett who is present in the courtroom also present are the minors natural mother linda bartlett north and his stepfather hal north the minors attorney is ms amy wu mr jason brandt is the district attorney judge johnson thanked the officer and peered down over his glasses ms wu its my understanding that your minor client mr bartlett and the district attorney have agreed to a mutually acceptable disposition in this matter is that correct wu put a hand under her clients arm and the two of them rose yes your honor johnson had done this innumerable times and although wu was tuned to a high pitch of anxiety for him it obviously held all the excitement and drama of a quilting bee mr bartlett i want to ask you if you understand the decision thats been reached here on your behalf andrews voice was firm yes your honor i talked about it with ms wu last night he turned halfway around gave a small nod to his parents then came back to face the judge johnson nodded and you understand mr bartlett that by admitting this petition filed against you by the state of california that you in fact claim full responsibility for the murders of michael mooney and laura wright and that immediately following this proceeding you will begin serving a term at the california youth authority and will remain in custody until your twentyfifth birthday andrew hesitated for an instant and wu jumping in spoke up for him yes your honor mr bartlett understands but johnson shook his head id like to hear it from him counselor mr bartlett andrew looked at wu then up to the judge when he began the first time he was almost inaudible so he cleared his throat and started again i understand about the sentence thats what we decided i had to agree to clearing his throat again he went on but im not really comfortable he stopped turned back to his parents again came back around to johnson but i cant say that i killed anybody because i didnt wu had a sense of the world spinning before her she reached out put her hand on her clients arm no wait andrew then addressing the judge your honor if i may but johnson gaveled her to silence he removed his glasses squinted out over the podium no counselor you may not not for a minute anyway he pointed a finger at andrew mr bartlett i want to hear you say it yourself one more time youre not admitting the petition your honor wu spoke up in a panic she couldnt let this happen id like to request a short recess over on her right she heard brandt close his binder with a sharp snap request denied johnson said we just got here back at andrew mr bartlett repeat your plea this time andrews voice was much more forceful im just saying that i didnt kill anybody behind her wu could hear the norths reacting with a muted enthusiasm needing to undo what andrew had done she turned to him whispered urgently you cant do this andrew youre looking at life in prison dont you understand the judge brought his gavel down again ms wu mr brandt he motioned with his head chambers and he was up in a swirl of black robes johnson was waiting facing them as they came through his door no trace of anything avuncular softened his countenance as he reached around and closed the door behind them all he came right to the point i dont tolerate being trifled with in my courtroom ms wu what is this supposed to be some kind of publicity stunt or delaying tactic she tried to swallow get a breath no your honor no to which neither your honor im as surprised as you are johnson looked to brandt who wisely stood at respectful attention then came back to wu this is unacceptable what do you expect me to do now ill go talk to him and what good will that do ill get him hes just afraid he was on board with this last night he just couldnt go through with it thats all the judge crossed his arms stop wasting my time as far as im concerned hes denied the petition this is really unacceptable counselor he added wholly unacceptable then making no effort to hide his anger and disgust he continued all right lets get the show back on the road go back in there and get this done as fast as we can brandt spoke your honor if i may johnson turned his glare on him what i just wanted to say that ms wu isnt as naive as shes pretending to be she knew the conditions when she cut her deal andrew admits or he goes up as an adult i think we all knew that johnson said so now were going to have him tried as an adult ms wu should agree to that his stare at her brooked no denial brandt nodded satisfied then we want him certified today your honor unless the plan all along was to get him to juvenile court by misrepresenting his intention to admit wu holding her temper in check talked to the judge your honor i promise you i dont know what hes talking about i had no such plan i didnt want andrew to have to run the risk of an adult trial an admission to me seemed like the right thing johnsons face remained grave his color high im just wondering if its possible that you are actually this illprepared ms wu agreeing to plead out a case before securing the clients agreement but he didnt wait for her to answer it doesnt matter the point is that mr bartlett as you undoubtedly must be aware is already in the juvenile system you see now he cant be tried as an adult without a sevenohseven hearing first do you expect me to believe you didnt know that suddenly the enormity of her miscalculation came into much clearer focus wu had been acting as though she needed andrews admission to secure his place in the juvenile system but this was not strictly speaking the case what she needed his admission for was merely so that the sentencing could proceed in fact boscaccis initial filing had assured that legally andrew was already in the juvenile system and hence protected from lwop as long as he stayed there i didnt think she stammered all right johnson snapped at her you didnt think so can i now assume that you will agree to waive the sevenohseven hearing and have mr bartlett recertified an adult today as mr brandt here has requested i i cant do that your honor no brandt exploded no of course you cant he obviously justifiably thought shed planned to have her client deny the petition all along this would not only delay andrews eventual trial as an adult but place another administrative hurdle the hearing in the middle of his path he appealed to johnson i dont believe for a moment your honor that this wasnt her plan all along thats not true thats just not true your honor brandt ignored her your honor the only way to read this is she set it up so that she could stall down here for months but im certain that the district attorney is going to want to get this matter back into adult court so id like to ask that the sevenohseven be calendared at the earliest possible time johnson gave a last withering look at wu then nodded im inclined to agree with you counselor lets go out and put it on the record look at the bright side wes farrell was saying shes convinced the clients that she did it on purpose she planned it all along now the kid catches a break in the sevenohseven maybe he never has to go to trial as an adult and everybody wins except the da never trusts anybody from the firm again picky picky farrell on the couch across the room shrugged they probably didnt trust us all that much anyway remember were defense attorneys a bare evolutionary step above pond scum that much you think hardy could joke but he wasnt amused maybe not if you want to get technical the thing is though were going to help get jackman elected again so were his pals or will be again soon itll all blow over in a few months and theyll be trusting us as much as they ever did which dont kid yourself is not close to the world record anyway meanwhile amys got the norths thinking shes a latterday clara darrow snatching victory from the jaws of defeat swell hardy pushed his chair back from his desk his elbows rested on the arms of the chair fingers templed at his lips so she spins it to deceive the people who are paying her paying us you mean just keep repeating the paying part and youll feel better i wont feel better i dont want to get paid to lie to my clients well fortunately theyre not your clients theyre amys hardy straightened himself up in his chair precisely the opposite point you made about one sentence ago you notice when the norths were paying they were our clients when theyre being lied to theyre amys youve stumbled upon my specialty honed in years of debate answers tailored to justify any course of action farrell broke a smile its a modest enough talent but its seen me through some dark days and what do you mean you dont want to get paid to lie i thought thats what we got paid for but hardy held up a hand wes enough okay the smile faded okay so whats she going to do amy first thing i had her go down to boscacci and apologize in person tell him the truth which is that the kid decided on his own not to admit farrell sat back and crossed a leg and why do you think he did that hardy gave it a minute hes young eight years sounds like the rest of his life but for now i guess hed rather take bad odds at pulling life than no odds at eight years he sighed hes going to find out inspector sergeant pat belou stepped out of the elevator on the fourth floor of the hall of justice she had ridden up from the lobby with her partner lincoln russell a welldressed midthirties black inspector also in the small enclosed elevator had been about ten other citizens at least one of whom badly needed a shower some new clothes a toothbrush maybe industrial disinfectant and certainly deodorant lots of deodorant that was the longest elevator ride ive ever taken belou said when the door closed behind her we ought to arrest that guy as a health hazard not till he kills somebody russell said were homicide hes got to kill somebody first those are the rules well he almost killed me that ought to count anybody goes with him all the way to the top their lifes in danger maybe we catch him on the way down russell said belou blew out through her mouth waving the air in front of her nose she was a thirtyyearold tall and rangy woman with an outdoorsy look a bit of a heavy jaw some old faded acne scars on her face but her large mouth smiled easily she laughed as though she meant it and her shoulderlength hair a shade lighter than dirty blond and with a perennially windblown look set off lovely blue eyes the inspectors turned into the hallway and belou stopped suddenly hit her partner on the arm glitsky she said good a time as any russell said hed see her in the homicide detail and she turned around and came back to the double doors by the elevator lobby that led to the admin offices she was just asking the receptionist at the outside desk if she could have a word with the deputy chief when the man himself appeared from somewhere in the back he wore a deep frown and was accompanied by a sergeant in uniform paganucci by his name tag she spoke right up sir sergeant belou homicide glitsky obvious frazzled came to a full stop im running to a meeting he told her if youd like to leave a message with melissa here ill get back to you as soon as i can yes sir but this is short ted reed ted reed elizabeth carys brother lake elsinore what about him hes been in custody on an arson charge down in escondido for most of the last month the public defender down there told me he must have decided he liked the food in jail didnt want to waste his money on bail his trials in a couple of months bottom line is he didnt kill his sister glitsky nodded something else was distracting him but he said okay thanks good job then to melissa im at the young community developers ribbon cutting out on van ness i wont talk to any reporters before the next scheduled press conference tony he turned to the sergeant who accompanied him how fast can we get there were late already lights and sirens five six minutes if they call glitsky told melissa tell them were on the way then they were gone jogging through the elevator lobby hitting the stairs at a run behind the reception desk melissa looked up at belou shook her head in commiseration man dont belong doing this gonna make hisself sick the phone rang and she picked it up said without ceremony that the deputy chief wasnt available hung up she smiled at belou pointed at the telephone one of the reporters he didnt want to talk to they eatin him up what about this leshawn brodie thing you following that the greyhound guy thats him sugar what about him so you aint heard he was headin back this way but they pulled him over up in colfax now hes got hisself twenty hostages in some diner up there already killed two of em she pointed to the phone them reporters they wantin his hide hardy asked phyllis to hold his calls he locked his door took off his shoes loosened his tie and lay down on one of his couches hed had a good breakfast with the family and wasnt remotely hungry and he decided he would start to break the bottleofwinewithlunch habit by skipping lunch entirely eliminate the temptation he fell asleep instantly and awoke nearly three hours later alone in his office he threw water on his face brewed a cup of espresso and drank it down as soon as it didnt scald replaying frannies monologue from last night in his mind he realized that all of his friends involved in the gunfight had been wrestling with their longterm reactions and demons ever since he shouldnt have been surprised that he had his own issues and that hed been ignoring them as best he could but from today on he resolved that things were going to change it was just a matter of will and that had always been one of his strengths but today after hed finished his coffee he got up to pour himself another cup and noticed the bottle of r√©my martin in his bar without agonizing about it too much he poured a shot into his cup and added coffee hed never entertained the thought that he intended to quit drinking altogether and after all hed not had any wine for lunch he deserved that shot as a reward for his earlier abstinence and one shot wasnt going to affect him adversely in any event it would just take a little of the edge off raising the cup to his mouth though he hesitated maybe frannies point last night was that his normal response to conflict or inner turmoil lately had been to round off the edges he was literally dulled and in that state nothing was really that serious you could take the easiest course ride it out have a few drinks and usually things tended to work out acceptably you couldnt spend your whole life worrying about the what ifs the small stuff and that was counterproductive too at least as debilitating as drinking in fact seen in that light drinking had enabled him to function better he came to work every day drummed up megabusiness with whoever could pay his fees used his natural talent for schmoozing he was good with people that was all and with a bit of a load on even more charming like wu charming the thought stopped him cold like wu screwing up hiding behind that old glib shit ultimately failing those who might be counting on you leaving the cup untouched on the counter he instead walked over to his dart area opened the cabinets and pulled the three tungsten customs from the board it wasnt so long ago that he used to throw his darts to clear his mind as a relaxation technique and now he got to the line in the floor turned and threw threw again again one round before he moved forward to pull the round from the board he went over to the counter picked up the coffee cup and poured it down the sink it was nearly four oclock by the time he knocked on gina roakes door she had the corner office an altogether different work space than hardys there were a few stuffed chairs and a sofa an old wooden coffee table a computer table and chair but no formal desk to speak of instead of hardwood floors gina went with walltowall carpet a shade darker than champagne cheaply framed posters of old moviesgiant casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane decorated the one big wall the other by the door mostly held her law books although there was one shelf of david freeman memorabilia an empty bottle of la grande dame champagne from the day hed proposed to her a picture of the two of them outside on the deck at the alta mira in sausalito the bay shimmering in the background a handblown blue and red glass perfume bottle some erotic if not frankly obscene porcelains from chinatown a clean ashtray with an unlit cigar and a book of matches from the crown room at the fairmont then there were the windows six of them to hardys two in the afternoon now the light suffused the room with a golden glow he stopped just inside carefully closed the door behind him you busy she was at the computer work showing on the screen i decided you were at least a little bit right if im going to have my name on the door i should pull some of the weight he drew around one of the folding chairs flipped it open and sat on it thats funny i decided i was at least mostly wrong the firms making a fortune i was a horses ass am he gestured vaguely around the room if you dont want to work youve earned the right not to he waited a moment so how are you she turned to face him thought a moment im all right i think if i exercised any more id selfdestruct which is maybe what i was trying to do im damn sure already the strongest woman my age i know if any man has the guts to want to find out but the smile faded but it wasnt physical strength though after all was it it was bullets it was bullets hardy agreed a silence ensued in only a few seconds ginas face tracked through several variations on the themes of grief revenge and regret last year shed killed a man and the experience had scarred her so what brings you down to this neck of the woods if it was just your apology unnecessary but nice it wasnt just that its amy he gave gina a brief recap of the events leading up to this mornings fiasco in juvenile court and by the time he finished gina had turned and was facing him her face set with worry she made the deal before she had the clients consent right then he added its possible she thought he had given it hows that did she have him sign a statement i dont think so no she called me last night and said it was locked up solid but didnt get his john hancock and then he went sideways last minute in the courtroom hardy shrugged it happens not as often as you might think if you do it right so what do you want me to do a pause for amy nothing for me i could use some guidance im the managing partner and ive managed this whole thing wrong up until now i knew her client hadnt signed off i kept convincing myself that i should trust her judgment that hed come around that was irresponsible enough but it was more than that really roake cocked her head what though exactly hardy took a minute deciding what he should say you may remember amys father died a few months ago since then shes been distracted and her works been suffering todays problem being the best of several good examples again he paused i cant help but feel that a lot of where this has gotten to is my fault i should have stepped in at the gitgo and three or four other stops along the way but the point is shes been playing fast and loose with this boys life and it probably feels relatively okay to her because shes playing fast and loose with her own roake leaned back into her chair let out a heavy breath people are going to do what theyre going to do diz do you think shes competent legally i dont know shes got a good mind but the only bright spot right now if you want to call it that is that shes somehow conned the parents who are paying the bills that this has been her plan all along to pretend to go along with the deal to get andrew declared a juvenile which i take it isnt true right so shes still lying to her clients hardy tried a weak grin spinning is the preferred term of art i believe but its going to unravel fast enough you watch boscaccis going to demand a sevenohseven before she knows what hit her and if she loses there which is a good bet because not only does she have the burden of proof but the judge already hates her then her boys looking at adult murder with specials hardy found a chair and sat im thinking i have to step in take her off it that would mitigate the personal issues with boscacci and the judge anyway although the paying customers currently think amy is a genius if i yank her they quit maybe she quits too did i mention the fees here its going to go adult murder and thats six figures high profile we dont want to lose it roake crossed her arms over her chest whirled halfway around in her chair and stared out toward one of the windows finally if memory serves the sevenohsevens not about evidence is it its only a question of whether the child can be rehabilitated in the juvenile system or should be punished in the adult isnt that about right hardy nodded okay then and how is andrews record otherwise nothing to speak of one joyride community service and a fine expunged well then roake considered a moment in that case she might have a shot the court cant say that the boys already a hardened criminal and needs to spend the rest of his life locked away she might pull it off maybe hardy had his doubts he knew perhaps better than roake that the last of the five criteria in determining whether a defendant was legally a juvenile or an adult was the gravity of the offense and there was nothing more serious than murder on that alone hardy thought the hearing was doomed to failure he ran a hand down his cheek i dont want to step on her gina or god knows fire her but her focus has been off on this since the beginning and now especially after she reneged on boscacci hes going to want to take her down he sat back crossed his arms in a pensive mode looked from window to window around the room suddenly he came back to roake his eyes bright with an idea how about if i tell her id like to sit second chair roake gave it some thought she might resent that too she might even quit and your hours on top of hers would the clients go for that i dont care about my hours hardy said i wouldnt charge for them long term getting amy straight and on track is worth more to the firm than id bill dont you think roake smiled spoke gently you dont have to ask me but that doesnt sound like the managing partner i know and love hes been pretty tough on billing lately even with some of our partners touch√© hardy said smiling but roake was back to business she still might quit though take it as a vote of noconfidence except that she knows shes screwed up i think it might be more likely especially with the other pressures shes feeling that shell be grateful shes not fired roake warming to the idea was nodding okay you could certainly say youve got every right as managing partner to demand a closer accountability you cant let another mistake happen on your watch whats she going to say no she could she might but roake shook her head sure but i dont think so i think shell thank you for offering so assuming shed be okay with it how would you handle it logistically hardy came forward suddenly pumped up at the prospect the way i see it i get up to speed on the evidence while shes arguing the rehab criteria at the sevenohseven that way even if we lose at the hearing were stronger for the adult trial plus between you and me if her personal problems become too much for her im already on board the clients now know me its good insurance he dropped his head for a moment stunned at how right this decision felt frannies message the night before had struck a reverberant chord he needed something to reconnect himself with who he was an officer of the court a justice freak a guardian of the law what he needed for his own good was a pure case where you defended your client because the presumption was innocence if the prosecution couldnt prove otherwise couldnt prevail against a spirited defense the client walked this was neither cynical nor manipulative it was the essence of the system and though hardy had lost some faith a great deal of faith in the mechanics in the way it sometimes played out in the real world suddenly it was crystal clear that this imperfect system if he still believed in anything was what he believed in more it was an opportunity for his own redemption that he couldnt let pass he hadnt taken a murder case in over three years they were too timeconsuming too physically grueling too emotionally demanding they played hell with his home life there was better money to be made quicker and more fun to be had cutting deals you could skim along the top of things and not worry too much hell not worry at all you laughed until your face hurt and youd be damned if youd ever have to internalize any of your clients problems you just fixed their messes and yet at some level hardy never lost his awareness that the fun was about as ephemeral and nourishing as cotton candy and often left a worse aftertaste and the money often felt dirty he might not have wanted to face it squarely but once he did it wasnt any mystery to him why hed been drinking too much he could see where it would all lead if he continued the picture wasnt pretty no more it was so ugly that thank god it had made frannie cry maybe it was time to engage again to let himself care he lifted his head broke a weary half grin so second chair you think roake nodded its got your name on it amy wu hadnt been able to face the idea of going back into the sutter street office and facing dismas hardy and her other colleagues again not after the brutal dressingdown shed taken at the hands of allan boscacci whod first kept her waiting for almost two hours then informed her that he had already filed a motion for a hearing on the bartlett matter to have the boy declared an adult he hoped she realized what shed done and wanted her to be under no illusion she wasnt getting away with it oh and by the way if she ever wanted to communicate with him about any case ever again she should do it in writing signed by her no dictated not read bullshit and he didnt mean email and she would find this to be the policy for every assistant district attorney in his office badly shaken fighting tears shed crossed bryant then descended into the dark and ripesmelling stairway under the bail bondsmans office that led down to lou the greeks shed taken her stool at the bar and ordered straight vodka no cosmopolitans today no froufrou little cocktails she wasnt here to party she was drinking by fivethirty lous was jammed and amys immediate troubles had mostly been drowned the bar was mecca for the lawyers and cops who worked out of the hall of justice and amys situation with andrew bartlett was as nothing compared with the shit storm that had developed over deputy chief glitskys handling of the leshawn brodie matter during the late morning and early afternoon brodie had taken the lives of seven of his hostages one every twenty minutes while the local cops and the highway patrol argued over who had jurisdiction to provide a helicopter that would take him to the sacramento airport there brodie evidently had been convinced that authorities would also supply him with a plane to take him to cuba in fact a police sniper shot him in the forehead when hed gotten one step outside of the diners entrance while the helicopter waited its rotors twirling in the parking lot both of the televisions over the bar at lous had been carrying nothing else for the past several hours while the pros and cons of the original police strategy had fueled an endless and passionate debate among the clientele by the time it had gotten dark amy had had six vodka martinis and was ready to go home and get some sleep but an aggressively clever young defense attorney named barry had outlasted the other hopefuls around her and now he had his arm around her as they negotiated the doors and came out into the suddenly fulldark night at the top of the stairs barry turned to her and she found herself being kissed then they were walking together down the alley that ran alongside lous she had herself tucked inside the jacket of his suit against the chill shed already told him she didnt think she should drive but he said he was sober enough and could drive them both he was parked where she had parked where every visitor to the hall parked in the allday just up at the end of the alley the lot was one block wide bounded by threestory buildings on both sides closing the place in every spot alley to alley was filled during business hours every day now the place held only three cars amys by the near building and then barrys car and another one parked in adjacent spaces on the far side one light burning from high on a pole by the deserted pay station cast its pool over the area leaving the borders in deep shadow when they got to his car barry opened the door for her and she lowered herself taking care lest she collapse into the seat as they backed out the cars headlights raked the building in front of them then washed over the car in the adjacent parking space following the beam through heavylidded eyes amy sat up abruptly wait a minute stop what barry slammed on the brakes before the car had fully stopped amy opened the door she was halfway out staggering she fell once cut her knees then got up and moved forward again what are you doing barry still in the car called from behind her she turned and pointed get your lights next to that car over by the wall she kept moving over toward a dark amorphous mound on the pavement up against the building as the headlights hit it its shape became obvious barry came running up next to her jesus christ the body was dressed in a business suit under a trenchcoat it lay skewed on its side the face visible now in the headlights a dark pool had formed under the head but amy wasnt able to pay any attention to other details she stood transfixed unable to tear her eyes from the awful vacant stare of the victim the dead man was allan boscacci part two excuse me are you a mr hardy it was all he could do to remain polite with the sweet young waitress it was date night and he was out with his wife having the worlds best chicken at the zuni cafe everyone in his world orbit knew that wednesday night with frannie was the one time he was absolutely not to be disturbed to further that end he had taken to leaving his cellphone and pager at home he put down his fork midbite used his napkin nodded and forced a polite smile i have that distinction he said you have a telephone call frannie thinking the same thought as hardy that it must be one of the kids and if they were interrupting date night it was a true emergency was halfway out of her chair when the waitress added an amy wu glitsky in his uniform and on his way to the ring of police cars in the lot stopped in his tracks changed directions and walked over to a subdued group who stood in a knot under the pool of light from the pole lamp by the pay booth he nodded all around said to hardy and frannie what are you two doing here hardy motioned to the circle that was now crawling with police they asked us not to leave until theyd talked to us were waiting he halfturned you remember my associate amy wu hardy paused came out with it she discovered the body wu came forward still a bit unsteady and gave glitsky her hand good to see you again sir glitsky held onto her hand squinted down into her face have you been drinking yes sir she said a few down at lou the greeks barry and i but were fine now the other man came forward introduced himself barry hess said he was whod called glitsky took that in stepped toward the crowd by the body stopped again anybody get statements from you two yet he asked both hess and wu as the people whod discovered the body both could probably look forward to a long night in a small interrogation room no sir hess replied ill try to get somebody over here soon glitsky said then he closed in on frannie i can see your husband who lives for parties like this one but why are you here she forced a weak smile it started out as date night right of course great timing glitsky said you okay frannie nodded but maybe wed be more comfortable in a car with the heat on glitsky tossed his head toward hardys car go on ahead ill send somebody over after wus short interview at the scene with sergeant belou she had promised to come and give a better more coherent statement at the hall tomorrow she didnt want to be with barry anymore it was obvious to frannie that badly shaken by the murder and still very drunk she didnt want to go home alone either so she asked wu to come and stay with them at their house tonight then dismas could take her down here tomorrow where she could do any more business that needed to be done at the hall pick up her car wu passed out on the drive home they had to wake her up to let her off at the house with frannie while hardy drove around the neighborhood a constant ritual and tried to find a parking place by the time he got back to the house she was asleep again on the foldout bed in the family room behind the kitchen hardy couldnt sleep sometime well after midnight he swung quietly out of bed pulled on a pair of drawstring gray sweatpants and went downstairs a bulb over the stove threw out about fifteen watts in the otherwise dark room and hardy opened the refrigerator and stared into it what he craved was some alcohol get his brain to stop its endless looping today thered been the long nap in the afternoon no wine with lunch an interrupted dinner the drunken condition of amy wu passed out on the foldabed and frannies lack of interest in a nightcap had somehow constrained him from a drink when theyd gotten home nightcap a harmless little old nightcap maybe hed have it now a couple of fingers of gin and peppermint schnapps over crushed ice it would help him sleep finally and god knew he had to get some sleep if he was going to be any good at work tomorrow sleep had to be the first priority if he had one short one now the only effect would be sleep hed wake up refreshed strong for whatever challenges the day might bring and with boscaccis murder there would be lots of them but something kept him from opening the freezer from reaching for the crushed ice they kept a threelegged stool in the kitchen because frannie needed it to reach the higher shelves and suddenly the refrigerator still open hardy found himself sitting on it leaning over elbows on his knees in the dimness stove light refrigerator light he turned his hands over looked at his palms there was no shake closing his eyes he dropped his head sighed audibly sir are you all right wu was a spectral shape in the doorway barefoot wrapped in the comforter theyd provided she came into the light he looked up raised his hand in greeting im trying to make the critical midnight snack decision could you eat something do you have some aspirin first sure hardy reached into the top drawer right next to the refrigerator where hed taken to storing the bottle so he could get it with his coffee so he wouldnt have to walk the extra steps to the bathroom how many you need whats the legal limit she asked im impressed sir i didnt know you could cook i cant really if its not in that one black pan im hopeless but that pan i know all its secrets i treasure it for what thats worth no soap just salt and a wipe nothing ever sticks its magic hardy had grabbed one of his daughters bathrobes and wu had put it on to come and eat now they sat kittycorner to each other at the dining room table splitting a very runny fouregg omelette of fried salami artichoke hearts cheddar cheese sourdough bread they both had cups of hot ovaltine hardy had closed the connecting door to the kitchen so his family wouldnt wake up but still he whispered and you can drop the sir if you want i realize that my august personage is intimidating but somewhere beneath the awesome authority figure beats what mr buffett calls a schoolboy heart warren buffett talks about a schoolboy heart hardy shook his head no but jimmy does wu couldnt quite get to a smile ive got a searing headache and youve got a schoolboy heart want to trade no thanks but they can remain our little secrets hardy tore a piece of the bread and sopped up some melted cheese anyway that pan my mother got it from her mother and gave it to me when i went away to college i bet she missed it not for long hardy pushed some egg around my folks both died my freshman year of college plane crash im sorry i didnt know that well it was a long time ago im over it by now wu squeezed her eyes shut fighting her hangover then put down her fork you are really pretty much sometimes i have to concentrate to remember them at all even what they looked like and their voices forget it thats what i wish the most i had some memory for their voices but i cant hear them do you mind if i ask you how long that took before you felt i dont know normal again it was a while he met her eyes certainly more than four months wu blinked a couple of times i keep wishing id done something more somehow something my dad would have approved of he didnt approve of your being a lawyer i dont know more i think he didnt approve of how i lived you know no i dont i mean being almost thirty not married no kids oh god i hurt she pressed her hands up against her temples and the great irony is that one of the reasons i stayed in school and became a lawyer was to make him happy even if he didnt like me i could always be a good student and i thought that pleased him so i kept at it but it really didnt matter why do you think he didnt like you i dont know maybe i was too much like my mom she left him left us both really when i was thirteen another guy she divorced a year later then a few after that she fell silent pushed again at her temples drew a pained breath eat some eggs hardy said nothings worse than cold eggs is your mom still around wu took a bite shook her head no she got emphysema she died about ten years ago but really she hadnt been in the picture for so long her dying wasnt so hard for me even though that sounds bad but my dad she swallowed took another bite drank some chocolate oh man she said hardy waited while she ate and gathered some strength anyway my dad he regretted that he didnt marry a pure chinese instead he marries mom you know a black woman and his family just hates her and then i come along and look like her at least colorwise she stopped and it wasnt like he didnt try to be nice to me but you can tell if your parent doesnt like you you really can nothing you do is right and i guess i lost patience with trying all the time and getting nothing back in return and so then i got mad at him and then she swiped a finger under one eye and then he dies before you can fix it up she shook her head im sorry i dont mean to dump on you its all right i knew something was bothering you i thought it might be something like this you lose your dad its not trivial then with the extra baggage have you thought about maybe taking some time off letting some of this settle out from work god no works the thing thats keeping me sane because it keeps you so busy you dont have to deal with the other personal stuff she started to say something then pushed back from the table pulled the robe close around her she dropped her head shook it slowly side to side side to side they remained at the dining room table the dishes pushed to one side second cups of ovaltine now forgotten had grown tepid in front of them hardy didnt want to add to wus pain right now by criticizing her performance in the bartlett case but she introduced the topic herself laying it all out in a torrent of words she had loved the idea of finessing brandt of snookering boscacci these arrogant men would see that she was good could hold her own in a fair fight take that dad it should have all worked out still you really should have nailed down andrews plea before you even tried to make any kind of deal with allan i realize that now i just got caught up in the rush of it if i could do it i couldnt believe that once andrew saw the evidence he wouldnt realize he had to lose except if it wasnt about the evidence to him but its always about the evidence no not always oj wasnt about the evidence patty hearst mark dooher you remember wess famous case ask him if it was about the evidence no it was about the passion and commitment of the defense the vision thing but you dont need that if you already have an out and andrew had an out you call that an out an eightyear top her arms crossed she sat back defiant the other alternatives were too risky i still believe its madness to let him go to trial not if he didnt do it wu closed her eyes pushed on the lids with her fingers please sir not you too its not whether he did anything thats law ia its whether they can prove it and they probably can because he probably did hardy jumped on that aha you said probably at last doubt enters wu shook her head not really not reasonable doubt anyway not enough doubt to gamble his life away which brings us back full circle all right hardy said lets even go on the assumption that hes guilty what else do you know about him i mean personally with all respect who cares its not who he is its what he did no sometimes its who he is who the jury sees if you can make them believe hes somebody who literally wouldnt hurt a fly theyll never believe he killed a human being or if you gave him a compelling enough reason its jealousy sir diz i mean he probably thought it was a good enough reason at the time but no jury in the world not even in san francisco is going to buy it enough to let him off you dont get to kill people youre jealous of all right how about his home life hes a spoiled rich kid not a good sell but abandoned by his father long ago right and pissed about it havent i heard about him needing anger management therapy maybe he did it but it was literally out of his power to control you yourself got abandoned by your mother you can certainly sell a jury on the rage hardy saw his cup of chocolate lifted it and took a drink made a face look at dan white he sneaks into city hall and shoots the mayor and a supervisor dead one fine afternoon and a jury of his peers basically lets him walk because he ate too many twinkies that morning he didnt walk no but he got less than the eight years andrew didnt want to give away my point is now youre in it youve got an opportunity with the sevenohseven to get a preview of what the witnesses will say at the trial she stopped him how do i do that that hearings not about evidence its wu listen to me its about whatever you can make it about youre entitled to call witnesses about the boys amenability to the juvenile system the judge isnt going to stop you from calling just about anybody you want he doesnt want to make a mistake and give you that issue on appeal so you call andrews best friend you call the guy who identified him in the lineup you call his school principal his counselor his parents his sister you call his shrink youre just trying to find out what happened not just that night but to andrew you dont know what happened that night andrew doesnt know what happened he wasnt there for the murder how could he know hell he called nine one one why would he do that hardy sat back himself crossed his own arms dared a smile at the risk of sounding like david freeman you can actually have fun with this he came forward intent now but youve got to commit wu whether or not he actually did it your job is to get him off any legal way you can if hed have copped the plea okay then you got him a deal he could live with but he didnt he couldnt live with it have you asked yourself why that might have been hes got to think he can get off and why looking at all the evidence arrayed against him would he think that is he stupid does he think a jury wont convict him somehow no i dont think hes stupid well could it be that he believes the system will work because hes innocent i mean is that even a possibility if it is then hes a very unlucky guy okay and if hes unlucky what does that mean she frowned shrugged i give up what it means someone else killed these victims she rolled her eyes the famous other dude but dont say it it doesnt have to be a real person it just has to be a believable story that a jury can take as an alternative lets say the teacher whats his name mooney okay mooney had another girlfriend before andrews laura is it yes laura right so this other girlfriend might have been jealous too as jealous as andrew was and maybe she also told a friend of hers and lo and behold her father also owns a gun and she had no alibi that night wu started to reply but hardy held up a hand im not saying theres any of this but theres something out there somewhere i guarantee it theres always something he paused looked directly into her face at any rate wu thats what im going to be looking for it took her a minute for the message to sink in but then wu sat up straight you what do you mean you me your boss im going to sit second chair with you on this but no no but im afraid her mouth hung open for an instant she swallowed hard looked down then up if you dont think i can do the job sir then you might as well fire me no although honestly we considered it you realize that nearly every decision youve made with this client from the beginning has been dead wrong dont you that youve compromised the firms reputation to a significant degree unable to deny it she could only nod he let her live with the harsh reality for a minute then softened it somewhat but everyone makes mistakes amy everyone and we dont want the firm to lose you beyond that on a personal note ive got to bear my own share of the blame for where this has all gotten to i didnt do my job and what was that supervising you advising against your deal right from the first minute i heard about it letting you go ahead afterwards you want more ive got em believe me but now weve got an opportunity to right those wrongs both of us he leaned in toward her listen by turning down the plea andrew basically bet us that he didnt do it whether or not we believe him the firm signed on to keep the da from proving he did i still like to think that we can get this kid off you and me together yes get him off completely maybe even that it happens sometimes you prepare the sevenohseven hearing on the kind of person andrew is whether he was temporarily insane or had a lousy childhood or organic brain damage from braces that didnt fit right or if hes got uncontrollable rage that should put him in a program instead of jail me i try to find a good alternative story time the trial comes around weve already seen the das case at the hearing so we choose the best option and run with it so he goes to trial after all i was hoping there was some chance with the sevenohseven that i could at least keep him down as a juvenile not likely hardy said murder one with specials goes to adult court every time well then why wouldnt every murder go adult murder one does some homicides dont but theyve got to be really close to an accident or a retarded kid or an abused kid who kills his dad something like those a righteous oneeightyseven the code section for first degree murderthe kid goes up i dont care if hes fourteen years old so why are they having this hearing in the first place if the outcome is foreordained hardy broke a sad smile because you made them wu it might not have been your original plan but you made them before theyd even come close to removing the body the citys power elite had descended upon the allday lot besides glitsky his boss and his underling police chief frank batiste and homicide lieutenant marcel lanier appeared within fifteen minutes of each other of course clarence jackman needed to be on hand the victim after all had been his chief deputy even a tuxedoclad mayor washington himself called from whatever party hed been attending showed up in his limo everyone agreed that this was no ordinary homicide the tendrils of boscaccis career extended near and far in half a dozen directions over the course of his life hed either personally or administratively been involved with the prosecution of a wide range of wrongdoers gang members whitecollar criminals and drug dealers scam artists rapists and murderers but hed also been extremely active in the citys hyperactive and often acrimonious labor negotiations politically he had been slated to run jackmans next campaign and his abrasive nononsense style had not enamored him to any of the das six or eight challengers by the time all these heavyweights were ready to go home theyd unanimously agreed to assign an event number to the investigation the police department like all city departments had a budget and was expected to stay within it but when something extraordinary happened an earthquake or a papal visit say the mayor would agree that the event would get a number and extraordinary expenses would come from the general fund practically this provided nearly limitless funds to allow the work to proceed inspectors wouldnt have to worry about their overtime the crime lab could run any sophisticated tests it needed beyond the routine the whole apparatus for a welcome change working in unison toward a common goal abe glitsky not only as deputy chief of inspectors but as a former head of homicide was the logical choice to take point now before the building had come alive before any other staff had come in glitsky sat in his office door closed with jeff elliot the influential writer of the citytalk column for the chronicle elliot and glitsky were both members of jackmans informal kitchen cabinet and had a lengthy and decent history between them not exactly close personal friends they nevertheless got along about as well as a cop and a reporter could maybe part of that was because in spite of glitskys hatred of the reporters basic prying function he couldnt help but admire elliots essential bravery in the face of his ongoing struggle with multiple sclerosis the bearded columnist lived and worked without reference to his wheelchair his crutches his specially designed car so he could get around there was no hint of victimhood about elliot who had more claim to it than most he was a true mensch and glitsky respected him at least elliot was saying we dont have to talk about leshawn brodie which was the original plan for todays interview as you may recall behind his desk glitsky sipped at his tea id be curious to hear your take on that though just as a matter of interest whats to take your call was the only thing that made any sense and in fact until the clowns who picked him up let him escape he let the statement hang what were you supposed to do storm the bus apparently but what i dont understand is all the vehemence the rush to lay blame not that i feel anything personally of course im a cop and therefore have no feelings of course elliot said that goes without saying why would you need them but you know as well as anybody how these frenzies develop its lucky for you that youre not an elected official brodie could have done you in in spite of the fact that it was the right decision no dont answer that it wasnt really a question but off the record it makes me think ive about peter principled out im not cut out for spin i must have the wrong genes or something i dont know some of us neanderthals in the media find it quaintly refreshing you say something you mean what you say most of the time it even makes sense the public can either deal with it or not elliot shifted in his wheelchair you dont watch out you might become a cultural hero glitsky ran a finger over the scar in his lips unlikely he said but give me an event number and a murder to investigate i may not be totally useless which brings us back to allan a brusque nod it does although i have to tell you this is too soon for me to have anything you could use were nowhere we sent a couple of inspectors out last night to canvass the neighborhood nobody heard or saw anything i was actually hoping you might have something for me elliot considered for a moment then shook his head he wasnt everybodys favorite guy but i never caught a whiff of anything particular that would make somebody want to kill him i hope to get a chance to talk to clarence whos got to be devastated by this he is but we talked last night and hes as mystified as anybody allan was a rock came in early stayed late great administrator loyal as a dog he fire anybody lately elliot asked a couple were checking them the purging of the deadwood from the earlier das administration had been an ongoing albeit lowkey program for the past three years to the affected parties though glitsky would bet the termination was probably not as lowkey as it seemed to others but to tell you the truth jeff were going to find out about everything in allans life this is something i know how to do as opposed to going to meetings and eating lunch with businesspeople and for a change weve got the manpower and budget to do it right if this killing wasnt completely random and i cant believe that it was well find who did it he looked up slightly startled did i just say something quotable because the allday parking lot was cordoned off with police tape and he couldnt park there jason brandt had to find a place nearly six blocks south of the hall of justice and walk up he was standing in the hallway outside of clarence jackmans office at eightthirty when treya glitsky got to the door can i help you she asked introducing herself unnecessarily all the assistant das even those who worked mostly offsite knew who she was brandt pulled his hands from his pockets and introduced himself as well he feigned an easy smile but it was clear that he was wound up i was hoping to get a minute with mr jackman she made a face of regret i dont remember an appointment its about allan treya drew a heavy breath well then she put her key into the door that poor man she said it seems so so completely unbelievable she shook her head clearing the thought then came back to him i dont know when or even if mr jackman will be in this morning i know he was at the crime scene until well after midnight then went to allans home after that so it might be a while if at all youre welcome to wait if youd like brandt thanked her and took the chair next to jackmans door treya opened the blinds turned on her computer checked her voice mail then the wall clock the telephone rang and she picked it up district attorneys office she lowered her voice hi no not yet ill call you as soon as he does no really a pause the hint of a smile me too bye when she hung up brandt asked was that your husband so much for subtle i read that he was in charge of the investigation i read that too he was gone before i was completely awake this morning i cant imagine who would have done this can you she sat up is that what you wanted to see clarence about brandt shook his head no he hesitated its a little weird to talk about allans work and not his death but with him gone now i dont know it seemed important to tell mr jackman what was going on in this case so it didnt fall through the cracks it doesnt have anything to do with allans murder whats the case slightly embarrassed now brandt started to shrug it away then spoke anyway just up at the ygc he went on to tell the story andrew bartlett the juvenile proceedings the scotched plea bargain deal amy treya nearly jumped at the name wait a minute amy wu yes maam and this plea deal it was between her and allan right she was coming down here to explain it to him how the kid andrew her client had screwed her or screwed them both anyway allan probably would have gone ballistic having noticed something in her expression he stopped what nothing im sure its nothing then after another pause she said did you know that amy was the one who found his body pardon she nodded really abe my husband mentioned it last night when he got home only because we both know her a little they were all down there at the scene brandts eyes went inward while he processed the information was she hurt too he asked with real concern is she all right now who amy from treyas expression she wasnt following him i mean was she around when allan got shot is she okay i think shes fine im sure she is for a moment brandt felt lightheaded with relief the feeling surprised him and it must have showed is amy a friend of yours treya asked no he answered perhaps too quickly just a colleague were in this case together on opposite sides anyway i knew she was planning to talk to allan yesterday when you said she found him i thought she might have been with him when it happened no treya said she was with another guy at the greeks and they found him when they went to get their cars who was the other guy i dont know i think just some guy abes going to talk to both of them hell find out hardy came out of the elevator into the lobby at his office in the reception area phyllis with a pinched and pained expression her hands clasped nervously in front of her stood up and said im sorry sir i told him he couldnt just walk in but he said you wouldnt mind if you didnt like it he said you could call the police who are we talking about phyllis lieutenant glitsky hardy showed a bit of teeth the ghost of a grin hes a deputy chief now phyllis he thinks the rules dont apply to him anymore in the office the deputy chief was on the couch elbows on his knees as soon as hardy closed the door behind him glitsky started in why didnt you tell me last night that amy wu had had a major fight with allan boscacci yesterday afternoon about three hours before he died at the hall of justice which if your memory fails you is about two hundred yards from where he got shot did you imagine that this would not be relevant to his murder investigation or were you afraid that we would have sweated her on videotape last night which we absolutely would and should have done its good to see you too hardy said hows your morning been long already you want some tea i want some answers not mutually exclusive im having some coffee of course you are wheres wu now from the counter fiddling with his ingredients hardy turned i just this minute dropped her at the hall i turned her in directly to lanier so he could get the murder collar and make you look bad not that you seem to need much help on that score lately who put the bee in your bonnet about her jason brandt told treya about the fight evidently a pretty good one i dont know him brandt ask wu she does oh wait hardy said da up at youth guidance the bartlett case now the boscacci case not he turned pushed the button for the espresso machine came back around look abe im sorry i forgot to mention it last night but if you recall there were other things going on at the time you saw amy out at the lot she could barely walk she was so drunk ten minutes after you let us go she passed out on the way home in our car he grabbed his cup walked over to glitsky and sat kittycorner to him you know how she got drunk after her fight with allan she went over to lous and started pounding vodka which she continued to do without pause until she left to go home with barry or larry or jerry or whatever the hell his name was about five minutes before they discovered allan lous got six eight ten guys who were all trying to get into her pants for four hours in a row and will severally and individually swear that she didnt sneak out and shoot allan i too personally promise you that she didnt either you still should have told me about this last night who we interview and how is not your call diz hardy sipped his coffee i thought i already had apologized for that but if not i hereby solemnly do so again im still going to want to talk to her soon on tape and she no doubt will be thrilled to cooperate in any way she can did mr brandt actually accuse her of murder did he give you any kind of motive no he didnt even know what he was telling treya but when i heard about the fight i asked around at the hall people heard allan yelling at her way out in the hallway this was a couple of hours before he got hit all too true im sure but i guarantee a complete waste of your time wu did not kill allan abe is that really the best youve got glitsky sat back crossed a leg we dont have anything yet nothing from the scene except the slug too deformed for comparison at least using the computer not that we have anything to compare it with no casing one witness says maybe a car peeled out of the lot just before it got dark but he couldnt even swear to the color how about allans family how about them the wife is sedated right now clarence broke the news to her and she dissolved on him two kids eight and ten lost destroyed nothing there a pause what was he working on one active case thats it a murder at hardys questioning look glitsky explained hes been mostly assigning cases since he moved up to chief assistant okay whats the murder you remember the old guy matosian who poisoned his wife and himself in a suicide pact but miraculously survived but the point is theres no witnesses around that case whod want him dead otherwise allans played a role in putting away a thousand people over the years although you know they never blame the prosecutor hes just doing his job almost never a weary nod i know were going to look anyway were looking at everything then youll probably find it lets hope glitsky said even though its undoubtedly a complete waste of time for everybody would you please tell ms wu we want to see her at the hall as in now could that be arranged probably i really did drop her off down there an hour ago to get her car she was planning to go home and get some sleep but she might be in your outer office even as we speak hoping to chat with your august personagehood though you might want to ask around at lou the greeks first she was evidently the main event there last night people will remember her im sure they will he took a beat then do you think it could have been political hardys mouth went tight i dont know abe its a reach the campaign hasnt even begun yet and if you want to take somebody out you take out the candidate not his eventual campaign manager wouldnt you think he put his cup down looked into glitskys face but no physical evidence huh one deformed slug do you ever wish youd let yourself swear once in a while glitsky stood up brushed some imaginary lint from his uniform all the time diz he said all the darned time the pale polished wood of the door to hardys old office upstairs displayed a patchwork of bumper stickers imagine whirled peas kill your television practice random acts of kindness wouldnt it be great if schools had everything they needed and the government had to hold a bake sale to build a bomb support the right to arm bears jesus is coming and boy is he pissed perhaps twenty more in the same vein all of them to go with wes farrells collection of tshirts for not the first time as he stared at this monument to the first amendment right to freedom of speech and expression hardy wondered if theyd been smart to bring wes farrell aboard as one of the firms founding partners as a business move it had seemed defensible enough at the time farrell had come up the hard way in the legal profession taking one bleeding heart case after another forgiving nonpayments even while he was going broke himself but almost in spite of himself hed built a practice with solid referrals a few retained accounts lots of estate and trust work plus he practiced good lawyering he helped his clients cared about them found his own motivation in their interests in many ways leaving his superficial lack of professionalism aside he was the perfect attorney he dressed well in court deferred to judges respected the clerical staff and there was no question that now he more than carried his own weight in the firm but if phyllis thought hardy was slightly out of the lawyer mode farrell was well into the lunatic range although due to his good manners phyllis had not yet caught on and fortunately for wes and perhaps the rest of the firm phylliss entire range of migration at work consisted of the receptionists station and the strip of floor between that and the womens room she ate and took breaks in her chair in the lobby surrounded by her phones and the waisthigh polished mahogany circular cubby freeman had built for her back in when hed originally bought and renovated the building so far as hardy knew phyllis had never walked up the fourteen steps to his old office now farrells domain he was sure that if she had theyd have known it because shed have screamed in dismay before dying of chagrin and mortification on the spot hardy heard farrell talking within a telephone call he tapped once and opened the door hed worked in this space for most of a decade and the move from it had been if not traumatic then at least portentous a rubicon of sorts hed jettisoned his old desk his metal filing cabinets the sears furniture hed come up once after all the stuff had been taken out and stood in the empty room turning a page in his life now with farrells furnishings the place belonged heart and soul to the new guy and reflected some sense of who he was the first change the desk was so fundamental that hardy had never even considered it to him a desk obviously went in the middle of the room facing the door it was the podium from which you conducted business you could use it to create a sense of distance or formality most simply it held your work stuff farrell didnt think so he had placed his in one of the rooms corners underneath one of the sutter street windows there was a chair behind it but farrell almost never sat in it at the moment the chair along with the surface of the desk was cluttered with paper red folders threering binders yellow legal pads mail opened and unopened a months worth of newspapers everything overflowing onto everything else the corner desk placement left a relatively vast open space that farrell had essentially made into an informal living room when hardy came in farrell was stretched out tie and shoes off on the longer couch portion of his green matching sectional set in one corner an overgrown rubber tree draped itself over an arm of his wing chair a brass and bamboo magazine table held a small television in the other corner on the wall where hardys dartboard had presided farrell had mounted a smallish hoop for his nerf balls over by the barcounter there was still lots of room behind the couch for up to four people to play at the foosball table on the other wall by the desk farrell tended to use butcher paper on which he would draw flowcharts to track his various cases farrell held up a finger indicating hed be a minute hardy crossed over behind the couch picked up two nerf basketballs from the floor and took a shot then another he retrieved the balls did it again after a few rounds farrell said goodbye to whoever it was and sat up whats up he asked though youve got to be quick ive got a client coming up here in ten minutes so you cleaned up for him farrell checked all around looking for a problem couldnt find one the guys been in jail ten of the last twelve years and im afraid that in spite of my best efforts hes going back soon this will be the nicest room hes seen i like my clients to feel comfortable so how can i help you hardy tossed him the ball he was holding i cant find my darts i wonder if you might have carried them out inadvertently farrell shot patted his pockets i dont think so he went over and grabbed his jacket made a show of a search nope not here either when did you miss them just now a few minutes ago i was going to meditate as i like to do you check your desk everywhere i cant understand it i dont know where theyd go farrell looked at his watch im sure theyll turn up what were you meditating on hardy rested a haunch on the back of the sectional allan boscacci mostly amy a little bit ive hooked up with her on this juvenile case shes been handling and not a minute too soon either hows she connected to boscacci farrell had sat down and was tying his shoes hell of a thing though wasnt it i think im in the minority i usually am but i kind of liked the guy straight shooter no bullshit hardy nodded soberly i know i felt the same way anybody have a clue who did it or why or anything not yet abe was by here this morning we exchanged a few bon mots hardy hesitated he seemed to entertain the thought that it might have been amy farrell stopped with his shoes snapped his head up get out thats what i told him you know the deal that went south allan yelled at her and people heard but fortunately or not amy was at lou the greeks getting picked up and pasted about the time allan must have walked by outside so shes clear now right i dont think she ever wasnt but abe will get her statement on tape anyway because thats what he does he was still holding one of the nerf balls and dropped it onto the couch but still on amy clarence also called he was his usual lowkey and polite self but said that given the history of this bartlett affair to date with amy and allan and all that he was sure id understand why he was pushing for the sevenohseven to get bartlett back into adult court as soon as possible he couldnt let people even my good wellmeaning associates get away with manipulating his office think of the precedent think of it farrell said how soon whats today thursday hardy asked next tuesday five days five days thats what i said he cant do that hell hand us an appeal i said that too but i just now checked and theres no rule says he cant so he can on the appeal he says there cant be one since he could have filed on the kid directly as an adult to begin with hes taking the position that we cant base an appeal on some inadequacy in a hearing we should never have had to begin with but nobody can prepare for any kind of hearing in five days its just not doable that was more or less his point wes clarence wants the boy back upstairs where he belongs and he wants him there now to remove the taint as he so delicately phrased it after that we can waive time for the px the preliminary hearingand take as long as we want preparing for trial but andrews out of juvenile next week if clarence has anything to say about it and then hes looking at life without you dont want to let him get there no hardy said ive got that part figured out the rest of its a little murky farrell got to his feet tucked in his shirt buttoned up and grabbed his tie so are we still throwing that campaign kickoff party for our good friend clarence hardy wasnt laughing nothings easy he said stop the presses youre onto something phyllis buzzed telling him his client was here on his way up sorry but youve got to go farrell said this guy my client he really hates lawyers wu awoke at hardys house to another hangover of staggering proportions stabbing pain wracked every cell and joint in her body pinpoints of flashing light hovered in the periphery of her vision how many drinks had she had at lous she thought shed counted six but it might have been seven or eight even nine more than one guy was buying hoping to get lucky and lou was famous for his heavy pour nine drinks eighteen to twenty ounces of vodka she weighed about a hundred and thirty pounds she was lucky to be alive after hardy had driven her to the allday and shed picked up her car he had recommended that she take yet another sick day go home and sleep and thats what shed done after a sixhour rest at around three oclock she called work and left the message that shed be back in the office tomorrow then in jeans and a turtleneck sweater she walked from her apartment down to the marina green the sun sparkled off the bay and though the breeze was light it carried a chill she crawled over some enormous breakwater boulders and sat invisible down in among the stones facing the water and hugging herself for warmth there she cried herself out when she came back to her apartment she found that hardy had left a message glitsky really for truly did want a statement from her right away the hearing would be in five days next tuesday five days she played the message again thinking she couldnt have heard it right but it sounded the same the second time she sat in her chair and stared blankly out her window five days was impossible she couldnt possibly prepare but apparently thats all the time she had the da and perhaps the judge were sending a very clear message to her venting the systems righteous pique it wasnt going to be a matter of choice anymore of what shed prefer of what she could work out with brandt or jackman with the clock now ticking she had to meet with the norths get together with hardy above all find out more about who andrew really was if she had only five days she had to start now on some real defense that would be worthy of the name her hangover wasnt forgotten her head still throbbed with a dull and persistent pain but she couldnt allow herself the luxury of suffering she had to go to work lifting the phone she punched in the norths number glitskys demand for her statement to the extent that it had registered as important at all was nowhere among her priorities linda north greeted her phone call warmly enough after all wu had partially convinced them that shed played a significant role in keeping andrew in the juvenile system for the time being at least he wasnt going to adult court yet and he still wasnt looking at life in prison wus strategy had been harrowing and tense but ultimately successful they still had confidence in her but linda had been just leaving the house to get her hair done when she picked up wus call she told her that this wasnt really a good time it was her regular weekly hair appointment and if she missed it michael would simply give away the time forever to someone else and shed have to rearrange her entire schedule it was a pain but that was how he was all these artiste hairdressers were the same she was sure wu understood in any event hal couldnt come home right now anyway hed already missed a lot of work because of this whole problem with andrew and when he wasnt in the office linda told her there were always problems but if it was important and timesensitive wu should just call hal at work and meet with him there hed fill linda in when they got together later wu trying to be flexible had suggested that she meet them both at their home when hals work was done and shed finished with her hair but no it wasnt a good night for that either hal had some blacktie stag foodandwine event linda was planning to see andrew later on at the ygc but if wu needed to talk to one of them right away she should really just go to hals office and talk with him there that would work out there wasnt any real crisis with andrew or anything was there if not hal was better at details anyway he would be the one to talk to he and linda had great communication and hed keep her informed of anything amy thought was important the headquarters of north cinemas was located on battery street near the embarcadero the threestory building itself was large it took up most of the block with a long and low modern look brick and glass wu parked onsite under the building in a reserved spot next to hals to which the attendant had directed her still in her jeans and sweater the norths might not have been anxious to meet with her but shed left her own home in a hurry she took the elevator to the top floor then turned right and walked a long hallway covered with a soothing green industrial carpet the walls were adorned on both sides with framed movie posters dozens of them having checked in and been told by the polite spikehaired young blond woman at the desk that mr north was expecting her and would be able to meet with her shortly she waited in the cool and spacious reception area flipping through the pages of entertainment weekly through the floortoceiling tinted window she looked across the bay to treasure island then to berkeley beyond in the clear afternoon light under the breezeswept sky both looked close enough to touch when she finished a cursory perusal of the magazine she looked at her watch and frowned giving it one more minute she ran out of patience got up and walked to the reception desk again im sorry is mr north being held up the young woman looked up im sure hes busy he said hed be right out yes but i wonder if you would mind checking again its been fifteen minutes the woman lowered her voice spoke conspiratorially fifteen minutes is nothing wu forced a tolerant smile im afraid it is to me would you mind trying him again please amy wu she popped her gum and shrugged sure i remember pushing a few buttons on the console in front of her she spoke into her headset hal ms wus still waiting a pause okay sure ill tell her she ended the connection looked at wu he says two more minutes but she held up her hand opened and closed it twice slowly the message clear it was going to be closer to ten it was eight projecting energy and command hal appeared from out of nowhere and suddenly was standing in front of where wu sat amy sorry to have kept you all kinds of madness going on back there as usual were supposed to open the new disney tonight and somehow somebody over in walnut creek lost six reels tell me where the hell you mislay six reels id like to know i gotta think somebodys stealin them she stood and they shook hands anyway im here now whats the problem i thought we were coasting on the legal stuff for a while until we got this next hearing scheduled is everything okay with andrew wu was somewhat gratified to hear that both parents at least asked about andrews welfare yes sir i think hes fine im planning to go on up and see him after i leave here good he told linda he thinks youre upset with him about what he did hell be glad to see you so linda already visited him today she said she was going tonight too did she i dont know whats today thursday thursday is normally her bridge group in the morning i think but maybe she went up youd have to ask her anyway so whats up you need to see us all the sudden you want to stay out here by the way go in to my office whatever here is fine i just wanted to tell you that they have scheduled the next hearing she paused and its for next tuesday the slab face went into a shock riff next tuesday he counted silently to himself five days thats like it might as well be tomorrow isnt it i thought the courts liked to move slow on this stuff most of the time they do in this case the das mad andrew didnt admit when he thought he was going to hes expressing his displeasure thats bullshit fuck him yes sir hals scowl deepened his voice suddenly harsh and i thought the plea change was part of your strategy all along now here we are sandbagged again whats that about wu expecting something like this had prepared her reply its about allan boscacci getting shot sir the whole thing would have rolled off his back im sure but now weve got clarence jackman himself with his shorts in a twist hes just asserting his authority anyway im going to appeal the date but my boss says its not likely to change your boss she nodded dismas hardy you might have heard of him hes good and this is really very good news if the hearing goes ahead on this accelerated time frame hes going to come aboard to help out and i pay extra for that no the firm covers his time and expenses we didnt make this problem with the da but we dont think its right to ask you to pay for it either ill be putting in a lot of hours though just to let you know we may be looking at another retainer payment especially if andrew goes up to adult which were going to fight tooth and nail yes sir but on the assumption that the sevenohseven is going ahead as scheduled on tuesday i wanted to bring you and linda up to speed on how its structured so we can be prepared how to proceed jesus hal said it never ends he threw a glance over his shoulder all the work awaiting him behind one of those doors then came back to wu maybe we want to sit down they did all right he said shoot over the next twenty minutes or so wu gave him the short course for all of its apparent complexity a proceeding concerned itself with only one question is the minor amenable to treatment as a juvenile from the perspective of the courts and the justice system this determination was critical despite the insistence by some that one of the goals of adult incarceration should be rehabilitation of the inmate for an ultimate return to society in practice adult jail and prison time was essentially punishment by contrast the juvenile systems ethic took on a far more hopeful and optimistic cast though incarceration was part of the process the goal was primarily to rehabilitate not punish the minor if you were in the juvenile system the bureaucracy contemplated your eventual redemption you still had a chance to turn out all right to be a good citizen and a productive member of society your youthful sins forgiven so the system provided not just the stick of incarceration but the carrots of education psychological and career counseling job training and a host of other social welfare programs because of these programs and treatments each minor in the juvenile system would typically interact with an assortment of counselors educators and social workers and not just his warden and guards but this vast bureaucratic apparatus of hope was not to be wasted on those it could not help who were not amenable to treatment these were juveniles who by virtue of their callousness cruelty history and crimes must in justice be viewed as adults society would rightfully treat them as incorrigible and not squander its limited resources in a doomed and hopeless bid to try and rehabilitate them and further these lost causes wouldnt be permitted to contaminate the salvageable kids by their sophisticated and fixed criminality but first the courts needed an objective formula to identify those who might be helped and those who must be abandoned to that end for violent crimes five criteria for amenability had evolved if in the courts judgment the minor failed the test for any one of these criteria then that person would be found not amenable to treatment in the juvenile system and handed up to superior court to be tried as an adult these criteria were degree of the minors criminal sophistication the likelihood of the minors rehabilitation prior to the expiration of the juvenile courts jurisdiction ie the minors twentyfifth birthday the minors previous delinquent history the success of previous attempts by the juvenile system to rehabilitate the minor and the circumstances and gravity of the offense for which the minor has been charged okay north said so whats all that mean it means were going to have to talk you and me and linda about which if any of these criteria apply to andrew i mean weve got a pretty good idea about number five the gravity of the offense its murder so its serious but we fight that one when we get to it meanwhile ive got to know about all the others so that if any of them seem to apply to him we work up a defense or at least an explanation for the court north was frowning deeply sitting all the way back in the couch his hands in his lap his legs straight out and crossed at the ankles havent we already done that remember that second day at the house i think it was when you wanted to know all about the blowups and we talked about his shrink and all that sure i remember but this is getting down much more to the nuts and bolts individual events reasons he shouldnt really be considered an adult character issues right he turned his head to face her but didnt you say the other day that we didnt want to bring up character once we did that then the prosecution could introduce their own stuff and jump all over us you were listening wu didnt seem very happy about it damn straight im a good listener so now youre saying we need character maybe its a bit of a risk certainly its a different situation but the bottom line is we need to defeat all the criteria every one of them or andrew goes up north sighed heavily cast his gaze out to the view ill talk to linda maybe between us we can come up with something you got those things the criteria written down yes right here okay leave them with me and if we can come up with something concrete you dont already know well get back to you hows that wu arrived before her client did in the cold and tiny room the scratched table the ancient chairs the antiseptic oldschool smell suddenly she noticed the bars of sunlight high on the opposite wall and she realized that shed been awake only for a little over three hours total today and the daylight was already nearly gone and wouldnt her father have been proud of her for that for wasting the day or the past weeks she rested her head in her hands as a fresh wave of nausea and revulsion rolled and broke over her an unconscious moan escaped are you all right she hadnt heard the key hadnt been aware that the door had opened now bailiff cottrell the young one with the old eyes stood in the entrance holding a restraining hand up for andrew waiting for a sign that the interview was still on it wasnt immediately forthcoming so he asked are we good here maam eventually she nodded and the bailiff lowered his hand let her client come in closed the door andrew warily kept his eyes on her as he pulled his chair over sat on the front inch of the seat are you mad at me he asked wus mouth was dry her face clammy she closed her eyes for an instant ran her hand over her forehead no im not mad at you andrew i thought you would be because i didnt do what you wanted me to he had his hands clasped together between his knees but i couldnt say i did it i know she said i wouldnt worry about it now its done the thing we have to do now is prevail at this hearing get you mandated in the juvenile system so you stay here but i thought that was already over with confusion played itself all over his features i mean thats what everybody is so mad about right not really theyre mad that now they have to go through the hassle of trying to move you back up to adult court so youre saying your deal even though i didnt agree to it got me another chance anyway yeah suddenly the look of confusion cleared her client tentatively smiled well then if your job is my defense how could it have been wrong maybe the guy you made the deal with wasnt as careful as he needed to be either you ever think of that maybe it wasnt all your fault wu wouldnt think ill of the dead especially not today but andrews rationale released some small bit of the tension she felt well she said at least some of it was my fault but thats very nice of you to say and i could use a little nice for the first time with andrew she felt something like a connection but there was still the business the five criteria for amenability to the juvenile system after she had painstakingly gone through the list for him she sat back with her arms crossed over her chest we need to talk about each of these individually andrew she said if the court finds you not amenable on any one of them you go up any one thats the rule and im afraid weve got less than a week to prepare but these criteria andrew scratched at the tabletop most of them dont apply to me at all i dont even know what they mean by criminal sophistication or if i can be rehabilitated rehabilitated from what your violent criminal past he looked a question at her i dont have one i know but i dont think sophistication is the problem neither is rehab but gravity is everyone seemed to understand that one immediately yes he gestured around the small room if it helps me get out of here but i was saying even on gravity if i didnt do it he raised his eyes hopeful but she didnt want to raise those hopes she came forward and reached across the table a hand over his forearm this hearing isnt about whether you did it andrew i need you to understand that its only about whether you go up as an adult or not theyre going to pretty much assume the gravity criteria and they only need the one im afraid so so im going to lose we may lose yes for now but well get a real chance in adult court we ought to just go straight there then if this hearing is just a formality no she said weve got to try anything that keeps you down here even for on extra minute is what we want to do in his eyes she saw real worry perhaps he was starting to realize where his refusal to admit had left him left them both so weve got to talk about some real issues andrew my partner mr hardy hes got a few ideas about gravity were not just going to give that to them but the other criteria we dont want any surprises with those either i dont know what theyd be no i dont either but thats why they call them surprises he started with some marginal enthusiasm as they discussed possible witnesses for the various criteria the psychologist hed seen for anger management his school counselor one of the probation officers up here but before theyd gone too far the enormity of what he was facing seemed to drag him down his focus wavered then abandoned him entirely and wu not at peak performance levels herself found it difficult to humor him from her perspective his primary emotion was sorrow for himself he stopped every few sentences stared straight ahead or down at the table he fought back tears a couple of times why should we bother doing this hed say were never going to win or im such a loser this isnt going to make any difference or itd be better for everybody if i just killed myself wouldnt it that last one stopped wu why would you want to do that andrew what good would that do itd end all this stupidity if theyre going to put me away anyway wu scratched at the table summoning her patience thats what were trying to avoid it wont work though will it not if we dont try but even to her the words sounded condescending the kind of adult pablum hed been forced to eat a hundred times or even if we do he said she tried to keep him on track but it was a long uphill slog until they finally summoned him for dinner after he left she felt she had no reserve of strength and remained sitting elbows on the table on her papers and notes she rested her head on her palms the heels of them pressing into her eyes she heard a knock excuse me ms wu bailiff cottrell come to close up the room stared down at her from the doorway she must have nearly let herself doze off are you feeling all right fine im fine you dont look well can i get you something some water moving slowly she leaned back in her chair how about a head transplant and maybe a new body to go with it you couldnt get a better face he said and you definitely dont need a new body at the moment she felt about as attractive as a garbage truck and she almost laughed at the compliment but he was she thought just trying to be nice thank you she said im sorry to have kept you waiting while i just sat here its been a long day she started gathering the papers and folders shed spread out over the table ms wu let me help you he said no thanks ive got it and you can call me amy ray if you didnt remember he said then stood waiting at the door while she finished up throwing everything into her heavy lawyers briefcase snapping it closed when she stood then leaned over to pick the briefcase up he said that thing must weigh a ton at least let me take that exhausted her head still pounding from her hangover she finally nodded that would be nice he stepped into the room picked up the briefcase gave her some support with a hand under her elbow youre sure youre okay to walk in fact she had some question about that but she took a step and then another and in a minute they were outside in the hall and then at the main entrance to the cabins cottrell accompanied her outside to the razorwire gate and opened it for her they stopped there and he put down her briefcase turning to say goodbye she looked up at him their eyes met for an instant and she thought she caught a glimpse of that earlier wariness she had noticed in the courtroom again his eyes seemed old and somehow empty but it was as though he had a switch he could throw suddenly a bit of life came into them your client seems pretty down he said she blew out heavily i dont blame him she said hes screwing himself hows that i dealt him an eightyear top and he turned it down now hes looking at lwop theyre moving him to adult not yet but its probable im trying to get him to help me but he doesnt seem to know the word cooperate maybe hes just scared im sure he is and he should be oh god she brought a hand up to her head squeezed at her temples with her other hand she grabbed the side of the gate for support cottrell stepped up grabbed both of her shoulders you look like youre going to faint maybe you want to sit down she nodded and leaned into him he put his arm around her and walked her back toward the cabins from the lobby of the admin building down the hill jason brandt saw the bailiff carrying her briefcase walking with her to the gate where they stopped and spent a minute talking he didnt want her to see him at least not until she was alone and so he remained where he was pretty much out of sight wu hadnt left his thoughts since the night theyd spent together and now brandt was unable to take his eyes off her he had wanted to get to know her since the first time hed seen her back right after his law school days but one or the other of them had always had other relationships going or big cases and shed more or less slipped from his consciousness until she showed up in his courtroom last week when finally hed thought there had been no impediment then he really believed that running into her at the balboa had been a sign there had been real chemistry between them that night something uncommon and he believed maybe even a little magical as a general rule he didnt do onenight stands the encounter like it or not had seemed as though it meant something maybe something important then this morning thinking for a moment that because she had been near boscacci when hed been shot that she too might have been physically hurt made him realize that hed been way too harsh with her the other morning okay shed made a mistake by not telling him right away that bartletts case wasnt really settled but maybe it had been innocent after all something hed never really given her a chance to assert maybe theyd just started talking at the balboa and in all the personal stuff theyd shared including the sex the professional business between them had receded into the background it certainly had for him so he didnt want this antagonism between them to go on any longer he wanted to apologize for his overreaction at least see what she had to say to that and just now when hed first seen her coming out of the cabins he thought hed take the opportunity to talk to her one way or another he thought that the bartlett matter was going to be over in a few weeks at the most at least as far as wu and he were concerned if bartlett went to adult court they wouldnt be adversaries in the same courtroom anymore maybe they could pick up where theyd left off if he could get her to talk to him although if she had gone off on him as ballistic as he had with her he wasnt sure if he would talk to her but then suddenly as brandt was watching them he saw the bailiff put his hands on her shoulders then she leaned into him her face against his chest and he put his arm around her keeping it there until they had both disappeared back into the cabins his stomach went hollow he turned to take the long way out the front door of the admin building where there was less chance that they would inadvertently run into each other cottrell stayed with wu until she told him she felt better and then he told her to take care of herself and went inside back to work still wu didnt move for a few minutes she sat on the bench just outside the entrance door to the cabins trying to summon enough strength to get up and walk to her car when the cellphone in her briefcase rang she considered not answering but then realized that it might be in fact probably was the norths after all that had transpired so far she felt that however exhausted she might be at least she owed them accessibility she got it on the third ring it wasnt the norths it was her boss amy so youre up and about where are you up at the ygc i just talked to andrew good for you hows he doing hes depressed we talked about starting a club not really that was a joke well this isnt did you get the message i left at your house about talking to glitsky it came back to her in a flash oh shit right hardy said hes still at his office and he called me at home just now which i really try to discourage he was wondering how he could get in contact with you like immediately since i had more or less promised him that youd see him today he wondered what was going on you want his direct number i guess id better good guess by now it was nearly pm there was no one at any of the desks in glitskys reception area at the hall of justice so wu walked back through the conference room and down the small hallway to the deputy chiefs door which stood ajar some natural light from outside made it through the drawn blinds but with the electric lights off the room seemed dim glitsky sat in one of the chairs in front of his desk he was canted slightly forward his elbows resting on his knees his head down he might have been napping wu was surprised that he didnt seem to have heard her approach and she stood a moment in the doorway waiting for him to turn and acknowledge her when that didnt happen she tapped lightly on the door he didnt exactly jump but hed clearly been somewhere else now back in the present he stood and came toward wu checking his watch as he did so you made good time from the ygc he said i appreciate it no traffic for a change she said im sorry about the mixup around this interview sir me not coming down here its all my fault not mr hardys he called my home and told me you wanted to see me but i have a client whos in big trouble and i went to see him first i didnt realize that this was so urgent even though mr hardy said it was glitsky seemed to find a little humor in her explanation next time i talk to him ill tell him you tried to cover for him but i know the truth he forgot to tell you didnt he no really he but glitsky held up a hand and stopped her kidding just kidding he didnt seem to take much joy in it though awkwardly he shrugged half turned well youre here now he said pointing why dont you take that chair and well get going wu sat while he got his tape recorder out of his desk tested it set it down and recited the standard introduction identifying himself his badge the case and event number his subject where they were three or four years before in her first year out of law school and before treya and abe had gotten married wu had played a small role helping hardy and treya learn the identity of the person whod killed glitskys grown daughter they hadnt all exactly socialized last night at boscaccis death scene was the first time glitsky had seen her since but there was a definite sense of familiarity and even goodwill still between them nevertheless glitsky was a procedure freak and this was a formal interview pursuant to the death of an important person he wasnt going to phone it in ms wu he began where and when was the last time you saw allan boscacci alive yesterday afternoon here at the hall of justice in his office presupplied with hardys version of events and jason brandts information conveyed through treya he walked her through the history and intricacies of the bartlett matter then mr brandt mentioned that there might be some bad blood between you and allan because of this blown deal not really bad blood i dont know why he said that it wasnt personal but the meeting was rancorous a little yes were voices raised his yes sir i had been wrong and didnt do much except sit and take it did he threaten you physically no professionally he made it clear we wouldnt be doing many more plea deals together and how did you feel about that it wasnt much of a surprise after what had happened i just let him vent and couldnt really blame him you had no reaction no of course i was upset but more at myself than at allan all right and after that after this heated interview with mr boscacci what did you do she gave him the details as much as she remembered them of the rest of her afternoon and early evening at lou the greeks and you were there continuously you never left the premises no sir not until about eight eightfifteen something like that accompanied by mr barry hess is that right i think so i mean i think that was his name whatever it is he was with me when i walked out of lous and went to the allday so what is your relationship with mr hess we dont have one he picked me up at lous and i may have let him kiss me once or twice on the way to the parking lot i really dont remember too clearly okay to get to the place he was killed from the hall mr boscacci very probably walked by lous did you by any chance notice him walking by no do you recall hearing a gunshot no all right after you discovered the body what did you do we called nine one one on barrys cellphone and got the police and then what did you call anyone else i called mr hardy at his home but he wasnt there his kids told me where he was and i reached him at a restaurant and why did you call him because hes my boss and i thought hed want to know about allan right away is he also acting as your personal attorney in this matter my personal attorney yes im sorry in what matter mr boscaccis death no why would i need she stopped he pretty effectively protected you from having to do this interview with me or someone else last night did you discuss that between you no i was drunk thats why i didnt talk last night you were there i talked to you remember we said today would be fine right did you talk to mr hardy about your statement today just that i ought to get down here and give it nothing about its substance no so last night you didnt call mr hardy to come down to the crime scene to act as your attorney no no of course not i didnt need an attorney all right ms wu thanks for your cooperation the bailiff wanted linda to meet andrew in the general visitors room which was much larger than the other room theyd used the last couple of times but far less private she told the bailiff that shed really prefer the smaller room as she wanted to have a sensitive conversation with her son but there was nothing the bailiff could do the smaller attorneys visiting room was currently in use there were a lot of kids here and all of them had lawyers and parents so she waited and waited there were only twelve stations until she got to the front of the line in the gymnasium and then until a chair cleared sitting between two other women one hispanic and one africanamerican she was hyperaware of being the only caucasian visitor eyes down andrew entered in his protective shuffling teen gait exaggerated shoulder movement his feet kind of sliding along she wondered why teenage guys considered it so cool to be sullen and silent then tried to remember when andrew had begun to adopt that walk she thought it was about the time hed stopped talking to her to anyone in the family really three or four years ago but what could she do it wasnt as though parents could control their children or exert any discipline not in todays world when everyone grew up so fast when between television the movies and the internet all kids were plugged into the same culture the same clothes the same slang even the same walk linda believed that there was no way that she could have any impact against such a relentless and ubiquitous force if you tried to teach them manners discipline them influence their behavior at all they just shut you out it didnt even make sense to try theyd just resent you for it the thing to do was be their friend when they let you and otherwise leave them alone the best you could hope for is that theyd eventually grow out of it and somehow turn out okay but that sure wasnt anything over which she had any control the partition prevented her from giving him a hug she missed the contact it might embarrass him but thank god he still let her hug him sometimes not that it wasnt somehow grudging not that he hugged her back with any enthusiasm but he was still her baby and she didnt know any other way to reach him andrew pulled out his chair and sat down across from her they didnt have him in handcuffs they could reach across the counter and hold hands if they wanted although she knew that andrew probably wouldnt go there hey he said hey silence arent you glad to see me sure a pause thanks for coming down hal and alicia say hi im sure dont you want to tell them hi back his eyes were flat sure for a minute she feared that neither of them would find anything else to say she forced herself to keep trying how are you holding up okay really a shrug another silence you look a little tired are they feeding you all right yeah he drew a heavy breath finally said something my lawyer was by earlier i know she called us too whatd she tell you linda tried to sound upbeat but the news didnt lend itself much to that that she was bringing on another lawyer from her firm to help with your case supposedly hes really good what else is she going to say that hes shit well she wished he wouldnt use that kind of language but she wasnt going to say anything he might take as a reprimand not with everything else he was going through she also told hal about these criteria to keep you here yeah he said the ritz linda sighed do you like her who amy i mean hal and i feel shes doing a really good job and now shes brought on this senior partner to help but if you didnt feel good about her i dont really care shes all right it doesnt really matter of course it does andrew dont lose hope now okay really she said dont he shook his head okay sure good idea mom except that its starting to look im never going to get out of custody dont say that she reached out over the counter here hold my hand she said thats not going to help anything please she said humor me okay he sighed again and put his hand in hers so theres this hearing on tuesday to see if i stay here did she tell you it doesnt look too good not really so much that she said it was kind of like a dress rehearsal for the trial where we get to see what theyve got which is really an advantage i bet it is he shrugged again either way mom i didnt do this and still they got me in here if they can do that i dont think theyre ever going to let me get out linda didnt want to argue with him well she said lets just wait for tuesday and hope for the best mom the best even if we win on tuesday is eight years no if they have the trial down here then the worst is eight years great he said maybe we should throw a party andrew all right all right lets just see okay keep your chin up she gave him a quick buckup smile squeezed his hand sure a longish silence settled finally she said i want to ask you something okay and i want to know how you really feel all right she took in a lungful of air well you know the newport open this was a tennis tournament in southern california that theyd attended for the past several years it starts tomorrow and he pulled his hand out of hers go youre sure she searched his face for any sign of wavering and saw none you wont mind why would i mind its just we wont be able to visit you thats all right im going to be working with amy most of the days anyway it doesnt matter you keep saying that thats cause its true it doesnt matter wed stay here if it made any difference to you at all you know at all even the tiniest little bit no question i know that but weve had these tickets for months theyre really expensive you know but wed give them up gladly we would you dont need to and even if we do go well be back by monday in plenty of time for the hearing wed be there for you for that mom i said go i mean it its no big deal youre sure i mean completely positive completely he said a hundred percent go have a good time it wasnt yet completely dark out but wu had drawn the blinds in her apartment and turned out the lights she was completely wrung out and badly shaken by the thought that glitsky might actually entertain the thought that she could have killed allan when she had at last gotten home after the interview shed swallowed more aspirin brushed her teeth twice then taken a shower her head still throbbed but she let herself believe that it was marginally better by the time she woke up in the morning she might be halfway to human again collapsing into bed she had just pulled the covers up over her head turned onto her side and closed her eyes when the doorbell sounded this time she was going to ignore it shed already had the day from hell and all she wanted it to do was end which it would when she slept whoever it was would go away another ring leave me alone she pulled the covers tighter around her the knock when it came was authoritative three sharp raps amy come on open up brandt she threw her blankets off and padded over the hardwood to the door spoke through it what do you want jason im trying to sleep i dont feel good i want to talk to you talk to me in the morning two minutes thats all you can apologize through the door its not just that no well it should be she hesitated another moment then sighed all right let me get some clothes on hitting the light switch by the door she grabbed her jeans stepped into them then tucked in the yellow spaghetti strap cotton blouse shed gone to bed in she considered taking thirty extra seconds and putting on a bra she didnt want to send any kind of sexual signal but if it was going to be two minutes she might as well hear it and then get back in bed besides she wore no makeup her hair was still damp her eyes must be ravaged she was a train wreck she opened the door in a gray business suit white shirt rep tie brandt stood awkwardly hands in his pockets he cleared his throat can i come in stepping back without a word she let him pass closed the door behind them he crossed over to her allpurpose table pulled a chair around and sat in it looking around getting his bearings really seeing the room for the first time the other night they hadnt paused for the grand tour before dragging each other into bed afterward she didnt think hed even turned on the lights just pulled his clothes on and let himself out arms crossed waiting she leaned against the counter by the sink i was down in the street for a while and saw your shadow moving up here then the lights went out i thought if i was going to get you it had to be now okay you got me then his phrase caught her you were down in the street for a while doing what just standing there he shrugged again deciding whether to come up and try to talk to you something in his tone stopped what would have been another harsh reply she cocked her head all right talk first he began i wanted to apologize okay but beyond that i guess im having trouble figuring you out he took a breath pushed on i dont understand whats happening exactly first the other night with us then the next morning at my office she cut him off then you accuse me of murder talk about not understanding whats happening amy i swear to god i never accused you of anything like murder i didnt accuse you of anything at all thats funny i just got back from the hall of justice where abe glitsky said you told him there was bad blood between me and allan he seemed to think i was some kind of a suspect that couldnt have been me youre saying you didnt talk to him no i talked to him but just telling him about whats happened with bartlett and me and allan okay but never even implying i mean come on if glitsky came to that on his own if you want ill call him tomorrow i never meant anything like that im so sorry i didnt mean he looked up at her im sorry he said again her tone softened she was too exhausted for another round all right apology accepted okay now if you dont mind im exhausted and your two minutes are up but he didnt move i didnt just want to apologize he scratched at the table took a quick breath i wanted to ask you about you and me you and me she pulled a chair around and sat on it first you accuse me of screwing you for advantage in a case then you go to glitsky and somehow give him the idea i might have killed allan i dont see any you and me in this picture she paused let out a breath look i dont expect anything from you jason that night was that night im not telling anybody about it so our jobs are both safe so now you can go in fact you really should go now thats not it he said no then tell me what it is sighing again she shook her head look if it makes you feel any better i thought it was a game to you too no okay maybe it started that way at first he walked over to one of the windows turned back to her for a minute i thought we had something going i mean personally he tapped his chest in here he waited eyes on her i guess not she didnt contradict him did he really think she was going to fall for this line now if he would have said something that night maybe because he was right there had been a real moment between them theyd both realized it beyond the physical stuff something that had felt to her like a deeper connection then in the morning hed been gone fool me once okay but twice she didnt think so a tense silence gathered until she finally broke it i think youd better get out of here right now i mean it hardy didnt want to go out after dinner at home but with the hearing looming he felt he had no choice since frannie had suggested he put his heart into his work again she couldnt very well object they both knew the strains that hardys work ethic had placed on their marriage in the past and both saw the irony in her position if hardy was going to care he was going to put in the hours that was who he was that was the tradeoff so when he told her he had to go out and have a talk with mike mooneys neighbor she kissed him with a tolerant humor husbands she said cant live with em cant kill em he had conceived of a strategic idea that he thought stood a long shot but still possible chance to play at the hearing if all the stars lined up just right hed already told wu that she could confidently call any witnesses she wanted jackmans insouciant attitude notwithstanding judge johnson would be concerned about the risk of having the case reversed on appeal he wouldnt hurt the defense any more than he already had done and it would be greatly to wus advantage if she knew how some of the witnesses were going to testify at trial but it had occurred to hardy that he might be able to take it a step further and convince johnson that justice demanded he allow witnesses to the crime itself this would be decidedly unusual since in this type of hearing the prosecution only had to make a prima facie case that the crime had been committed and there wasnt any doubt that somebody had killed mooney and laura but clarence jackman had never practiced as a criminal lawyer in his preda career and even after three years in office he was sometimes embarrassingly inexperienced in the nuts and bolts of how things really worked and hardys hope was that brandt young and relatively green himself by pushing the supercharged rush to the after boscaccis murder had goaded jackman to a tactical blunder judge johnson would be nervous that the defense had only been given five days to prepare for the hearing no doubt feeling angry and abused himself he would be inclined to grant the das wish to get andrew moved downtown hed want to slap wu as badly as either brandt or jackman did but hardy and wu would file motions by monday making sure the judge knew that the defense considered this unseemly hurry an appealable issue after that if johnson let the hearing proceed as planned hed be extra sensitive to the threat of appeal and might let the defense get away with calling witnesses related to the case in chief as a function of the fifth amenability criterion the gravity of the offense if hardy and wu could make that happen then andrew would get himself not just an administrative hearing but a de facto juvenile trial if he lost at the then worst case hardy and wu would get two chances to hear the prosecutions case and to beat it and even if andrew then lost again in adult court hardy might still be able to appeal saying that theyd been forced to go to the before they could adequately prepare hardy knew this wasnt just a long shot it was a fullcourt bomb at the buzzer but occasionally he knew they went in so as he turned into beaumont avenue in the first block off geary boulevard he felt some small grounds for enthusiasm twenty feet of free legal curb space yawned open on his right and he pulled over and parked hed driven out with the top down on his convertible there was no fog and the last days winds had finally abated and now he sat headlights off letting a sense of the crime scene seep into him he forced himself to wait to observe to listen there was no hurry if his coming out here was going to do any good at all he had to slow down and take time it was a short block eleven relatively small twostory housing units squatted between the major thoroughfare of geary and the next street south which was anza the address he sought was the fourth building down from anza and at least from the outside by far the smallest residence on the block set back a little from the street it was also the only building with a lawn in front and a driveway with a separate garage on the side lights shone from the upstairs windows while the bottom unit mooneys old place was dark finally he put up the hood on his car grabbed his legal pad from the seat next to him got out of the car and went to lean against one of the streetlights on his side of the street with six of these all miraculously functioning the area was surprisingly well lit this wasnt the most unusual thing in the world hardy thought but it almost never happened on his own block which was in a similar suburban highdensity neighborhood he made a note to check and see if public works had come out to install new lights since mooneys murder sometimes a station captain or one of the beat cops called to a crime scene in one of these nice neighborhoods would take the opportunity to check the citys housekeeping and let somebody know if the street had been significantly darker two months ago it might make a difference to eyewitness testimony standing there on the curb hardy became aware of a subtle rhythm he timed it out of curiosity he didnt think it was really worth writing down about every forty seconds the street noise from geary less than two hundred feet away increased dramatically as eastbound traffic released from its last red light sped past on the way to the next one the sound wasnt anywhere near deafening but once hardy became aware of it he waited through a few cycles trying to determine how loud it could get loud enough to cover gunshots he didnt think so certainly not for the closer neighbors and it would be quieter as it got later the gunshots were a question and he jotted it down andrews walk was critical to his story and hardy wanted to see if it made sense so he checked the time and started moving south a few blocks to turk where he then turned east along the periphery of lone mountain college this time of night the road was quiet enough and might be conducive to memorizing lines certainly this was a better route for that purpose than anything along geary would have been there was also quite a bit of street parking it was where andrew said he had parked on the night of the murders rather than go all the way to another busy street masonic andrew said he had turned south again crossed the campus of the university of san francisco by the baseball diamond then come out through a little culdesac andrew hadnt known the name of this street when hed traced his route for the detectives but hardy was glad to see that it fit his description a paved walkway allowed foot access to the campus at the end of the street when he turned back west at fulton hardy found the uphill going a little slower there was also a significant increase in traffic it might have been more difficult for andrew to concentrate or memorize his lines on this part of the walk but maybe not there simply was no way to tell he passed st ignatius church at the top of the hill continued down a couple of blocks to stanyan then turned right and made it back to his car he checked his watch he hadnt been particularly pushing himself and hed made the circuit in eighteen minutes rather far from the half hour it had supposedly taken andrew although andrew might have stopped once twice several times to set a line or perhaps just to think hed never specifically mentioned stopping hardy didnt feel comfortable with the twelveminute difference he made another note crossing the street he stood under the streetlight and looked up at the salarcos unit from reading the police reports hardy knew that the involvement of this critical witness had been reluctant at first salarco was a mowblowandgo gardener with an ins problem no green card ironically the salarcos were only involved in the case because andrew himself had told the detectives about them sergeant taylor had asked him if he had any idea who might have called nine one one before he had that person had had a thick mexican accent andrew had volunteered that he bet it was the people upstairs they had definitely been home that night their baby had been crying incessantly and it had been distracting to the max andrew had told sergeant taylor that it was one of the reasons he couldnt just go into one of mooneys back bedrooms to work on memorizing his lines hed had to get out where it was quiet enough to concentrate so taylor had asked salarco if hed seen or heard anything or had called nine one one at first the neighbor had said no he and his wife had a sick baby thats all they were concerned with but taylor had a hunch and asked about salarcos immigration status then explained that he was not with the ins that salarcos testimony might be crucial to a murder investigation and might in fact mitigate in his favor with la migra hardy knew this was probably a cynical lie on taylors part but it did accomplish its goal salarco talked at the sidewalk in front of the house hardy took a deep breath hoping he could make the man talk again the door to the salarcos upstairs unit was around the driveway side in the back a small flatbed truck took up most of the space between this building and its neighbor there was no light over the door and hardy heard nothing when he pushed the doorbell but after few seconds he heard footfalls within coming downstairs then s√≠ qu√© es se√±ora salarco s√≠ policia no habla ingl√©s hardy dug for some words that he hoped were close enough soy abogado de se√±or bartlett momento the footsteps retreated hardy had time to turn around and examine the truck and the building wooden fence posts lined both sides of the empty flatbed he saw no tools the windows in the cab were up the house was old ramshackle very small less than half the size of the other buildings on the block hardy had wondered how an illegal handyman could afford the rent to even a doghouse in this neighborhood and the answer was that it wasnt much bigger than a doghouse and from the outside at least not much nicer another set of footsteps on the stairs this time the male voice though heavily accented spoke english yes mr salarco he said through the door my name is dismas hardy im the lawyer for andrew bartlett about the murder case no response if youve got a few minutes id like to talk to you if i may salarco didnt ponder for long perhaps hardy thought he considered anyone involved with the case a potential official who could turn him in if so hardy was happy to let him keep believing that with bright red skin and an unlined face he struck hardy as much younger than his stated age of twentyeight a little above medium height in his tshirt and jeans salarco could have been a weight lifter with his massive arms and welldeveloped shoulders tiny waist but the face hardy came back to it it was the face of a boy tardes se√±or what is it please your name again hardy dismas hardy deezmus i dont know that name hardy kept it genial nobody does i wouldnt worry about it they ascended a narrow stairway that ended in another door that opened into salarcos living room it was little more than a cubicle but nicely furnished in salvation army a beaded bottle of modelo negro rested on the coffee table along with a paperback bookcien a√±os de soledad so the gardener was a reader perhaps with intellect it was good hardy thought to find out early the television was tuned to a spanish station salarco turned it off indicating that hardy sit on the upholstered couch cerveza he asked and hardy nodded when he came back with the beer salarco took the opposite end of the couch so what do you want to know he asked hardy put his beer down on the table took a relaxed position id really just like to walk through the events of the night of the murder when you called the police ive got a copy of your statements here and i just wondered if youd mind telling me again what you did that night in your own words would that be all right with you s√≠ sure before we begin though i want to ask you if youve talked to any lawyers with the das office about your statements or your identification of andrew bartlett he thought about it for a second then shook his head not any lawyers i have talked to the police three maybe four times but no lawyers this made sense to hardy in the normal course of events this case wouldnt come to trial for the best part of a year whoever pulled andrew bartlett for the adult trial wouldnt even have had a chance to review his own discovery yet with all the dealing and then the hurry to move andrew up out of juvenile court hardy doubted whether brandt had either since he didnt have to know all the facts about the crime he wasnt trying the case so hardy had a clear field but before he started to run it was important that salarco understand his position he had already gotten it out and now he handed him his business card as required by statute i want you to know that i represent andrew bartlett the boy you identified as the killer of mr mooney and the girl laura wright im his lawyer i want to hear what you have to say because im going to have to try to find out what happened the seriousness of the little speech hit a mark salarco drew his arm off the couch and onto his lap his brow clouded a bit i will just tell the truth he said as i have thats all i can ask thank you he took a handheld tape recorder from his jacket pocket and placed it on the table do you have any objection if i record what you say it wasnt clear whether salarco knew he had the option to refuse he nodded then waited how do you want me to start just what happened that night another nod the main thing is carla our baby she was sick high high fever she is crying crying but finally maybe about nine oclock we finally get her to start to sleep he uncrossed his legs reached for his beer and drank but then downstairs you know just down there right below we hear this this fight a physical fight i dont know i couldnt see but i heard loud yelling a man two men and a woman loud really loud and of course then it wakes up carla she started crying again and you have babies two hardy said older now well you know then when they cry at least me it makes me i dont know the word impaciente crazy to have it stop impatient hardy said and thought to say the least s√≠ impatient so then carla starts again and i am impatient with the noise from below so i stomp on the floor like this he brought his heel downboom boom and its quiet for another few minutes then the yelling starts again and carla is crying and what happened then hardy asked then when it started again i went downstairs to ask them to stop just a minute please hardy sat up straight this was not in anything hed read youre saying you went downstairs at a little after nine oclock and talked to the people down there s√≠ and who was there the girl se√±or mike and the boy andrew the boy you identified in the lineup s√≠ hardy took a breath this wasnt good if salarco had seen andrew at the house close up there was much less chance that hed been mistaken at the lineup or would recant at the trial he sipped some beer to get his concern under control and the question came out almost casually and what then did they tell you theyd stop fighting a questioning look crossed salarcos face what is it hardy asked but it passsed nothing salarco said i dont know but yes they said theyd stop and then it was quiet yes for how long no se when the baby is crying time just goes you know but again we just got her to sleep again and anna and i we come out here to this room and turn on the tv real quiet but then there is this this scream the girl and then a a bump you could feel it up here like something dropped the house shook then right after a crash the sound of a crash glass breaking and a few seconds later suddenly boom again the house shakes another time somebody slamming the front door under us salarco on his feet now acting it out anna goes to this window here and i am behind her and there is the boy running away he stops under the light there and turns and anna starts to put the window up to to yell at him i think but then carla starts again with crying madre de dios salarco living it again turned to hardy and put both hands to his head is it never going to end and then then i remember i am i have no sleep and my baby has been crying for ten hours straight i run downstairs i go to yell at them all but when i hit the front door i hit it with a fist and it it opens his hands hung at his side and i see them mooney and the girl s√≠ on the floor with so much blood i walk in the girl is shot i think in the chest and is by the back wall there is a big standup lamp knocked on the floor broken all smashed next to her but there is still light above and from in the cocina and se√±or mike is on his back with a hole in his face i will never forget no hardy said im sorry salarco crossed back to the couch sat now on the edge of it he seemed to remember his beer and picked it up drained it looked across to hardy otros hardy hadnt put much of a dent in his first beer and didnt want another but he wanted to keep salarco talking gracias s√≠ when he came back with the two cold ones he put them on the coffee table and began without any prompting so the phone is there and i go to it and push nine one one and tell what i see where i am and while i am talking i notice the gun on the little table in front of the couch he leaned forward knocked wood just the same as this one and then what did you do then i see how bad this looks me in this room with the gun i think the boy maybe hes going to come back if he sees i am there he can say it was me what was you who killed these people why would you have done that salarco turned his palms up the noise i already come down one time to stop it maybe next time i bring the gun and make sure then the woman on the phone she tries more to get my name and the other thing comes to me la migra i know i have to go i cannot be there when the authorities come so i come back up here and watch out the window until the boy comes back and the authorities you mean andrew again s√≠ you saw him under the streetlight there out the window s√≠ the same boy youre sure salarco put down his beer bottle turned and faced hardy directly im sorry se√±or but it was him the same hair the same clothes and what were they the clothes like all of them wear i dont know how you say loose baggy salarco nodded s√≠ the pants baggy and then the he made a gesture of pulling something over his head like eminem in the movie you mean he had a hood a sweatshirt with a hood s√≠ that was it and even with the hood you saw his face and it was the same face after the shortest pause salarco nodded s√≠ of course it was the same boy i say hardy believed him in fact it had to be andrew returning from his walk or from wherever he had gone perhaps having run away and then realizing hed left the gun which could be traced back to him looking up hardy caught a glimpse of salarcos wife hovering in the doorway back to the kitchen he might have to talk to her one day as well but for tonight he took a last pull from his beer then stood up i want to thank you for your time youve been very helpful i am sorry about the boy se√±or truly i am thank you hardy said i am too it was well past nine oclock by the time glitsky sat down to dinner at the small table in his kitchen treya had gotten good at meals that took fifteen minutes to prepare and she waited until she heard his tread on the steps up to their duplex before she threw the halibut on to broil in the oven when she turned it the one time she would smear it with jalape√±o jelly which would melt forming a fantastic glaze the asparagus sat in a shallow covered pan with a quarter inch of boiling water shed finish that with olive oil balsamic vinegar and a pinch of sea salt a small still warm dense loaf of homemade breadmachine bread roastedgarlic with asiago cheese would round out the meal after which theyd split a plate of frozen grapes for dessert glitsky had fed rachel in her high chair and for the past few minutes had been doing magic tricks making a quarter disappear now treya put the adult plates down arranged yet he said shed garnished with a few sprigs of fresh rosemary a crystal vase sat between the place mats on the small wooden table and in it bloomed one perfect daffodil glitsky put a finger on his daughters nose turned to his food and picked up his fork do i thank you enough for doing all this treya kissed the top of his head every day she touched her babys cheek you gave me her didnt you she came around the table and took her seat now shush and eat your fish its brain food id better then im going to need it he chewed swallowed this boscacci thing at least its not leshawn brodie i checked and youd dropped right off the news tonight just like it never happened fresh kill glitsky said anyhow youll be glad to hear amy wus almost certainly out of it she was never really in though was she no not really although she could have timed her last meeting with allan a little better the real story though is that because of her i got to give diz a little grief treya smiled always a plus and even more so because i swung by his office to give him his earful of righteous cop and while i was there i found a way to repay him for his little caper with my peanut drawer i thought you werent sure who that was i wasnt then i realized it had to be diz no one else is that immature i can think of one other person she said the corners of glitskys mouth rose a fraction of an inch thank you he said plus anybody at the hall its too risky if i catch them theyre flayed then fired diz i get him redhanded and he says ha ha you got me so what it was him okay so whatd you do to him first you have to promise not to tell under penalty of death that goes without saying diz or frannie youll be tempted ill resist i promise what a spark of mischief flashed in his eyes i stole his darts you want to hear the best part that wasnt it what could be better next time im there im going to put them back then steal them again my hope is that eventually hell go insane and that would be so that you two could play together as equals treya put her fork down and looked across the table her own eyes alight she turned to rachel do you know how lucky you are that you cant understand any of this she asked an hour later the baby was in bed and the two of them sat in their living room with their after dinner tea but that poor man treya was talking about boscacci do you have anything at all well if you count that were fairly certain it wasnt amy weve got that well yes but we knew that this morning before you even talked to her true but now we know with more certainty he said and not because she works with diz because she couldnt have done it so who could have glitsky pulled at the scar at his lower lip my best guess now is someone he fired in the last three years maybe one of them took it personally so how many people did he let go allan seventeen treya whistled softly thats a lot glitsky sat back into the couch he reached down near his belt and probed perhaps unconsciously at his side well fortunately he went on ive got a lot of resources for a change ive got two inspectors from general work for the canvassing and alibi checking then belou and russell from homicide and theyll basically be full time to find and interview the folks allan fired then marcel asked to be part of it too back on the street if he had to and of course my own magnificent self what are you going to be doing glitsky drew a sharp breath well mostly given the lack of any forensic evidence im going to be developing theories but im not complaining at least its a homicide something i know how to do treya put her cup down reached over put her hand on glitskys shoulder is your side hurting you again maybe you should see a doctor no no to what both you wont see a doctor glitsky grunted ive seen enough doctors you start in with doctors it never ends they looked when this started and couldnt find anything im not about to let them cut on me again just to look but its still hurting you whatever it is i know what it is he softened his tone im uptight im waiting for the other shoe to drop and till it does or i decide its not going to ive got to tough it out so whats going to make you decide that do you have any idea i dont know he said maybe doing something im good at what does that mean youre doing a great job as deputy chief everybody says so nobody was saying so yesterday with leshawn treya waved that off those were just the media vultures abe you know that you cant take them seriously im talking about people like clarence and frank batiste the mayor kathy west i hear nothing but good things and where i work thats saying something a shrug i make my numbers i show up on time my brass shines but inside im not like these people what people frank clarence the mayor all the people who have these meetings he pushed at his side again theyre politicians plus ive got this little secret and cant help thinking that someday somebodys going to find me out treya spoke with some care maybe you want to talk to somebody what do you mean a shrink he barked out a black laugh so then word goes out that the man is cracking up and everybody starts to check out my office furniture half the folks would think i really am crazy and the other half would figure its a scam to get disability id kiss my credibility goodbye forever it wouldnt have to be a psychiatrist maybe a psychologist or a career counselor and whats this person going to do talk me out of the pain he took her hand besides i talk to you treya wasnt going to be conned and i cant help i havent helped im just saying maybe someone else could get somewhere not if i couldnt tell them about it and i cant you know i cant thats what you keep saying but there is such a thing as doctor patient privilege you know thats a real thing they couldnt tell right in theory but in real life they tell all the time a rumor gets started and you know cops they ask questions and then where are we at least youre not in pain wonderful except that now im ruined even in jail how does that sound theres no statute on murder it wasnt murder it was selfdefense you keep saying it was murder and it wasnt all right but it killed a cop and i was a party to covering it up whatever happens if that comes out even if i never go to jail its the end of my career he exhaled with some force ive got to live with it thats all its not that bad but as he said it he tightened his lips the scar through them going white with the pressure treya her own face tight with concern laid a palm on his thigh and he covered it with his own hand squeezing hard when the spasm had passed he released his grip not that bad he repeated he came into the bedroom and treya put down her book who was that marcel she checked the bedside clock this time of night i told him he could call anytime she smiled at him of course you did she patted the bed next to her here sit down what did marcel find well again its more what they didnt find nobody heard anything what do you mean i mean marcel sent out our team to knock on every door within two blocks of the allday lot have another go at them catch the people who werent home earlier they got fortyfour hits which is the jackpot nobody heard a shot not even the shoe repair folks still at work just around the corner like fifty feet away maybe they just didnt want to say maybe some percentage wouldnt give away their trash to save humanity but youve got to hope that with fortyfour people maybe a couple are good citizens but these folks were there admitted they were there talked to our people nobody heard anything treya sat up is that so unusual glitsky shrugged you know what a ninemillimeter sounds like close up a cherry bomb a block away you hear it and you stop a second and go what was that and nobody heard anything maybe he was inside a car and rolled the window down maybe that glitsky said or maybe he had a suppressor a what a silencer suppressor and what does that mean other than the shot doesnt make much noise it means hes probably a pro in which case hes probably in another state by now but if he was a pro that also means somebody hired him its another place to look thats all hardy owned a onequarter interest in one of san franciscos oldest bars the little shamrock at the corner of ninth and lincoln just across the street from golden gate park the majority partner was frannies brother moses mcguire another emotional casualty of the shootout by jogging just slightly from the direct route to his home from juan salarcos hardy could pass right by the place check up on his brotherinlaw maybe have a short nightcap it had gotten late after saying good night to salarco hardy had gone out to his car and with the interview still fresh in his mind listened to the tape of it twice through again with the sometimes lengthy timeouts he took for making notes both as the witness talked and as ideas occurred after each listening he worked for most of an hour that felt to him like five minutes the shamrocks bar ran along one wall halfway back to where the room widened out slightly at the front door it was walltowall people five or six deep his first glance told hardy he had no chance to claim a stool anywhere near the bar itself and even if he was successful at that the crowd would keep moses too busy to talk nights like this hardy would sometimes take off his jacket grab a bar towel and help out behind the rail hed been a bartender once and a good one but tonight he wasnt in the mood it was too crowded too loud too hot the jukebox was cranked up with some old marshall tucker music maybe he ought to go home he was just turning to leave when wes farrell and his livein girlfriend sam duncan pushed their way in sam was a petite feisty pretty darkhaired woman fortyish who ran one of the citys rape crisis counseling centers not far away on haight street youre not leaving farrell said not when were just getting here it had crossed my mind its going to take an hour to get a drink weve got that knocked sam said we know the owner come on sam took hardys hand and led the way jostling them through the crowd once theyd cleared the bottleneck up front there was adequate room to stand and even move as long as nobody wanted to polka hardy noticed that farrell was his outoftheoffice casual self wearing one of his trademark tshirts which read be more or less specific at hardys shoulder sam was saying that since he was buying shed have a chivas rocks and wes would have a pint of bass ale hardy could have whatever he wanted thanks he told her he ducked under the bar gave mcguire a halfsalute and called down that he was getting his own drinks moses shouldnt worry about him when hardy got back with the drinks farrell nudged sam and said tell him tell me what hardy said sam sampled her scotch nodded appreciatively i dont know how it came up she began at dinner farrell said i started telling you about this situation with amy thats it she came back to hardy well the point is he mentioned this boy andrew bartlett and i said i knew a little about it id been following it in the papers i was interested because back when i was young and foolish i used to hang out sometimes with linda at hardys uncomprehending glance she added his mother what do you mean hang out a shrug just that go to bars meet guys this was before i met my true love here of course but if you wanted to pretty much guarantee youd get lucky of a given night you wanted to hang with linda if you could she could materialize men out of a vacuum youre thinking so what arent you in fact thats what hardy was thinking sam could make almost any story listenable but the wild child linda bartlett was now the married linda north and other than the fact that san francisco continued to be a small and selfreferential little world there wasnt anything particularly fascinating about the fact that shed hung out and picked up men with sam duncan when both of them had been younger but hardy said go on well since its the law and by definition must be endlessly enthralling i say to my darling here im not surprised the little kid didnt turn out right his dad ran off and his mother didnt give him the time of day so andrew was around when you and linda were hanging out he was around in the sense that he was alive he must have been three or so about this time but linda would dump him with anyone at the drop of a hat i even kept him with me for a couple of weekends when she went away with somebody he was the cutest little guy if you like threeyearolds which you know are not generally my favorite but even given that this was a woman who shouldnt ever have become a mother the boy was nothing but inconvenient to her she was going to have her fun and all he did was get in the way sam drank more of her scotch actually thats one of the reasons i stopped hanging out with her it just became obvious the kind of person she was i like to think im as shallow as anybody its why wes loves me after all but she just wasnt going to be involved with her own son and that was that after a while it got so i couldnt stand to see it farrell jumped in the reason this might be important to you diz hey sam hit him on the arm its my story all right i understood your point at dinner im getting to it im listening hardy said thank you the point she shot a glare at farrell being that the boy really has had a difficult life especially in his early years so in spite of the pampered rich boy he might seem to be he was essentially an abandoned kid raised if you want to call it that by an emotionally removed if not outright abusive mother she abused him you think i dont know if she actively abused him like beat him or anything like that but i guarantee you hes deeply scarred and finally the point is ahh farrell said the point is that in many jurisdictions but especially in san francisco the wise defense attorney such as my esteemed roommate here will take every opportunity to present his criminal client as the victim of something childhood abuse being perhaps the alltime favorite it is a good one hardy said and andrew is legitimately in that club if you can get it into the record farrell said it may not get him off but it sure as hell couldnt hurt in sentencing no hardy said i dont imagine it could weve got a problem at his desk hardy motioned wu in shed taken some care dressing and making up this morning she often did so this wasnt unusual in itself but the twopiece pinstriped dark blue business suit she wore was such a far cry from the way shed looked in his daughters bathrobe nursing the mother of all hangovers that hardy blinked at the transformation hed been listening again to the tape hed made at juan salarcos something about it bothering him and now he removed his headphones gave wu his attention hit me he said hes a writer who is andrew she nodded on his computer they delivered more discovery here yesterday while i was out this disk she held it up is not good you want to see it would make my day he took the disk from her and slipped it into his computer perfect killer dot one she said love the name hardys fingers moved over the keyboard wu came around behind him as the document appeared on the screen quiet and intent together they read andrews short story about a young man filled with jealous rage who kills his girlfriend and his english teacher for over ten minutes the only sound in the room was the tick of the computers cursor as hardy scrolled through the document when they got to the end hardy found his heart pounding he had also broken a sweat he pushed his chair back from the computer stood and went over to open one of his windows get some air after a minute he turned to wu id better go meet the client can i ask you a question wu asked they were driving out to the ygc in hardys car the top down do i come across as some kind of monster not at all hardy didnt know exactly what to say he looked over at her the light changed and he pulled out why do you ask did somebody say that more or less that i didnt feel anything that there wasnt anybody real inside of me who said that somebody in the firm no a colleague well whoever it was can ask me the other night talking about your dad that was real enough but i was drunk then with my guard down ive done research on that exact topic it still counts i dont know she turned in her seat but im thinking if thats all people can see in me then maybe thats all my dad saw too hardy kept it lowkey or maybe it wasnt you at all maybe your dad just wasnt able to show what he felt no he really didnt approve of me or like me very much or maybe the idea of showing you terrified him so he was extratough so you wouldnt ever find out and take advantage and hurt him trying to lighten it up he added and if thats the case you better watch out its genetic that kind of thing hardy flashed a quick look at her abruptly wu had turned straight ahead in her seat her eyes on the road are you all right he asked her lips tight her jaw set she nodded but said nothing throughout all of his schooling at the best institutions in san francisco andrew had been inculcated into the sensitive educated modern childs nutritional paradigm of healthy eating sutro had both a juice and a salad bar and thats where for a mere he bought his lunch every day over the years like most of his classmates whod been forced to witness the brutal slaughtering of some food animal on videotape in school he had come to believe that humans shouldnt eat meat a few days of real hunger after his arrest though had conquered his qualms besides that the ygc vegetarian alternative meal was total slop wu didnt think it was the food though that accounted for his pallor and lethargy today hed shaved showered and combed his hair but in the jail outfit blue denims gray sweatshirt he showed no sign that yesterday afternoons depression had lifted at all if anything it seemed worse he greeted hardy with a bored and sullen silence he only shook no grip after a pause long enough for hardy nearly to withdraw his own offered hand wu started to explain that hardy was here because he had more experience with murder cases and you said that yesterday so were going to adult trial maybe not wu said were hoping that this hearing but he cut her off again no youre not yesterday you said that was hopeless they get one of the criteria its over right andrew had stuffed himself into the old school desk wu sat at the table hardy was standing in the corner leaning against one of the walls arms crossed he spoke matteroffactly you can always go back and admit the petition ill bet you i could talk johnson into accepting that if you wanted to change your mind you want to do that andrew kept his eyes on the table in front of him thats eight years automatic thats right hardy said he looked up i didnt do this well then hardy said you dont want to do those eight years do you he didnt answer which like it or not hardy said leaves us with an adult trial unless we can win this hearing next tuesday he pointed to wu she says we cant do that weve got some problems hardy admitted but weve also got some strategies to make them work though were going to need your help if you think its even worth it to try andrew shrugged hardy came forward his voice hardening up pressing him a little you do you dont im not reading your signals very clearly you want to try using some words it was clear that andrew hadnt had too many people talk to him so harshly all right he said finally what do you want me to do lets start by you telling me about the gun hardy said what about it im curious why you brought it to your rehearsal that night andrew didnt have to think about it it was just in my backpack id been carrying it around for a few weeks but you took it out that night at mr mooneys isnt that right yeah so how did that happen he shrugged it was a prop thats all we were doing virginia woolf you know that was the play and mike mooney he thought it might add to the tension if we had a gun on stage its not really in the script but he just wanted to see how it would feel so he asked you to bring a gun to rehearsal no i had it with me anyway so i brought it up it was my idea i thought it might be cool hardy thought this would be a good time to shake things up he forced an amused little chuckle walked up to the table looked down at wu the boys good amy he said this is some brilliant delivery i can see where he got the lead in the play what are you talking about andrew asked hardy kept his tone easy im talking about acting andrew what else im not acting this is what happened a pause really hardy nodded chuckled again talked to amy damn hardy said impressive i mean it id be pretty well swayed if i were on a jury me too wu said we put him on the stand he flies hardy looked down at him its always a big decision whether or not to put a defendant on the stand himself but we get a worldclass performer like yourself its a real bonus why are you saying this im not performing im telling you the truth again hardy spoke directly to wu and the award goes to im telling the truth goddamn it what are you saying hardy didnt rise to the challenge retreating to his neutral corner he leaned against the wall again crossed his arms you tell him amy she took the cue andrew she said andrew look at me he dragged his pained expression back down to the table why mr hardy is skeptical is that in perfect killer you tell that same story as the andrew jumped as if hed been stung how do you know about that i never he shot a look to the corner where hardy was the picture of nonchalance nothing there he came back to wu i never even printed that out no wu said i dont suppose you would have but it was still on the disk hardy spoke up its pretty standard procedure now andrew the police get a search warrant and dump your computer files read your email thats the one thing id criticize about your story the writing was good it reminded me a little of holden caulfield but you hadnt done your research on the latest tech stuff didnt you know theyd served a warrant at your house didnt it occur to you that theyd look for everything they could find andrew slumped at his desk his arms hung straight down his head bowed they let him live with his new reality for a minute or more a very long time under those circumstances finally he sighed and raised his head look he said im not acting im telling you guys the truth what i made up was that story i had my guy my character trevor wu said right trevor i had trevor hardy cut in andrew he said thats the most incriminating document ive ever read and ive been in this game a long time no judge in the world is going to let you off if he gets a look at that which he will how many other stories like that are in your computer none just like that thank god wu said what in the world were you thinking andrew unbowed he snapped back i was thinking about writing a story you know fiction we know all about fiction hardy said he hadnt moved from his spot in the corner by the door but this just well it isnt fiction i flat dont believe it you can believe what you want havent you ever read crime and punishment or john lanchesters the debt to pleasure ive read them both wu said what about them well i had just read debt to pleasure earlier in the year when i was starting to have some problems with laura his eyes went back and forth between his attorneys when we first started rehearsing with mike she well like julie in the story she was just all impressed with him that shed gotten the part all that it got to me we actually broke up about it that wasnt in the story hardy said the breakup no andrew said thats because i made up the story have i already mentioned that i thought i had hardys mouth grinned but his eyes didnt i dont know who convinced you that sarcasm was a powerful debating tool andrew but whoever it was didnt do you a service i understand that you made up your story its not that tough a concept to grasp but you have to admit that theres a lot of it that seems pretty closely based on your own experience now do you want to tell us about that or not andrew tried stewing for a moment he turned to wu who might show some sympathy for support but she stonewalled him at last he spoke when i wrote it i was jealous of mike with laura i was going for a weirdguy feel like lanchester did you got that wu said she turned to hardy the debt to pleasure again hardy deadpanned ive got to read it in the end andrew said thats why i didnt send out the story anyplace it was too derivative i mean a really really bright guy whos basically insane its been done a million times now plus i dont think the ending worked really well i wanted trevor to find a really unique way to commit these murders but in the end i fell back on the gun hardy had to fight a disorienting sense of surrealism heres a client up for murder and what he wants to discuss are plot points in a story that might hang him have you published before he asked no but ive sent out a bunch i did get a nice note back from mcsweeneys on one of them not a straight rejection im happy for you hardy finally moved up to the table pulled around a chair and sat in it listen andrew whether or not you made this up weve got to work on some kind of spin for this story youve got to see that it casts you in the worst possible light it wasnt that bad andrew said no its peachy hardy said but im not talking about its literary quality im talking about the events and motive around these two murders that have actually taken place and that youre charged with committing and that you pretty much exactly mirrored in the story you wrote two months earlier two murders your teacher and your girlfriend your dads gun even down to your alibi dont forget my favorite moment amy said shed printed the thing out at the office and now had found the page and read aloud talking about the gun now heres your narrator but what if i get rid of it after then even if they can recover the slugs they wont be able to compare the ballistics marks i doublecheck and make sure the gun isnt made in israel where they shoot their guns before they sell them then the ballistic readouts are computerized and matched with the weapons buyer so even if the gun itself is unavailable they can identify its owner thats true andrew objected thats what they do i found it in my research good for you hardy said but not the point here amy let me she handed the pages across to him he flipped to the end how about this part andrew how do you think a jury would feel about you if the prosecutor got this admitted which he will and reads it out loud i come back and find the bodies i call nine one one theyre going to think theres no way id come back and do that if id done the shooting will the cops suspect me yeah but ive gotten rid of the gun and the gloves the night i do it i pack a change of clothes just like the ones i was wearing in a plastic bag in my trunk shoes too i adios the whole package before i come back and discover the carnage the cops look but im clean and mike and laura are gone no thats wrong andrew came halfway out of his chair i didnt write mike and laura i wrote julie and miles the characters oh thats right you did i guess it seemed like you meant mike and laura so thats what i read honest mistake hardy turned the pages facedown looked across the room at his client listen andrew not only is this pretty much exactly what happened it shows premeditation and planning its also sophisticated stuff you may remember that as another one of the criteria were supposed to avoid criminal sophistication andrew slumped back into his chair crossed his arms over his chest given the magnitude of disaster he was looking at his expression was almost serene look he said you start with my character in the story remember not me you put him in a situation that you know something about thats what they tell you to write what you know thats what you say in the story too so all right you picked jealousy i hadnt ever felt anything like it before it was just overpowering laura would get to going on about mike and after a while i just couldnt listen to it anymore i suppose i started acting like a jerk wu jumped on it how every way i could really coming on to other girls around her cutting her down in front of other people dissing mike but nothing physical she asked no nothing hardy repeated this was the kind of fact about which you wanted no ambiguity you never hit her nobody ever saw you hit her i never hit her he said i would never hit her i loved her okay hardy thrummed his fingers on the table lets go back to the story do you have any idea how we deal with it or get around it andrew sighed its fiction i dont know what else i can say the character isnt me julie isnt laura miles isnt mike theres tons of stuff in the story that didnt really happen name me something important hardy said something that will make any difference to a judge or jury well the main thing in the story trevor had had a lot of sex with other girls that wasnt me youre a virgin hardy asked that didnt read like a virgin wrote it i was then andrew said a hint of pride in the admission i imagined what a guy like trevor would have felt and done all right hardy wasnt giving him much but its a stretch to call that the main thing andrew maybe you could tell us something about the crime thats different in the story from real life the boy looked to wu for help but she too was waiting for what hed say okay he said finally okay in the story i have trevor almost decide not to use his fathers gun right he understands that if he does that the cops have got to see that hes tied to the crime so if i understood that clearly enough to write about it four or five months ago would it make sense that id just go ahead and use hals gun hardy shrugged maybe you figured out some way you could make it work but i didnt it wouldnt have worked so i wouldnt have done it not in real life wu came forward but hals gun was there andrew but that was i mean look i got the idea from writing the story we have the gun there on stage hardy butted in weve already done this lets go to something a little more personal your best friend lanny is it lanny has testified that you thought mooney and laura were intimate thats why you brought the gun to school in the first place and thats another one andrews expression was alight with triumph my character trevor never would have showed the gun to anybody at school i wouldnt have shown it to lanny if id been planning to use it i mean think about it would that make any sense would a guy smart enough to write the trevor character be dumb enough to show the gun around smart guys do dumb things all the time hardy said the question is did you believe that laura and mooney were having sex deflated andrew sat back i thought maybe thats why i wrote the story but then we got back together you and laura hardy asked between the fiction and the reality he almost felt he needed a scorecard i guess i missed the breakup what was the timing on that before christmas a couple of weeks after we got on the play and why did you break up again she broke up with me over me being so jealous but then after christmas you got back together right how did that happen again the lick of pride she convinced me there was no reason for me to be jealous in other words wu put in you started having sex andrew nodded but in the story hardy wasnt letting this go julie having sex with trevor didnt make any difference in fact it only fueled his jealousy right but thats not what happened with us suddenly he brightened in fact ask lanny about that hell tell you what wu asked about you having sex with laura no the question rankled him i didnt tell him about that he read doubt in both their faces thats the truth i didnt brag about it laura and i that was private it was nothing like in the story at all that was another reason i didnt think i could send the thing out those descriptions they would have hurt lauras feelings thats not how we were thats how trevor was dont you guys see that hardy prompted him we were on lanny i never said a thing to lanny ive never told anybody about me and laura in fact until right now nobody even knows wed gone that far it was only between us okay hardy unimpressed with andrews vision of his own virtue pressed the inquisition so what do we ask lanny about whether i was jealous anymore after we got back together i didnt have to tell him why about the sex i mean but i did tell him that all the jealousy was over but you still kept the gun in your backpack and while were at it you want to tell me how a spent shell casing im assuming from your fathers gun got into your car i think that must have just been bad luck when i first took the gun i wanted to see what it felt like to shoot it so i drove out to the beach one night and fired it a few times from inside the car just outside one casing must have kicked out and gone back in through the window it must have hardy said but it still leaves you with the gun in your backpack for at least several weeks after you say you had no intention of using it except of course hardy paused for your motivation i should have put it back i see that now oh and another thing i just remembered you just remembered hardy said dont start remembering things now andrew no about the story another thing i would have done definitely that trevor did when he went for his walk he made it a point to talk to the clerk in that store remember that vividly hardy said what of it on my walk on my real walk that night i didnt do that i didnt stop in some store and establish where i was and i would have dont you see trevor thought of it so i would have terrific hardy said theres progress the problem were on though is still that you didnt put the gun back in your fathers drawer and mr salarco happened to see it at mooneys he paced three steps to the wall turned around andrew i promise you im a lot gentler than anybody else youre going to talk to in the courtroom i want to get your answers down here so we can have an opportunity perhaps to give them a more positive slant if and when you get up in front of the judge are you with me whats my other option hardy snapped his reply ive already told you that your other option is pleading guilty as amy suggested at the beginning if and this is a big if theyll still do the deal you want that no all right so heres my last question did laura in fact wind up staying at mooneys once in a while after you left to your knowledge did he ever drive her home yeah just like in your story well except they didnt he hesitated have sex are you sure about that when he didnt answer immediately hardy pounced yes the answers yes andrew youre sure about that if you ever get on the stand there is no doubt at all do you understand cowed the client nodded if im not sure the jury will think ive still got a motive his mouth a tight line hardy nodded good andrew thats correct and you know for sure they didnt have sex because you and laura talked about that the way you talked about everything isnt that right yes sir thats right and because you talked about everything you knew everything important about her and her life isnt that true andrew sat back in his chair suddenly wary pretty much everything yeah he said everything important andrew wu couldnt wait any longer what mr hardys getting at is that laura was pregnant did you know that thats what they told me after the autopsy but before that didnt you know she was carrying your baby hardy asked him you know that dna sample they took when they booked you they called with the results before we came up here today it was yours it had to be andrew said i know that but you didnt know it while she was alive wu asked that she was pregnant she didnt tell you no she didnt andrews face went slack and told the whole story hed just told his attorneys that he and laura shared everything their most intimate secrets but hed had no clue shed been pregnant hardy certain that hed never had a client who was less inherently credible cast a quick glance at wu andrew must have seen it its really bad isnt it hardy rubbed a hand back and forth across his forehead this might be a good time to take a break he said hardy left for a lunch meeting and wu stayed with andrew preparing her witness list revisiting his alibi playing devils advocate for what she guessed would be brandts attack at the hearing it continued to be dispiriting work getting information andor cooperation from andrew was like pulling teeth without an anesthetic it was early afternoon by the time they finished ray cottrell was coming up the hill to the cabins when wu walked out into the sunshine he got to the gate a few steps before she did and held it open for her when she thanked him he took it as an opening so howd it go today he asked she made a face shrugged all right i guess curb your enthusiasm you really want to know hes pretty depressed hes looking at life in the joint youd be depressed too i guess so she paused can i ask you something sure you were in court when andrew wouldnt plead when he said he didnt do it well thats whats got him looking at life without okay whats the question she considered her phrasing you pretty much know how things work up here youve seen a lot of these kids im thinking andrews got a lock on an eightyear top hes got to take it he doesnt understand that whatever the actual truth is it looks like he did it almost any jury is going to find him guilty i dont understand why he cant see he can still get out of this johnson might still take a plea andrew doesnt have to be looking at life he probably thinks it matters that hes innocent if he is she shook her head frustrated thats so not the point he probably thinks it is well thats my question why cant he see it isnt what matters is playing it to your best advantage theres a system here a way that it works and its not going to work to let him out so he should take the best deal they offer right is it only because im a lawyer that i see that so clearly cottrell stared off somewhere behind her maybe okay but look she said even if hes in fact innocent he could take the plea and his dad could buy a team of private investigators who might find something that could get him out might and could not exactly a lock eight years a kid his age its the rest of his life you ask how he feels he just wants to get back out he doesnt care how it works she set her jaw heres how it works ray theres one rule maybe you could help andrew with it if you two talk whats that you listen to your lawyer ninetynine times out of a hundred youre better off but theres that one cottrell said if you think the one chance where youre not better off happens to be you its hard to take you still play the odds you deal with it for a second he seemed almost angry with her view of it but then he shrugged or not he said anyway it looks like youre feeling better today the reference took her a minute oh than yesterday she broke a smile i always feel better than i did yesterday that was the low point of my life thats good news then the low point of my life hows that its behind you everythings better from now on thats a nice way to look at it she paused then added though i may never drink again darn he clucked with disappointment i was going to ask if i could buy you a drink sometime the comment stopped her cold glancing quickly up into the pockmarked face she cocked her head sighed as though she meant it im flattered ray she said i really am but ive got a policy about seeing people with whom i have a professional relationship ive found its just not a good idea sure he said no sweat its cool im sorry i really am its nothing personal at all no he said why would it be he pointed at the cabins well ive got to get in to work see you around if she thought cabs were few and far between downtown they were an endangered species up here on the hill now she waited at the corner of market berating herself for more stupidity being friendly to the bailiff but again her actions had been misinterpreted this was becoming a goddamn trend she was tired of it no cab she checked her watch quarter to two shed been standing here for nearly fifteen minutes she should have called and ordered one now she reached down into her briefcase pulled out her cellphone flipped it open suddenly a purple pt cruiser pulled up to the curb she stepped back as the window came down brandt was leaning over i couldnt help but notice you standing here when i left the building five minutes ago are you waiting for somebody where are you going downtown me too you want a lift he pushed open the passenger door professional courtesy he said she started to hesitate then realized she was being foolish she could take a ride downtown with him ray cottrell was outside on guard duty watching an inmate basketball game the court was on the far side of the cabins at the highest point of the grounds the fence topped with more razor wire ran along a ridge that fell off in about a hundredfoot cliff to market street just below he turned around for a minute and happened to see something familiar in the woman standing on the corner down there squinting in the bright sun he moved to the closest spot on the court for a better look it was her all right uptight lawyers he should have known i dont see people with whom i have a professional relationship but still he watched her even at this distance she was a lot easier to look at than anything else he was likely to see today all dressed up today but yesterday with the jeans and sweater hed seen what she packed under that business suit man the basketball slammed into the fence a foot in front of him rattling the chain link maybe one of the players noticing he didnt have his eye on them taking the opportunity to shake him up a little he shot a glance at the court everybody getting a kick out of making him jump he ignored them looked back down for another glimpse of wu still there then suddenly he saw jason brandts car no mistaking it that yuppie piece of shit pull up from around the corner come to a stop in front of her cottrell watching as she steps back talks into the passengerride window the door opens she gets in she doesnt see people with whom she has a professional relationship does she cunt he thought for the first several blocks neither of them spoke finally brandt said so wheres your car back at the office i drove up this morning with mr hardy but he had a meeting i told him id get a cab we dont see too many cabs up here i noticed they went another block in silence brandt finally broke it so what did your boss want to meet andrew hes coming on second chair brandt threw a look across the seat you okay with that we didnt vote on it she forced a small laugh i havent exactly impressed him at every turn you must admit he didnt comment after a minute she said anyway ive been distracted again he looked over she was looking straight ahead her big briefcase lying flat on her lap her hand clasped and resting on it you might as well know that my dad died a few months ago i guess i havent been myself im sorry he said you should have told me when the words stopped yeah well its not the kind of thing you talk about when youre getting picked up especially if you think its why youre letting yourself get picked up he let that thought hang in the air between them for a minute you could have told me he repeated maybe she said but i didnt want to find out find out what if youd want to deal with baggage yeah i try to avoid that at all costs me too as you said were the same after a moment he reached out his hand across the seat friends he said tentatively she gave it a second then nodded okay she said i guess so they shook on it during the previous administration the preferred firing method for the das office had been a pink slip on your chair while you were out at lunch or even making a quick court appearance just so long as there was no direct confrontation or discussion youve had your job for sixteen years and youve got three kids two just starting college and you go down to department for fifteen minutes and come back and surprise youre an at will employee and now youre fired thanks for the memories the terminated tended to take this so badly that for a period of time the da actually had an armed investigator posted outside the office in case somebody wanted to lodge a violent personal protest boscaccis more straightforward management style in this regard was making it easier for glitsky and lanier he had held exit interviews for every assistant district attorney he laid off under jackman and hed filed the records of those interviews as well as other personal data alphabetically in his secretarys credenza this narrowed the list of truly disgruntled exassistant district attorneys down from seventeen to three and glitsky had assigned those three to the homicide inspectors belou and russell the other fourteen would be interviewed and otherwise checked out by the general work officers although hopes were not high that these interrogations would lead to a break in the case the last of the boscacci layoffs had been nearly a year ago in a back booth under the windows at lou the greeks glitsky was telling marcel lanier that he didnt consider it likely that at this remove in time someone would suddenly get mad enough to kill allan for it but i think weve got to look there anyway eliminate the obvious then move down the list lanier chewed at todays special potstickers cooked up in some kind of yogurt sauce with garlic and paprika over rice im not sure that these guys are even the most obvious anymore lanier said although yesterday they seemed like a good place to start if nobody heard the shot it probably was silenced and if it was silenced it was a pro glitsky sipped iced tea the lab says the boscacci bullet has scuff marks that could be from a silencer not certain but possible and if it was a pro i agree we lose but since thats out of our control for years lanier had been a homicide inspector under glitskys supervision and now they fell into an old and familiar routine it wasnt a robbery lanier said so its someone he knew so its about motive right and we eliminate the family yeah i agree and no caseload to speak of just one murder and that one kind of selfenclosed he mostly assigned cases thats the job true but he mightve been riding herd on some actives he was also pulling guys to trial whod been waiting around in the system for a while he was ramrod for that program lanier had a small notebook out and jotted thats real he said glitsky nodded maybe we want to look at whos coming up the pipeline somebody with mob connections russian chinese vietnamese regular mafia im not up on the latest do any one of them use suppressors more than the others any of them would simple business all right speaking of business what about the union stuff lanier forked some special nodded i dont see someone with the union getting so bent out of shape about the negotiations that he takes allan out hes just watching clarences back he probably leaned toward giving the union a lot they wanted anyway agreed not worth pursuing without some kind of tip okay whos that leave with motive i mean our professional hes getting paid thats motive glitsky shook his head but were counting him out as hopeless somebody else the rest of the known universe tempted to smile and ruin his reputation glitsky sipped tea he looked up as lou himself stopped by the table abe you dont like the special glitsky had taken one bite and realized he wasnt that hungry its great lou but i didnt realize it had yogurt in it im allergic hey whynt you say so ill have chui whip you up something else shes got a whole tray of potstickers still hot back there on the steam table she could throw some soy over em vinegar hot flakes youd swear you were in chinatown thanks lou but me and marcel are out the door in a minute weve got a meeting in fact we were getting the check just now all right ill run and ring it up he pointed to the untouched dish but i dont like this it happens again youve got to let me know right away and ill tell chui she uses yogurt all the time gives her stuff that greek taste everybody loves but shed cook up something special for you abe i mean it he went off to get the bill and glitsky said the awful thing is i think she would so where were we the known universe how do you feel about checking out everybody hes put away as a prosecutor i mean in like what twentyfive years whens the last time youve heard anybody did that not recently but its a few less than the whole universe and weve got the general work people to look they start with anybodys whos gotten out of the joint recently you mean somebody that boscacci sent away right lanier shook his head its not what they usually do abe i realize that glitsky thought a second okay we put that on hold for a few days and instead check the gun shows for what for somebody selling silencers glitsky cut off laniers reply you never know we might get lucky at least were doing something maybe ill go do one of the shows myself you think somebodys going to talk to you at one of those places well its either that or we start slogging through twentyfive years of old records and find every case allan ever won and theyll talk to me at the gun shows i wont wear my uniform yeah lanier replied thatll fool em glitskys friday afternoon had originally been scheduled to be taken up with addressing the pakistan association of san francisco at the bay area band shell music concourse in golden gate park when he got back to his office from lunch he debated with himself for the better part of five minutes before placing a call to frank batiste he told the chief that there had been a possible development in the boscacci matter and he personally wanted to look into it perhaps he suggested one of the departments senior press officers could stand in for him at the pakistani gig and deliver some poignant remarks which were certainly to be better received than his own in any event on his way out the door to his office deputy chief of administration bryce jake longoria called out and stopped him although he ran around as much as any deputy chief longoria was again behind his desk again at his computer im out the door bryce what can i do for you dont let me slow you down i was just wondering if youd had any luck with your jury question my jury question the last time we talked somebody whod been on a jury somewhere a hundred years ago glitsky closed his eyes trying to bring it back he shook his head about to give up when the name came elizabeth cary he said maybe i dont know if you ever told me that was it shot at her doorstep last week still nothing though not with her last time we talked i recall was about five minutes before leshawn brodie broke and since then boscacci those two washed mrs cary clean out of my brainpan and she hasnt had much opportunity to come back but why you got an idea no longoria shook his head lifted and dropped his shoulders it just seemed vaguely like real police work so it got my attention a chuckle tickled at glitskys throat you too huh longoria waved a hand at his surroundings the desk he said you know i hear you so where are you off to glitsky took a step into the room between us bryce im cutting school checking out a gun show what for see if i can pick up a line on somebody selling suppressors illegally nobody heard the shot that killed boscacci longoria held up a finger and turned to his computer tapped a few keys look at this first he said i may save you a trip glitsky not particularly wanting to save himself a trip crossed to the desk and leaned over it what am i looking at i just ran a search for gun suppressor you know how many hits i got he scrolled down to the bottom of the screen five thousand eight hundred twentyeight and youre going to a gun show got to be quicker than checking all of those plus youre not stuck in the office there is that glitsky was stuck on the screen when did suppressors get legal oh theyre not longoria replied with a breezy air all these listings they clearly state that sale of suppressors is only permitted for government agencies and police departments police departments we dont use em yeah we do tac has a couple the tactical unit you dont know that i havent done much business with tac yeah well theyre on the roof of a building with hostages downstairs they want to zap bad guys they meet on the way down without waking up the whole block thats legal at least under federal law but these websites check em out longoria scrolled through several screens here these journals on how to make your very own sweet little suppressor from common items in your home shop for information purposes only of course or academic study im sure no one has ever bought one of these books and actually made a silencer no glitsky said that would be wrong but hed already decided that he was going to do some oldfashioned footwork outmoded though it was he told longoria goodbye then at the door turned around you think of anything i can do about elizabeth cary id love to hear ill keep it in mind on any given weekend gun shows are common in northern california glitsky had checked the internet then made a couple of calls and discovered that this weekend would feature gun doll shows in several communities santa rosa san jose fremont sacramento and the san francisco cow palace which was actually in brisbane in san mateo county the more he thought about the idea given that they werent going to waste time looking for a professional hit person the more he liked it the suppressor angle might actually give him a lead and at least as hed told longoria he was away from his desk and the endless meetings on one of the first truly lovely days of the year in his hiking boots dockers and a camouflage blouse he was far more comfortable than he would have been in uniform beyond that he didnt think he much resembled a cop the camo actually worked to his advantage that way on his way down to the cow palace he finalized arrangements for his event number detail to hit their snitches and cover all the shows over the weekend then report back to him on monday if everybody struck out glitsky might have them begin culling the internet suppliers for their mailing lists and customers even if he could get the notautomatic cooperation of alcohol tobacco and firearms it would be an enormous and tedious job pretty much comparable to assembling the list of boscaccis convictions over the past twentyodd years still it was early afternoon and he was on the road an added bonus was that he still had the services of his driver paganucci pulled the black taurus up to the cow palace parking lot and glitsky gave him two hours off the right half of the huge hangarlike structure boasted well over three hundred booths with ordnance of nearly every conceivable type as well as all the ancillary clothing equipment ammunition and literature from the smallest imaginable singleshot pistols to shotguns to assault and sniper rifles to every type of handheld sixshooter and semiautomatic gun the sense glitsky had of the place was that if it fired bullets you could buy it here and of course the weapons displays werent limited to firearms dealers were showcasing a spectacularly wide assortment of personaluse and paramilitary gear including crossbows slingshots hunting andor combat knives leather accessories the nra had a booth at each end of every aisle business seemed to be brisk glitsky couldnt help but make the observation that in spite of an apparently continuous assault from the antigun lobby the second amendment seemed to be holding its own even in the liberal mecca that was san francisco he was glad to see it as a cop although concerned with the idea of loaded guns getting into the hands of children andor burglars he was comfortable enough with the idea of home protection and private weapon ownership somewhat less thrilled with the assault rifle booths the really viciouslooking knives the weapons whose only function was essentially military their only potential targets human beings but no suppressors silencers were illegal in california but then again so was marijuana glitsky didnt believe that the former were nearly as commonly available as the latter but the street snitch hed called on his cellphone a twotime loser named walter phleger had set him straight at the cow palace you had to ask for mort you had to have a hundreddollar bill then about another grand in cash in the first hour he wandered stopped handled many weapons up and down the aisles he stopped and chatted with salespeople at five booths smaller manufacturers getting comfortable he hadnt done any street work in a very long time after the shootout last year moses mcguire had disposed of all the guns they had used in the firefight including both of glitskys colt revolvers in the interim he hadnt really missed them he wore his glock automatic with his uniform every day but now he had a hunch and on impulse he stopped in front of the colt booth there were two other customers but the man behind the counter stepped to glitsky as soon as he approached how are you doin sir jerry by his name tag was in his midthirties he was buffed under his shirt and tie and wore a clipped red mustache and jarhead haircut are you interested in buying a gun today glitsky slowly looked to one side all the way around to the other guns for sale everywhere he looked he came back to jerry and nodded it appears so doesnt it are you familiar with colts moderately i used to own a couple somebody took them technically this was not a lie i thought id see if one of these spoke to me he pointed down under the counter this python looks like the brother to the ones i lost three fifty seven yes sir the man was lifting it out placing it on the counter may i glitsky asked reaching for it he hefted it in one hand passed it to the other flipped open the cylinder removed it entirely then held the gun up to his eye and squinted down the barrel what line of work are you in glitsky checked the sight replaced the cylinder handed the weapon back to jerry security his smile did not reach his eyes and lowering his voice he cut to the chase ive always loved that gun but im looking for something that can accommodate a suppressor and im afraid that leaves revolvers out of it yes it does jerry turned rummaged in a drawer at the desk behind him and a few seconds later placed a professionally designed fullcolor brochure on the counter if youre going to go with a suppressor colt recommends its m handgun which takes your fortyfivecaliber acp cartridge the m of course is semiautomatic and takes the ss suppressor once its been threaded for glitsky interrupted the guns that got taken from me they were these three fifty seven revolvers and i had suppressors to go with them they also got taken well yes sir but it sounded like you were telling me if i didnt shoot a semi you couldnt help me no not at all although we cant authorize any sales of suppressors out of the show today we cant even carry them as im sure you realize but if youre interested maybe you havent been listening to me jerry im interested in this gun right here right now and i happen to have the thousand dollars to buy it i dont like to use a semiautomatic they jam you notice that now are you telling me you cant help me locate a silencer in this brochure of yours here for this exact weapon that im interested in putting down some money for cause if thats the case i think maybe i can find another dealer nearby who might be willing to he put the revolver down on the top of the glass counter on the other hand you put me in line with a topquality suppressor for this gun i give you my credit card come back later on after the ridiculous tenday cooling off period has expired and youve got at least one sale maybe a few more after i talk to some of my friends are you hearing me he leaned in and lowered his voice someone told me if i had any trouble i should ask for mort it was indeed the magic word jerry glanced at his other customers nobody paying any real attention give me a couple of minutes he said it was more like twenty during which glitsky wandered some more checking back at the colt booth at fiveminute intervals the fourth time jerry was talking to a heavy short bald man and motioned glitsky over this is uh abe glitsky extended the hand that held the cnote mort the mans grip was weak and sweaty but he palmed the bill like a master glanced down at it quickly apparently was satisfied lets go he said they walked out back toward the main entrance mort a couple of steps ahead of glitsky never looking back glitsky got stamped for readmission outside they turned right and walked in the bright sun through the parking lot hard up against the chainlink fence a white van with a dash full of dolls in the window squatted in the meager shade of a lone eucalyptus mort knocked once then twice on the back door then turned and without a word or a nod at glitsky headed back across the lot when the door finally opened in a fog of cigarette smoke glitsky stepped forward if hed thought that mort was overweight the man who sat on the swivel seat in the rear of the van put things into perspective he must have gone close to three hundred although the untucked hawaiian shirt may have added twenty pounds or so he was still smoking and every breath wheezed out of him like a bellows he squinted through the smoke and out into the sun and said its nine hundred dollars cash glitsky fanned away some of the smoke there was no ventilation in the van itself thats what i heard im looking at a colt three five seven revolver he took out his wallet and started counting out the bills laying them out on the filthy shag rug the huge man wheezed again put out his cigarette then swiveled and grabbed one of the thick black leather briefcases that lined a shelf behind the front seats pulling it onto his lap he opened it studied a moment then took out one of the long heavy metallic objects this isnt just a flash suppressor he said handing it over this will eliminate noise in excess of seventyfive db i can thread it and mount it here whenever you pick up your weapon a hundred dollars or you can take it with you and mount it up yourself i recommend you let me do it here ive got all the equipment as you can see you fuck it up it might kill you the left side of the back of the van was a low metal work counter with a vise and array of tools neatly mounted against the side wall he grabbed a metal box off the counter wiped his brow and wheezing with the effort reached down to pick up glitskys bills after counting them again he placed them in the metal box when the box was back on the counter he pulled a small spiral notebook from his pants pocket you got a number cells best i change the setup i like to keep my customers in the loop glitskys hands had gone damp with nerves so far everything that his snitch had told him about this operation had turned out as advertised but if this fat man had a partner sitting in any one of the hundreds of nearby cars covering him this is where it would get ugly he put the suppressor down on the rug and reached behind as though for his wallet or a beltworn cellphone instead he pulled his glock from where hed tucked in at the small of his back at first the fat mans face registered a mild surprise as though glitsky had brought along the weapon for which he wanted the silencer then realizing how and where the gun was pointed he lowered his hands into his lap then raised them slightly you can take your money back he said and whatever else is in there im absolutely cool with this you can take the truck too i dont care keep your hands where i can see them and crawl on out here he backed up as the man slowly got himself off the mounted swivel chair and pathetically on all fours made his way across the gross shag his dark hair hung in greasy shanks down around his face all the way out glitsky said then over to the fence hands on it over your head okay now slowly lift your shirt i want to see your belt and turn around all the way pants up at the ankles im not armed thats what they all say im happier making sure glitsky had him step back from the fence and still facing it lean against his hands his legs spread wide after patting him down glitsky told him he could straighten up and turn around what do you want the man asked the gun never left the mans midsection let me see some id please the mans drivers license identified him as james martin ewing of redwood shores about fifteen miles south of where they were glitsky stuck the wallet into his back pocket what do you want he said again ive been trying to make up my mind about that glitsky said i decided its pretty much your lucky day im san francisco police this brought an outraged rise bullshit all by yourself glitsky was calm all i want from you right now is that little book of your clients phone numbers that and my money back of course you think we can handle that peaceably ewings eyes were slits as he tried to figure out the angle what else how many silencers have you sold here in the past few months would you guess i dont know james glitsky steadied the gun on the mans kneecap his voice calm and thrumming with menace dont push this you make most of these suppressors yourself i take it yeah i got a metal shop at home there see youre cooperating already so i ask you again while youre still in the mood how many of these have you sold in say the last month say ten ten a month is that about your average close look man if you really are a cop youre screwing up big time i appreciate your concern glitsky said now let me see the notebook just toss it on the ground near my feet glitsky picked it up opened it it was a small book two by three inches with about ten lines on a page it was about a third filled with phone numbers ewing had been in business awhile glitsky put the book in his shirt pocket okay james heres what i want you to do let me have the keys to your van okay now i want you to start walking across this lot here toward that exit way over there the farthest one down go ahead now the exercise will do you good youre going to shoot me in the back i doubt it but either way you start walking and dont look back go youve still got my wallet thats right i do ill leave it in the car ewing scanned the lot possibly looking for some help but it was a slow and peaceful friday afternoon not much going on finally he started to walk when hed gone maybe a hundred yards glitsky closed the back doors climbed into the drivers seat opened the windows and started the motor checking the rearview mirrow ewing was still walking away he turned and lifted the metal box from the counter extracting his money he picked up the bills that remained estimated the amount as close to two thousand more closed the box with the money still inside and put it back where it had been putting the van in gear he drove to where two empty brisbane police cars were pulled up by the entrance he stopped in front of them blocking them intentionally and got out leaving the motor running and ewings wallet on the front seat then he walked out the exit gate and hopped into the backseat of his waiting ride paganuccis timing was perfect and told him to step on it lights and sirens if he had to he had a date with his wife and didnt want to be late most fun ive ever had as a cop treya put a soft hand to his face its good to hear you talking about fun again you think talking about it is good try having it i was beginning to think it had all left the planet says the man who just recently stole his best friends darts for fun that was revenge not fun my sacred honor was at stake ah they had eaten borscht and sandwiches in a booth at a noname deli on clement and now were pushing rachel along in her stroller taking advantage of the soft dusk light and the unseasonable warmth what i really love is that ill have reverse listings on everybody in mr ewings book by monday at the latest these are real people we can work on every single one of them in violation of the suppressor law and ill have the troops to go after them and you really think one of them may have shot allan no its not likely but at least its somewhere to look maybe one of the names will intersect with another part of the investigation and meanwhile youre hip deep in a murder and alls right with the world glitsky didnt answer but he knew treya was right he put an arm around her drew her in next to him i dont love feeling like im dancing on allans grave but looking for his killer is how i ought to be spending my time not going to meetings a thought struck him and he stopped how about this ive been trying to figure out how to get the atf to help us out here theyve got to have access to mailing lists from the net people who have ordered silencers or the handbooks to make them they wont be inclined to share but once i get the names from ewings list ive got something to trade right this is what you need to be doing abe working cases really you know that he walked a few more steps then stopped turned and kissed her you think he said laura wrights parents wouldnt see hardy they didnt buy his opening gambit that he and they were working toward the same goal to find lauras killer they did not even want to talk to anybody who had anything to do with defending the murderer of their daughter lanny ropkes parents were wary too but ultimately allowed the interview june wanted mark to be home for any discussion hardy might have with their son so they scheduled it for hardy rang the doorbell exactly at the stroke now the four of them sat around a pottery barn wroughtiron table in a screened patio off the kitchen door of the ropkes victorian irving street out here on twentysixth avenue supported the occasional large home on a big lot and the ropkes was one of them a tall and welltrimmed laurel hedge hemmed the backyard on all sides and long shadows fell across the deep lawn in the back theyd also had room to erect a playground set by the back hedge swing slide sandbox and half a basketball court to hardys left there was another redwood porch off what he assumed was a bedroom and on it was a large covered hot tub hardy had been introduced to the rest of the family two cute and wellmannered young adolescent girls named kim and susan but theyd disappeared by the time mark suggested the patio for the interview june poured heavily lemoned iced tea from a beaded pitcher they were a handsome family with a strong resemblance along gender lines junes button nose and athletic figure were reflected in her two daughters and mark and lanny both lanky and bigboned with prominent adams apples milky blue eyes and ruddy cheeks might have been brothers hardy had a copy of lannys transcipt and he got it out of his briefcase and came right to the point the situation is this lanny when you talked to the police you told them about andrew bringing his fathers gun to school and then talking about maybe using it on laura and mr mooney im not going to try to get you to say anything thats not true but i do want to ask you a few questions that might clarify some things for the defense im assuming youre okay with helping us out if were trying to help andrew sure he was my best friend i mean he still is june said he wants to go visit him in jail but after they arrested andrew the police said it might not be good to let the two of them talk since he was going to be a prosecution witness i wouldnt change what i said mom im not going to lie no of course youre not lanny no ones suggesting that june said we thought it seemed like a reasonable suggestion mark added thats all hardy smiled tolerantly at the parents he was starting to see why they both wanted to be here while he talked to lanny well my opinion he said is it really wouldnt do any harm to either of them but thats of course your decision he shifted to the boy so lanny what were facing immediately this next tuesday is a hearing to see if andrew gets tried as an adult or not and id like to call you as a witness to talk about the kind of guy andrew is id do that good lets talk about the gun when you first saw it what was your reaction lanny considered for a moment i dont know what you mean exactly it freaked me out i mean a gun at school is not a good idea june spoke up we dont understand why he didnt tell well at least somebody about it right away i didnt want to get andrew in trouble his eyes implored hardy to ignore his mother weve gone through this a hundred times i didnt think he was going to use it why not its just not who he is when i talked to the police they just wanted to hear about how andrew had the gun and talked about using it which he did im not denying that but that was like way back in december definitely before christmas while they were still broken up by the time of the killings it wasnt an issue at all anymore but he still had the gun lanny shot a quick look at both of his parents came back to hardy i mean youve got to know andrew hes a little dramatic sometimes he liked to play with i dont know he searched for the right word ideas after hed gotten away with it for a while he got to thinking it was cool i guess that everybody thought he was this nerdy good student and he carried a gun around he didnt have to use it it just made him feel like he was putting something over on everybody i think if you want to know the truth mooney might have had something to do with that mark cleared his throat now wait a minute lanny i thought we agreed that it wasnt mr mooneys fault that somebody shot him june concurred he didnt bring it on himself lanny let out a breath of frustration talked to hardy but andrews idea of keeping the gun for when they rehearsed mooney thought that was neat he wanted it out there i think otherwise andrew would have put it back he was starting to be afraid hed get caught hardy sat back so there was no blowup in the last day or two no not that i knew and laura and andrew were solid together more than ever i think he flashed to his parents i guess everybody knows she was pregnant by now andrew says he didnt know it while she was alive thats true lanny said he would have told me mark came forward his eyes alight with a possibility hey what about this maybe laura told him she was pregnant that night and andrew thought it was mooneys lanny turned on him raised his voice he wouldnt have thought it was mooneys dad she wasnt sleeping around she was with andrew and he knew it maybe it was mr mooneys baby though june said maybe they did have a relationship mr mooney and laura back when andrew was first worried about it hardy put a stop to the argument even if they did he said the baby was andrews they took his dna when they booked him he was the father and mooney didnt do it with laura mom for gods sake he just didnt how do you know that june asked i dont see how you can be so sure if i may hardy interjected mrs ropke do you have some reason to think he did silence descended june ropkes eyes had gone wide with surprise and an embarrassed giggle escaped well no of course not i mean her eyes went to her husband then lanny finally to hardy except well the rumors you know that hed slept with students before hardy brought a hand up to his mouth andrews short story had introduced this basic topic but this was the first corroboration of it hed heard in the real world earlier in the day hed talked to the principal at sutro and mr wagner had scoffed at the idea mr mooney was a charismatic and relatively young teacher and girls undoubtedly got crushes on him but he had never to wagners knowledge had a breath of scandal surface from hardys perspective though if rumors about mooney were even circulating then regardless of their substance this would add credibility to the prosecutions theory of andrews motive i havent ever heard anything like that mark said and if there was even a shred of truth to it sutro would have kicked him out im sure of that thats why ive never believed them either june said although hardy was not sure this was the truth he turned to the young man what about you lanny were there rumors did students think mr mooney slept around id never heard that lanny said but of course hardy reasoned lanny had come to understand the damage hed done to andrew now he wanted to protect his best friend if he could and thats what hed have to say hardy knew that if he were going to introduce any plausible alternative theory of the murders for either a jury or a judge to consider he had to get more of a handle on the lives and circumstances of the two victims if he could somehow establish that someone else had a strong motive to kill either or both of them hardy might be able to create some doubt about andrew at this stage hed take almost anything but lauras parents had already shut him out that left mike mooney hed thought that lanny ropke might give him some insight into the teacher beyond what hed already gleaned from andrew and his damned short story but if anything lanny had only strengthened andrews apparent motive this was doubly damning because clearly that was the last thing he wanted to do any thought of spending time this weekend with frannie or the kids had to be banished to the exigencies of the case and theyd opted to get in one last ski weekend before the slopes closed now full dark on this warm friday night hardy pulled up to an address on poplar avenue in burlingame fifteen miles or so south of the city he found he could park in an empty driveway what a concept and then walked on stones placed in the lawn to a craftsmanstyle bungalows porch where a light burned and where he pressed the bell which echoed within the door opened mr hardy a practiced formal smile please come in he offered a hand im ned mooney mooneys father lived on the property of the baptist church which he served as minister although he wasnt wearing a clerical collar tonight at home but a black vneck pullover and black slacks hardy followed him into a dim wellfurnished semisunken living room with a baby grand piano in one corner and a lifetime of books and magazines on the dark wood builtin bookshelves he took the deep red leather chair one of a pair of them that mooney indicated the reverend took the other one sat back smiled his professional smile again threw one leg over the other and clasped his hands on his lap there were deep bags under his eyes a sallowness to the skin which wasnt just the poor lighting a few strands of gray hair covered his scalp reverend mooney looked to be at least seventy years old though his handshake had been firm and his walk to this room steady hardy sensed a deep fatigue as though he were drawing upon his last reserves of strength you said youre defending the boy accused of shooting michael he began in a very quiet voice so im not sure what ill be able to do to help you im not either reverend though it might help you to know that what im most interested in is no different from the police i want to identify your sons killer i dont believe thats my client you dont why not from what i understand the case against him is very strong actually there are any number of problems with it not the least of which is that theres no physical evidence tying him to the murder weapon no evidence that he fired a gun at all that night and they have to prove he did andrew doesnt have to prove he didnt mooney rubbed his weary eyes and they dont have that no sir what about all the yelling didnt the man upstairs say theyd been fighting all night hardy leaned in closer i talked about this with andrew just this morning do you know what play they were practicing yes i think it was whos afraid of he stopped where the characters are yelling at each other for half the play arent they yes sir he paused they werent fighting they were rehearsing mooney eased himself all the way back into his chair slumped low eyes closed he templed his hands over his mouth and blew into them finally he opened his eyes again it doesnt really matter he said it wont bring him back no but the wrong man shouldnt be punished would your son have wanted that would you he sat low in the chair nearly horizontal ive spent all of my life in the service of god mr hardy i dont understand how he could have done this to me after he took margaret michael was all i had left the mans sincerity was heartrending he was my pride and joy he pointed with an unsteady hand you see that piano over there you should have heard michael on it playing like an angel and singing along ever since he was child he just had an immense and godgiven talent he was such a wonderful boy then those tapes do you see them that whole second shelf those are the acting jobs the television even parts in some movies i tell myself that someone born with that much god only lets us keep them a short while before he wants them back i tell myself hardy understood what he was saying hed lost an infant son over thirty years before also named michael he suddenly realized but he wasnt going to let himself get sidetracked down that path now he was here for his client reverend mooney his voice barely intruded on the rooms stillness aside from his performing what was his life like im trying to get a sense of if there might have been someone who would have a reason to want to hurt him the old man shook his head he didnt have any enemies everybody loved him do you know if hed had a runin with one of his students maybe gave somebody a poor grade you really didnt know him did you he was the softest grader in the school id ask him sometimes if he shouldnt be harder on the kids if he wasnt doing them some kind of disservice being so easy he wasnt preparing them for real life but he always said i didnt understand the importance of grades nowadays you get one b half your college options disappear he wasnt going to do that so you saw him a lot still once a week at least hed come for sunday service and stay for lunch every week we were very very close so youd know about his social life did he talk about that i know he lived alone mooney dragged himself back to upright eager to talk about michael in spite of himself hed pretty much given up on dating he was married twice you know and neither one worked out i think this was the biggest disappointment in his life especially after the wonderful life we all had while he was growing up me and margaret our marriage was his model im sure when he didnt succeed in either of his i think this sounds a little strange but i think it broke him in some way anyway after the second marriage ended he just kind of gave up on the idea of having his own family said if it was meant to happen god would take care of it how long ago were these marriages both when he was in his twenties both lasted a couple of years and two fine women too terri and catherine it seems they all just wanted different things and of course the artists life is never easy he wasnt making much money he sighed i think those failures and the constant worrying about money thats a big part of what made him turn to teaching which finally made him happy i know he loved his work the kids the plays all of it it was his life now maybe not the one hed chosen when he was young but the one god had chosen for him it was good hardy took a last look around the dim ordered cultured room if there was anything in mike mooneys life that had played a role in his death hardy was certain that mooneys father knew nothing about it driving up the freeway with the top down listening to the news to check for traffic problems and determine whether he should take the or the back home hardy suddenly leaned forward and turned up the volume police in san francisco tonight are looking into two separate shootings that occurred within fifteen minutes of each other earlier tonight in the twin peaks district both victims were shot in their homes apparently at close range and both died at the scenes police are unaware of any immediate connection between the victims a middleaged man and an elderly woman but have not ruled out the possibility that both shootings may have been the work of one gunman neither shooting appears to have been gangrelated police are advising residents in the area to be especially cautious opening their doors to strangers so far no witnesses have come forth with even a tentative description of the suspect in either shooting hardy pushed the button on his dash and flipped over into cd mode in a minute he was listening to nickel creek again the haunting and beautiful lighthouses tale he was tired of hearing about murders in the city although vaguely aware that it seemed to be turning into an unusually bloody month as it was he had his work cut out for him with andrew and for the moment he was out of ideas wu didnt go home shed missed eight hours of billing the day before and after brandt dropped her off she went to her office and closed the door behind her by six shed drafted the sixteenpage memo of points and authorities that farrell had requested on the notice rule a question of whether or not the statute of limitations had run on a clients malpractice claims against his wifes doctor who in spite of several physical examinations had failed to properly diagnose her breast cancer until it had been too late wu got into it it was a fairly sensitive analysis of when the statute began to run at the time of the original nondiagnosis or when the damage had been noticed plus farrell had given her twenty billable hours and for a change she thought she could be efficient sometime afterward they delivered her order of takeout chinese and she ate her carton of lo mein at her desk while she studied the files of two conflicts cases shed picked up one computer identity theft and one meth sales complicated by a concealed weapons charge that were coming up for prelim in neither of these cases did she entertain the slightest doubt that her clients had done what theyd been accused of nor did either of them deny it she hadnt even asked them yet it would be unnecessary and even a little rude before the prelim to press them too hard about what had happened better they should hear the evidence and then decide what their respective stories would be her meth guy was looking at a third strike if he was convicted and life in prison so he had nothing to lose the computer geek didnt think the rules actually applied to him he was tedious and whiny and kept complaining about how his court appearances were inconvenient and why hadnt wu gotten the charges dismissed yet he was a long way from being ready to face the music now it was ten oclock and she was alone in the office yesterdays hangover had become a dim memory and she pushed herself back from her desk thinking that it was friday night shed worked more than a full day expiated her demons now it was time to party to forget to score and prove again how desirable she was how charming fun worthy of love her eyes fell upon the picture of her father framed on her desk she wondered if he was seeing her now watching from wherever he might be sitting back down she pulled the picture near to her knowledge her father had never gone out and partied in his life he did his job he took care of his responsibilities raised his difficult daughter all by himself she stared at his likeness well if he wasnt going to like her anyway shed show him she wouldnt need him anymore either that was the greatest punishment she could inflict on him she could be completely independent financially secure on her own emotionally untouchable alone alone come on dad talk to me she said aloud it wasnt her fathers voice but jason brandts that she heard for a minute i thought we had something going i mean personally she saw him tapping his chest in here she sat back and gathered herself her eyes closed when she opened them her gaze fell upon the cardbox box containing the files in the bartlett case she reached down and pulled it over to her hard on the heels of the two cases shed just been reviewing she was suddenly struck by the qualitative difference between both of them and this one between all of her previous clients in fact and andrew shed been completely blind to it at the beginning assuming that her client was guilty as all of her previous clients had always been but now as she turned the pages in the files the police reports autopsies photos of the crime scene transcripts of interviews with andrew and every witness in the case she tried to take everything fresh but this time with the prejudice that he might actually be innocent certainly andrew himself hadnt deviated from his original story even when hed been presented with new evidence that seemed to damn him he always had an explanation that fit the facts andrew was an intelligent young manperfect killer illustrated that clearly enough his stubborn insistence on his own version of events when he had no illusions about how bad it made him look had a certain perverse authority she found the quote from his short story would a smart guy like me admit to these damning lapses if i had done it no id lie about them too id make up a more consistent story think about it doesnt that make more sense and in fact she had to admit that it did she pulled her yellow legal pad over in front of her and on the top of the first page wrote first criterion the minors degree of criminal sophistication lifting the rest of the pages of perfect killer out of its folder she chewed on the end of her pen trying to recall every instance where andrews story which she reminded herself was fiction which hed made up pointed more to his innocence than his guilt tomorrow saturday shed be in here writing the motion to judge johnson on the impropriety of the rushed timing on the hearing giving notice they would be cutting him no slack they had not yet truly begun and were already laying the groundwork for an appeal maybe even a writ get the appellate court involved before the even took place shed already made appointments to talk to recruit and perhaps even get time to prepare some reasonable number of the seven witnesses she and hardy had preliminarily identified to testify on the various criteria she had to nail down addresses phone numbers schedules she desperately wanted to talk to jason brandt again her hand had gone to the phone half a dozen times while shed been working each time shed drawn it back but she felt she had to apologize she had to let him know how she really felt about all of her mistakes the seemingly endless series of them she wanted to tell him that she was beginning to get some understanding of what had been driving her the ghosts that had haunted her her hand went to the phone again if he answered theyd just talk it wouldnt be about andrew she pushed the numbers heard the ringing got his machine of course it was friday night of course he was out she hung up before the message ended sighed and opened another folder it was going to be a long weekend on saturday morning alone in the house hardy showered dressed in jeans and a blue workshirt and went downstairs to the kitchen he poured himself a mug of coffee and took the first essential sip lifting his eightpound black castiron pan from where it hung from the hole in its handle on a marlin hook he put it over a high gas flame on the stove they were out of eggs hed used them all up with amy the other night and this slowed him down for a second but he hadnt eaten dinner last night at all and was famished so he cut a half inch of butter threw it in the pan let it start to melt with an english muffin going in the toaster he opened the refrigerator found some luncheon ham and cut it up with a can of new potatoes half an onion and a red pepper after it had browned up a little he added a tablespoonful of flour and a bouillon cube and stirred it all together into a dark paste into which he then poured a coffee mug full of water and stirred again after it had thickened up he tasted it added worcestershire and tabasco stirred again and turned down the heat while he went to get the paper poured over the muffin halves he figured his breakfast was at least as good as most of the specials at lou the greeks maybe hed even type up the recipe drop it by there chui would serve it over rice instead of english muffins and probably use soy sauce instead of worcestershire for the gravy but it would be cheap to make and at least for hardy this morning it was satisfying enough he could call it hearty bowl a pun abe would love it the two homicides last night made the front page the coincidences theyd mentioned on the radio had blossomed into a tentative theory it had been the same shooter theyd recovered mm slugs from both scenes and police were running ballistics to see if they came from the same weapon but in both cases there appeared to have been no sign of forced entry the woman edith montrose was seventytwo years old and lived alone on belvedere street while the man philip the fiftyfiveyearold owner of wongs fine produce lived in a duplex on twin peaks boulevard with his wife mae li the article noted that the two murder scenes were less than four blocks apart there were other similarities as well both victims were shot at very close range in the chest nothing was apparently stolen from either domicile hardy finished the article then came back to the front page and found a followup story on allan boscacci so far glitsky and his special task force didnt appear to have accomplished much he washed his dishes and poured another cup of coffee it wasnt much after am still too early to call anybody on a saturday and who was he going to call upon anyway he was beginning to think he should have gone up to northstar with the rest of the family after all certainly he hadnt helped andrews case by either of his visits last night it wasnt really too late he could hop in his car now and if he flew he could still ski a run or two before lunchtime instead he came back to the table and finished reading the rest of the newspaper hed think of something to do here there were still several people he hadnt talked to notably hal and linda north and their daughter alicia he told himself he should just show up at the wrights lauras parents and try again to get them to talk to him he thought his best bet though might be juan salarco he was a nice enough guy and something about their talk the other night had seemed somehow unresolved although hardy hadnt been able to put a finger on what it had been maybe if he went back there went over the whole night one more time talked to the wife glitsky got the call back from hardy at where have you been ive been calling you for an hour you only left one message thats because if you hear that one glitsky said you wont need the others which apparently you did since here you are calling me back true enough i was taking a walk clearing my brain it didnt seem to do much good what can i do for you you can listen to my adventure yesterday treyas getting a little tired of it after the fourth time i can tell but i think youll appreciate it all right hit me hardy said and listened to abes version of his singlehanded cow palace bust leaving the van loaded with illegal suppressors and paraphernalia not to mention ewings drivers license and address with the engine running and blocking the unmanned brisbane police cars into their places when the story ended with glitsky ducking into his car and making a clean getaway he waited a minute for hardy to say something when he didnt glitsky did i said is that cool or what yeah yeah thats your complete response to one of the great moments in my career right hardy said then with a small show of interest sorry abe i missed the end of it what were you saying as soon as he hung up hardy grabbed his telephone book and looked up juan salarcos number which was listed the phone rang four times then he heard a message in spanish juan he said at the beep soy dismas hardy abogado de andrew bartlett importante por favor and he left his number in both english and spanish hed stopped listening to glitsky about halfway through the saga when it occurred to him that maybe his friend had inadvertently supplied him with what had been nagging him about salarcos testimony all along it was a small enough point perhaps but it could prove important hed already listened to the salarco tape several times all the way through but to be sure now he got his briefcase put it on the dining table and took out his notes and the tape with some chagrin he realized hed even written a comment about street noise and whether the gunshot could have been heard over it but hed never followed up now he put in the tape and started running the interview through another time this time knowing what he was listening for it was even less ambiguous salarcos voice and turn on the tv real quiet but then there is this this scream the girl and then a a bump you could feel it up here like something dropped the house shook then right after a crash the sound of a crash glass breaking and a few seconds later suddenly boom again the house shakes another time somebody slamming the front door under us stoked up now hardy ran it back played it yet again a bump you could feel it up here like something dropped a crash the sound of a crash glass breaking boom again somebody slamming the front door under us a bump a crash a boom but no gunshot paperthin walls where even the sounds of andrews and lauras rehearsals could wake the baby upstairs and yet salarco did not hear or did not comment upon the explosive percussion of two mm automatic rounds fired probably within eight feet of him could it have been possible not to hear them the telephone rang and hardy leapt to it perhaps salarco getting back to him already pulling a break on this case at last dad something wrong with the voice something wrong altogether vin whats the matter um its not bad i mean everybodys alive jesus christ vin what its mom she didnt want you to worry but vin what about her whats happened she had an accident somebody hit her in the car no on the slope skiing is she okay where is she now can i talk to her she says shell be okay you know youre not supposed to worry but you cant talk to her they had her on a backboard to the ambulance and now theyve got her in the emergency room and the becks waiting outside in case anyway she said i ought to call you where are you the hospital in truckee by the emergency room im on my way up im on my cellphone the whole way okay and dad yeah bud hurry huh frannie was going to be okay as vinnie had said nobody was going to die but okay was a relative thing they let him take her home on sunday but as soon as she got there hardy was to make sure she got in bed and stayed there until her local doctor told her she could get up shed definitely sustained a concussion it was very much out of character for frannie who didnt like to acknowledge physical pain but she didnt argue with him at all shed be wearing a neck brace and sporting an arm sling for at least six weeks after that theyd do some more tests and have a clearer picture of what if any further damage had been done to her spine andor neck shed also cracked two ribs on her left side and sustained a pingpongball fracture of the left shoulder socket in the course of dislocating it by the time he had fed her some soup and settled her into bed it was full dusk but the beck still hadnt made it home shed been driving his hot little sports car following close but theyd lost sight of her in the traffic just outside sacramento and now theyd been home for almost an hour and still no sign of her for dinner hardy and vincent cooked up two cans of corned beef hash the black pan again but without any romance and quartered a head of iceberg lettuce with a mayo and ketchup thousand island poured over it they amused themselves and kept the unspoken fear about the beck at bay by inventing tortures for the person whod run into frannie on the slopes who of course didnt even slow down and had never been caught finally they heard the front door hardy put down his fork and prepared himself not to speak harshly hed almost been unable to swallow for the second half of his meal as the minutes had passed his beautiful smart clever seventeenyearold was never late and if anything had happened to her too she stood at the end of the dining room im so sorry dad i got a flat tire in sacramento and you had both cellphones with you and i wasnt anywhere near a gas station and then i couldnt figure out where they put the spare its under the rug in the trunk vincent said thanks dear brother i know that now and i even know how to change a flat tire but dad look i pulled over and some guy stopped and i mean an older guy and he helped me but then he asked for my number and i got anyway i didnt think i thought if he followed me wait wait wait hardy held up a hand did he follow you no i dont think so but i was afraid when i was parking he stopped her again are you okay now is the car okay good are you hungry sit down ill make you something he stood up put his arms around her kissed the side of her face the top of her hair he kept his arms around her tight around her back i love you everythings all right your mothers upstairs sleeping thanks for driving my car down im sorry about the flat tire they happen they separated and she looked up at him getting her bravery together but dad she said suddenly breaking a smile what a great car finally finally the kids both relatively calmed and catching up on their weekends homework he got to the sunday paper while theyd been gone things had developed rapidly in the double homicides and by this morning executioner stalks city streets was the banner headline ballistics had confirmed that both victims in the friday night shootings had in fact been shot by the same weapon because of the nature of the attacks the executionstyle pointblank shot to the heart marcel lanier of homicide had told some reporters that he was afraid that what we had here was some type of executioner and judging by the headline the idiotic name looked like it was going to stick hardy never even looked at his answering machine until the kids were asleep he hadnt had a drop to drink since at least thursday night and was somewhat surprised to see that he hadnt missed it a bit still now he thought he could use a beer he opened a sierra nevada and turning off the overhead finally noticed the blinking light on the far end of the kitchen counter salarco getting back to him it was on a sunday night the gardener undoubtedly got up at or near daybreak hardy wouldnt be doing himself or salarco any favors by calling back this late for a minute he cursed himself for all hed absolutely had to do this weekend that hed left unaccomplished his clients hearing was now only two days away and hed made no progress of any kind it had been through no fault of his own true but he knew that other lawyers might have found a way to proceed on the case even through two such difficult days they might have called in partners or associates hired private investigators even pled hardship to the judge he might have thought to do something but all hed been able to think of was the suffering of his wife the worries of his children the needs of his family so sue me he said aloud put down his unfinished beer went up to get some rest hardy got the phone before it finished its first ring next to him frannie moaned but did not wake up it seemed to be sometime in the middle of the night pitch out the window hello his sleepedged voice cracked he cleared his throat and said it again hello the voice was urgent yet controlled the words hastily strung together sorry to wake you up sir its amy i just got a call from the ygc andrews tried to kill himself give me a second he was up moving to the bathroom where he closed the door behind him and turned on the light blinking in the glare what do you mean tried is he alive what happened all i know is they called me about ten minutes ago they said he tried to hang himself in his cell but the guard heard something and got to him in time to cut him down or maybe the shirt he used ripped it wasnt clear it doesnt matter so where is he now they were bringing him to sfgh san francisco general hospital im on my way down now ill meet you there dressed now in the same clothes hed been wearing yesterday and saturday before that down in the kitchen he stopped to write a note to rebecca and vincent telling them where he was going theyd been getting themselves ready for school making their own breakfasts their bag lunches for some time now beyond that hardy didnt know the monday morning routine but he was confident they could work it out themselves he reminded them to check on their mother upstairs make sure she got some food and liquid and her pain medication hed be back home hopefully by midmorning if he could again hed be on his cellphone call with any questions or problems he grabbed his briefcase glanced at the clock on the kitchen wall outside he paused in thin fog at the sidewalk just outside his gate realizing that he didnt know where rebecca had parked his car last night well fortunately they had two of them now if he could only remember where hed parked the runner after a minutes reflection it came to him and he turned up toward clement halfjogging now he covered the two blocks down to thirtysecond then turned right the car was about midway down the block under a burnedout streetlight the front seat was dewdrenched and cold inside the car in fact it seemed exceptionally cold but the reason for it didnt really register until he turned to look over his shoulder as he put it in reverse so he could pull out the backseat window on the passenger side wasnt there anymore neither he suddenly realized were the skis theyd left the night before now in a flash his actions last night came back to him double parked in the street right out front of his house he and vincent had helped get frannie inside then hed gone on the daily search for a parking place finding this spot a couple of blocks away not too bad considering in his rush to get back to his wife hed locked up of course but hadnt unpacked this car thinking to return soon with his son but then the beck hadnt shown up and knowing what hed find he got back out of the car and walked around to where the broken glass covered the sidewalk crunching under his feet he opened the door and peered over the backseat into the storage area in the back and verified that theyd not only taken the skis but the poles and boots and luggage bag they used for the rest of their stuff gloves goggles extra clothes everything the deck was bare cleaned out sick at the world he got back in behind the wheel started the engine put on his lights and pulled out into the stilldark street wu wore a dark blue jogging suit and tennis shoes a black and orange giants warmup jacket no makeup her hair was back in a ponytail hardy thought she could have passed for about andrews age because its my fault thats why she was saying how could it be your fault hardy had had enough of hospitals over the weekend with frannie to never want to see one again and yet here he was now outside the emergency room at sfgh aptly nicknamed the san francisco gun rifle club by the law community he and wu sat on red moldedplastic chairs and he was drinking vending machine coffee from a paper cup i spent almost all day yesterday with him going over the criteria ways we might be able to beat them it wasnt too heartening by the time i left he was pretty down did you tell him about our plan to call witnesses on the crime itself she nodded sure but by that time were on number five he figured we couldnt win on any of the first four either not after his short story got out so he was going up that was his opinion we couldnt do anything to stop that she hung her head wearily came back up to hardy i keep thinking if only i wouldnt have gone in to talk to him it wouldnt have come to this but what was i supposed to do who else except andrew could have a young asian woman in bloodstained blue scrubs and a stethoscope was approaching them wu stopped talking and they both stood up the officer who brought him in told me you were with the hanging victim she said hes going to have trouble talking for a while and hell be in some discomfort but fortunately whatever he used evidently his shirt couldnt hold him and the fall didnt break his neck hes going to live the officers want to take him back to the ygc but i told him were going to hold him here for observation for at least a day thank you hardy said under the circumstances id make it a close watch we will the doctor said do you know where his parents are by the way does he have parents theyre in palm springs i believe at a tennis tournament wu said then including hardy but im concerned about his sister the ygc called his home first and there was no answer at all they called me next so no parents the doctor said and people wonder where kids go wrong the young womans face was set in frustration can we talk to him hardy asked she shook her head no he cant really talk also ive got him sedated for now hell be out for a couple of hours and he really wont be able to talk normally for at least a few days a pause then a gentler tone do you know why he might have tried to do this hes got a hearing coming up soon wu said he thinks hes looking at years in prison the doctor nodded what did he do the charge is murder wu said but there are questions this was the first time hardy had heard wu say something like that and he shot a glance at her wu nodded back hardy and wu were walking across the parking lot out in front of them the sun still hadnt cleared the hills across the bay and wisps of fog still hung in the air but the chill had already gone out of it overhead the sky was a clear blue and there was no wind what did you mean in there there are questions which hasnt exactly been your mantra since you got on this case i was wondering if something had happened nothing specific i just decided that i needed to adjust my attitude if i wanted to keep on defending him his position hasnt budged hes innocent she shrugged so i guess i decided to try on believing him see what it felt like at least its got me thinking that it might be possible after all otherwise why would he persist in all these insane contradictions until i read his short story i thought he just might not be too bright but we know it isnt that no we know it isnt that right so now im kind of leaning the opposite way thinking hes just too smart to have made up so much dumb stuff he wouldnt have shot them and left the gun on the table for example period he just wouldnt have done it anyway once i decided maybe he wasnt lying about everything it gave me some hope thats funny hardy told her that some similar thoughts had been surfacing for him since hed started to consider the fact that the upstairs neighbor the states prime witness hadnt said hed heard any gunshots but as soon as hed said it aloud to wu he immediately backpedaled its nowhere near certain he said ive got to talk to him again salarco about the gun what it looked like if it had any kind of silencer on it he would have had to notice but if not then ive got to find out if the cops found any kind of muffling agent at mooneys maybe the shooter shot through a pillow or something theyd both stopped walking wu faced him theres no indication of that from the crime scene pictures i didnt see anything in discovery i know i doublechecked them myself and salarco probably would have mentioned something like a silencer if hed seen one its a big old protruding tube stuck on the end of the barrel you know its not something youd miss so what are you saying if all of this gets borne out well the simplest interpretation which is always the best is that if andrews gun didnt have a silencer on it and he didnt use anything to kill the sound then that gun the purported murder weapon never got fired that night hardys eyes were bright with the possibility its not quite exactly the other dude that i must say theres no sign of but andrews gun is a big part of the picture if i can get johnson to listen or get salarco to testify that he got a good gander at the gun and it looked normal then wait a minute what well being devils advocate andrew could have used a silencer killed mooney and laura then taken the silencer off and ditched it before he came back to call nine one one then got rid of the gun a second trip i dont see that happening i cant see andrew doing that i dont either but jason brandt will see it and the arguments then refuted and were back where we started no not exactly hardy said at least im not what would be the difference wu asked you mean if everything is just as i described it to you now salarco didnt just miss the two shots no muffling agent in the house no silencer on the gun yeah what then hardys eyes were out of focus while the idea worked itself into something like resolution in his mind the matter settled he came back to her then im pretty sure i dont have to pretend to myself anymore if salarco didnt hear the gun then andrew didnt shoot it and you know what that means what ive got to believe whats that hes innocent somebody else killed them part three hardys medical business with frannie taking her to the doctor getting her back home into bed and fed trumped any interaction he might have had with juan salarco and took up a good portion of his morning rebecca the dear had told her mother that since dad had taken the regular car she had no choice but to drive herself and vincent to school in the convertible so after hed changed into his business suit then called to speak with the principal at sutro he swung down to their high school found the s in the lot and switched cars on her leaving a note about the broken window on the runner so she wouldnt think it had happened at school he drove by salarcos saw that the truck was nowhere to be seen and realized hed have to come back after the workday as far as he knew juans wife anna spoke only spanish beyond that he doubted if she would know the precise residence where her husband was working at any given moment anxious though he was for salarcos information he had to pass for now he had other questions and precious few answers it wasnt far to sutro and he made it there by the end of the schools lunch hour the outer administration office was empty but hardy knew where he was going and went right to it the principal was in his office behind his desk doing some paperwork and stood when hardy poked his head in mr wagner sorry to barge in but time is short and there isnt anybody out front dismas hardy andrew bartletts attorney wagner portly and slightly foppish with a bow tie and suspenders reached a hand out over his desk certainly hows he doing in his earlier call hardy had told him about the suicide attempt hes alive hardy said which is good enough for now wagner swiveled in his chair looked out the window behind him at the play yard still packed with students this has been a terrible tragedy for the school he said to think that he was coming here every day for weeks after he sighed our counselors are a little overwhelmed you know students realizing theyd been walking around or even taking classes with a murderer an alleged murderer hardy said alleged or otherwise wagner spun back around gave him the mantoman mr hardy please do you really think its possible andrew is not guilty yes possible although proving im right may be a different story i must say its refreshing to hear someone say they dont think hes guilty pretty much all i heard after the arrest was that it was openandshut id heard the same thing myself i keep hearing it in fact wagner moved some papers around on his desk you know it would be so wonderful for the school if that werent the case its bad enough that the two victims were members of the community but if somehow andrew were found innocent it might go a long way toward starting the healing well you know sir thats the reason i came by here today ive got a hearing for andrew scheduled to begin tomorrow and i wondered if i might ask you a favor i understand his sister goes here too thats right well i know its unusual but ive got some questions for her and for the two other people that were in the play with andrew that really might be of some use i know i could wait and see all of them at home with their parents and maybe their lawyers he thoughttonight but im in a time crunch of major proportions would it be possible to borrow a room here in the office and pull those three people out of class for a few minutes when he saw that wagner had a problem with the idea he added mr north assured me that i would have your complete cooperation in the defense of his son wagner considered a moment im sure we can do that a bell rang and he looked up at his wall clock fifth period he said together or separately separately would be better hardy said but it wasnt to be that simple wagners desire to see andrew cleared because it would benefit sutro might have blinded him to the fact that he should not under any circumstances be allowing his students to talk to an attorney without parental permission but obviously he couldnt let hardy be alone in a room with one of his students either hardy was obliged to let him sit in he couldnt help but think that this changed the dynamic dramatically he had been planning a glovesoff discussion with each of the kids but he had no choice if the meetings were going to happen at all theyd be in wagners office with the principal in attendance alicia breezed in first hardy had heard next to nothing about her either from wu or from andrew his only preconception was that she was probably the model for the sister in andrews short story locked in her room listening to death music and smoking dope his first look at her very pretty with beautiful long dark hair clear skin and eyes designer clothes was a bit of a shock and brought him up short andrews story he reminded himself was fiction if the judge wound up having trouble with that concept hardy thought he could bring in alicia as a witness and win the point without any further debate she took a few confident steps into the office threw at glance at hardy a stranger to her and spoke to wagner you wanted to see me sir alicia this is mr hardy hes one of the lawyers representing andrew hed like to talk to you for a few minutes if you dont mind her face grew serious and she nodded first at wagner then at hardy sure okay why would i mind although andrew and i arent exactly what id call close why not hardy asked well i dont know hes just we dont have that much in common i suppose so you dont know much about whats happening with him just of course the basics what dad and linda have told me i thought it must be some misunderstanding or something that dad would have to work out hardy found that an interesting turn of phrase he asked her would you be surprised to hear that andrew tried to kill himself this morning she stared all the vivacity drained out of her face she looked to wagner is that true is he dead no but mr hardy was at the hospital this morning he tried to hang himself hardy said he didnt succeed the news derailed her for a beat without asking permission she went to a chair and sat i guess i could see him doing that she said hes just always so intense and so unhappy and then when laura was killed it got so much worse she turned and faced hardy full on but i dont think he killed her you dont think he did do you hardy shook his head no there might be some facts about that night that dont work if andrew did it see i didnt think he did either hardy hadnt quite said that but hed take it he stood up hands in his pockets and began to pace the room but the problem ive got is that i dont know what else was going on in andrews life something that might have had some connection to mr mooney or laura and given someone else perhaps a reason to have killed them surely not another student here wagner said im not implying that theres no evidence implicating anyone else here at sutro hardy came back to alicia but youre his sister you may have heard andrew say something that didnt seem to mean anything at the time but now when you think back on it it might have been important he thought that given the different crowd alicia hung out with the odds were against her providing some alternative theory of the crime but at least she might start thinking about her brothers situation differently in hardys experience schools like companies and coffee groups and mens clubs always had secrets if andrew hadnt killed mooney and laura then the person who had done it might have had some connection to sutro at least from alicia or one of the other students he might get some rumors something to wave in front of a judge or jury as opposed to what he had now which was nothing nick and honey are the character names of the young couple in whos afraid of virginia woolf who become foils for the vitriolic outpourings of george and martha as their relationship implodes mooney cast andrew and laura as the leads with the secondary couples parts going to steve randell as nick and jeri croft as honey if alicia north was the norm for the popular look at sutro jeri was something else again shed dyed her hair a dark henna rimmed her eyes with black kohl shadow waifthin the pajama bottoms she wore hung low enough on her hips to reveal a hint of pubic hair on her belly under the black tshirt in addition to the silver rings adorning both of her ears shed pierced her nose eyebrows and tongue when she got to the office she greeted wagner and then hardy with an illdisguised wariness she tugged her pajamas up an inch or two so why again am i here wagner went through the explanation for a second time the girl scanned hardy up and down clearly pegged him as another meddling adult in the wagner mold suit and tie a dork who started out by saying im trying to get at the truth of what happened that night she rolled her eyes an actress all right i dont think so she said if youre andrews lawyer and youre any good youre trying to get him off whether its the truth or not so give me a break all right and that night i dont know what happened i wasnt there okay hardy said thanks for coming down then dismissing her two could play at that game she threw a confused glance first to hardy then at wagner thats it hardy stonewalling shrugged you obviously dont want to talk about it i want to help andrew and im sure there are other students here at sutro who feel the same way i do so why waste each others time sorry to have interrupted your class she shifted her weight hip cocked who said i didnt want to help andrew hardy giving her nothing looked up from scribbling on his legal pad as though surprised she was still there i got that impression its not a problem thanks again he went back to his notes spoke to wagner lets try steve randell wait a minute steve doesnt know anything either patiently hardy said well if thats true im sure hell let us know what could he tell you he wasnt there either i dont know jeri what do you know say about laura you mean she and mooney we can start with that sure well the main thing they didnt have anything going sexually but andrew thought they did maybe i mean yeah sure the first couple weeks of rehearsal laura got a crush on him so did i you want to know the truth he was just so there you know this is mr mooney now hardy ventured an encouraging smile just keeping the players straight mr mooney was so there you said you want to talk about that a sigh have you met lauras parents no they wouldnt see me there you go they wouldnt see her much either im going to sit down she folded herself down onto the floor the thing about mike mr mooney is there was no like barrier you know i mean at school he was a teacher and all but when you got acting you were with him just completely equal hed get inside your space and youd just want to stay there it was just total acceptance of what though exactly if you can say she paused thinking of who you are of what you were doing and laura how did she react to that what do you think like a desert to water she bloomed man everybody did and this is when andrew became so jealous jeri didnt answer right away okay she finally said lets get this part straight at first yeah andrew kind of freaked but youve got to remember that this was like in november or something four months before the shootings happened four months you know how long that is thats half the school year all right but you said andrew freaked what do you mean by that first though you had to know laura were you and she friends like best on the floor with her legs crossed jeri bent over at the waist stretching came back up the movement seemed unconscious but it bought her some time to get her emotions in check you know she was seriously depressed no i hadnt heard that thats the key though shed been in therapy forever she tried to kill herself two years ago did you know that hardy and wagner exchanged glances and wagner gave a small nod acknowledging it do you know why hardy asked a million reasons the world you know but mostly the home scene sucked what sucked about it basically clueless parents theyre heavily into the social thing here in town you know the wrights wrightway components anyway she had this whole wing of her house that was all hers so she comes home from school goes to her room and gets loaded listens to all like you know metal and death music like who jeri shook her head you wouldnt know them theyre not playing for guys like you lets just say the musics dark so anyway shes popping valiums and ludes and anything else she can get her hands on but nobody notices i mean her parents see her every day right and lauras fine shes pulling as and bs and mom and dad are all whatever as long as you dont bother me cause ive got a party you know same as andrew you mean with the drugs too no andrews uptight about drugs but the home thing gone parents thats how they connected hardy found himself working the fictional angle again the sister in perfect killer hadnt been based on andrews sister alicia but on his girlfriend laura he made it up next wondering if the wrights had discovered their daughters pregnancy and because of the rumors about mooneys promiscuity attributed it to him and what they might have been tempted to do about that he scratched a note came back to jeri so how does all this relate to mr mooney he asked she scrunched her face puzzling it out hesitantly the words started to come i guess i think laura needed somebody to notice she was alive maybe andrew needed the same thing that was kind of the baseline you see hardy didnt exactly but wanted to keep her talking so he nodded okay so youve got two needy kids andrew and laura hanging on to each other right then all the sudden really one of them wakes up now she doesnt just need anymore suddenly shes i dont know if happy is the word maybe validated mike mr mooney makes her feel that way all on her own without andrew if you ask me thats what andrew freaked about laura just had this new confidence and went flying away not with mike by herself but mike had made it happen and andrew didnt know how to handle it so howd they get back together hardy asked thats whats funny the same thing i think happened to andrew mike really thought andrew was a great actor i mean he gave him the lead and i think andrew finally just got it hed been stupid and he apologized so next time he and laura got together it was i dont know it seemed like it was on a different plane if that makes any sense so youre saying you dont think andrew was jealous of mr mooney anymore at least not by the time the shootings happened no way he just wasnt i knew them as well as i know anybody they were tight but she didnt tell him she was pregnant did you know that she was jeri glanced down to the floor yeah but she was getting an abortion she didnt want to screw things up with andrew again by getting him involved in all that it would be better if he just never knew thats why she was staying later with mike those nights getting all that worked out he was going to help with the arrangements she sure couldnt go to her parents all right but what if andrew found out about the baby and wanted to keep it might they have fought about that i doubt it and so then because he wants the baby to live he kills it i dont think so and while were at it andrew didnt shoot laura either or mike theres no way thats just not who he is hardy leaned forward then do you have any idea at all who might have this is going to sound weird i know she said her dark eyes shining now but i dont think it could have been anybody who knew either of them a tear track black with kohl coursed her cheek they were too great she said first thing that monday morning glitsky had put out the word with marcel lanier that he would like to see the field notes from the weekend work of his task force investigators on the boscacci investigation because of the twin peaks killings on friday night lanier himself as head of homicide had been otherwise employed and had not been able to participate but pat belou lincoln russell and the general work inspectors had covered all of the gun shows in the bay area that weekend except the one in fremont maybe because these san francisco cops didnt have reliable snitches in some of the outlying counties nobody came back with anything remotely resembling glitskys phone book from mr ewings truck frustrated by the lack of data glitsky still believed he was on to the only possible lead albeit a remote one to boscaccis murder so before he ran out to his am chiefs meeting he called the atf liaison for san francisco got a recorded message and left one of his own he gave a xerox copy of ewings phone book to the guys from general work and told them to get names and addresses for everyone in the book from the phone companys reverse listings he wanted them by the time the atf got back to him so that hed have something to trade the names and addresses of known suppressor buyers in exchange for the atfs cooperation in supplying still other much larger lists of similar buyers he had the personnel and the budget for once and he was looking for the nexus if any of suppressor buyers and people who might have had dealings with allan boscacci after chiefs he met with the mayors representative celia bonham at city hall to discuss some jurisdictional issues between the sfpd and the officers and administrators of homeland security after that paganucci drove him halfway home out to fillmore to talk to the new executive director of the africanamerican art culture complex about some mutual impact issues such as the use of the citys finest as private security for the complex at the citys expense back at the hall of justice he fielded questions from reporters on all three of the major events currently transpiring in his domain the handling of the leshawn brodie matter allan boscaccis murder which some reporter had now called an assassination and the double homicides of the executioner on friday night since he had nothing good or even mildly productive to say about any of these it was a dispiriting news conference glitsky couldnt seem to get much of a spin going about the fact that between the chiefs the homicide detail and his own special event number task force he had nothing to show and very little to say about crime in the city within the past six days he finally checked into his office the general work guys had done a good job while hed been going to meetings and theyd compiled a neatly typed name and address list from the ewing phone numbers which now lay under a stapler on his desk for lunch he washed two rice cakes down with a diet coke when his receptionist buzzed to tell him that two atf agents were here he felt reasonably prepared but that didnt last long the two of them aitkin and drew struck glitksy as having come straight not from their offices but from the street perhaps a bust both still wore their black field jackets with the oversized initials atf across the back both were packing in obvious bulging shoulder holsters drew made the introductions for both of them and they sat without any fanfare in the chairs in front of glitskys desk glitsky had planned to open the discussion by expressing his appreciation that theyd come down on such short notice and so on but drew barely gave him the chance before he interrupted we just wondered sir he began in a terse tone if youre familiar with the joint task force weve had working with local officers in each county and through which were all supposed to coordinate our activities sure glitsky said i called sergeant trona last friday and he told me he could get me hooked up with one of your agents by early next week which is now im heading up an event number force on this allan boscacci homicide i didnt have that kind of time he reached for his list but i think youll be pleased with my results aitkin who so far hadnt said a word came forward and took the sheet of paper drew glanced over at it without much show of interest and these are what he asked names and addresses of people whove bought suppressors illegally from a man named james martin ewing out of the cow palace or at least thats where he was working out of last friday how did you get to him drew asked ewing i had a snitch it was easier than i thought it should be finally aitkin spoke turning to drew imagine that i beg your pardon glitsky didnt much appreciate the tone do you gentlemen have some kind of a problem yes sir im afraid we do drew sat back linked his hands over his belt aitkin had carried in with him a flat leather briefcase and now he opened it on his lap and withdrew a photograph which he handed over to his partner drew in turn handed it to glitsky id like to ask you sir if this looks familiar to you the picture was of him the photo was taken last friday no doubt from the camera ewing had concealed somewhere inside his van ewing is your snitch he said drew nodded didnt you wonder why it was so easy getting connected with him you got a guy looking at twenty years if he gets caught at this stuff and you drop one name to a more or less random dealer at a gun show and youre talking to him in fifteen minutes any warning bells go off for you i thought i was having a lucky day the two agents heads turned briefly to each other drew came back at glitsky so what are you looking for background i need to know if any of these guys are connected to boscacci he pointed to his list its long odds but were not working with much the problems of any local police department were of no concern to the atf weve busted twothirds of ewings people already drew said the others were watching to see who they hang with how they hook up you know the drill which is why were asking you not to pursue this any further glitsky passed the photo back to drew his stomach was doing a mariachi dance and he put a hand over it id still be interested in getting some background on anyone who has bought suppressors see if we can get a match drew and aitkin exchanged a glance and nodded we can provide that drew said probably be a couple of days sooner would be better always of course as the two men were standing up aitkin spoke for the second time its always our intention to work with local agencies sir thats why we set up the joint task forces for mutual communication and cooperation so in future if you plan to freelance out of your jurisdiction you might check in with local authorities to find out what you might be getting into i get it glitsky said when they had gone through the door and out of the office he heard one of them say fucking locals i need to talk to you wu hadnt changed since the hospital she still wore her blue jogging suit tennis shoes the giants warmup jacket she stood in the doorway to brandts minicubicle at the ygc her mouth was dry and her palms wet even after the ride theyd shared to downtown which had seemed to break the ice a little she didnt know how he would receive her but she felt that coming here to him could be read as an apology of sorts she was playing straight with him now keeping her opposite number up on developments in the case she knew she was here with the best of intentions youre not going to like it brandt had his hand on the telephone receiver halfway to his ear but he replaced it he wore a neutral expression i already heard he said did he make it hes going to im glad i really am which leaves us some business she leaned against the doorjamb im requesting a continuance on the hearing tomorrow i wanted to tell you about it beforehand i figured you would brandt said when i heard about the suicide attempt you ought to know since were being up front with one another that i heard warvid this morning talking to his clerk about that very thing i wouldnt get my hopes up he said he wouldnt continue thats what i hear from the clerk if andrews bipedal we go maybe he wont be that remains to be seen then but let me ask you something if warvid continues on these grounds whats to stop everyone from feeling suicidal the day before their hearing brandt leaned back in his chair put his hands behind his head his feet up on the desktop lets be straight here okay this hearing is a formality you know it i know it warvid knows it my client went sideways jason hasnt that ever happened to you of course all the time but right now the only thing warvid wants is to restore order to the cosmos and to do that hes got to get bartlett back upstairs which hell do tomorrow wu went from one doorpost to the other arms crossed im calling witnesses you know ive filed a list brandts feet came off the desk he straightened in his chair youre not fighting the criteria every one all i need is one you realize that sure brandt sighed ive got to assume youve read his short story i have she said i can mitigate it all right mitigate but you cant believe that a double homicide wont strike the court as of sufficient gravity it isnt if he didnt do it brandts mouth stood halfopen when he finally spoke his voice hummed with concern amy listen last time we were in court you were admitting the petition now youve got one of the worlds fairest judges seriously upset with you and what are you going to argue that the homicides didnt happen cause thats all ive got to show that they did theres no burden of proof you know this i make a prima facie case and ive got gravity and circumstances you even get a step into arguing the basic facts and warvids going to shut you down she smiled good youre worried im not worried he said or rather im worried for you theres no argument to be made here warvids going to walk in with his mind made up as it should be maybe not after hes seen my motions but amy bartlett isnt a juvenile hes seventeen jason hes a boy brandt threw his head back brought his hands to his face finally looked at her over them i dont believe youre doing this wu took a step about the limit she could trespass without coming behind brandts desk jason listen to me you know when andrew said in court that he didnt do it he might have been telling the truth no he wasnt but what if he was so go to trial downtown and get him off but for gods sake do yourself a favor and get it out of warvids courtroom first but she shook her head intense now she leaned in to him hes already suicidal jason as it is now he thinks hes going to be in prison the rest of his life thats where he should be he killed two people amy maybe but hes innocent until brandt barked a laugh of pure disdain oh give me a fucking break you read his stuff jason you know i know hes dangerous thats what his writing shows me hes a sophisticated criminal mind who thinks he can use you and is on his way to proving it he tried to kill himself to manipulate me is that what youre saying brandt shrugged i heard the shirt he used ripped maybe he tore it a little first wu reacted in a blaze of rage bullshit jason thats just such bullshit suddenly behind them in the hallway loomed the imposing and to wu increasingly sinister form of bailiff nelson knocking on the door behind her is everything going along okay with you people he moved in closer lowered his voice the sounds traveling pretty good in the hallway here brandt spoke over wus shoulder the voice relaxed and friendly were fine ray just a friendly little pretrial conference between two country lawyers wus eyes were flashing her color high she whirled and brushed by nelson excuse me please jogging in her tennis shoes she disappeared around the corner of the hallway brandt found her car the last in a long line of them parked at the curb downhill from the front entrance to the ygc she was in the drivers seat sitting with both hands on the wheel head down from the sidewalk brandt hesitated then touched the passenger window with a knuckle leaned over so she could see who it was she reached over and unlocked the door when hed closed it again behind him they both sat in silence for the first seconds finally brandt eyes sideways let out a long sigh i shouldnt have said that in there i dont think your boy faked it she kept her own eyes forward her hands back on the wheel i came down here as a courtesy to you jason i wasnt playing any more games she paused with this case or with you the other night the words stopped she looked over at him we dont have to talk about that yes we do i think then you were right theres something wrong with me i didnt say that you didnt have to she moved her hand from the steering wheel as though she were going to touch him but stopped dropped it into her lap can i tell you something sure that night at the balboa i didnt go into that thinking about allan or andrew or the deal i thought id made that was just us that was real all right thats all i want to say okay then ive got one if it was so real whyd you kick me out i didnt kick you out you left after you said and this is a direct quote youd better be out of here by morning or were in trouble you dont remember saying that wu shook her head slowly from side to side i didnt mean legal trouble i meant i meant if this was supposed to be a onenighter and neither of us wanted to get serious you had to leave before we went any further but we already she turned on him i didnt mean the sex brandt blew out heavily no i know i know what you meant a long silence then you figured i was playing you he chuckled i love this me too its perfect a microcosm of life itself brandt said makes me think though that maybe we want to go in and get out of bartlett now wu shook her head we cant i cant abandon him and if you drop out the sevenohseven gets continued plus youd have to give a reason which would probably get you fired brandt suddenly saw something over wus shoulder and he swore across the street ray nelson was leaning over the roof of his car lighting a cigarette seeing them both now looking at him he raised a hand in greeting then opened the car door and got in he saw us wu said yes he did but so what were sitting in a car having a discussion do you think he followed us out i dont know why would he i dont know to have something on us wu looked after nelsons car now driving away the guy creeps me out ray hes a pussycat after you get to know him brandt said i dont want to get to know him no honestly you probably dont but maybe him seeing us out here was a good object lesson after all in what the wisdom of being seen together outside the courtroom top down on the convertible with coat and tie off and the top button of his shirt undone hardy with his headphones on might have been mistaken for a stressedout executive zoning out to his relaxation tapes in fact he was waiting across the street from the murder scene listening again to the tape of the other male actor in the play steve randell to whom hed talked at sutro after hed finished with alicia north and jeri croft when juan salarco pulled into his driveway at a little after three oclock hardy sat up slipped the recorder back in his pocket put up the cars hood and got out across the street salarco exited his truck and immediately went to the small garage and opened it by the time he turned around hardy was standing by his drivers side fender he raised a hand with an exaggerated nonchalance that he didnt come close to feeling he realized that ever since hed concluded his careful review of the tape hed made with juan hed begun to imagine that andrew bartlett might be innocent but he reminded himself now that belief hinged on what salarco told him in the next ten or fifteen minutes if he had in fact heard two gunshots or even what might be interpreted as two gunshots hardys hopes and maybes would be out the window he hadnt recognized before this moment how invested hed become hey he said lowkey salarcos boyish face broke into a ready smile deezmus he said coming forward to shake his hand crushing it effortlessly i try to get you this weekend after you call s√≠ s√≠ but my wife had an accident skiing shes okay but it took up some time now im wondering if i can take up a little more of yours salarco took a minute perhaps translating the request then nodded sure he pointed first i unload though the truck okay the sun was bright overhead but a light breeze kept the day cool enough and hardy decided to pitch in it seemed the natural thing to do lifting the rakes shovels and wire trimmer from their positions in the wooden slats on either side of the truck while juan wheeled the mowers and heavier gear down his makeshift wooden ramp and around into the garage when they finished juan locked up the garage and the truck and then they walked up the indoor stairs together at the door salarco called out hola got a female response and went straight through the living room past the television with its american soap opera on the screen to the cheerful kitchen handsewn curtains bright yellow cotton with a red and orange floral print cast shade over the back counter and the formica table but they only covered half the windows and allowed in bright shafts of sun anna turned as they entered hardy saw her light a smile at her husband then extinguish it when she saw him she had a large pot going on the gas burner olive oil and garlic and was cutting more vegetables onions red and green peppers tomatoes on the counter while carla the baby sat contentedly jailed spinning the plastic letters on the sides of the playpen salarco picked up the baby tucking her in his arm he then kissed his wife whispering something to her and went to the refrigerator for a couple of beers hardy took his pulled at it tried with a grin to break some ice with the wife it smells great in here she nodded politely and went back to her vegetables still holding carla like a football under one arm salarco walked over to the table and sat in one of the chairs indicating that hardy should take another one moving forward he took his tape recorder from his pants pocket and held it up getting tacit permission salarco nodded so how can i help you hardy had been waiting so long to ask that he pushed the record button and was talking before hed sat down something we really didnt get clear last time that might be important salarco moved the baby to his knee and began bouncing her up and down okay the noise of the gunshot what about it the last time we talked and i listened to the tape of our conversation a lot you were talking about the noises downstairs when the fighting was going on this is after youd gone down the first time to ask them to be more quiet do you remember s√≠ all right if you dont mind id like to go over those few minutes again with you from the first noise that woke up carla again do you think you can put yourself back there and try to remember exactly what things sounded like what you thought at the time all right we can take a minute hardy said were in no hurry i want you to think back to that night if you can carla had a high fever and shed been crying all night and then finally you got her to sleep you and anna went out to the living room and turned on the television quietly do you remember all that salarco was concentrating the perfect witness who wanted to recall the exact truth and with no one to object if hardy led him back to the scene to his state of mind s√≠ he said i am there okay hardy had memorized the sections last time we talked you said you heard a scream the girl scream s√≠ and then the first noise you heard a bump you called it where you said you could feel it in the floor as though something heavy had dropped downstairs salarco was paying careful attention he had stopped bouncing carla put one of his fingers into her mouth a pacifier his face took on a faraway look is that about right hardy asked the first noises then were a scream then a bump a nod now the next noise the second one you said it sounded like something crashing with glass breaking anna hardy noticed had stopped cutting her vegetables although she didnt turn around yes i hear that salarco said the glass breaking okay hardy threw another quick glance at anna she hadnt moved a muscle finally he said the last one was a boom again you didnt say it sounded like somebody slamming the front door under you you said it was the door slamming s√≠ okay you mean yes thats what it was right yes so would you now describe any of those sounds try to remember exactly if you can would you say any of those sounds could have been a gunshot a spark of surprise or perhaps it was something else recognition of a mistake pure fear shot through salarcos eyes he licked his lips the youthful face suddenly aged its all right hardy said youve never testified that they were youve said what youve said and people assumed now im asking you were they gunshots he was sure for a moment that hed spooked him by springing an unseen trap and he couldnt afford to lose salarcos cooperation if that happened andrew would be tried as an adult and probably convicted hardy himself might never know the truth of what happened downstairs that night he had been subliminally aware of the television in the next room in english throughout the entire course of his questions so far with juan and now needing to somehow redirect the energy and keep these witnesses talking he had to take a chance mrs salarco her shoulders tightened then she sighed and she turned around s√≠ wouldnt you say thats about right the way your husband described the noises did any of them sound like gunshots to you she didnt even have to think about it no i never thought about that before but there was no sound of any shots just the other sounds she turned to her husband cari√±o s√≠ es verdad he nodded and seemed to take some strength from her taking a breath he came back to hardy when i sit back and listen i cannot say any of the noises sounded like shots the relief almost made hardy dizzy not only had he gotten the critical admission but theyd both put it on tape now instead of being the prosecutions star witnesses the salarcos testimony would work if not to exonerate andrew then at least in his favor anna came over picked up the baby and stood holding it leaning against her husband your english is very good mrs salarco hardy said she wasnt happy or at the moment proud of it three years she said juan and i me we try at home and pick up a little here and there on tv she flashed a glare into the living room went and placed the baby gently back into her playpen hardy let them get used to the change in the dynamic he took a sip of his beer then spoke to both of them as i said before im not with the ins i will do nothing to involve you with them no matter what you say or do if they come to me with any questions about you at all i wont answer them the only person im interested in is andrew im starting to believe he may not be a killer but i juan stammered it was him i saw him with these eyes yes you did hardy said in fact you saw him twice once when you went downstairs the first time to complain the second time when he came back after youd called nine one one isnt that right yes but there was also the other time hardy clucked folded his arms sat back a moment he picked up his beer as a prop he didnt want to risk alienating salarco for good but he had another point to drive home perhaps more critical than the first and to get to it he had to expose something much worse than salarcos gunshot misperception or lack of precision that other time is what i wanted to talk about he began the time after the door slammed downstairs when you and anna jumped up from the couch and looked out the window and saw somebody turn around on the walkway out by the street it wasnt somebody juan said he pushed back a little from the table straightened himself in his chair his back stiff now and crossed one leg over the other hed picked up on hardys direction and didnt like it it was the boy andrew i saw him afraid of losing him hardy twirled his bottle took a beat im not saying you didnt juan if you saw him you saw him and thats the end of it salarco nodded an abrupt bounce of the head suddenly impaciente with all this and equally afraid of where it might go when he picked up his bottle and drank hardy seized the opportunity its just that when we talked the other night ive got a copy of the tape right here if youd like to hear it but i also wrote down exactly what you said he took the folded sheet of yellow paper from his shirt pocket opened it and spread it out in front of them here listen anna goes to this window here and i am behind her and there is the boy running away he stops under the light there and turns and anna starts to put the window up to to scream at him i think but then carla starts again with crying thats what you said juan isnt that how you remember it salarco put his bottle down and stared out through the curtains hardy pressed him the reason its so important juan the reason that this particular identification is so important he brought anna into it with his eyes is that theres little doubt that the person that both of you saw out the window was the person who had killed mr mooney and the girl very little doubt salarco pouted his visage frankly dark now it was andrew he said im not arguing with you it may have been andrew certainly it looked like andrew with the same cowled sweatshirt he was wearing that night but listen to what you said in your own words you said anna went to the window and you were behind her s√≠ so you werent at the window exactly were you could you have been maybe a couple of feet behind it no answer then the boy runs down the walkway hardy kept up his pace measured yet urgent he stops for a second under the light and turns this is the moment that you see him hes under the light he turns the cowl over his head hardy looked to anna who stood transfixed this is when anna goes to put the window up to yell at him shes angry youre angry and just at this second your baby starts crying again youre behind your wife who is standing at the window trying to pry it open and suddenly your baby screams and you turn cursing and swearing and go back to her yes salarco said softly yes thats how it was well then hardy said if you were behind your wife a few feet back from the window and she was standing in front of it trying to get it open and the boy with the cowl sweatshirt over his head was thirty feet away in only the dim light from one of the street lamps please tell me how you could possibly have seen his face salarco stared at a spot in the middle of the table not meeting hardys eyes finally he looked up im sorry se√±or but it was andrew he said monday afternoon lanier told glitsky that this would be a good time to come down and talk to the troops with the rash of killings lately lanier felt overwhelmed it was bad enough when it was the usual gangbanger mayhem and carnage but when regular citizens got killed it felt to him like another matter entirely and regular citizens were taking an especially serious hit over these past two or three weeks first with elizabeth cary then boscacci and now this executioner and his two victims last friday hanging up with glitsky lanier stood stretched and walked out into the inspectors area the desks of his twelve people were placed back to back in team pairs and over the years a line of metal filing cabinets had slowly grown like a vine out from one of the walls so that it now nearly bisected the space isolating the inspectors area from the lieutenants office even so over the past half hour lanier had been aware of inspectors drifting back in for their paperwork or simply to get the decks clear for tomorrow now he got himself a cup of coffee in the main room he hadnt yet taken his first sip when glitsky showed up in another minute eight homicide cops stood or sat casually around the partnered desks of dan cuneo and glen taylor lanier wasted no time i know all of you are busy with your own cases and a couple of you are on the boscacci force but in light of these executioner killings deputy chief glitsky thought it might be helpful to do some brainstorming abe glitsky looked over the inspectors faces realizing with some surprise that most of them had never worked personally under him of the assembled group only sarah evans and darrel bracco had been homicide inspectors while hed run the detail of the other four belou russell glen taylor and dan cuneo two were almost complete unknowns the other two cuneo and russell had actually investigated glitsky in the weeks before last years shootout it was common knowledge that they still werent among his fans so it was not as congenial a group as glitsky might have hoped still he needed their cooperation first im only here because marcel asked me to come down ive been working with a small team on the boscacci killing and frankly we havent made much progress marcel tells me its basically the same situation with these executioner hits although weve got the ballistics match that connection between the victims my question is whether theres another one sarah evans spoke up nothings leaping out at us sir the elderly woman edith montrose lived alone and has no local survivors although a son and a daughter have both flown in from out of state for the burial neither of them had ever heard of the other victim philip wong and mr wongs wife mai li didnt know montrose evanss partner darrel bracco added his voice were close to eliminating robbery too we wouldnt know for sure with the montrose woman but mai li hasnt found anything missing both of them look like pardon the phrase executions am i missing something this was dan cuneo sitting at his desk playing some imaginary bongo drums between his legs whats that dan lanier asked the inspector stopped drumming well youve got this boscacci thing on the one hand and the two executions on the other he turned to glitsky aside from the fact that weve got very little on any of them i dont see any connection at all i dont either glitsky said but along with no connection i see total evidence of two slugs no witnesses no prints no forensics no motives no nothing am i wrong no sir evans admitted speaking for the rest of them this spark any ideas for anybody glitsky asked does what spark any ideas cuneo asked nothin from nothin leaves nothin wait a minute belou stepped out from behind her partner russell we do have another open case with that profile hell pat cuneo said ive got about a dozen myself if you want one yeah lanier interjected but are any of them citizens elizabeth cary was belou said yes she was glitsky filled in for those who didnt know couple of weeks ago now elizabeth cary a middleaged white housewife was gunned down at her front door one bullet in the heart the shooter left no sign except a ninemillimeter casing was there a slug cuneo asked belou shook her head no through and through then through the drywall and stucco out the back of the house we had csi look for a whole day they couldnt find it so we dont know if it was this executioner or not russell asked right glitsky said he left us nothing now my question to all of you is why does this sound familiar excuse me sir cuneo had straightened up in his chair so youre saying you think because we got nothing on these separate cases that theyre related with respect that seems like a stretch he got agreeing nods from at least russell and taylor and went on its like saying beer isnt water and milk isnt water therefore beer is milk i realize that glitsky knowing what hed come down here to propose was prepared to remain unruffled and of course its a good point but on the other hand since weve got nothing on these four homicides in this past fortnight maybe the only way well catch a break is to go outside the box we can expect this executioner to hit again and until hes kind enough to leave us a clue maybe we ought to work with what weve got which evans said i thought was nothing no sarah not quite glitsky said weve got only the ballistics connection if were looking at the twin peaks killings but if we go on the assumption first that boscacci may have been an executioner victim cuneo nearly jumped out of his chair wait wait wait youre really losing me here sir youre saying maybe the executioner killed boscacci next is kennedy maybe too huh lanier came to glitskys defense no ones denying its a reach dan if we had anything else at all to follow up on the executioners victims glitsky said i wouldnt waste anybodys time talking about this but the fact is we dont have anything and nothing with boscacci either cuneo said glitsky not quite we believe its likely he was shot with a silenced weapon in fact he turned to lanier thats why we need to have the lab reexamine the slugs from twin peaks they already ran ballistics lanier said and the boscacci slug was deformed so they couldnt crosscheck i know glitsky said im not talking about ballistics he talked to the group boscaccis slug had a fairly distinctive scuff sometimes if a silencer isnt fitted properly it scuffs a slug as it leaves the barrel and normal ballistics wouldnt pick it up especially if the slug is deformed but he added they get a visual match with the twin peakss slugs maybe were in business so these are pro jobs taylor said maybe glitsky said in any case it would be worthwhile to find out if anybody in twin peaks heard a gunshot or he turned to belou near mrs carys home yeah but so what cuneo asked every witness says they heard nothing which is the answer every time i ask anything they didnt hear nothin they didnt see nothin as far as they can recall if their memory serves them at that particular point in time they were out of the area code if not the hemisphere when the incident occurred then what were going to consider that some kind of positive evidence glitsky remained calm at least positive enough so that the atf will supply us with people who bought silencers these we interview and try to find some connection between any one of them and any of the victims at least its doing something instead of just waiting for another strike and meanwhile taylor said when the executioner does hit again then what then if he leaves us anything at all we move on that of course but until weve got something better weve got to eliminate other options the best one being that a silenced weapon has killed four people instead of two and lanier said we can know the answer to that by say tonight if we all go out and canvass now when witnesses are likely to be home evans chuckled softly that was subtle marcel lanier smiled all around thank you i like to think its the key to effective management so were approved on the overtime russell asked this was always a thorny issue lanier hesitated looked over to glitsky who nodded put it all on the event number he said one more thing cuneo said everyone turned to him when we started talking about boscacci you said first you were going on the assumption that he was one of these executioner victims was there something else a muscle worked in glitskys in his jaw i said first i believe so yes sir another minute sorry he said its gone when hal and linda north came out of their sons guarded room at the hospital wu and hardy were there in the hall to meet them after wu introduced hardy linda smiled and said dismas wasnt that the name of the good thief on calvary hardy forced a smile he didnt feel remotely friendly that was him he said not too many people know that hes also the patron saint of murderers linda tightened drew herself up andrew isnt a murderer no maam he isnt hal spoke up after all weve been through on that score its good to hear somebody say that so youre telling me weve got a chance dont get me wrong weve got some tough days ahead but theres some reason for guarded hope there have been some developments in your absence besides of course this suicide attempt he fixed them both with flat eyes linda read his look you probably think were horrible to have gone away dont you it doesnt matter what i think hardy said maybe i wondered a little about what hal stepped protectively in front of his wife about what he repeated us going south hardy said nothing i asked andrew and he said he was fine he knew that wed had the reservations for months and he was adamant we should just go it was only for three days he said hed be fine he was getting used to youth guidance we didnt know hed do anything like this how could we have known mrs north hardy said mr north im not accusing you of anything its none of my business how you run your lives for andrews sake though it might be helpful if we knew where we could find you if we need to contact you while this is going on but he knew where we were hal was growing hot he turned to amy i was sure hed have told you no sir he didnt he can talk to us anytime linda put in both of our kids can hal and i were always there for them if they need us there you go hal took an aggressive stance between them but spoke to wu you could have called alicia at home you have that number she could have reached us easily how did you find out hardy asked about this i called the ygc to talk to andrew as soon as we got home this morning they told me then i called hal and we came straight here but hal continued at wu i still dont understand why you didnt think to call the house alicia could have called and gotten us back here hours ago wu matched his gaze tightened her lip turned to hardy who came to her defense your daughter wasnt home sir what of course she was we both talked to her we did linda said she was home absolutely she called us on her cellphone hardy asked yes i think so linda looked from hardy to wu then back to hardy youre saying she could have called from anywhere im telling you hardy said that when they found andrew in his cell this morning they called your home first then sent a squad car by this is at four am remember and nobody was there the first person they could reach with any connection to andrew was amy at her apartment i dont believe that hal said you check it out hardy replied wont take you five minutes now youre calling my daughter a liar hal directed his ire at hardy hey you know what we dont need to take any more of this crap from you or anybody else he turned to linda grabbed her by the elbow lets go thats the end of this but she held back i want to know the truth about alicia you just heard it hardy said it doesnt matter hal snapped its another ploy to make us feel guilty and ultimately im sure to pay him more pay me more heres a flash for you pal if you havent already heard im doing this for free hardy was by now so mad at the mans blindness and arrogance that he was tempted to throw a punch blood pounded in his ears he felt he had to raise his voice to get above it and firing amy theres a brilliant idea never mind how andrew is going to feel if the one person whos been standing by him since his arrest deserts him too you think thats going to help his state of mind his selfesteem of course worrying about what andrews feeling isnt something you do much is it linda stepped in front of her husband how can you say that i love my boy i do hardy forced himself to some semblance of calm you know mrs north im sure you do but doesnt last night tell you that maybe hes not getting the message that maybe he feels alone and deserted in the world thats not because of us hal said our kids have had everything they need their whole lives every opportunity he looked to his wife took her hand came at hardy you keep wanting to bring this back to me and linda we are not at fault here this is all because of andrew the lies he told how he acted who he is hes always been such a difficult kid this is not me and linda we have been damn good parents this hardy realized would never go anywhere productive look he said ive got two kids myself teenagers i know what youre talking about my wife and i get a chance for time alone we take it too but i might suggest and this is true with me and my wife and maybe every other set of parents on the planet that maybe youre not as in touch with your sons feelings as you think you are he did after all just try to take his own life after a short and tense moment linda broke the silence im going back in to him she said for when he comes out of it come on hal are you coming with a surly look back at both wu and hardy and no comment hal took her hand and together they turned back toward andrews room and people wonder where they go wrong raising children frannie said she was already chafing at the bedrest edict and against her doctors orders had been planning on coming downstairs to dinner but hardy had finessed her by bringing up the fettucine alfredo and serving her in the bedroom now he sat next to the bed eating his own pasta from a television table i dont know if hal and linda wonder about that so much hardy said ask them and theyll tell you theyre not doing anything wrong theyre great parents theyve worked hard and now just want to have some fun you cant argue with the basic concept okay but getting it even a little bit right takes some energy you check up on them from time to time get in their faces when they need it once in a while god forbid you say no you make sure they know theyre loved all the time even when you hate em especially when you hate them that too see its not that complex although ive heard you say more than once that raising the little darlings is the hardest thing in the world thats because i only speak in revealed truth hardy went back to his food frannie fell pensive time passed then maybe they just got tired the norths hardy put his fork down who doesnt but youre still in their lives a little not that some percentage of them wouldnt make it if you left even a large percentage but somebody like andrew whos already got obvious issues it might occur to you hes at risk wouldnt you think he shook his head forked some pasta chewed thoughtfully one of the kids i talked to at sutro today was this girl jeri pierced everywhere you could stick a needle tattoos the look you know not my first choice for fashion consultant but a really good kid solid grounded helpful she was in the play with andrew what about her well when she walked in she was the one who fit the poster child image of troubled youth but you hear her talking about andrew or laura these kids who look like theyve got everything and shes got the answer she calls them gone parents even if theyre right in the house theyre gone and hal and linda arent even in the house all that much frannie reached over and put a hand on hardys tray table so what happens now with andrew i mean well theyre sending him back up the hill in the morning meanwhile it looks like amys on tomorrow frannie took a breath and let an involuntary moan escape closing her eyes she let herself back down onto her pillows and what about you no what about you that didnt sound too good im a little sore thats all thats all you didnt by any chance forget to take your pain medicine did you she shook her head as far as the neck brace let her its not that bad i dont want to be drugged up if you werent already so hurt id whup you upside the head hardy got up and went into the bathroom found her medicine and brought it back here take these would you give yourself a break tomorrow you can get up and suffer all day if you want what are you going to do clear dishes check on kids take the rest of the night off on the day before a hearing youre kidding yep he said so what really really i dont know exactly ive got some phone calls ive got to find something that might help this kid especially after what he tried last night he leaned over and she put a hand behind his neck held him in the kiss for an extra second when he straightened up he said on the other hand i could close the door and get these silly dishes off the bed although with your medical condition wed have to cut back on the usual acrobatics its a nice offer but with the concussion and all i really do have a headache she offered him a weak smile i hate to say that its fine i really do have stuff to do anyway he sat down on the side of the bed but for the record that was a nice kiss thank you i thought so too you know why why what why suddenly i thought a good kiss was in order hardy shrugged i thought it was just the usual animal magnetism that too she said but also im liking this guy who showed up again recently caring for his clients interacting with his kids all that sensitive stuff she touched his hand really she said if he wanted to stick around that wouldnt be so bad hes thinking about it hardy said no commitments though no of course not no pressure either but just so he knows hardy leaned over and kissed her another good long one hell take it under advisement he said as a matter of course and of habit hardy had left his card home and business numbers with all of todays interview subjects he had also asked for their own numbers and told all of them that he might need to call them as witnesses for andrew but this really didnt seem too likely at the moment none of them had given him a shred of evidence and without that no judge would let him introduce even the most compelling alternative theory of the murders hardy had to have something real and he had nothing at all not even a reasonable conjecture of his own this last fact considering that hed come very close to actually believing in andrews innocence was the most galling if someone else had killed mooney and laura wright he had no idea who it might have been or what reason they might have had perhaps the most frustrating element was that hardy now believed that juan salarco or more precisely anna salarco had actually seen the murderer as he fled from the scene and turned to look back at the house but because of the promises of the police for some kind of intercession on his behalf with the ins promises hardy knew to be empty salarco couldnt admit that hed made a mistake on the identification maybe he didnt even accept that fact himself maybe all anglos looked pretty much the same to him especially young ones wearing cowled sweatshirts he was just finishing up a telephone discussion with kevin brolin the psychologist whod treated andrew for his anger problems when hed been younger and whom hardy wanted to testify the next day on the second criterion andrews rehabilitation potential brolin had been called by the norths before theyd even flown home after the suicide attempt and hardy had talked to him earlier that evening at the hospital right after his little contretemps with hal and linda brolin seemed knowledgeable and sympathetic and more importantly convinced that andrew had resolved the problems with his temper in brolins opinion he was not a candidate for physical violence hed learned to channel that negative energy into creative outlets such as writing and acting brolin even understood that hed stopped eating meat out of compassion for the suffering of food animals hardy didnt tell him about andrews jailhouse conversion on the vegetarian issue nor was he particularly convinced by brolins professional opinion about andrews current commitment to a nonviolent life in hardys own experience hed known people who had directed their negative energy toward creative outlets and who were still capable of heinous acts of violence the two were not mutually exclusive but if as a psychologist and expert witness at a thousand dollars per court day brolin thought they were and was willing to say so that was all right with hardy it might not convince the judge but brolin would certainly make a damn strong argument that would be hard to refute especially if jason brandt had not thought to present a rebuttal witness to testify to the opposite hardy was still on the kitchen phone when the front doorbell rang he checked the wall clock it was anybody want to get that he called out in a second vincent called from his room rebecca gave her constant refrain im doing homework the doorbell rang again hardy said excuse me a minute doctor would you covering the mouthpiece now he called out as in right now beck vincent yelled im doing homework i said her final answer she wasnt budging so am i its not fair hardy heard a slam from vincents room a book being thrown down in a fit of pique then a chair perhaps knocked over anger anger everywhere his son went running by down the hallway hardy came back to the phone you work with children all day he asked how do you do it im a very very old fortyfive brolin said from the front door dad somebody for you covering the phone again tell him ill be a minute hardy heard vincents steps coming back up through the house then passing through the kitchen his putupon fourteenyearold son didnt so much as favor him with a glance hardy cut it off as quickly as he could with brolin told him hed see him at the ygc the next morning and walked up through the dining room to the front of the house no one waited in the living room and the front door was still closed was it possible he wondered that vincent had left the caller to cool his heels outside and closed the door on him surely between him and frannie he thought theyd covered at least once some of the basic etiquette involved in answering the goddamned front door but evidently not a shadow moved behind the glass and hardy opened the door the young man looked familiar recently familiar but hardy couldnt quite place him mr hardy he said then reading hardys uncertainty steven randell from sutro sure sure sorry didnt my son invite you in he said youd just be a minute hardy sighed backed up a step opened the door all the way summoned him inside and closed the door behind him you want to come in can i get you anything something hot to drink maybe no thats okay thanks he went to the window seat neatly groomed and as tall as hardy with brown hair and a good complexion closely shaved he hailed from the opposite fashion camp as his costar jeri he wore tan cargo pants and a black leather coat over a blue work shirt during the session theyd had earlier in the day at sutro he hadnt volunteered much his position being that he hadnt known either andrew or laura very well but if andrew had killed mr mooney steve hoped that hed be punished for it hardy had given him his by now pro forma song and dance about andrews innocence but had gotten the impression that it had rolled off but obviously now if he was here something had stuck you mind if i ask you how you knew where i live hardy asked randell shrugged at the nobrainer i had your phone number i just got directions to here on the web you can do that another shrug had hardy climbed the evolutionary ladder all the way up to cromagnon sure he said you can find anything on the web hardy wanted to ask him how hed found this particular and unnerving bit of information and if there was a way he could remove it from the public domain but he guessed it would be impossible now besides the young man hadnt come here to talk about cyberspace so what can i do for you steven he said he sat straight up rather stiffly his hands folded in his lap the window seat was really more of a bench with cushions there was nothing to lean back against no real way to get comfortable and now that they were down to the nub randell seemed suddenly reticent even confused um wrestling with it hardy helped him out did something we talked about earlier come back to you something like that hardy waited through another lengthy silence in the street out front a couple of cars passed and from up on geary came the wail of a siren city noises finally steven yeah i know he let out a heavy sigh took an audible breath but before i tell you anything i need you to promise me that it stays between us hardy narrowed his eyes cocked his head do you know who killed mooney and laura no but i know something i just dont know what it might mean if anything i almost told you at the end of our talk today and maybe i should have but then wagner would have known too and he might have felt like he had to go to my parents anyway then tonight i couldnt get it out of my mind that i should have told you im not even sure it matters but there are things about it that definitely matter a lot to other people and to me personal things do you know what im saying i dont mean to be dense steven but you have my word that whatever it is ill keep it between us hows that another sigh it just seemed like you really might believe that andrew didnt do any of this hardy finessed that admission which was still just slightly too strong i believe that somebody else might have come to mooneys while andrew was on his walk if thats true im trying to find out who or why or both okay what if i told you and this is the thing i was talking about the secret what if i told you that mr mooney was gay the perverse obviousness of it brought a lightness to hardys head hed been standing by the fireplace and now he crossed the room and sat down on the ottoman by his reading chair then id say he did a good job of keeping it hidden yes he did that was on purpose do you know his father ive met him yes well mike loved him more more than almost anything i think he couldnt let him find out his dad it would have broken his heart he couldnt have dealt with it the dad the christian minister couldnt have dealt with it the southern baptist minister right how is that possible i mean this is san francisco in the two thousands mooneys dad must have seen hundreds of people come out yeah but not his own son not michael and he isnt a san francisco minister putting together an aids quilt hes a nice enough man i guess but his church is down on the peninsula and his brand of preaching is uh more conservative the sons and daughters of gomorrah being turned into salt and rightfully so ive heard him steve pitched his voice differently homosexuality is always sin and always a choice its not a matter of genetics as some would have us believe but a degenerate lifestyle for those unfortunate people who can muster neither the strength nor the grace to reject it straight out of the fifties huh and thats michaels dad still but michaels dad or no hardy immediately saw the incalculable strategic value of this information for andrew if he could bring it out at the hearing or the trial if it got to that point then all he and wu would have to do would be to keep their defendant from testifying which was always the defenses option meanwhile the jury would naturally assume especially in san francisco that andrew and everyone else at sutro knew that mooney was gay this would in turn eliminate the prosecutions primary motive of jealousy it would also not only open up an alternative theory of the crime the soddit or some other dude did it defense but also allow hardy and wu to question the original police investigation that had resulted in andrews arrest they certainly should have interviewed people from this aspect of mooneys life a failure to even identify mooney as gay must surely argue for a shoddily handled case from the outset if hardy could then get salarcos no gunshot testimony and even a hint of a hedge on the eyewitness identification his client stood at least a chance of a hung jury then maybe a plea on a lesser charge this was very very big news if it were in fact true if he could get it in front of a judge or a jury and most importantly if it wasnt merely hearsay steven hardy said ive got to ask you this question and i think i already know the answer but in the eyes of the law theres a big difference between someone hearing about a fact and someone experiencing that fact with their own senses did you and mr mooney have a relationship steven needed to take a while with his answer and hardy was content to let him yes he finally said with that one word hardys entire view of mike mooney underwent a complete transformation if he was in fact having sex with one of his students male or female hardy didnt care then he was not the caring and sensitive soul most people took him for he was a predator would you be willing to testify to that in court he asked but hardy couldnt let his reaction slow him down this was critical information and though the bare fact of it filled him with outrage toward mooney he had no choice but to find a way to use it hardy couldnt imagine why but the question actually seemed to both surprise and frighten him he thought another moment then shook his head no why not i mean not unless its your very last chance to save andrew by itself and i dont see how it could get to be that thats why i asked you to promise before i told you okay but ive still got the same question why not randell met his gaze with a steady one of his own are you bullshitting me no what would i be bullshitting you about why i wont testify he choked off a bitter laugh because im not out mr hardy im not out okay and im not going to be out while im still at sutro theres no way hardy was leaning forward his elbows on his knees would it be that bad i always thought if you were gay this was the town to be in maybe for older guys but dont be a gay teenager youll get slaughtered you want to hear a story sure i had this friend tony hollis you can look him up he came out last year and got beaten up by cruisers in noe valley four times in six months whenever any prowling group of teenage straights got bored then i guess tony got bored with that and took a bottle of pills he took a minute collecting himself so no im not saying anything in public and you promised you wouldnt either if you do ill deny it and that goes for mooney too what do you mean it goes for mooney too you promised you wouldnt tell about him yes but that was hardy paused im not sure i understand why that is so important now after hes dead for the same reason it was while he was alive he didnt want his father to know it was like the most important thing to him he lived this whole secret life to keep the truth from his old man if he didnt want to cause him that pain how am i supposed to let it happen i cant do it when you were talking to me today you said if i knew anything i should come forward and do the right thing well ive come forward but letting you tell his father about mike wouldnt be right at all so then maybe you can tell me how am i supposed to use this information if i cant let it come out i dont know thats not my problem he stood up a good kid awkward with playing the heavy and now suddenly anxious to get away from what hed already done look im sorry i really am but i just thought it was important that i tell you so youd know what you were really dealing with dont get me wrong steven i really do appreciate that but the young man cut him off but what you do with it is up to you hardy sat in his reading chair for a couple of minutes pondering then he rose and walked back up through the dining room into the kitchen in the dark and empty family room he stopped to gaze at his tropical fish for a moment of centering and peaceful reflection he turned on the rooms lights then knocked on his childrens bedroom doors at the same time perpendicular to each other just a second im doing homework he knocked again i need to see both of you right this minute please the familiar grumblings ensued but he heard movement from inside both rooms by the time the first door opened and the beck appeared he was standing out in the middle of the family room hands in his pockets relaxed and casual vincent opened his own door saw his sister pouting looked to his dad having a hunch what might be coming he wiped all traces of his own bad attitude from his face he asked helpfully whats up hardy gave them a full ten seconds of lowgrade glare then finally spoke in the calmest voice he could muster i dont know if its escaped your attention or not but your mother is upstairs in bed pretty beat up and while i realize that the critical schoolwork youre both working on so diligently is far more important than the job i work at to keep us fed and clothed i dont think its asking too much for both of you to contribute toward the smooth running of the household when im for example busy on the telephone and let me say im just a tad disappointed that i have to mention this to people of your ages to whom it should already be and i thought was second nature but clearly i was wrong he paused for a moment made eye contact with both of them so heres the deal whenever the doorbell or the telephone rings and either your mother or i or both of us ask if one or even both of you could please get up and answer it i dont want to hear about your homework and i dont want to be told to wait even for a second i want you both to jump and even race to see who can get to it the fastest and whoever does get there first i expect you to extend to whoever it is the kind of hospitality that you would expect to receive in the home of a civilized person for example vincent you dont leave a guest who asks for someone in this house by name standing out on the porch in the cold and beyond that if its an adult you dont know you look him in the eye shake his hand and introduce yourself then you invite whoever it is in and even i know this can be grueling engage that person in small talk and make him or her feel comfortable until the member of this household that he requested makes an appearance does any of this sound remotely familiar to you have we ever talked about this before rebecca tossed her hair if this is just vincent dad ive got homework i need hardy wheeled on her and cut her off as a matter of fact my dear its not just about vincent your homework is not an automatic pass on the normal duties of citizenship around here vincent has homework too believe it or not even your father has homework from time to time like tonight relatively important homework your mother never stops having homework so homework is not an excuse to opt out of your duties as a citizen in this house is that clear she drew a pained audible breath it hit hardy very wrong and while were on these special moments of politeness id really prefer not to see your theatrical sighs or vin your looks of obvious displeasure we all live here together weve all got things we need to do so we respect each other we cooperate we use nice manners to each other and to our guests he looked from his son to his daughter and back again is there anything about what ive just said that either of you dont understand vincent his son was leaning against the doorjamb downcast he shook his head no vincent hardy repeated look at me in the eyes good is there something about what i just said that you dont understand no no what no sir thats the right answer rebecca no sir im sorry even better hardy turned as the phone started to ring in the kitchen dont either of you trouble yourselves he said ill get that i usually wouldnt call this late glitsky said but your phone was busy last time i called so i figured you might still be up hows frannie sleeping i hope if shes not lacing up her track shoes but thats not why you called no are you waiting for me to beg no youll never believe what we think we found out about the executioner dont tell me hes a redheaded dwarf he might be glitsky said but he may also be using a silencer still on silencers we didnt have anything else so i sent out half of homicide to ask around in twin peaks between the two killings we talked to twentyone citizens who were nearby just like with boscacci and nobody heard a thing elizabeth carys neighborhood too remember her nobody on the whole culdesac and all of them were home nothing so what are you saying these were all this executioner thats the working theory in any event you get four shots in highdensity areas and nobody hears anything somethings a little funny hardy didnt really agree it was a noisy city and people were so inured to nearconstant aural assault that he thought a gunshot could easily go unremarked nevertheless though he wasnt ready to mention it to abe yet when the time came he might be tempted to call his friend to the stand as a witness in the andrew bartlett matter where the actual sound of the gunshots was the proverbial dog that barked in the nighttime another alternative theory presenting itself another ball in the air but something entirely different struck him wait a minute he said did you say boscacci whats this got to do with him you think this guy shot him too i dont know glitsky said but it is tantalizing dont you think that they all might be connected sure but youve got to admit its not much to go on something people didnt hear especially a shot which most people think is a backfire if it registers at all ill bet most of em didnt hear tinkling sounds either and that doesnt mean tinker bell did it you sound like treya there are worse people to sound like granted but its not all fairy dust i called down to the lab again and asked them to physically check allans slug the tech couldnt get a ballistics match with the twin peaks slugs they were too deformed but he did get to eyeball identical scuff marks on rounds of identical caliber he couldnt swear to it in court maybe but his bet is its the same gun silenced maybe hardy said though if he couldnt swear to it in court which last time i checked was where we had to do these things but he didnt mean to bust abes chops anyway it does sound like youre getting somewhere he said but if youd told me youd found something with the other victims about that jury the cary woman sat on maybe allan was the prosecutor on the same case then im thinking you might thats it glitskys voice crackled with a rare enthusiasm what i forgot thanks dont mention it hardy said but he was talking to a dial tone though it had suddenly taken on a much higher profile hardys professional life wasnt all or even mostly andrew bartlett first thing tuesday morning he had another appointment with clarence jackman so he didnt even check in at the office but drove directly to the hall of justice parked in the allday where boscacci had been shot and was talking to the da at sharp the issue they were discussing was a theory called provocative act murder where the person charged with the crime had not killed the victim instead the theory went the person charged had done something so inherently likely to cause a violent response that they were legally responsible for the murder there were two classic examples the first was when somebody goes in to rob a liquor store pulls a gun on the proprietor and the proprietor pulls his own weapon out from behind the counter and shoots missing the robber but accidentally killing a bystander the proprietor in this case is completely blameless where the robber might be charged with provocative act murder the second example is a scenario where two drug dealers get in a shootout and one of them grabs an innocent person using that person as a human shield who is then killed by a shot from the other drug dealers gun in this case while the second drug dealer might be guilty of murder too the person who grabbed the human shield in the first place though he didnt fire the lethal shot could be charged in the death in the case hardy was arguing his client was leila madison the mother of a fourteenyearold boy named jamahl madison whod gone with a gang of four of his homies to rob the apartment of one of their neighbors hardy had gotten connected to leila because she was the cleaning lady of another of his clients besides jamahl she had three other children under the age of ten all of whom lived with her own mother in bayside it was a horrible alltoocommon situation now aggravated by jackmans initial decision to charge jamahl as an adult with the provocative act murder of his friend damon jamahl had not shot damon in fact the apartment owner while the gang was fleeing from the robbery had taken some shots at all of them and had wounded jamahl and killed damon and again as had been his habit lately hardy wasnt planning to take the case to trial he was facilitating though his heart didnt go out to poor jamahl it did to the boys mother and hed taken five hundred dollars donated by leilas boss to see if he could persuade jackman that in this case provocative act murder wasnt the right call if he were even say seventeen clarence but the boys only fourteen hes gotten his own stupid ass shot already and lost his best friend ive got to believe thats going to make an impression that maybe its not a good idea to rob people jackman behind his desk seemed to be enjoying the exchange so would thirty or forty in the can diz time he gets out ill bet hes lost his taste for it entirely he spread his hands on his desk my question to you is do you honestly think hes going to change ever hardy shook his head you ever meet a kid that didnt clarence age fourteen to forever he might he gets the right counselors at ygc somebody catches a spark with him he comes out in a few years and hes a standup human being but the real question the legal question is the provocative act jackman ran a finger under his shirt collar now his deep voice an almost inaudible rumble he chuckled if you break into somebodys home you forfeit quite a few of your inalienable rights granted but mr parensich the robbery victim whod actually shot damon and jamahlwas never really in danger the boys didnt even have guns they didnt even know he was home thats what they say so its just more bad luck for them and lets remember there were five of them he held up his hand cinco this is a substantial amount of gang throwweight and you know it even if this guy was only fourteen i believe mr parensich felt legitimately threatened i dont doubt it but these kids didnt act up that much they were already fleeing when parensich fired at them selfdefense or not theyre the ones that took the shots lets call it square if youre suggesting it let me just say that no way am i going to charge parensich jackman said somebodys got to stand up for the victims in these situations hardy actually broke a grin thats a lovely campaign moment clarence but you cant say that running away is inherently likely to cause a violent response and thats what the boys were doing hightailing it hardy paused considered concluded parensichs response was legal but unnecessary so the murder cant go under provocative act thats all there is to it jackman had been listening carefully rolling a pencil under a finger on his desk so how do i get the message out to these people diz you break into some guys house you dont understand somebodys likely to get hurt the tragedy here isnt your boy and his mother but damon who was also fourteen and who wont be getting any older if these dumb fuck kids pardon me wouldnt have decided to knock over parensich damons still walking around its such a goddamn waste i hear you clarence i really do but youre punishing jamahl in any event hes going to ya on the robbery thats appropriate but you wont win hearts or minds by a reach of a charge like this youll just seem unfair and vindictive jamahls only fourteen clarence as you say hes still walking around so hes still got a chance slim but real you dont want to take that away from him on this and hardy was getting to the bottom line you and i both know theres no way youll get any jury in this town to convict him so why waste the time youre just pissed off i am pissed off thats fine but take it out on somebodys whos earned it this one just aint right and you know it hardy found himself surprised that hed used these words he hadnt thought that way in quite some time jackman rolled the pencil some more by all indications he was making his decision on jamahl but when he finally spoke it wasnt about that i hear through the grapevine that youre working with your associate on bartlett that the hearing is this morning if im not mistaken thats right it should start in about an hour im taking your presence on the team to mean that some kind of reason is going to prevail up there well were playing the cards we got dealt clarence if thats what you mean amy should never have tried to make the deal with allan that goes without question but not because she didnt deliver no then why not because im more than halfway to convinced hes not guilty the quiet voice took on an ominous tone you think there was a rush to judgment out of this office do you think we werent fair that we dont have a case your own associate was going to plead him guilty less than a week ago whats changed do you have new evidence no sir not really maybe a new approach thats all well jackman frowning now picked up the pencil and tapped the table with its eraser ill let you know my decision on jamahl then when i make it he looked at his watch you dont want to be late for court it was a dismissal when the meeting ended hardy came out into the reception room by treya glitskys desk so howd it go she asked the reviews arent all in yet but hardys face indicated that when they came they wouldnt be all good and treya knew better than to push his pager had vibrated three times while hed been speaking with jackman and all the calls had come from his office and now he asked could i borrow your phone for one minute local one one she said then after shed made sure the door to jackmans office was closed she added abe called he asks if you get a chance stop up hardy was punching numbers nodded abstractedly he called me howd he know i was here he didnt he didnt call you he called me since im his devoted wife and i work here i told him you were in with his nibs hes going to want to talk about excuse me one sec hardy was holding a finger up stopping her he spoke into the phone phyllis diz you dont have to call me three times you leave the number once ill call back promise he listened who okay yes i know her i got it all right then ill be going straight out there right right that means i wont stop at the office first after that im up at ygc with amy right okay thats it thanks hanging up he turned to treya i love that woman he said she makes the rest of humanity look so good by comparison was abe important always she said then lowered her voice but i think he just wants to pick your brain on this silencer thing with allan and the others the others hardy leaned over her desk you know i think hes a brilliant and fascinating guy but this is just spinning his wheels until he gets something real thats what i told him she said he just wants to be back in homicide and this gives him an excuse he sent out a couple of inspectors this morning to ask relatives of the twin peaks people if there are any if either of them had ever served on a murder jury they werent too enthusiastic the inspectors waitll he sends them downstairs to records to look up all of allans cases over the past twenty years thatll really juice em up at this moment anna salarco was by any of hardys standards more important than glitsky so for that matter was the hearing which would start now before he arrived but he couldnt ignore the summons from anna who had called his office wu and he had discussed strategy late yesterday afternoon and he had no reason to believe she couldnt handle it well herself but he did ask treya to call abe back and send his regrets twentyfive minutes later he was back in the salarcos bright yellow kitchen carla was in her playpen watching barney on television clearly nervous her head darting this way and that her hands pushing her hair around anna offered him a seat at the kitchen table he took out his tape recorder held it up and got a nod from her and put it on the table between them she sat where she could keep an eye both on her baby and on the front door reading the signs hardy asked her if her husband knew that shed called him no but i had to i think about it all the night the boy andrew the one juan pick out of the lineup she threw a look at the door took a breath came back to him i was there too at the lineup with juan but afterward they only talk to him because hed seen andrew and hed told them that he could identify him s√≠ but they did not she snapped her fingers cast her eyes about the room searching for the right word no sais then they did not make it different the times juan saw him like you did differentiate hardy said s√≠ differentiate between when he went down first and when he came back later after or the other one the one you saw outside in front s√≠ i dont know what how if juan saw something that time shed gripped her hands intertwining her fingers in her lap and now she turned them over on themselves but i went over it last night a hundred times what i remembered and it was as you say as juan said when he described how we went to the window me in front of him youre doing fine hardy said im listening its all right she gave him a darting empty smile turned her head toward the door again you were at the window s√≠ i look out and i am angry too at waking up the baby i am slapping you know at the window this is why the boy turn around he look up at me and then hes gone running and that man that time was it andrew no she shook her head i dont say juan is not telling the truth maybe he saw different maybe i it was too far and i dont see everything just perfect all right maybe all that listen anna no ones going to accuse juan of anything because of what you tell me now it could have been an honest mistake hed already seen andrew twice that night so who else could it have been right and when was the lineup a month later six weeks s√≠ something like that much but they bring out the boys and juan and i are both there you know watching from back in the dark they keep us apart and were not supposed to talk you know they give us a card and we make an x if we know somebody but i see nobody i know and later i find out juan said it was number two he knows i tell him i dont think this is who i saw from the window it was not andrew shaking her head from side to side she said no not if he was in that lineup then with the confession out she stopped all the frenetic movement her shoulders settled almost imperceptibly juan he takes my arm and asks me do i know what am i saying he tells me that there is no doubt this is who he saw he did hardy said thats who he did see just not that one time s√≠ but he is angry at me very angry do i think he does not know who he saw dont i know the police will help us with la migra if we help them they cant hardy said they wont i think that too but juan still hopes you know if we go to the trial and he says it was andrew she trailed off anyway i dont fight him anymore her head was down but she raised her eyes to him not until yesterday when i understand by the time hardy arrived at the ygc at and got himself admitted to the courtroom and then the defense table in the bullpen all under the disapproving eyes of judge johnson they appeared to have cleared all the motions including the continuance request and now were apparently in the middle of what hardy supposed was their first witness but before they could get back to that johnson took off his glasses and spoke up for the record the court notes the arrival of hardy stood im sorry im late your honor dismas hardy second chair for the minor johnsons lips went tight his eyes narrowed all right mr hardy would you care to approach the bench please ms wu you too this was unusual but when the judge called you up you went yes your honor johnson held his glasses in one hand and it was shaking his eyes were cold pools of glacier water he spoke with a crisp clarity brooking no misunderstanding i gathered from your various motions and witness list yesterday that you intended to make this hearing more of a protracted proceeding than i had intended to countenance in this particular case now i see a second lawyer at mr bartletts table i dont often see two attorneys for one juvenile defendant in the sevenohseven i wanted to give you both fair warning that im not going to tolerate any delaying tactics or tagteam mumbo jumbo from either of you ill hear from one lawyer per witness either one of you but only one if your witnesses dont speak to particular criteria i will dismiss them if you waste this courts time i will cut you off is that clear yes your honor hardy was stunned at not only the force of the warning but also the severity of the dressingdown wu had really ruffled feathers up here maybe more so even than she had with boscacci and hardy would be well advised to keep it in mind still he wasnt about to roll over but as youve no doubt noticed from our motions your honor this case has grown in complexity the johnson pointed a finger thats exactly my point mr hardy dont get me started this hearing is not about the complexity of this criminal case its about whether mr bartlett should be tried as a minor or not thats all its about ive read your motions about calling witnesses for the gravity criterion and it doesnt take a genius to see what you have in mind on that score but your witnesses had better be about facts and evidence i wont tolerate any alternative theory nonsense you can bring all that up in adult court if some judge will let you he caught himself assuming of course that this case goes to adult court he leaned down over the bench shot a look at hardy over to wu he lowered his voice which in no way diminished its intensity i believe we all know that we shouldnt even be here this morning and wouldnt be mr hardy if your firm had played straight with the da but now that we are here i wont let you make a mockery of this proceeding thats all summarily dismissed hardy returned to the defense table while wu prepared to continue with her witness seated next to andrew for several minutes hardy found that he couldnt get his mind to focus johnsons warnings rang in his ears anna salarcos tape burned in his pocket next to him andrew sat not in one of the courtroom chairs but propped and shackled to a wheelchair his wrists cuffed and resting in his lap a thick cottonwrapped white brace of some kind encircled his neck bringing visions of frannie back to him it was neck brace week on the hacienda andrew sat straight up a ramrod eyes closed occasionally emitting tiny moans that hardy did not believe were faked behind them both in the front row hardy felt the hostile eyes of the norths theyd watched him enter the courtroom followed him up the aisle and to their sons table with illdisguised displeasure gradually he forced himself to put the distractions aside he reminded himself that this hearing was merely act i of what looked more and more like it would become a threeact play with the preliminary hearing in adult court next and then the trial to follow on the stand next to the judge was an excop private investigator friend of wes farrells named jane huron whom they were paying and who was to have read andrews perfect killer story and picked it apart for criminal veracity on the surface hardy thought this was a simple and fairly straightforward task especially since theyd supplied her with many of the objections andrew himself had voiced for them shed obviously been on the stand for a good while and now wu was apparently in the process of wrapping it all up so ms huron based on your training and experience eleven years as a police officer and seven as a private investigator how would you characterize the criminal sophistication of the author of this story huron looked the part shortcropped dark hair a dark blue pants suit she was a hefty solid woman with a nononsense face answering she turned directly to the judge as hardy and wu had suggested theyd also told her not to mince her words not at all sophisticated in terms of the real world she said what specifically do you mean by that he showed no knowledge of how a real police investigation would treat such a crime could you give us one example please yes his alibi was extremely naive in what way well primarily because it wouldnt in any way have eliminated him from suspicion the times of the deaths would have been consistent with his presence at the scene when they occurred regardless of what he did afterward it would have just been stupid and then going back to the scene and pretending to discover the bodies not even the most remotely sophisticated criminal would consider doing something like that anything else again huron looked up at the judge as though for approval and he nodded down at her almost everything else i would say the author demonstrated little understanding of forensics ballistics testing gunshot residue hair and fiber samples any of the normal details that crime scene investigators routinely analyze as a matter of course the kind of precautions outlined in the story the surgical gloves and fingerprint worries and so on are what youd expect to get from watching television and movies not from any reallife crime experience this was all hardy and wu could have hoped for and huron had pulled it off perfectly wu inclined her head thanked her and said she had no further questions mr brandt johnson intoned from the bench and brandt was immediately on his feet approaching the witness with a light in his eye and a spring in his step hardy thought this wasnt a good sign but didnt see where he could go he was about to find out and it wasnt a long journey ms huron youve worked in law enforcement for nearly twenty years isnt that true yes it is and youve had a great deal of experience with firearms and forensics have you not yes ballistics studies matching samples of bullet slugs and so on yes i see let me ask you this then prior to reading this story did you know that guns made in israel were fingerprinted ballistically before they were sold and that this information was embedded with the registration number of the weapon so that any bullet fired from that gun anywhere in the world could be matched to its owner huron smiled as though in appreciation of a bit of fascinating trivia no she said to tell you the truth i didnt know that thats an interesting fact yes it is brandt said and you a sophisticated criminologist didnt know it he halfturned back to wu and hardy came back to the judge nodded genially i have no further questions the suddenness of it clearly surprised wu but hardy thought it was a very effective jab trumping hurons own undeniable sophistication with an even better example of andrews but he didnt want to risk causing damage to wus rhythm or confidence so he just leaned back crossed his arms nodded as though he were enjoying himself wu stood and called her next witness this one someone she had known from college padraig harrington phd a teacher at san francisco state university but just as bailiff cottrell got to the back door and opened it to call the witness brandt stood again your honor sidebar judge johnson adjusted his glasses raised his voice to the back of the room saying one minute please dr harrington and motioned counsel up to the bench when they were all in front of him johnson said yes mr brandt your honor before we begin with this witness id like to ask ms wu what it is that dr harrington is a professor of i dont see the relevance wu began johnson cut her off i do answer the question english literature english literature brandt raised his eyebrows clearly a rehearsed gesture your honor with the courts permission id like to ask ms wu for the general import and relevance of dr harringtons expected testimony youll see when i ask him wu retorted not good enough johnson said its a legitimate question answer it johnson was being just nails on the bench and hardy longed to raise some objection to protect wu but knew that anything he said now would only alienate the judge further and hurt their clients chances hed have to stand and take it wu swallowed blinked looked quickly to hardy then threw a glance at brandt hell be talking about the nature of fiction and the degrees of similarity between an author and a character that the author has created in other words is a person capable of making up things that hes incapable of actually doing brandt fairly dripped derision your honor is there some science here that im missing the petitioner is willing to stipulate that fiction authors make things up if thats the gist of dr harringtons testimony wu interrupted hes going to address specific elements in mr bartletts story your honor as compared to elements in the actual crime and this will demonstrate what exactly the judge asked that even the degree of sophistication exhibited by the character in the story minimal though it is as my last witness demonstrated brandt corrected her tried to demonstrate as my last witness demonstrated wu repeated even that small degree of sophistication is less than that possessed by mr bartlett or more brandt said her stage whisper getting out of hand wu shot the question at brandt what do you mean more he turned directly to her im willing to accept its different the authors either more sophisticated or less theres no way to tell from what he wrote both of you listen to me johnson was a few inches out of his chair leaning over the front of his bench youll both address your remarks to the court and the court only i dont want anything personal marring these proceedings as to the point at issue i agree with mr brandt ms wu given petitioners stipulation that fiction authors make things up its this courts ruling that we dont need to hear from this witness thank you your honor brandt immediately bowed and turned back toward his seat wu stood in shock but johnson snapped at her put your offer on the record if you wish she returned to counsel table and then repeated for the court reporter what she had told the judge when she finished johnson wrote something then looked up dr harrington he said raising his voice to be heard in the gallery youre dismissed the court thanks you for your time johnson had announced a twentyminute morning recess before wu would call her next witness this one was testifying on andrews potential for rehabilitation most of the rest of the courtroom had emptied out bailiff nelson brandts pussycat had wheeled andrew off to go to the bathroom while bailiff cottrell and the court recorder had disappeared through the door that led back toward the judges chambers brandt was just suddenly gone as were the norths probably out into the main hallway this left wu and hardy at the defense table alone his honor seems a little bit biased hardy said yeah like bill gates is a little bit rich hardy managed a small smile i wouldnt worry too much about it though its going to come down to five anyway if thats the case were in trouble hardy shrugged maybe not he brought her up to date on the two major elements hed unearthed since hed last talked to her with the norths last night at the hospital michael mooneys gayness and anna salarcos failure to identify andrew as the person whod run from mooneys place just before juan had discovered the bodies wus eyes lit up will she testify maybe shes got some issues with her husband he explained the ins problem they faced so its not a slam dunk but she called me on her own which is a positive sign the husbands a good guy but hes afraid of getting deported i cant say i blame him can we do something to help them like what i dont know turn them on to some good immigration attorneys something hardy shook his head maybe but not until she testifies i dont want to get into the whole question of whether were suborning or buying her testimony by offering her some kind of immunity in fact i was going to attack her husbands id of andrew on pretty much those grounds myself except say it was the police promising to help him if he gave em andrew so i wouldnt feel right about it afterwards if she comes through different story but if shell say it actually wasnt him i know but its more than that her husbands on the record saying it was hell have to admit he was wrong and as of yesterday that wasnt happening hell look like a fool and maybe worse hell look like he cant control his woman and as long as theyve got his id theyve got a case they both settled into their thoughts finally wu asked what about the gay thing the one im not allowed to mention yeah that one hardy blew out in frustration ive been wrestling with that all day what am i supposed to do i promised the kid against andrews life i know i know but the question i have is really so what if andrew didnt know mooney was gay then nothing changes hed still be just as jealous maybe i could run it up for a jury in the trial but its weak its not going to do it on its own and without the kids testimony its only hearsay anyway could you get it somewhere else hardy considered drummed his fingers on the desk even if i did he said slowly what does it get us so mooney was gay maybe andrews homophobic and killed him for that he shook his head and meanwhile weve outed the boy and screwed up his dad no it just doesnt work except it opens up another world about mooney what do you mean i mean that everybody loved him right he was the worlds best teacher and so on but the truth is nobody knew him he had a secret life it seems to me anything we could bring up that points that out has got to help andrew at the barest minimum it might give us somewhere else to look for who killed him hardys fingers stopped drumming he suddenly sat up put out his hand over hers the wives he said whose wives mooneys he had wives hardy nodded two of them his ridiculous memory had somehow retained the names terri and catherine well what about them they would have had a hunch wouldnt you think the regular tuesday lunch meeting at lou the greeks was both a somber and an illattended affair jackman of course was there but not presiding since there wasnt much of an assembly glitsky having missed the last few of these luncheons because of scheduling conflicts had decided on the heels of his involvement in these latest murder investigations that he was going to take a more proactive stance in defining the parameters of his job and basically do what he wanted to do pleading out of as many meetings as possible he sat next to his wife gina roake like glitsky a frequent absentee of late was also at the table but missing were hardy the citytalk columnist jeff elliot both city supervisors harlan fisk and kathy west and of course allan boscacci so instead of the big round table in the back that they usually filled they had a booth for four under one of the alleylevel windows instead of the usual convivial gossip personalities and politics they talked about the executioner who had apparently claimed another victim last night although the shooting hadnt taken place in the city and nobody investigating down in san bruno had put together a possible connection until early this morning when the police chief in that town had put in a call to lanier and wondered if somebody from the city would like to come down and have a look lanier had driven down himself accompanied by sarah evans and theyd learned that morris tollman an engineer with amtrak divorced living alone in a small house by the tanforan park shopping center had taken one shot to the head pointblank on his driveway as he was getting out of his car last night sometime between six and eightthirty near sunset a woman walking her dog had seen the body and called police the local crime scene people had found amm casing in the weeds beside the driveway but no slug so far on glitskys prevailing theory wild shot though it might be lanier evans and two of the local cops had gone door to door the neighbors on both sides of tollman had been home all evening and nobody in either house four adults and five children had heard anything resembling a gunshot that had been good enough to juice up lanier and hed called glitsky who grasping at straws asked lanier and evans to try and talk to tollmans next of kin if any and see if he had a murder trial in his past after that he had called the atf to try to light a fire under them then he had come back downtown where in response to the request hed fired off after talking last night with hardy hed already received by fax a long list of names from the california department of corrections convicts whod been released from californias various jails and prisons in the three weeks or so since just before elizabeth carys murder since these people were in the computer glitsky assigned his general work officers to look up the original case numbers that had been assigned to them and then begin checking them against the hard files downstairs in the basement to see which of them if any boscacci might have prosecuted by the time glitsky left for lunch at lous the two inspectors had identified thirtyone of the four hundred plus case numbers which is why id like to get my hands on more bodies he was saying to jackman he doesnt mean dead bodies either treya said he means people to check the files glitsky nodded i cant ask homicide inspectors to do that even my event number people theyd mutiny and i wouldnt blame them even the gw guys are grumbling id imagine so jackman said ive got a call in to the mayor now glitsky said if he sees serial killer here which im starting to hell give me some more staff but even so its a monster of a job i dont think the fbi could do it in a month but maybe hizzoner can also persuade the atf to get off their duffs although thats just one more list to check out jackman lifted a peanut with his chopsticks and looked at it skeptically the special today was kung pao moussaka not one of chuis alltime triumphs and everyone at the table was picking at their food are you sure its even worth the time abe glitsky knew what jackman meant he sagged a bit no i dont on the other hand roake said if its the only thing you have to go on what do you have to lose thats my feeling glitsky sipped some tea whatever else he is this guy knows what hes doing i dont believe somebodys paying him to hit these people and hes not picking them at random are you even sure of that jackman asked glitsky had to shake his head at this point clarence im not sure its tuesday and no hint about allan either i assume treya answered for her husband abe sent out inspector belou this morning to talk again to edie boscaccis widow meaning no leads on anything in his professional life jackman asked any of his active cases he didnt really have any clarence as you know better than anybody there might be something on the home front edie couldnt remember with the initial shock but im not holding out much hope there either so you really think allan might have been shot by this executioner too roake asked no i cant say im all the way to thinking it gina im really just back where we were glitsky said its the only place ive got to look what im really hoping is that this guy last night has got a huge extended family wholl tell us that a long time ago he invested in wongs produce and dated edith montrose and bought a used car from elizabeth cary and they all had the same banker who is a gun collector treya added right glitsky said thatd be even better but you doubt it roake said glitsky nodded seriously everyone stopped and looked up as marcel lanier suddenly appeared at glitskys elbow excuse me i dont mean to interrupt abe i was just up at your office laniers face was mottled with emotion his breath came as though hed been running im just back up from san bruno he said i begged crime scene down there to come back and look again and they found the slug tollmans yeah in the roof of a garage a couple of houses down given the circumstances they let us run it up to our lab the san francisco crime lab was halfway down to san bruno anyway where they rushed it youll never guess glitsky was already up i already did right same gun no question and abe all silenced four of the five slugs have a scuff mark same place on the bullet microscopically identical a silencer and the same one and guess what else tollman his daughter said he was on a murder jury one time where san bruno she didnt know but they lived in the city until she was five so it might have been here what about the exwife shed know she might except shes on a mission in india how the gods favor the good glitsky put his hands to his face and pulled them down over it he looked back at the table this is it he said to no one and everyone then to jackman i need more people clarence yesterday jackman nodded ill give you some clerks and every deputy i can spare guys the men looked back at treya forgive me for speaking up but id be careful about that she spoke to her husband i know you need people abe but you dont need this to make the news do you what he said youre saying the media isnt my friend shes right lanier said it gets out it tells him we know good jackman said then maybe he stops or maybe he hurries up to finish glitsky said call me slow roake said but what is it that we know exactly whats he going to hurry to finish by now they were all out of the booth standing in a knot glitsky leaned in to roake hes recently gotten out of prison and hes killing the people that put him away hes already killed the prosecutor and im guessing four of the jurors that leaves eight more and maybe the judge whoever that was the good news jackman said is if youre right its a finite list of suspects big but finite maybe among your four hundred abe thats where im starting for sure glitsky said if its not on that list though roake said what are you looking at glitsky thought of the cavernous basement to the hall of justice nearly a city block square packed to the fifteenfoot ceiling with file boxes of ancient transcripts a lot more victims he said jackman and roake walked together across bryant street they were about to say goodbye when the da put his hand on roakes arm and said im glad to see you back down here gina i was worried about you although of course i understood we all miss david though never as much as you do im sure thank you clarence thats nice of you to say i mean it may i ask you though did anything specific bring you back today she offered a slinky grin if credit is due id have to give it to my ohsosubtle partner no offense to mr farrell but that would be mr hardy she nodded youve got to love the guy except when you hate him jackman gave his own imitation of a smile yes i had a little of both experiences just this morning i wonder if you could give him a message for me certainly just tell him that its not about scratching backs its about justice and thats why jamahl isnt being charged with murder jamahl isnt being charged with murder got it its about justice too thats important thats why hes supporting my campaign jamahl and justice a wide grin and jackman hand in glove roake said she gave the da a chaste buss on the cheek im all over it she said see you next week outside the ygc courtroom after lunch hardy said hello to ken brolin andrews anger management psychologist while he was in the hallway catching up with the norths hal and linda maintained their chilly demeanor not saying a word to him as he introduced brolin to wu explaining that she would be conducting brolins interrogation on the second criterion when court was back in session when the younger bailiff cottrell called everyone in from the hallway hardy went out to his car drove to the freeway and headed south hed called mike mooneys father during the lunch break the sad old man had been home but had no idea how to get in touch either with terri or catherine mooneys exwives he hadnt heard from either of them in years and years so hardy had asked him if he was still in possession of his sons effects if the dissolution papers were among them hardy might be able to track the women down as it happened the reverend had his sons papers and files stored in an empty room of the rectory until he could decide what to do with them until now he hadnt even had the heart to glance at all the stuff but he said hardy was welcome to go through it if hed like if it would help him identify mikes killer mooney stood and raised a hand in feeble greeting as hardy came up the walk he wore his black sports coat today and had obviously been in his chair on the small front porch waiting if anything the house was sadder during the day in the sunshine five painful minutes after hed arrived after he had assured reverend mooney that he would be welcome to join him if hed like to take this opportunity to start going through mikes possessions hardy was alone in one of the unused back bedrooms of the sprawling house even with the blinds open and the overhead light on it was a dim room with a threadbare lightorange carpet there was a dresser with a mirror over it a madeup single bed an empty pocketdoor closet a small bathroom three rows of four packing boxes were tucked into the corner under the windows hardy went to the nearest one cut through the tape and lifted the cover clothes being thorough he pulled out each item folded shirts and pants until he got to the bottom he then repacked in reverse order the entire effort look him less than two minutes the second and third boxes also contained clothing items although in the bottom of the third box he found an envelope filled with snapshots all students some with mooney and some alone none even slightly objectionable or incriminating by themselves although hardy with his secret knowledge found himself fighting a rising tide of anger in the fourth box he ran across his first paperwork mostly scripts and what appeared to be students papers he went through these with a little more care hoping to find perhaps some correspondence that hed be able to use but mooney had evidently been a careful and very private man and there was no indication that he had any private life at all much less as wu had called it a secret one by the time hed found the marriage dissolution papers filed among some old tax filings and ancient bank statements in the seventh box hardy was tempted to keep looking through the rest just to see if anything of import to his investigation would come to light but hed already thumbed through a thousand or more sheets of paper including many many letters mostly to and from current and former students and again there had been no overt signs of impropriety he decided that hed gotten what he had come for if it turned into a dead end and he needed more he could always come back for now he had to keep moving forward the way the was going they could be crucial to the fifth criterion circumstances and gravity of the offense the one hed been planning to argue by tomorrow judge johnson had made it abundantly clear that neither alternative theories nor hearsay evidence were going to make the cut hardy would need demonstrable facts both from anna salarco and from what if anything he might discover from talking with mooneys wives and even then johnson might not admit them reverend mooney lent hardy the telephone in his office another room of sepia tones and he called information to get the number of the law firm blalock hewitt and chance andor the attorney michelle ossley who had evidently handled both sides of mikes uncontested divorce from his first wife terri neither were listed in san mateo santa clara or san francisco counties so hardy placed another call to his office and asked phyllis to please check martindalehubbell a directory of attorneys and have either blalock hewitt chance or ossley call him on his cellphone if she could find them he had better luck with catherines attorney from the second divorce the spouses had used different lawyers this time his name was everett washburn a sole practitioner who practiced out of redwood city another fifteen miles south his secretary informed hardy that mr washburn was expected to be in court until four or fourthirty after which he would probably go out to the broadway tobacconists for drinks and a cigar his invariable ritual after a court date if he wasnt going out with the client could she take his name and have mr washburn get back to him tomorrow im in a bit more of a hurry than that im afraid im trying to find a witness for a murder hearing thats in progress right now and i think she may have once been one of mr washburns clients does he have a pager number yes but he turns it off in court and then leaves it off if its after five or if hes out with clients he thinks its rude to let cellphones interrupt important conversations also he had a heart attack a year ago and wont work anymore except during business hours hardy was happy for him but this wasnt any help maybe i could try it anyway certainly she also took his name and all of his phone numbers and would tell mr washburn if he called which was doubtful that it was rather urgent hardy thanked her and sat at reverend mooneys desk staring at the motes flickering in the thin shafts of sunlight that penetrated the window slats after a moment and before he forgot to do it he punched in the numbers for washburns pager left his own cell number as a callback his watch said as he swung onto south heading for the courthouse in redwood city traffic was heavy but the time passed quickly enough as he took phone calls from both messrs blalock and chance ten years ago their firm had broken up after hewitt had died and though both remembered michelle ossley neither of them had kept up with her chance thought hed heard she left the law biz and moved to florida to work with her new husband in a travel agency but he wasnt sure neither of them had ever heard of ossleys divorce clients mike and terri mooney hardy paid five dollars to park in the redwood city courthouse lot only to discover that here at fourthirty all the courtrooms were deserted and locked up on the front steps he saw two middleaged black men in business suits talking together both of them had thick briefcases at their feet both projected an air of solidity hardy strolled over and excused then introduced himself would either of you gentlemen know where i would find an everett washburn he said washburn was a different suit of clothes than hardys friend and mentor david freeman but he was cut from the same cloth no doubt pushing seventy washburn wore suspenders and seersucker rather than freemans rack brown suit but neither believed in shining their shoes neither shaved with particular care and washburn sported an impressive gray walrus mustache and both seemed to believe that the smoking of daily cigars with some kind of strong alcohol was the key to longevity to say nothing of sex appeal when hardy found washburn in the backroom of the broadway tobacconists private humidified cigar vaults bottles of single malts and rare cognacs on the low tables he was holding court with a few welldressed younger people of either sex next to him an elegant and statuesque middleaged black woman in a bright red dress smoked a cheroot and kept her free hand protectively on washburns forearm reluctant to interrupt hardy watched and listened to him for a while through the thick blue fragrant smoke finally and again freemanlike washburn called the shot himself smiling around at the gathered group whispering something to his attractive companion he rose and walked directly up to hardy if youre looking for everett washburn son and by the way youre standing here i gather you are then youve found him he had a large watch on a fob chain that he consulted theres barely five minutes left in the business day and even if i didnt have a beautiful woman waiting for me when i get free i dont work after that so youd better talk fast im trying to locate catherine mooney you represented her sixteen years ago in a divorce proceeding against her husband mike who was killed a few months ago in san francisco im representing the suspect in that homicide and catherine may have some crucial information that could free my client this was a stretch but hardy didnt care i have to talk to her as soon as i can washburns expression showed nothing he brought his cigar to his lips squinted his eyes against the smoke you got a card with your cell number you got your phone on you yes sir lets have em both hardy dug out his wallet extracted his business card gave the man his cellphone lets go find ourselves a little more light he led the way out of the room out of the store stopped on the sidewalk outside and turned around to face hardy you wait here he walked off ten or fifteen steps and hardy watched as he first punched some numbers then talked into the phone then read from hardys card and finally closed the phone up when he came back he handed the phone back to him pocketed the card in his shirt i like the dart on the card he said nice touch thank you if she wants to talk to you shell call you thats how i left it hardy knew that that was all he was going to get and damned lucky at that if catherine mooney had remarried and changed her name which was not unlikely washburn wasnt about to give it to him without the call hardy might never find her i appreciate it he said washburn waved the thanks away with his cigar professional courtesy mr hardy im sure youd do the same for me could i ask you one more question a quick smile washed away the merest flash of impatience certainly in case i need to see her in person would you recommend that i stay in the area or go back up to the city and which city would that be pace he said a joke id stay nearby good thank you washburn checked his pocket watch again nodded with satisfaction and with twenty seconds to spare too if i would have gone over it would have cost you now it was after six oclock and hardy brought his cup of espresso to the pay phone by the kitchen at vino santo restaurant on broadway across the street from the tobacconists about five blocks from the courthouse he had his cellphone with him of course but he didnt want to use it and risk missing catherine if she called hello frannie said im assuming the kids must have put the phone in your bed right which is how youre able to answer it dismas im fine in other words not in bed as the doctor no scratch that two doctors have ordered he heard her sigh did you call to yell at me because if you did you can just call back in a minute and leave it on the machine im not going to yell at you im calling to say im probably not getting home anytime soon im down in redwood city hoping to talk to a witness for andrew bartlett are you making dinner no as a matter of fact our two darlings are cooking up something even as we speak it smells delicious whats gotten into them do you think theyre being angels they love their mother and want to take care of her thats all since apparently she wont take care of herself you didnt talk to them i talk to them all the time its what a father ought to do that and not nag the mother unless she asks for it well whatever you said thank you its really made a difference thats good to hear really he said then added but you dont push it okay i dont want to come home and have you on your back in bed she lowered her voice thats the saddest thing you always used to heres a little secret he said i still do hardy next reached wu at the office where she was getting ready for tomorrow she told him that the brolin testimony had gone all right judge johnson had given her considerable leeway with the psychologist whod painted andrew in the best possible light a young man who didnt need rehabilitation because he was essentially a good citizen already as hardy knew they had also pulled mr wagner from sutro in and hed testified to andrews basic goodness his extracurricular activities talent for writing and the arts in general again there was nothing to rehabilitate brandt had not even bothered to crossexamine and wu had thought it was because he was prepared to give her these criteria after all he only had to win one of them but mr brandt fights everything im learning he called his own witness glen taylor the inspector whod arrested him and whatd he say well brandt leads him up from the beginning of the investigation his first suspicions about andrew the mounting evidence right up to the arrest then asks him if in all that time did andrew show the slightest amount of remorse for what hed done you objected of course of course and even got sustained but he just rephrased did andrew at any time show any remorse about what had happened and of course taylor said no hardy at his table at vino santo drew circles on his legal pad there werent any notes to take or comments to make this was pretty much pro forma police testimony in proceedings of this kind and wasnt particularly sophisticated or damning stuff it sounded as though wu had won her point he wasnt so sure though about the third criterion the minors previous delinquent history this both he and wu had considered a slam dunk since andrew had no real record they hadnt even planned to call any witnesses but would let that fact speak for itself but again the short lead time andrew had demanded aggravated by his suicide attempt had left them unprepared and vulnerable to attack and brandt was ready for it he called as witnesses two ygc counselors and another san francisco police officer who had had occasion to meet with andrew before this case for while it was true that andrew had never been arrested or convicted it turned out that as brandt phrased it he had had previous dealings with the police and youth authority the joyride wu had fought back with the standard argument that it hadnt been a serious offense hed never been arrested or even formally charged but hardy thought it was bad luck to get surprised in court and at the very least doubted if they had helped themselves on criterion number three and worse he knew that the problem with number three would impact criterion number four obviously given andrews presence in the courtroom and the fact that he was being charged with special circumstances murder argued more eloquently than mere words could against the success of the juvenile courts previous attempts to rehabilitate him like all criminal lawyers hardy and wu both knew that once a defendant began showing up in courtrooms the cycle was more likely than not to go on repeating itself from the courts perspective and although not legally accurate this was really andrews second offense johnson would be aware of the statistics people who appeared before him twice most often managed a third then as adults they would start accumulating the strikes that would eventually get to three and put them in jail for life i know we had no witnesses but did you make any argument at all hardy asked her i just reiterated that hes got no record there wasnt any previous effort at rehab to be successful or not i know it sounds bad but weve got to win these last two on the merits hardy hoped she was right in a completely fair world she would be but johnson had thus far shown himself to be so antagonistic that hardy wasnt sure how it would come out it wasnt impossible that hed find against every one of the criteria as an object lesson for wu to contemplate and because no one could reasonably dispute his acceptance of the gravity criterion johnson would be immune from appeal on the other four rejection of any one of the criteria got andrew into superior court as an adult so the remaining four would be judicial largesse a personal thumb to the nose but if it was to be it was already done so where are we now hardy asked ive served the salarcos she said meaning with subpoenas to appear in court theyd be there tomorrow how are you doing with the wives still hoping silence wu asked youll be in court tomorrow though right thats my plan because were opening with your show ill be there hardy said dont worry the cellphone rang an hour later hed had another cup of coffee his first apple pie √† la mode in probably ten years forgotten tastes childhood memories delicious beyond imagining mr hardy yes this is catherine bass im sorry im a little late getting back to you weve got three kids under fifth grade and we just finished supper but everett washburn said this was about mike mooney yes maam hardy thought her brittle laugh sounded nervous or embarrassed dont tell me he left me all his money no its not that im kidding of course mike wouldnt have had any money then i was so sad when i heard about that its just so unbelievably sad hardy gave her a second then said i realize that this is an imposition but would you mind if we talked in person i wont take much of your time i know about small children i promise i wont keep you hardys intention all along had been to get some face time with either of the wives he didnt just want to verify the fact of mooneys sexual orientation after steven randell he didnt have any real doubts about that what he wanted was some sense of where it might have played in his married life in the hope that some of the habits might have continued did he have secret liaisons longterm but hidden relationships was he consumed with smoldering anger or paralyzed by fear of exposure were there enemies lovers blackmailers too much for a phone call with someone hed never met she came back after talking to her husband where are you she asked catherine bass like his own wife was a petite redhead she didnt have frannies worldclass cheekbones her skin was a bit more freckled and her hair cropped short but with her striking green eyes and dimples as she smiled she was very attractive nonetheless hardy had the impression that she was still dressed from a day of work at some professional job she wore low black heels a gray kneelength skirt a black turtleneck sweater she exuded a confident warmth as hardy stood and they shook hands he thanked her for coming to meet him she waved that off as they both sat and the waitress came to the table by now hardy was a resident catherine ordered herself a dessert called a chocolate heart attack ive got cdd she said by way of explanation breaking that dimpled smile again no let me guess hardy was immediately taken with her after a second he said chocolate something something youre not from around here are you or it would be obvious chocolate deficit disorder its pretty serious why would i have known that if i lived around here because here in the lovely south peninsula you have kids and you hear d attached to anything you know it means disorder you may not realize it but right now were sitting in the ritalin capital of the world every second or third child here has add or maybe adhd at least something why is that i mean whys it so big down here she leaned in toward him and lowered her voice this is heresy she said i could be shot if anyone heard me but its because they test for it who does any parents with a difficult kid your children are failing or acting up in school take them to a shrink have them tested for add and see if you can guess youre a shrink looking for a condition where if its present youve got a lifelong patient and endless billings they tend to find it surprising is it not kind of like asking a car mechanic if you really need the brake job she shook her head because its not that kids crave attention from their both too busy and cant be bothered parents its that theyre born with a disorder not the parents fault not the kids either which is the way we like things down here dont get me started hardy was grinning at her i thought you already had its my job she said forgive me nothing to forgive i know i get tedious im trying to stop the dimples chocolate will help hardy wanted to keep her talking until she was comfortable and it didnt seem like that was going to be much of a chore what do you do im a city attorney believe it or not i do code enforcement on foster homes and shrinks mostly but my real mission is this overprescribing of ritalin it really is an epidemic down here maybe its everywhere parents can afford to get their kids tested i dont know maybe kids have fundamentally changed since i was growing up and everybody needs to be medicated but if you want my opinion and it looks like youre going to get it anyway its that most of the time not always i admit kids have this attention deficit because they dont get attention from their parents is it that complicated oh god she brought her hand to her forehead im sorry especially if your kids have it and they probably do dont they no sometimes they get coud but we dont medicate for that we just bust them pretty good it took her a second center of universe disorder youre good he said smiling you must do this all the time the waitress arrived this will shut me up she stuck a spoon into the dessert brought it to her mouth savored okay she said mike you know i never asked you what about mike you wanted to talk about but you still came down here i still cared about him although i hadnt seen him in years he was a good guy hardy kept his opinion on that to himself thats what everybody says but somebody killed him and im trying to find out why somebody i understood they had a pretty solid suspect an awareness gathered in her eyes she killed a few seconds licking her spoon youre defending the killer hardy had gone through this so often that he was tempted to wave it off but it was the first time that catherine bass would have heard it and he had to give the objection its weight the alleged killer yes andrew bartlett but i expect hell be released maybe as soon as tomorrow im all but certain he didnt do it i want to find out who did and you think i might know i havent laid eyes on mike in years i realize that he paused then came out with it mrs bass i know he was gay she closed her eyes for a second drew a deep breath and let it out all right im wondering if that might have played some role in his death if what did being gay how would it do that i dont know if he had some secret life she poked the chocolate with her spoon wasnt someone else killed with him a girl one of his students yes that doesnt really point to a sinister gay secret life to me it doesnt to me either she might not have been part of the original plan but as a witness she had to be eliminated do you really think that i really dont know im hoping my client is innocent beyond that im fishing but it would be helpful to get the simple fact of mikes gayness out in front of the judge and how would that help it might punch some holes in the prosecutions motive theory what about his father hardys own expression had grown somber i know ive been trying to figure that one out bring it out in chambers seal the record something i see youve dealt with it too her mouth was a hard line god those years when i compare them to how i live now how long were you together her eyes came back to him not so long in real time i guess thirty months something like that beginning to end her mouth tried to signal a kind of apology for getting so personal it was an eternity though in psychic time we really were best friends even back when he was with terri i was the other woman you know in their marriage broke them up it was really pretty funny actually if you had a taste for irony did you know about his being gay not at first at the time hell you know we were young and living the theater life all of us it was assumed that we all led active sexual lives and that some of us experimented with various combinations we didnt see it as a big deal and mike was pretty she laughed again with the brittle embarrassment hardy had first heard on the phone with her actually he was pretty period gorgeous and promiscuous as all hell trying to prove what he wasnt you know god was it exciting drama every day especially when he when we were cheating on terri sometimes shed be out on stage doing a scene i mean in plain sight thirty feet from us jesus he gave her a minute to come back to him so how did you find out hanging her head she drew her dessert near and picked at it after we got married we had a couple of good months but pretty soon the the physical side i guess what turned him on was the forbidden fruit aspect when i stopped being that her shoulders rose then fell but as i said we were friends we liked to do the same things so at first we pretended everything was the same fooling ourselves you know im not sure if mike really admitted to himself that he was strictly gay even then we were always together and busy and shit i may as well tell you we never had sex in our bed it was always someplace we might get caught for me that got a little old but as long as we had our busy routine and found time to sneak away i told myself that we were intimate enough the lies we tell ourselves huh and then as it turned out nobodys fault but the routine changed on us anyway what happened mike got called to jury duty lucas welding write it down hardy was in his car speeding north talking to glitsky it was and hed left catherine bass fifteen minutes before his right hand was sore from taking notes but he remembered everything hed written in he strangled and murdered his wife ginny got tried and convicted in san francisco in sentenced to lwop but hes out now looks like howd that happen i dont know but mrs bass mooneys exwife is a lawyer herself now and remembered boscacci distinctly as the prosecutor shes followed his career ever since ill bet you a million dollars that your elizabeth cary was on the same jury you said youre in your car where are you just passing the airport meet you at the hall glitsky said twenty minutes since the ground floor of the hall of justice was the location of sfpds southern station the building was open hardy and glitsky opened the front door together and passed through the metal detectors and security cops in the lobby lanier was already waiting for them in the hallway outside glitskys office and the three of them filed into the small conference room behind the reception area by earlier that afternoon theyd finally managed to set up a total of six borrowed computers for the use of the two general work officers and the twentytwo others that both jackman had provided and glitsky had recruited out of their respective clerical staffs all overtime expenses paid it had taken a good part of the afternoon to get the computers up and connected but when glitsky had left work that night all of them had been in use six volunteers at a time worked the list of four hundred recently released convicts while six others armed with case numbers from the computer searches went downstairs and under the building to records where they searched for the physical files on the boscacci hits by the time of glitskys departure earlier that night out of the first theyd identified seven cases where boscacci had been the actual trial prosecutor at pm the second shift of twelve was scheduled to come in and continue through the night and then the next morning until they got something but now the room was empty where is everybody glitsky asked theyre all downstairs lanier said they got the case number on welding five minutes after you called finding the physical records isnt so easy it may be a while he wasnt in your original four hundred you know so he didnt get out in the last two months glitsky said whered they keep him hardy asked corcoran according to the computer hardy threw a glance at glitsky came back to lanier and hes out now pretty much got to be if hes killing people dont you think glitsky took hardys silent cue we call tie it up if it turns out this guy is the executioner we want to know everything about him the warden gets a wakeup hardy and lanier followed him around the corner to his office where he flipped through his rolodex and picked up the telephone after a short wait he identified himself by name and rank and said he needed a record on one of the prisons inmates immediately it was urgent glitsky listened for a while then said yes i realize that but if hes the only one with that access at this time of night then i need to talk to him another pause while the scar in glitskys lips went white then could i get your name and rank please thank you sergeant gray listen i could have the mayor of san francisco call again in five minutes and possibly even the governor after that but that seems like a lot of unnecessary trouble ill take full responsibility glitsky spelled his name left his badge and telephone number hung up i guess the warden likes his beauty rest he said they heard the elevator and the scuffle of feet and in a minute the small army of twelve volunteers had gathered again in the computer room theyd brought up two large gray rolling trolleys each about four by six feet wide and three feet high and on them were piled what looked to be about twenty cardboard boxes the lead guy who was in uniform saluted glitsky this is the case sir or as much of it as we could find lucas welding eightysix theres no room and worse light down there so we thought wed bring it up what are we looking for the jurors glitsky said also just to be thorough lets make sure allan boscacci tried the case everyone including hardy took a box and started going through the paper endless endless reams of paper the complete record of a california murder trial the boxes contained everything from the initial police reports to the autopsy and forensics information to witness interviews as well as all discovery prosecution notes expert witness testimony and background the transcript of the trial itself after fifteen minutes one of the workers said ive got boscacci heres the whatdoyoucallit the front page the caption page hardy said although nobody looked up or seemed to care glitsky jumped though and was looking at it okay so far so good he flipped through a few of the following pages in that document then closed it and handed the whole thing back lets keep going he said a long twentyfive minutes after that laniers easy delivery broke the silence here we go he was sitting across the table from glitsky and slid the document across while everyone else some from out in the reception area stopped what they were doing to look glitsky read for a moment then put a hand to his scar and pulled at it hes the one he said in a hoarse and strangled tone then clearing his throat he read aloud philip wong michael mooney edith montrose morris tollman what about elizabeth cary hardy asked glitsky looked down nodded elizabeth reed that was her maiden name jesus christ someone whispered i doubt it lanier said he wouldnt have come back for a murder trial to a titter of nervous laughter but glitsky was already punching numbers into the phone on the desk a muscle working in his jaw while he was waiting another phone rang in his office diz thats the warden get it he ordered tell him ill be right there hardy jumped marcel glitsky handed lanier the conference room phone hed been using thats batiste when he picks up tell him what weve got and that ill be right back now or sooner were going to need eight teams at least at least to protect the people who are left he was moving back to his office and when youre done put out an all points on welding asap in his own office glitsky strode in and grabbed the phone from hardy warden fischer he said this is glitsky thanks for getting back to me i dont know if youre familiar with these executioner killings weve been having okay great in the last hour or so weve developed a tentative id on the suspect and believe he was staying at your place until recently were going to need all the information you have on him immediately last known address next of kin the works he went up in lwop i know i wondered about that too welding welding lucas yeah im sure why hardy watched glitskys face already hard turn to stone the eyes narrowed the lips went tight the jaw muscle by his ear quivered his hand went to his side and he pushed in as though trying to reposition his intestines then for a long frozen moment he ceased to move entirely finally he asked youre sure then yes of course i see thank you he hung up raised his head saw hardy standing there lucas welding is dead he said for the next half hour glitsky was a dervish other people might still be at risk knowing that there had to be a connection between the executioner and lucas welding he sent people to find the names of all of weldings visitors at corcoran correspondents cell mates people who put money on his book everyone who had ever met the guy he assigned the other half of his volunteers in pairs to track down the other jurors from weldings trial check phone books and reverse listings get unlisted numbers from the phone company go online somebody had to know how to locate individuals by name and get their address be aware of the maiden name issue leave messages with dmv and any federal agency they could think of wake up anybody they needed to the jury records people he didnt know precisely how the connection fit yet but he knew that it did he ran down the hall to homicide and stopped lanier from issuing the apb back in his office he briefed batiste on the general situation and told him he wanted to assign protection officers to the jury people to have teams of two standing by to deploy as soon as he could locate the jurors then they had to reschedule other officers to fill the affected shifts everyones time would be on the boscacci event number if that met with the chiefs approval which it did hardy listened in picking up the information secondhand he died two months ago in the infirmary in corcoran glitsky told the chief fischer remembered specifically because it was a bit of a deal hed just been cleared on appeal dna it looks like he really didnt do it but then the cancer got him first if thats true its ugly hardy said as he hung up they put away an innocent man looks like from the expression on his face glitsky wasnt happy about it either the executioner seems pretty upset about it too i cant say i blame him glitskys look went black you dont hardy held up a palm easy for what he feels not for what hes doing he does what hes doing i dont care how he feels this certainly wasnt the time to discuss it and hardy wasnt sure he disagreed so much anyway injustice happened he knew and sometimes perhaps with welding even innocently revenge and violence wasnt going to make anything better at least that was the theory so who is it hardy asked did he have a kid maybe some other relative glitsky still in do something mode snapped his fingers and picked up his desk telephone again fischer the wardenwill know that where are you going home hardy looked at his watch its twelvethirty and ive got a hearing this morning you dont want to know how this comes out i know how this comes out abe for my client glitsky had certainly already known this on some level hardy had given him the first inkling of it the night before on the telephone and tonight the mooney connection through catherine bass had all but cinched it but suddenly it hit him fresh he put the phone down on the desk and the girl too hardy nodded laura wright she just happened to be there at on wednesday morning dismas hardy stood up at his place at the defense table and addressed the juvenile court for the first time in the matter of minor andrew bartlett your honor he said before we begin argument and witnesses today i think it will save the court considerable time and trouble if counsel meet in camera for a few minutes johnson perhaps sensing shenanigans considered for a long moment we just got out here mr hardy id like to get a little work done before we take a break we may not need to do the work your honor there is new and pertinent information about this case critical evidence that will i believe be persuasive to the court and perhaps even lead to dismissal of all charges against mr bartlett the courtroom as always was nearly empty but his words still created an audible buzz from the norths who sat behind hardy and even from the bailiffs the clerk and the recorder brandt who sat to hardys right at the prosecution table pushed his chair back and stared with frank amazement johnson pulled himself up to his full height in his chair behind the bench as i mentioned to you at the outset mr hardy were not here to consider the criminal charges against mr bartlett the purpose of this hearing and its only purpose is to determine where mr bartlett gets tried here or in adult court not whether of course your honor i understand that nevertheless the import of this new information is rather extraordinary and i believe the court will want to have heard it to save the time that is obviously so important to you to prevent a grave injustice your honor im talking perhaps ten minutes maybe less johnson wore his reluctance like a shroud but finally shaking his head in disgust he turned to brandt does the petitioner have any objection nothing substantive your honor all right ill see counsel in my chambers johnson stood ten minutes and he left the courtroom by the back door johnson his arms crossed over his chest stood in his robes in the middle of his room so that when the three lawyers trooped in behind him there really wasnt anyplace for them to go after brandt closed the door behind them they stood with their backs to the wall their faces to the intractable judge all right mr hardy were in chambers as you can probably tell im not in much of a trifling mood so lets hear whats so important hardy nodded thank you your honor ill cut to the chase andrew bartlett didnt kill mike mooney and i have information which i believe rises to the level of proof and i think youll agree but johnson was already shaking his head no i wont agree because i wont hear it pardon i cant imagine mr hardy how i could have made it more clear to you that this sevenohseven is not about mr bartletts guilt or innocence hardy striving for equanimity inclined his head an inch in deference yes your honor i understand but this you say you understand and follow it with a but that sounds like an argument coming up do you hear yourself your honor forgive me im not trying to be argumentative im trying to present information that you will im sure find compelling about your clients guilt or innocence hardy knew the wrong answer and tried to avoid it about the circumstances of the crime which would make it fall under criteria five all right but be careful johnson cocked his head were getting a little obscure here counselor im talking about the person theyre calling the executioner what about him brandt got on the boards excuse me but wait a minute this sounds to me like were getting back to who committed these murders it does to me too johnson said mr hardy youre not going to imply i hope that some unknown serial killer might be guilty of the crimes for which your client is charged your honor with respect its not a question of might i was in the hall of justice last night with deputy chief glitsky he identified a defendant in a seventeenyearold case with connections to allan boscacci as well as to all the socalled executioner victims and youre saying the victims in this case im saying mike mooney and laura wright were killed by the executioner yes excuse me brandt said again did i miss something have they caught him no has someone confessed hardy came back to johnson thats not the point your honor glitsky knows who he is but hasnt been able to identify him yet by name johnson barked a note of derision so hes known but unidentified whatever that means it seems weve gotten to quite a long throw from whether or not mr bartlett is an adult im getting there your honor you are you know mr hardy i dont believe you are is mr bartlett somehow related to this known but unidentified executioner no may i ask how you can know that one way or the other if you dont know who the man is the judge gathered himself for a moment then pointed an accusatory finger at hardy this is exactly the type of alternative theory hocuspocus that i warned you against at the outset and warned you again before we came back here to chambers but this isnt hocuspocus your honor you can call deputy chief glitsky and johnson finally raised his voice i dont have to call anyone if there is strong enough evidence to warrant revisiting the charges against mr bartlett im sure mr brandt will hear about it from the district attorney mr brandt have you gotten any calls today on this topic no your honor he turned to hardy then this court is going to assume mr hardy that the current charges are still in effect if mr bartlett is demonstrably innocent of them im sure that mr jackman will drop them and let mr brandt know as soon as he can but in the meanwhile until i hear otherwise mr bartlett is in the middle of an administrative process to determine where he gets tried thats all thats happening here enough of this hardy in a bit of a fury of his own took a step forward moving into the judges personal space to the contrary your honor with all respect there has not been enough of this if its your decision to refuse to hear what ive got to say then when we get outside im going to open up by making a representation to the court and getting it on the record johnson glared at him talk all you want mr hardy sooner or later youll have to stop and well get on with it if it please the court they were all back in the courtroom hardy didnt even sit down but got back to his table turned and spoke last night acting on information received from a classmate of andrew bartlett i spoke to a woman named catherine bass who was at one time the wife of michael mooney because proceedings in juvenile court were kept confidential hardy could bring up the bare fact of mooneys sexuality here if he needed to and still keep it out of the public record but now he realized with some relief that there was no reason even for that she informed me and subsequently i have verified it as true that in michael mooney served on a jury here in san francisco in the case of people v lucas welding a murder case the prosecutor in that case was allan boscacci other members of that jury included hardy looked down and checked his noteselizabeth cary born elizabeth reed edith montrose philip wong and morris tollman all of these people the jurors ive mentioned and allan boscacci have been murder victims in the past three weeks next to him he heard andrew his neck brace gone now whisper to wu is that true even within the bullpen he saw the bailiffs exchange glances with each other and then the court recorder johnson picked up his gavel then put it back down it was the first time that he was hearing all of this in detail and hardy hoped that the recitation would make an impression upon receiving this information i immediately called san franciscos deputy chief of inspectors abe glitsky and subsequently met him at the hall of justice where he discovered that lucas welding who had been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife had recently won a reversal of his conviction based upon dna evidence that had not been presented at the original trial he had been ordered released from prison but during the course of his appeal he had developed cancer and ultimately died at the infirmary at the corcoran penitentiary before he could be released hardy stopped wondering if that was enough it certainly had been plenty for him and glitsky he threw a look over to brandt but the prosecutor was sitting slumped in his chair his head down his hands clasped on his lap johnson himself appeared to be waiting for more and if that door was open hardy thought he should walk through it deputy chief glitsky has assigned several inspectors first to find and protect the other jurors from the welding case and second to identify and locate anyone who might have had a relationship with welding and whose rage over weldings seventeen years of incarceration for a crime he did not commit might have become a motive for the murders of allan boscacci and several members of the convicting jury he paused to let his words reverberate for a moment then added including he said the murder of michael mooney brandt was sitting up straight now johnson was taking some notes at the podium when he was finished he looked up his eyes went first to brandt then to the gallery where hal and linda were whispering then finally back to the defense table thank you mr hardy your representation is noted for the record is that the substance of it yes your honor all right then lets move on do you have another witness for this sevenohseven proceeding wait a minute andrews voice was still fairly hoarse but carried in the courtroom if you know that somebody else killed mooney behind him hardy heard the norths and he turned hal was on his feet that ought to be the end of this he was saying both bailiffs nelson and cottrell stood quickly and moved out from their positions on either wall but this is nuts andrew was saying to wu it proves what ive been saying from the beginning he got to his feet and spoke up to the court in general back to his mother its what ive been telling you guys all along johnson gaveled him quiet a sharp loud crack ill have order in this courtroom mr north sit down mr hardy ms wu im warning you get your client under control both bailiffs stopped in their tracks for a moment then cottrell with a warning glare at wu and hardy walked out through the bullpen gate and into the gallery hardy turned and watched cottrell as he continued back past the norths and positioned himself by the back door wu stood up but your honor surely the import of mr hardys johnson brought down his gavel again ms wu i said thats enough shaking her head in frustation and anger wu shared a look with hardy put her hand on andrews arm to calm him and sat back down hardy was still on his feet your honor he said its obvious to everyone in this courtroom that andrew bartlett did not kill mike mooney brandt was up across the room your honor if it please the court its not obvious to me ive got an eyewitness and a great deal of evidence that says he did and what about the other victim in this case laura wright andrew bartletts girlfriend does defense counsel contend that she was on this mr weldings bad luck jury too hardy spoke to the judge your honor she was killed because she happened to be there and mooneys killer did not want to leave a witness johnson used his gavel again then waited while the courtroom went to complete silence finally he drew a long breath mr hardy i reject your conclusion that your representation rises to the level of proof in the matter before this court ill admit that it does rise to the level of coincidence and the court does not find that compelling also it doesnt change the essential fact of the gravity of the offense mr mooney and ms wright were murdered the district attorney has not withdrawn the charges against mr bartlett nor has he conveyed the gravemen of your most recent information to the court or to mr brandt as ive already mentioned several times this sevenohseven is about whether mr bartlett is a juvenile or an adult and thats all its about but your honor crack mr hardy your representation is noted for the record what do you expect me to do drop the charges i dont think that would be unreasonable your honor given the enormity of what youre calling the coincidence mr mooney and ms wright were both killed by someone connected to lucas welding and theres no such connection with andrew bartlett i understand that thats your theory mr hardy now do you have another witness or is it time that i make a ruling hardy bit the inside of his mouth hard looking down to his right at andrew he whispered hang in there then came back to the judge and said wed like to call anna salarco your honor all right johnson looked to his left cottrells standard position in the courtroom and frowned he turned in the other direction officer nelson would you please go out to the hallway and call the witness anna salarco and while youre out there if you see officer cottrell would you ask him if hed care to join us again in the courtroom there followed some minutes of confusion hardy had told anna salarco that theyd call her as a witness as soon as the court was called to session but then theyd all had the meeting in chambers and hardys representation to the court in the interim evidently both of the salarcos had left the hallway to go to the bathroom maybe bailiff cottrell had gone looking for them in any event cottrell was still missing from the courtroom when anna salarco finally and nervously took the witness stand hardy walked her through the bynow familiar recital making sure to memorialize for the record the understanding that the salarcos thought they had with the police regarding their immigration status which hardy believed served as a strong incentive for juan to refuse to change his story when theyd finished annas testimony was all hardy could have wished for just before her husband had gone downstairs and discovered the bodies she had clearly seen the man leaving the house after the door had slammed and could not identify him as andrew hardy thanked her and turned her over to brandt for crossexamination much to hardys displeasure brandt and anna werent complete strangers anymore wu told him that when the prosecutor had seen her name on the list he too had called the salarcos then gone out to visit with them last night himself this was why juan was out in the hallway now waiting for his chance to talk to the court and possibly refute whatever his wife had said first so brandt advanced to the witness box with a relaxed demeanor mrs salarco he began how far is it from your window to the sidewalk in front of your house i dont know exactly approximately then she shot a glance at hardy and he nodded with some confidence this question was not unexpected thirty feet maybe forty thirty or forty feet thank you thats about the distance from where youre sitting to the back of this courtroom is that right hardy turned around to check and saw that brandt wasnt far off something like mrs salarco said yes and you and your husband live on the second floor of your building do you not yes so you were looking down at the person you saw yes and he was wearing a cowl at her confused expression he mimicked with his hands and added a sweatshirt with a hood over his head s√≠ yes did it cover his whole head again she looked at hardy and again he nodded what else could he do he had to let her tell her story and hope it came out as credible she nodded back at brandt yes but not his whole face did it cover part of his face then she paused yes then added he looked up god bless her hardy thought but brandt came right back at her what do you mean by that mrs salarco that he looked up do you mean hardy stalled to let the witness get composed objection sustained brandt was ready though at any time did the hood come off the mans head no it covered the top of his head and part of his face hardy stood again objecting sustained all right let me ask you this mrs salarco was it dark outside at this time nighttime yes but yes is sufficient thank you brandt said cutting her off he must have decided that hed made enough of his point and switched gears mrs salarco were you present at the police lineup where your husband identified the person whod been downstairs at mr mooneys apartment that night yes did you take part in that lineup too yes and you failed to identify anyone in the lineup as the person you saw that night is that right yes you were given a form and then signed the form saying you didnt recognize anyone in the lineup is that right yes and mr bartlett sitting at that table over there he turned and pointedyou did not recognize him your honor hardy was up again im getting to something here your honor brandt said all right johnson nodded objection overruled but get to it mrs salarco when you did not positively identify anyone in the lineup as the man below your window did you mean that you didnt know whether it was one of the people in the lineup or not it might have been or it might not have been or did you mean to say that none of those people in the lineup was the man you saw that is you could not definitely say that it was andrew her eyes by now filled with fear anna salarco looked to hardy for support but there was nothing he could do she came back to brandt im sorry i dont understand your honor brandt said may i rephrase go ahead brandt gave her a warm smile and stepped a bit closer to her mrs salarco he said we are trying to understand exactly what it is that you want to tell the court at the lineup you said you could not identify anyone is that correct yes all right did you mean that it could not have been andrew that it was impossible that it was andrew down below you thirty or forty feet away with a hood over his head on a dark night no maybe not impossible but brandt rushed her with the followup so your testimony now is that what you meant to say was that you couldnt positively identify the person as andrew is that right that you werent sure enough to swear to it s√≠ she said i could not swear to it that it was him ah brandt rewarded her with a beaming smile thank you mrs salarco he whirled to hardy redirect he wanted to take a short recess perhaps confer with wu and give anna a few minutes to collect herself and perhaps realize what shed said but he didnt think he could afford to wait mrs salarco he began is there a streetlight in front of your house yes was it on that is lit up when you saw the man come from the downstairs apartment turn and look up at you yes and could you see the mans face yes and was it andrews face she stopped looked for a long time at the defense table then finally shook her head no she said was not that boy during the lunch recess hardy stood out in the back lobby making phone calls to glitsky to his wife to the office as he was finishing up the last one he noticed wu and brandt sitting on a bench next to the walkway that led up to the cabins from his vantage they appeared to be arguing but there was something about their body language that set hardys alarms jangling since there wasnt a jury that might be influenced by seeing the opposing attorneys schmoozing during lunch their t√™te√†t√™te wasnt the breach in trial decorum it might otherwise have been but still especially given the norths presence just up the hill in the cabins having lunch with their son hardy did not think it presented a picture that would be particularly comforting to the clients he put away his cellphone walked out the back door and started to approach them when he got close he noticed the silent signal pass from brandt to wu and they both shut up and put on different faces hardy gave them both a polite hello any word from glitsky wu asked him hes not answering so im assuming hes too busy i left a message that we want to know the second hes got anything firm meanwhile im going up to have a word with andrew and his folks if im not interrupting anything here you want to come along coming from her boss this wasnt really a request wu hesitated then stood up and fell in next to him as he continued walking hes not going to call juan salarco she said hardy nodded believing that the decision was the proper one though juans testimony might have undercut his wifes credibility somewhat in the end his identification of andrew in the lineup was already on the record and the differences in the stories and interpretations of the husband and wife were what juries were for further once he got on the stand hardy or wu would have a chance to crossexamine him and perhaps expose other weaknesses that they could later exploit at the trial so thats it for witnesses then it looks like then its over we get the ruling when we go back in hardy took a few more steps then asked what were you two arguing about it wasnt that he isnt calling salarco no its that he wont call jackman why should he as his honor was kind enough to point out if they get anything jackman will call him mr brandt is just playing it out a game right well in some ways it is a game wu you know that not for andrew she said no though it was when you started with him wasnt it her shoulders fell with the truth of that its just that keeping track of when its a game and when its not she broke a weary smileit can wear a girl out they hadnt yet reached the gate that enclosed the cabins and wu stopped walking but this is just so clearly wrong dont you think andrew didnt kill anybody no i dont believe he did either thats what i asked jason whether or not he believed it he said that wasnt the point he didnt want to go there hes right his job right now is to present the petitioners argument even if he knows its wrong even then and in this case he doesnt know hes wrong hes just a lot more likely to be wrong than he used to be and so andrew winds up screwed again you dont want to be screwed dont get in the system but for the time being thats what it looks like but it wont last much longer i dont think wu bit her lip shook her head this is all my fault you know that every bit of it if i hadnt been so arrogant and stupid johnson might be listening to all this new information with an open mind instead of being so blind i mean what if andrew had succeeding in killing himself that would have been completely my fault and now every extra minute that he spends in jail hardy stopped her you thought you were doing what was best for your client thats the job but he wasnt guilty you didnt know that you thought he was i always thought they were they always have been before okay so maybe you wont think that anymore its not all about strategy and leverage sometimes not often i grant you but sometimes its about the truth the small visitors room was too small for all of them so bailiff nelson had accompanied andrew hardy wu and the norths back down the hill to the courtroom where they now sat but this makes no sense at all linda north said we know that mr mooney and laura were both killed by this executioner dont we she looked around at them all wideeyed dont we all know that is it just me hardy nodded no its not just you and yes we know it but we dont have proof what more proof would we need hal asked physical evidence hardy said we know that theyve matched the slugs that killed at least three of the executioners victims im asking the police to take another pass at mooneys place try to find the slugs either theyll do it or ill find some investigators and pay them to but what if nobody finds them linda asked then maybe theyll find this executioner and hell confess to killing mooney or maybe juan salarco could withdraw his id any of those would be good but what if linda went on what if we dont get any of them are you saying they wont let andrew go they still might yes hardy said but they might not and in the meanwhile andrew said in his damaged voice what happens to me ill be here his mother said to him ill be here every day well both be here hal added hardy put a hand on the young mans arm gave what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze ive got to ask you to sit tight awhile longer you think you can do that this is going to work out i promise you were almost done hal couldnt let it go but the judge must know now doesnt he i mean the coincidence is so great it really couldnt be anything else in fact hardy said it could be something else somebody else besides the executioner could have had a motive to kill mooney or laura though i wouldnt bet on it but andrews guilt or innocence isnt what this hearing is about anyway and meanwhile he sits in jail his mother said really though hardy said not for too much longer this is just a fucking travesty hal said hardy met his angry gaze with one of his own i couldnt agree with you more nelsons bulk appeared at the table beside them mr hardy ms wu his honor would like to see both of you in chambers they exchanged a worried glance excused themselves and walked back out through the bullpen nelson knocked on the judges door got a yes and pushed it open this time they had room to enter and even to sit on two of the three chairs that had been placed in front of johnsons desk where the judge sat without his robes in shirt and tie much to hardys surprise he looked up from the document he was perusing and greeted them more or less genially ive asked mr brandt to join us as well and id prefer to say nothing until he arrives he went back to his document occasionally taking a note or striking a phrase brandt didnt keep them waiting long and as soon as hed come in and sat johnson adjusted his glasses and began to speak i want to thank you all for coming by youll notice that i have not asked the court recorder to join us this is because id like this meeting to be off the record does anyone have an objection to that no one did as all of you im sure realize this has been an acrimonious case from the outset ive spent the last hour and a half here at my desk thinking about what weve seen and heard about this minor andrew bartlett his attempted suicide and so on its led me to wonder if perhaps some of the earlier defense motions and strategies presented in this case might have antagonized the court to a degree that is incompatible with the interests of justice the fact of the matter is that ive been very angry and remain very angry at what ive taken to be deliberate manipulation of the court your honor thats all right ms wu im not accusing you of anything now im pretty well over it he took off his glasses and laid them on the desk in front of him mr hardy your representation in the courtroom this morning was as you pointed out compelling and highly relevant however as i tried to make clear about half a dozen times i wasnt going to allow this hearing and the reason for it to become bogged down in the question of mr bartletts innocence or guilt but now weve heard from all the defense witnesses and mr brandt i understand you wont be calling anyone thats correct your honor all right then for all practical purposes were finished with the sevenohseven all that remains is for me to render my decision which ive prepared and plan to deliver at the proper time for my own peace of mind and frankly to preserve the integrity of the court i wanted to share that tentative decision with all of you now before we go out on the record he replaced his glasses then and opened the document that was on the desk in front of him the court finds that the minor was seventeen years old at the time of the alleged offense and that the offense falls within welfare and institutions code b the court finds as follows the minor is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law he looked up noted hardys and wus looks of frustration and defeat went back to his text the court finds that the minor is not amenable to the care treatment and training programs available through the juvenile court based on the degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the minor for the following reasons the minor eluded a vigorous antiweapons campaign at his school for several months before the alleged incident and carried a loaded gun concealed on his person for the next several minutes johnson didnt look up as he read from the notes in his folder finding that andrew is amenable to the care treatment and training programs available through the juvenile court for the second third and fourth criteria and giving his reasons so wu had won three out of four hardy was thinking not that it mattered one whit for their client as to the fifth criterion johnson finally intoned the court finds that the minor is not amenable the minor is an unfit subject to be treated in the juvenile justice system the matter is referred to the district attorney for prosecution under the general law the matter shall be set for arraignment in the adult court when he finished he took a breath and removed his eyeglasses thats where we are he said i wanted all of you to understand my position on the law my reasoning and my ruling that will be the ruling of the court now he looked to each of the three lawyers in turn however in view of mr hardys representation and in the interest of justice and simple fairness im not going to issue this ruling today im going to take the matter under submission for one week during which time you mr brandt will discuss the matter with the district attorney and determine if he chooses to pursue the matter further and to what degree in the meanwhile since mr bartlett remains a minor until i formally declare him to be an adult i intend to release him from his detention into the care of his parents until next week when i deliver my ruling brandt having won the hearing on its merits only to have the victory snatched from him raised a hand and spoke your honor with respect you can still issue your ruling today the da will be reviewing the case as a matter of course and will but johnson stopped him youre forgetting the special circumstances counselor the minute i declare mr bartlett an adult he remains in confinement and that doesnt seem right to me theres no bail by statute in a special circumstances case if i say hes an adult today he goes downtown today and its my feeling that hes already been locked up too long if hes innocent one day is too long thank you your honor wu said but he turned on her too theres nothing to thank me for counselor he tapped the document on his desk this will be my ruling it goes into effect when i deliver it one week from today meanwhile your client doesnt leave the jurisdiction hes under his parents care and guidance the entire time there will be a number of strict conditions is that clear yes your honor of course of course johnson was clearly sick of the whole thing he looked at his watch and stood up if there are any more comments id prefer not to hear them my decision is my decision and its final now id like to go out and put it on the record jason brandt wasnt as disappointed as hed let on with johnsons decision on andrew bartlett in fact as he listened to dismas hardys representation to the court that morning hed realized that if even most of what his opposite number in the courtroom was saying proved to be true he could be prosecuting an innocent man and since it was all verifiable why would hardy lie then when the judge had ordered him to confer with the da on the further disposition of the case it removed any onus from him hed won the hearing on its merits and that was the task hed been assigned now that was over johnson had made his decision and anything he and amy wu might do outside of the courtroom would be irrelevant to the case technically he should possibly wait to see her until the ruling next wednesday but there was just no way he was going to do that not now hed take the risk and if one of his bosses didnt like his timing he had an answer that he knew would fly they hadnt started until after the ruling they would not be adversaries in the courtroom again but after theyd adjourned at the ygc hed had no opportunity to talk with her in the courtroom set up a time they could get together she hardy andrew and the norths had been celebrating quietly around the defense table and he had caught her eye for an instant a message or a promise then left by the back way hed called jackmans office and treya told him she could squeeze him in at a little after four oclock which meant he couldnt waste a moment so he didnt when brandt came in jackman stood came around his desk and shook his hand which brandt took as a sign of enhanced recognition and even of approval they sat on either end of the low settee in front of the coffee table jackman asked him what was so important and brandt gave it to him in under five minutes we can check this out pretty quick the da said in his quiet tone he stood again and went over to the door treya he said is there a chance you could get me in touch with your husband right away ill give it a try just transfer him to my line jackman came back into the office went back to his desk and the telephone rang once before he picked it up abe weve had a question come up here theres a young man in my office jason brandt whos been prosecuting the andrew bartlett case up at the ygc mike mooney and right thats right its hardys case too you are well the judge has postponed his ruling until he knows more im thinking you might be able to tell mr brandt what youve got and he can report back to me right on mooney too but all of it thanks jackman hung up you know where youre going yes sir then go in the improvised computer room next to his office a harried and exhausted glitsky was bringing brandt up to date between taking the reports of his people in the field and answering the questions of his workers the clock on the wall read i know hardy has already left me three messages about the slugs at mooneys but ive got other priorities at the moment we dont have any of those slugs we didnt find any the first time i dont think its likely well find them next time we look either but do you think personally that mooney was one of the executioners victims glitskys lips pursed you dont i dont know well start knowing im not saying we can prove it yet but its a dead lock as far as im concerned and bartlett i dont know from bartlett glitsky said wrong guy wrong place wrong time phones were ringing all over the office and somebody from outside in the reception area called in chief your line glitsky picked up the receiver then pulled a pad over and wrote furiously taking notes how many times he said whats the name anybody see him enough for a composite do they video the visitors down there glitskys mouth went tight yeah that sounds right okay keep checking he hung up raised his voice everybody listen up and the other noises in the room stopped that was darrel bracco down at corcoran lucas has got a son ray welding visited him in prison forty times in the last three years no address no listing braccos requested the phone calls from the pay phone at his fathers block and theyre going to fax it up direct sarah he turned to evans you pick three people i want every four one five four oh eight five one one six five oh all the telephone area codes for the bay areaevery one reversed for names and addresses this might be the guy this guy welding the dad brandt wanting to contribute couldnt stop himself and spoke to glitsky if he won an appeal he must have had a lawyer the lawyer would know the son wouldnt he where he lives he might glitsky said but he wont talk to us were the cops remember the bad guys but if the sons the executioner glitsky didnt answer because someone else told him to pick up the phone this time he listened without writing or saying much and by the time he put the phone down the room had hushed his head hung chin to chest he slowly fisted the table in a black fury everyone waited until he raised his head the last local juror he said wendy takahashi maiden name shui the one that just moved last month which was why they hadnt been able to locate her sooner shes already dead someone asked before we got there glitsky said maybe just before belous been standing outside her place since about two protecting a dead woman glitskys eyes opaque with fatigue and anger were glazed over brandt wandered out to the reception room stopped next to a uniformed officer what did he mean the last local juror the man studying a computer printout answered like a zombie there were six locals mooney reed thats cary montrose wong tollman and now shuitakahashi she was the last one the mention of mooney as the first executioner victim did not escape brandts notice what about the other six he asked four moved away two died were trying to find the four we figure the other two the dead ones are out of immediate danger wu got back to the sutter street office and after accepting congratulations from the small group gathered in hardys office excused herself to go and call brandt back at the ygc he wasnt in and she left a message that she wanted to see him with her work and home phone numbers maybe she said they could even have dinner later tonight start over and take things more slowly in the flush of confidence she was feeling after johnsons decision on andrew she allowed herself to believe that sometimes the right thing could happen in this world but brandt wasnt at his office shed have to wait a bit longer her in basket was filled to overflowing with work mail that shed neglected returned materials from word processing and her secretary on the top was the most recent draft of the notice rule memo she was writing for farrell billable work and she lifted it up from the pile kicked back from her desk put her feet up and began to read it over ten minutes later she was back in her working hunch red pen in hand scratching out and rewriting when somebody knocked at her door come in youre working hardy said thats what you pay me for whats up im going down to the hall see if i can find glitsky and get a word with him maybe get a commitment on some action with the mooney scene you want me to come with you actually i was going to suggest that you give yourself a break as managing partner i wanted you to know that ive declared today a clear win for the good guys and theyre not so common you want to ignore them ever david freeman lesson six so its your sacred duty to take the evening off and savor the victory david freeman never took time off not true every time he won he burned the city down wu glanced down at the draft on her desk let out a sigh i dont consider this over yet sir not till next wednesday if then its over hardy said jackman hears that the salarcos never heard a shot my guess is that even without scuffed slugs from mooneys hell never go forward andrews home tonight wu youve got to call that a win all right but it wasnt a win for me how do you figure that youre the one who found everything that made the difference i just made problems we shouldnt have had at the outset then made them worse as we went along hardy stood a minute in the doorway then took a step in and closed the door behind him look wu he said this was your first major case so you werent perfect nobody is the point is do you think you learned anything gradually she softened nodded her head in acknowledgment okay then your clients free your team just took the flag your boss is telling you to take the rest of the day off and youre splitting hairs about how we didnt really win and it wasnt really you and how it could have been better dont do that it could always be better but you ought to recognize when its good enough dont you think she sighed again glanced at her in box finally looked up and gave him a chagrined smile all right you can go back to punishing yourself tomorrow i wont stop you but tonight give yourself a break and get out of here hardy was right she thought you had to take these moments when you could it was a bit after five suddenly warm and still now after all the spring wind with an almost buttery softness to the air and the light she parked just off chestnut and decided to stroll along the avenue letting her senses dictate where shed stop what shed buy for a private celebration dinner at home shed open all the windows to let in some of the outside then sit alone at her table with her view of the bridge and some great bread and selections of the awesome takeout marina food and fresh flowers after shed curl up in her chair and read or put on some music or both and jason would call or he wouldnt but either way there would be tomorrow and if it was meant to be it would be it took her most of an hour dawdling along stopping in at half a dozen shops chatting with the merchants and even some of the other customers she bought daffodils and some fresh asiago cheese bread marinated artichoke hearts a spinach salad some potstickers an early pear the staircase up to her apartment was suffused with stillbright sunlight as she walked up when she got to the fourthfloor landing outside her door she stopped and took another moment to look down over the neighborhood then the view beyond the dark green cypresses in the presidio a hundred pleasure boats on the bay what a gorgeous place suddenly for perhaps the first time in her adult life she realized that she felt blessed and even lucky she put down the bag of food and flowers taking her keys from her purse she inserted the house key into the door picked up her groceries again and walked inside closing the door behind her she threw the deadbolt and set the chain lock behind her a male voice said turn around slowly and move away from the door the afterwork crowd at the balboa cafe wasnt quite as thick as the afterdinner mob but jason brandt still felt fortunate to get a seat at the bar he laid a twentydollar bill down and ordered a beer a beer cecil held up a bottle of jack daniels i see you walk in the door my hand automatically goes to the jd double rocks not today brandt said beer what kind of beer wet and cold im looking for amy wu she been in not yet he started pulling a sierra nevada from the tap on the bar come to think of it i havent seen her in a while since she went out of here with you if i remember you think shes all right yeah i was with her in court today shes fine she is fine you seeing her no weve been in trial together opposite sides its against the rules shame cecil said yeah brandt brought the beer to his lips drank off an inch cecil moved down the bar served some customers changed the channel on the television set when he came back brandt was staring into his beer turning it around and around on the bar in front of him you all right cecil asked yeah great you dont look great you look unhappy its wu brandt said i think im kind of in love with her you say that like it just occurred to you it did are you still in trial i dont think so not after today well if youre in love bro you better make a move or somebody else will snag that babe first for sure i wouldnt be sitting my poor ass on a stool waiting for her to come in here id go find her where she is stake my claim his glass halfway to his mouth brandt stopped and lowered it back down to the bar then he was up off the stool and moving hey your change keep it he was sitting in her reading chair having moved out from behind the changing screen where hed been waiting when she came in he held a gun on her a gun with a long and very heavylooking tube attached to the barrel she sat at her table hands in her lap the grocery bag remained on the floor by the door shed locked how did you know where i live howd you get in here his laugh was guttural humorless ive gotten real good at finding people and getting in is the same as it was when i was a kid the point is that im here what do you want i want to finish my work and whats that your work i believe you legal types would call it redress of grievances then it cant have anything to do with me i havent done anything to you no thats true not to me personally in your case maybe its more that i want to keep you from doing more harm than what i havent done anybody any harm amy amy amy please i hope you dont really feel that what about andrew bartlett what about him he got out of detention today did you know that how is that harming him are you forgetting his attempted suicide already did it really make that little of an impression on you you dont call that harm but i didnt he slapped his free hand down on the arm of the chair bared his teeth in a snarl the fuck you didnt dont you think he did that because you made him believe hed never get out but no you dont think that way do you nothings really your fault is it no thats not true some things are completely my fault please dont point that thing im sorry she said whatever it is i didnt mean you dont understand what im saying i dont care what you mean what you meant you play the same game they all played with my father dont you see that youre just like allan boscacci was twenty years ago arrogant selfrighteous pigheaded and wrong he lifted the gun again dont you move i wasnt i was just he kept his arm extended the gun with its silencer pointed directly at her chest i dont care i say something you dont deny it if i say dont move you dont move im sorry i wont anymore i promise but im nervous ive got to pee so pee she started to stand but he barked again came halfway out of the chair with the gun trained on her sit down but you just said i said you can pee i didnt say anything about going anywhere she stared across at him squeezed her legs together what do i have to do with allan boscacci anything to keep him talking to buy time even a few precious seconds more youre just like him you said that but how you really ask how as if you dont know all right ill tell you how he sat back in the chair rested the gun on his knee i saw you that first day with bartlett so sure he was guilty ready to send him away for half his life no concern at all for the truth for what might be right just like boscacci did with my father sent him up for life when he didnt do it your father thats right my father didnt do what rape and kill my mother thats what she clutched her hands together against her stomach im sorry but i really dont know what youre talking about im talking about my father goddamn it my father again hed come forward lifted the gun he held it on her for five seconds ten again he collapsed back my father he said his voice now going to dead calm what about him i dont know about your father lucas welding his name was lucas welding all right she said please tell me about him jason brandt got to the landing and thought he heard voices upstairs he stopped and listened almost turned around and went back down but then decided since hed come this far hed just say he was in the neighborhood and thought hed stop by and see if she wanted to go out for a drink or maybe meet him later at the balboa surely that was harmless enough or if whoever was with her turned out to be just a friend or a neighbor shed invite him in theyd finish their conversation then shed tell the friend goodbye after that the two of them could let the night take them where it would when he got to the door he paused a moment and listened yes two voices one male and one female when he knocked three quick raps the voices stopped abruptly within he waited through a lengthening silence perplexity growing on this face then all at once the truth of what he must have been hearing dawned on him he blinked a few times nodded bit at his lower lip he wasnt aware of it but his shoulders fell what a fool he was he turned back toward the steps then heard her voice through the door behind him who is it for a second he considered not answering getting to the stairs and out of sight before he brought any more embarrassment to himself but she had asked him to believe her believe in the kind of person she was at least he thought he owed her that to give her a chance to be straight with him amy its me jason jason he thought he heard a kind of relief in her voice but it disappeared with her next words this isnt a good time im sorry are you all right fine im fine but really its not a good time okay but if i could just jason go away leave me the fuck alone all right get out of here now or youre in trouble i mean it good he said that was all right nobody stays around after that no hes a jerk she said turning around well you know that but please could i go to the bathroom brandt stood below in the gathering dusk looking up at her window her outburst against him had punched him in the gut even now frozen in his spot leaning against the wall of a building across the street he held his hand there he couldnt seem to make himself move he stared up at the window saw no shadows no sign of movement maybe they were lying together in her bed that thought came like another kick to his stomach but suddenly all at once he couldnt accept it that wasnt what was happening up there and his certainty wasnt a matter of rational thought it was on another level a bonedeep conviction she was up there with somebody yes but even if she was being romantic with another man there was no way she would have gone off on him that way beyond the connection he felt that theyd established that wasnt who she was she wouldnt have treated him like that not now it made no sense and then suddenly her words came back at him youre in trouble that private powerful ambiguous code word between them and now amy had screamed it at him through her locked door youre in trouble a little out of place even in that context offkey a warning or a cry for help christ he thought what an idiot shes just dumping me let it go but he was already crossing the street going back up boscacci was so sure he said all the jurors were so sure they polled them one by one afterward you know every one of them hed followed her into the bathroom stood in the doorway while shed gone walked her back to her chair and now was finishing his story im so sorry she said i didnt know that yeah well heres something else you dont know you dont know what its like having your home taken away from you when youre seven years old you dont know what its like when your moms murdered and they blame your father for it and then try him and take him away and put you in foster care do you know what thats like no i dont wu said im so sorry and she was but mostly she was afraid that she was going to die and thought maybe she could get him to spare her it must have been terrible for you terrible doesnt begin to cover it and taking away my own name talking me into taking my moms maiden name i didnt want to have people knowing im the son of that murderer did i wouldnt i be happier with a different name dont you understand they took away my life im sure they didnt mean to do that i mean boscacci and the jury i hope they all rot in hell he suddenly jerked and was back to the present thirteen of them every one of them so certain and every one of them so completely dead wrong he found something to laugh at and now more than half of them just completely dead she felt a wave of chill break over her what do you mean what do i mean i mean i killed them you havent figured that out yet all of them still living around here anyway in beautiful san francisco and vicinity when it came to her the blood ran from her face youre the executioner good he said why do you think i got onto you in the first place i dont know you dont really all right then ill tell you because there you were miss professional lawyer who doesnt believe in seeing people you work with there you were andrews defense lawyer the only person in the lousy system whos supposed to be working for him and youre talking about pleading him guilty and sending him away for eight years and im watching you in court and listening to what youre telling him and i see its going on and on and will always go on with you since youre just like them all like all of them have always been he raised the gun and she thought he might shoot her now but he lowered the weapon then swallowed went on and it was so funny to me you see because i knew he didnt do it and you know why i knew that because i did you killed mooney he nodded and his whining little girlfriend and while were at it i should maybe call your partner after ive gone and thank him for letting me know how close they were to finding me this morning i wasnt planning to do more of my work today until i heard what he said in court and realized i really had to hurry though i would have been gone anyway soon enough where to she asked he gave her a ghastly empty smile on the road but first he said theres you please she said please dont put the gun down dont make me use it then i dont like sitting with a corpse they stink so you stay sitting there and shut up all right i will she said i wont move what do you want me to do nothing he said i want it to get dark again that emptyeyed smile its so much easier to walk away when its dark brandt crept away from amys door and descended from the fourth down to the second landing which he figured was the closest spot where he couldnt be heard from above he took out his cellphone and turned it on and couldnt get a signal in the stairwell his breath coming in ragged gasps he broke out of the building onto the sidewalk got his signal and punched in the number for police dispatch which like all assistant das he knew by heart he didnt want nine one one somebody getting it wrong and showing up with lights and sirens this is jason brandt patch me through to deputy chief glitsky please at the hall of justice yes its an emergency tell him ive found the executioner the sun kissed the tops of the cypresses next the roofs of some of the low buildings and then suddenly full dusk had fallen there were no shadows anymore no reflection of the setting sun in the windows of amys place across the street the sky in the east had gone from turquoise to a deep indigo behind brandt at the western horizon a garish orange sunset was fading to a purplish yellow bruise but no glitsky four patrol cars had arrived silently then three more then brandt had lost count all of the police cars had parked invisibly somewhere in the surrounding streets and dispatched their occupants out to encircle amys place and evacuate anyone inside who lived on the floors below her and even people in the surrounding buildings brandt showed his badge to sergeant ariola the initial ranking officer at the scene and identified himself as the person whod called the police but that cut him no slack with ariola who shunted brandt with an escort back behind the police line he could still see wus windows but now he was around the corner on cervantes boulevard looking behind him and down the other streets he realized that the entire block had been cordoned off squad cars parked perpendicular to the curbs in the middle of the streets stopping any automobile traffic teams of cops were keeping pedestrians out of the area although now small crowds of the curious had begun to gather at the perimeter next bad to worse the tv news vans were arriving the very scenario brandt had tried to avoid by calling glitsky direct if the tv happened to be turned on in amys apartment and they broke the story as latebreaking news there was no telling what would happen inside but it could not be good next brandt watched with some admixture of dread and disbelief as the motor home command post of the tactical unit pulled up he saw ariola moving toward it and again tried his das badge trick with one of the uniformed cops who this time let him through with barely a glance he stood right behind ariola as he reported the situation to the tac unit commander and neither of those men paid him the slightest heed either the whole tac unit wasnt here yet it usually took forty minutes to an hour for all the members to check in but the sharpshooter had been one of the first to arrive and the commander sent him up to the roof of the building directly across the street from amys to see what if anything he could do brandt heard the order if you get a clear shot and hes got a gun on her take it then motioning to the tv vans he turned to ariola inform those jackals that if anyone runs a live feed ill hunt them down and kill them and their children in the crush of events brandts presence continued to go unnoticed ariola went to talk to the newspeople while the commander ran across the street and disappeared into amys building every minute or so another policemen in a black tac unit jacket would show up and report to the deputy commander at the door to the motor home at some point any normal measure of time had long since become meaningless ariola reappeared next to brandt and they both watched as the commander came out of the lobby looked up into the sky and jogged back over to where they stood he spoke to his deputy i dont see how we can wait much longer i dont either the chief ordered me to wait for him if we bust in we could lose her although i dont know what else hes got in mind again the commander glanced at the rapidly darkening sky shaking his head he sighed with exasperation looked up again five minutes he said and its dark weve got to go in hed been sitting the whole time holding the gun with its awkward attachment the silencer resting on the arm of the chair his finger continually unconsciously teased the trigger as he flipped one by one casually relaxed through the pages of the various magazines wu kept next to her reading chair she became nearly hypnotized with fear watching it once she shifted her weight in her chair at the table and it was as though shed prodded him with electricity so quickly did he have the gun raised all focus and menace dont move then satisfied that she wouldnt he sat back crossed one leg comfortably over the other and began turning pages again wu didnt know what she could do to save herself and so sat in a numbed state of panic and resignation shed already considered what she thought were her only options in his chair he was probably close to ten feet away from her farther than she could leap in a quick rush the front door was still deadlocked and chained the bathroom the only place she might conceivably escape to was all the way at the back corner of the large otherwise open room she thought that when the time came if indeed he gave her any warning at all she would bolt and try to throw something the saltshaker the chair she sat on but she realized from his demeanor throughout this excruciating wait that he was just as likely to lick his finger turn a page check the window as hed done a dozen times decide it was sufficiently dark lift the gun without a word or warning and shoot her then unlock the door and walk downstairs and out into the sheltering night unable to bear watching his twitching finger any longer she closed her eyes trying to find some place of inner peace but found there was nowhere she could go this was the end of her life and all she could feel was the coming void opening her eyes again she watched him flip a page glance at her as though she were a piece of furniture look back down at his magazine turn his head to the window flip another page the small hole in the barrel of the silencer the finger dancing over the trigger guard had so dominated her consciousness that she hadnt looked at the window herself in what must have been minutes but now she did and realized that the night had truly come on she was looking at her own reflection now in the glass as though in a mirror there was no more light from outside to dissipate the image he would not wait much longer knock knock knock the sound startled them both wu gave a little involuntary yelp and he jumped where he sat the chair legs giving a little screech on the hardwood floor at the same time the magazine slipped and fell out of his lap after all the silence in the room the two sounds the knock and the dropped magazine seemed to amy to echo like thunder she shot a startled glance at him he lifted the gun his arm outstretched centered on her heart the gun never left her his eyes went to the door back to her the initial moment of panic passed she felt she could see him plotting what he would do with the inadvertent noises from inside there was no way to pretend that no one was home quickly he pointed the gun at the door then back to her and nodded who is it amy its me diz we had a meeting she turned to him mouthed my boss something like a smile curled the corner of his mouth all the better he nodded the message was let him in he got to his feet just a second she said in a few steps agile as a cat suddenly hed come around the table and pressed himself against the wall by the door he moved the gun up and now held it on her head one foot from her head wu read his intentions with crystal clarity when she opened the door it would block him from sight until hardy was inside and then he would shoot and then both of them would die she couldnt let that happen what was he doing here they hadnt planned any meeting she undid the chain fumbling with it her hands shaking if she threw the door back quickly could she disable him she looked down for an instant saw that hed planted his foot to prevent that the door could open only enough to let hardy in nothing more and meanwhile he could fire at will if she let him in hardy would die too she couldnt be responsible for that if she was going to die anyway maybe at least she could warn him first her thoughts tumbling over one another she watched as though from a distance as her hands turned the dead bolt went to the knob turned it dropping her hand resigned now to the gun there at her ear she heard herself saying i dont feel well you have to go diz we need to talk he said face to face its urgent hardy knew shed undone the chain hed heard her throw the dead bolt watched the doorknob turn and heard the little click the door was unlocked he guessed she was stalling for time but there was no more time he grabbed the knob turned lowered his shoulder and exploded into the crack where hed opened the door hitting her with a tackle at the waist taking her down with him before theyd even hit the floor the four tac unit specialists whod crammed into the landing behind hardy crashed in through the opening with their guns drawn splintering the door completely off its hinges there were another four behind them and then yet another team rushing unstoppable as a flash flood into the apartment the force of the door flying back knocked the gun from his grip and somersaulted him back over the table and onto the floor crashing against the counter where wu kept her dishes and cooking supplies for an instant he lay stunned on the floor amid the splintered wood and broken glass but in the halfsecond before anyone could reach him emitting an animal cry he made a last desperate scramble and lunge for his weapon but he never made it as the first pair of tac unit specialists reached and fell upon him writhing and screaming a runover animal whose back had been broken he grunted and kicked and gouged and spewed his vile rage until theyd gotten his hands behind his back and cuffed him now facedown in his own blood and spreadeagled with a tac guy on each leg and another kneeling on his back he couldnt move a muscle glitsky was standing in the doorway his own gun drawn but now held down at his side he could see that his plan well his and hardys had worked and theyd managed to pull it off without anyone having to die their backs against the wall hardy sat next to wu on the floor a protective arm around her wus head was down her shoulders heaving a little as she cried out some of the tension fine glitsky walked over to where his troops had the suspect in righteous custody and looked down at the now pathetic and restrained figure of the executioner theyd only discovered his name in the minutes before brandt had called to say he knew where they could find him the youth guidance center bailiff ray cottrell the tac unit police had wasted no time getting cottrell up and taking him away and now the room fairly buzzed with the spent energy and the detritus of chaos in the destroyed half of the apartment wu hardy and glitsky went to almost robotic wordless motion getting the shattered door to one side and leaning it up against the wall setting the table back on its legs righting the chairs two of them still unbroken picking up the larger pieces of plates and pottery at last wu sat heavily in one of the chairs hardy took the other glitsky crossed to the dish counter and filled a glass of water from the tap he went over to the table and handed it to wu then went back to the counter cleared a spot and sat on it how did he get here he asked i dont know i had no idea he knew where i lived but what did he want with you you were what twelve years old during his fathers trial you had nothing to do with it did you seeming to notice the glass in her hand for the first time wu drank off half the water she dropped her head and appeared to gather herself for another minute finally she began to tell them what cottrell had said he had wanted with her as best she could explain it her connection to the system that had mistakenly and tragically convicted his father no more than that she said it wasnt just that i was another lawyer he saw me as exactly like allan boscacci had been when hed prosecuted his innocent dad and sent his dad up i was doing the same thing to andrew bartlett bartering away years of his life when ray knew andrew was innocent she was coming out of her state of shock and seemed suddenly to realize the import of what hed told her because he was the one whod done what andrew had been arrested for dont you see he killed mooney and laura wed pretty much gotten to that ourselves glitsky said she raised her voice a notch but he told me he did it he actually told me he called mooney by name she turned to hardy thats important she said urgency bleeding out of her it makes a difference i know he put a hand over hers at the table i dont think abes missing it glitsky nodded well get his statement then see where we are he said but unofficially i dont think you need to worry itll all come out at least enough to clear andrew hardy said lets hope wu let out a heavy breath but how did you know id open the door she asked i almost didnt i didnt know that for sure hardy said that was plan a plan b was the door comes down anyway about five seconds later abe and i both thought it was worth a try to get you out of the way first they heard noises from out on the landing footfalls and voices on the stairs im going to want a more complete statement from you tomorrow glitsky said but we can let that go tonight his eyes went to the shattered door leaning up against the wall the empty door frame with its hanging hinges are you going to need a place to stay she can come to my place hardy said turning to her if youre good with that same spacious quarters and comfortable bed same night chef she asked it might be arranged at that moment jason brandt broke from the ranks of police that were accompanying him up the stairs and stopped in the open door frame jesus he exclaimed at all the damage then seeing her at the table he closed his eyes and blew out heavily in relief hardy and glitsky might as well not have been there amy are you all right her face lit up jason what are you doing here whats he doing here hardy asked hes the hero thats all brandt shook his head in embarrassed denial spoke to hardy no from what i hear youre the hero i just hardy cut him off you just figured it all out and called chief glitsky here and got us moving thats all without which none of this happens wu was staring at brandt but i told you to get away jason to get out of here i know he shrugged i snuck back up and listened at the door but why how did you know because i know you amy he said you wouldnt have just sent me off not that way no matter what thats not who you are lanier and ariola appeared from the steps on the landing behind brandt hardy turned back to wu and saw that her eyes had brimmed brandt stepped into the room out of the cops way he hesitated then came over behind amy at the table he put a hand on her shoulder and wu put her hand over his in the door frame ariola said if were sealing this place up were going to want to get to it pretty soon chief all right glitsky said he motioned to the civilians when theyre ready to go down lets get that done lanier spoke up also just a heads up abe but theres some people waiting for you downstairs he said cameras glitskys face went dark he took in the scene here one last time said swell and pushed through to the landing out in the street at the impromptu press conference glitsky stood in a circle of halogen and uniforms and spoke into a hastily assembled cluster of microphones as usual at this type of event he found himself on the defensive well he said assuming that our sharpshooter could not take him out which was always a viable option there were really two main objections to simply calling him up on the telephone or using a bullhorn to tell him he was surrounded the first was that we knew that hed already killed seven people at close range and in cold blood after some serious discussion downtown we decided whos we chief myself homicide lieutenant marcel lanier and dismas hardy the lawyer a womans voice whats a lawyer doing making police decisions mr hardy didnt make the decision claudia he had some detailed knowledge of the situation and it proved useful in any event getting back to the original question in view of mr cottrells behavior in the past few weeks if we announced our presence we thought it extremely likely that he would simply kill the hostage and then himself the second objection was that we thought we had a better plan but one that exposed civilian lives to danger isnt that true thats true but it was only one civilian and mr hardy volunteered and his involvement was crucial ms wu is his business associate and friend and lets not forget if you dont mind glitsky said forcing himself the operation was a success another disembodied voice from out in the darkness yes but how sure are you that ray cottrell is in fact the executioner close to a hundred percent he confessed as much to ms wu but now that hes in custody youll be hearing lots more about that im sure i understand he was an abused child who grew up in a succession of foster homes is that a question glitsky asked if so i have no comment chief what part of your decision not to use your sniper in this instance comes from the tragic results of the leshawn brodie situation well first that leshawn brodie decision wasnt made by me or anybody else in this jurisdiction second as i thought id already made clear mr ralston we never made the decision not to use our sharpshooter in this case and in fact that option was on the table throughout the course of the operation if the opportunity presented itself which it didnt in other words you approved the order to have cottrell shot out of hand but by the same token you elected not to give him a chance to surrender by letting him know that his options had run out and he was surrounded glitsky brought one hand to his side and pushed in against the spasm there he raised his other hand up against the bright lights trying not to look too menacing and to possibly even look cooperative and friendly and failing abysmally he glared out into the invisible circle in front of him as i believe ive already explained on the wednesday of that week at a little before one oclock in the afternoon wu walked up the hall from her office and turned right toward hardys passing directly behind phylliss workstation the elderly receptionist obviously had eyes in the back of her head because as wu came abreast of her she whirled in her ergonomic chair and actually held a hand up hes busy and doesnt want to be disturbed did you make an appointment wu stopped forced a polite smile i just opened my mail she said holding up a yellowish manila envelope and hell want to see this i promise thats what everyone says all of you associates believe hell want to see you which of course he does he and i have discussed this hes happy to make time for the associates but hed really prefer that those times are convenient to him not necessarily to them phyllis possibly actually thought she was softening the message with her schoolteacher smile im sorry she said as one of the phones in her bank rang behind her and she whirled around again to get it wu didnt hesitate for a moment but broke right as quietly as she could got to hardys door and knocked ms wu from behind her as from the other side of the door she heard yo and got herself inside her boss coat off tie loosened was rummaging through the drawers of his desk he greeted her arrival with a smile that seemed more or less welcoming behind the more obvious fluster of his demeanor how did you he began and was interrupted by the sharp buzz of his intercom he reached over pushed the button and said yo again this time into the speaker he knew that of all the things hated by phyllis and in his experience this included nearly all forms of human interaction his cavalier telephone greeting ranked near the top he winked at wu during the short distinctive pause while phyllis bit back her natural reprimand mr hardy i told ms wu you werent to be disturbed and she went ahead i can see that and i assure you that im already disturbed phyllis its not your fault i intend to have a word with her right away thank you he left his speaker on for a second or so while he began in a firm voice ms wu when i tell phyllis i dont want to be disturbed i expect you and all the associates to then he pushed the button breaking the connection charging the door isnt very subtle wu i need that woman believe it or not shes very good at what she does none better maybe but shes not very nice shes not supposed to be if she were nice people would walk all over her as it is some of your colleagues are afraid to go to the bathroom if they have to pass her station so they stay at their desks working all day this is good for the firm wu allowed a smile you really are becoming more and more like mr freeman hardy inclined his head an inch ill take that as a compliment of the highest order have you seen my darts your darts when would i have seen your darts i dont know but they were here yesterday or the day before and now ive mislaid them second time in two months i think im losing my mind maybe youre just saving it for bigger things hardy stopped his rummaging through his drawers slammed the latest one closed unfortunately theres not much sign of that either scanning the room one last time for obvious places where he might have left them he finally gave up and sat down in the big leather chair behind his desk so whats important enough to risk the wrath of phyllis she held up the envelope this is very cool what is it she handed it to him and he pulled out the pages dear ms wu ive been meaning to write to thank you and mr hardy for all that you did for me but i had so much work to make up at school i never got the time as i think you might have heard from my mom sutro took me back some combination of hals money and mr wagner making me sign a paper promising that i wouldnt bring a loaded gun to school again oh okay or what i get expelled forgetting that we dont own a gun anymore and as if that would stop me if i decided to but dont worry i agree that its a bad idea the other reason i havent had time is that ive been doing some more writing i started almost the day i got out totally different stuff than perfect killer working with the narrative voice wondering if maybe it wouldnt hurt to have it be accessible even friendly anyway maybe im getting somewhere since just today i heard back from mcsweeneys they say they want to publish my latest story i thought youd be glad to hear about that and maybe also to hear that im so glad i didnt die when i tried to kill myself so glad you know the famous line from anna karenina happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way well my time in my own unhappy family is getting to the end and maybe when i get to going out and making one of my own i can form it a little differently the story mcsweeneys is taking imagines a guy from a happier family way later on i hope you like it just remember one thing though would you i made it all up brandt and wu were at a table in the restaurant at the back of the balboa cafe the waiter had brought their drinks but both of them remained untouched when brandt finished reading andrews letter he handed it gingerly back to wu it was a long minute before he said anything i dont like to think that i was trying to send him to prison for the rest of his life he paused again ive never had a defendant be innocent before you know that it gives one pause you wonder if youve sent up somebody who shouldnt be there he thought about it for a few seconds not really no i dont think so i mean bartlett was unusual at least i hope he was but i dont know for sure to tell you the truth im sure allan boscacci thought whats his name welding was guilty in a funny way he said it almost makes me feel better about the system i mean andrew bartlett got off with me and johnson both trying to bring him down sometimes it works hardy and glitsky hadnt seen much of each other for six weeks in the aftermath of the executioner arrest and in spite of its successful conclusion the media couldnt seem to warm to glitskys politically incorrect style the many published and broadcasted comparisons with his role in the leshawn brodie debacle combined with his alleged insensitivity not only to the legal but to the basic human rights of suspects especially those that came from backgrounds riddled with abuse prompted several public and private calls for his resignation other advocacy groups demanded investigations into the police departments decisionmaking procedures and called for the formation of various committees to oversee and secondguess the command structure how had it taken the police so long nearly twenty hours to crib together the clues linking lucas welding with his son and his current identity why even working with the luxury of an event number had no one in the police department been able to discover sooner that the executioners victims had all been on the same jury surely the records on these things should be more accessible how had it taken so long to locate the address of the last victim wendy takahashi better police work quicker and more informed decisionmaking would almost certainly have saved her life how in the world had glitsky seen fit to allow an unelected civilian to take part in a command decision involving the citys highly skilled and specialized tac unit and on and on and on fortunately batiste lanier jackman and the mayor himself in a rare and somewhat surprising display of unanimity had all closed ranks around glitsky shouldering their portions of the blame if in fact there had been any eventually inevitably the immediate outcry had died down although glitsky knew and hoped that his days as deputy chief were probably numbered he couldnt say it broke his heart hed even spoken to lanier and batiste about the possibility of becoming an inspector at large where he could float between the investigations of different details without being burdened by an administrative portfolio he wasnt a politician and everybody knew it so why not let him work where he could do some good instead of where with the best of intentions a great work ethic and even a record of success he caused nothing but headaches for the department for his part hardy had spent most of his time bringing his associates and partners up to speed on the workload surrounding what he called his influence clients hed lost his taste for facilitating what he liked best and did best was trials another of his associates graham russo had asked him if hed consider another shot at second chair in a local potential death penalty murder case that would need an incredibly strong psychiatric defense to prevail russo was planning to argue some variety of mental illness to save his clients life and in truth hardy had known golden retrievers with more brains than their client who reminded him of lenny in of mice and mentell me about the rabbits george the client had done some terrible things it was true but hardy didnt believe the state should execute him but whatever the outcome it was going to be a complex and interesting case huge issues he just wanted to be part of it hed spent the better portion of the rest of his time at his own expense boning up on immigration law there was already an enormous market there and in california it was only going to grow and using the salarcos as his guinea pigs hed secured the sponsorship of several of juans gardening customers all of whom lived in comparative splendor and though it was early in the game he held out some hope that the salarcos could avoid some of the bureaucracy and despair of the longdrawnout citizenship process today though sunday the first day of june hardy and glitsky sat seven rows behind home plate at pacbell park they both wore their giants caps against the bright sunshine had removed their jackets bonds had dumped one into mccovey cove and they figured theyd gotten their moneys worth already although in truth the seats had been free courtesy of one of hardys clients with season tickets hardy popped a peanut chased it with a slug of beer your gallbladder thats the latest they want to take it out glitsky sipped his coke i told them no why not glitsky shrugged ive had enough metal in my guts over the past few years to last me a while im not letting them cut me three more times which is how they do it nowadays my doc even said kind of goofing yeah its like being stabbed in the gut in fact it is being stabbed in the gut guys a laugh riot yeah but if thats whats causing the pain its on the other side what is the pain its on the other side from my gallbladder its called referred pain they say its fairly common you get a whack on the toe and feel it in your arm oh yeah hardy said that happens to me all the time glitsky threw him a look me neither its why im a little skeptical about the diagnosis plus what ive got its not really pain i mean like sharp pain its more a flutter maybe its your heart again glitsky shook his head nope i know what that feels like and its not that so if you dont let them take the gallbladder out what are you going to do live with it its been a year already and it hasnt killed me yet treyas convinced its all stress and shes not dumb during all that madness after we got cottrell it got pretty unbelievable a knife in here all the time since then its seems to be getting better ive got a theory i hope its not relativity hardy said thats already been taken you remember when i got the event number for boscacci we were going to do the biggest manhunt in history okay so with all that effort and personnel we pretty much came up with nothing not to swell your already large head but if you hadnt talked to mooneys wife wed never have got him maybe maybe but the point is nobodys ever going to check go back to it find anything he leaned in and lowered his voice im talking about us nobodys looking for us nobodys going to be looking for us ever i dont have to worry every single damn day that somebodys going to find out and my lifes going to implode hardy noted the expletive with surprise glitsky never swore he put a hand on his friends arm for a second nobodys looking abe really he squeezed the arm let it go he said lifes too short i guess its just i know that if i were back running homicide id still be looking hardy had to grin thats what makes you such a joy to know but let me ask you this are your guts fluttering right now glitsky sat back into his seat concentrated a minute shook his head no lets call that a win then and move on acknowledgments first my deepest gratitude
