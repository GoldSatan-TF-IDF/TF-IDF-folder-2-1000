the untouchable gerald seymour prologue i think i can live with that yes it was henry arbuthnot thought a moment of almost classical symbolism not that dubbs would have noticed and certainly not albert william packer the words marked the transfer of power yes dont have a difficulty with what youre suggesting youll not find a problem with me the man sidled out of the room they heard his footsteps scramble down the steep staircase the door on to the street slammed shut and there was the noise of a powerful car accelerating away then the quiet that was broken only by the rumble of the machines spinning in the launderette below it was a fine afternoon in early winter and the windows of the firstfloor room were open the launderette was always busy on a friday and the motion of the machines shook the room above making the dust from the files and the leatherbound books dance in the light the room was seldom cleaned arbuthnot rarely used a vacuum cleaner and he would never have allowed casual staff into his office three men had come that day to visit the premises rented by henry arbuthnot solicitor at law he had expected a fourth visitor until he had noticed the cuffs of albert william packers shirt where they peeped out from under his jacket sleeves there was blood on them still rich red not yet darkened with age it was fresh and the fourth visitor was conspicuous by his absence three men had come and had pledged that their commercial activities would in no way impinge on the business dealings of his employer the transference of such power the granting by rivals of control of the capital city should have been celebrated with a good bottle of veuve clicquot but that would have offended his employer dubbs swung his shoes off the table and grinned then slapped the employers back arbuthnot offered a pudgy hand that was held squeezed and dropped there was no triumphalism flanked by his accountant and his solicitor packer had listened as three men shuffling and mumbling had acknowledged his superiority good as gold werent they dubbss little voice trilled in the shadowed office well thats it isnt it we run london we got there we got to the top of the tree i do the money he does the law and keeps us clean and you do what you do best keep the business flowing a day to remember and that was it that was the end of the moment of victory a short heavily built floridfaced balding man arbuthnot three days short of his fortyfirst birthday took the opportunity to reflect that he was now the legal representative of a man who exercised supreme power with chilling ruthlessness not that day but in a week or a fortnight he would find the opportunity to raise the question of increased remuneration with his employer he thought he was now worth a minimum of a fifty per cent hike cheap at the price his job for nearly twenty years had been to keep that employers liberty intact and he had no doubt that he had the skills to accomplish the same role in the future but then the stakes would be higher he rubbed his hands together and smiled wanly he knew what he should say but it would be a cold douse for the others and he hesitated he looked at dubbs couldnt stand the little bastard his mind raced he thought dubbs a chimpanzee with a fresh banana dubbss grin split his narrow lips but just as an employer of status needed a legal adviser so he needed a totally trustworthy man to mind his assets and they were considerable dubbs was short slight sallow and neat and his hair probably dyed fell lank on his forehead he smelt of a pungent body lotion he wouldnt have invited dubbs common little creature across the threshold of his home however acute the need but as he was brilliant in his understanding of the law so dubbs was expert in his manipulation of money they were both the solicitor and the accountant of equal importance to their employer and though their dislike of each other was mutual it was hidden suppressed his glance roved on until it rested on the face of his employer albert william packers appearance was ordinary his was of medium height and medium build his hair was carefully cut his hands were neither heavy nor lightweight his clothes were arbuthnot looked away his employer did not like to be stared at and always focused his eyes on the target who watched him a cobras eyes arbuthnot thought if he had ever been asked and he sincerely hoped he never would be to help in the creation of a photofit image of packer he would have concentrated on the eyes as the only distinguishing feature of the man the brutality that had taken his employer to the top of the heap was in those eyes they never ceased to frighten him what id like to say before you both leave crime squad and the church theyll hear soon enough about the new order of things i would urge a period of consolidation nothing flash too soon build on what we have then expand sort of one step at a time great caution should be exercised arbuthnot looked at the mouth not the eyes because from today they will chuck at you every resource they can muster you are now their target one dubbs giggled but packer was silent merely gave a wintry little smile the meeting was concluded arbuthnot escorted them to the street watched as they checked for tails went through the basic but thorough countersurveillance drills and they were gone dubbs turning right on the pavement packer going left slowly because they were steep and the carpet was threadbare and loose arbuthnot mounted the stairs he was trembling and his knees were weak it took him an age to get back to his office his client was now the king of the capitals criminal world and he felt its implications keenly he had made a pact with the devil he was faust when would the devil come for him he had sold his soul for wealth back in his office he used a grubby handkerchief to wipe off the table the smears from the heels of dubbss shoes and then he moved back the chair that packer had used lifted it from behind the desk to its usual place against a bank of shelves that bent under the weight of legal texts there was a knock at the door and his clerk brought in a tray to clear away the coffee cups and the water jug left him the evening newspaper and backed out respectfully he had attached himself voluntarily to serious money he picked up the newspaper margaret thatcher had left downing street that day the iron lady was gone with a tear in her eye usurped in a palace coup vicious but bloodless he turned the pages that transference of power was of secondary importance to the one that had been played out in his small office he found the news item a man from southeast london had been discovered in the early hours of the morning in epping forest his legs had been severed by what police believed to have been a chainsaw death was due to shock and blood loss a scotland yard spokesman had said and added that the murder was assumed to have been a further atrocity in the capitals current gangland turf war he put the newspaper in his brimming wastepaper bin in his mind he recited the stars move still time runs the clock will strike the devil will come and faustus must be damned not today not tomorrow old cocker not ever he was entwined with albert william packer packer was a clever bastard the top man packer would look after him of course he would the light was slipping the room seemed darker chapter one when dawn came the body was snagged in the branches of a tree not that it was easily recognizable as a corpse in spite of the foreigners alternate pleading threatening and throwing money at the citys municipal authorities refuse collection had again broken down in many of the streets back from the river rubbish was piled high outside business premises and at the doors of the old apartment blocks the residents of the blocks facing the river not believing that the dispute between the foreigners who nominally ran the citys affairs and local officials was about to be settled had taken to heaving their plastic bags into the water the body was wedged between two plastic bags and was disguised the tree holding it fast was marooned on a spit of gravel halfway between two of the bridges straddling the river one bridge was overlooked by the scaffolded and screened building where the national library of historic documents without price had been housed before being hit by incendiary shells and the second bridge marked the position taken by gavrilo princep eightyseven years earlier in the moments before he had raised a handgun and fired the bullets that killed an archduke and an archduchess and condemned europe to a conflagration of a scale unknown before the roads running either side of the miljacka river the obala kulina bana on the north side and the obala isabega isakovica on the south side were already jammed with cars vans lorries and the foreigners military jeeps and trucks no driver had time to waste peering down into the river to notice the tree pedestrians crowded the bridges smoking and hurrying gossiping and continuing last nights arguments and none of them young or elderly paused to stop and stand against the rush of movement to look down at the mudbrown water the spit of gravel and the tree beached on it as they had in the recent siege of the city people hurried to complete their journey to linger and look around them had been to court death for four years the city had been called the most dangerous place on earth and habits of survival died hard but now the tide of inhumanity washed on other more distant shores dili in east timor and grozny and mitrovica in kosovo there had been five successive bright spring days over the city the piled snow banks on the pavements beside the river compacted by bulldozers in the winter months were finally dribbling away high above the city dominating it where the siege guns had been sited with a clear view of the river the bridges and the streets the ski slopes were melting mountain streams seeking escape into the miljacka cascaded down steep escarpments and the river running through the heart of the city swelled and rose its force grew as the early rush of footsloggers and vehicles thinned the strength of the waters flow lifted the body sufficiently for it to break free of the trees branches there was nothing romantic or noble about the miljacka it was not a thames or a seine a tiber or a danube perhaps that was why none had bothered to stop and gaze down at its movement flanked with concrete and stone bank walls fifty paces wide if measured by a man who had a good stride and had not lost a leg in the shelling broken up by weirs it was more of a dirty drain than a majestic waterway as it continued its journey downriver the body was sometimes submerged caught in powerful deep currents sometimes swirled to the surface before it was again dragged down and sometimes just the buttocks of the dark grey trousers protruded above the water there was no dignity for the body as it was taken through the unseeing city behind him he heard the scrape of the spy hatch being opened then the clatter as it was dropped on its hinge against the outside of the door he didnt look up coffee mister packer cappuccino two measures of sugar granulated and brown he pushed himself off the floor wiped the dust from the knees of his trousers and went to the cell door he reached out and took the polystyrene beaker from the hand stretched through the hatch he didnt thank the prison officer for bringing him the coffee with two measures of sugar but then he hadnt asked for it to be brought him not that day or on any of the days that he had been in the central criminal court he smiled briefly as if that were sufficient indication of his gratitude he could see the prison officers face through the hatch the blinking eyes and the flash of teeth and he knew that his smile had been sufficient to lighten the stupid bastards day he understood why he was brought coffee why this and others of the stupid bastards apologized to him for the dirt in the cell and the state of the toilet and why they always grimaced when they put the handcuffs on him before leading him back to the wagon for the evening journey to hmp brixton they were all every last one of them frightened of him they feared that he would remember rudeness sarcasm a sneer and they thought he would have a good memory they also knew that he could find out where they lived what car they drove where their women worked at the snap of a finger his reputation went before him more importantly he was going to walk as certain as night follows day and they all knew it he was always brought coffee with sugar from their canteen when he was first put in the holding cell before being escorted up to number court and at the lunch recess and in the evening after the court had risen and before he was loaded into the wagon ill let you know as soon as theres signs of movement mr packer his back was to the hatch he took the top off the coffee poured it down the toilet and went back to his work on the floor laid across the concrete were sheets of a tabloid newspaper and on the sheets were the clothes and possessions he had used in the last eight months on remand since his arrest his suit jacket was hitched on the back of the cells single wooden chair on the newspaper were his second suit conservative and grey with a light stripe three buttondown shirts two ties his three spare sets of underwear five pairs of socks and an extra pair of plain black shoes they were all laundered pressed or polished because when he walked he didnt want to bring back soiled or creased clothes to the princess neither of his suits was particularly expensive not handmade off the peg his shirts were decent not monogrammed his ties were sober his shoes ordinary nothing about his clothes or his appearance was flamboyant his confidence that he would walk had caused him to send home his trainers tshirts and the tracksuit he had worn during the long months on remand in brixtons maximumsecurity wing before the start of the trial there were no books no magazines no photographs in frames only a plain washbag and a small clock radio early that morning the prison staff had been surprised when he had cleared his cell loaded everything that was his into a plastic bin liner and carried it to the wagon that was escorted to and from the court by policemen armed with heckler amp koch machine pistols the trial was halfway through the prosecution case was concluded and the previous afternoon his brief had made the proposition to the judge that the client had no case to answer at the time of his arrest the newspapers had written that he was worth in excess of a hundred million pounds that he had headed the capitals top crime family for a decade that he was targeted by the national criminal intelligence service the national crime squad customs amp excises national investigation service gchq the security service and the secret intelligence service but he was going to walk he was an untouchable he knew he was going to walk because the eagle had told him he would he sat on the chair and faced the door glancing over the graffiti on the walls written by provos and yardies murderers and rapists a brief involuntary action but he touched in turn each of the pockets of his jacket hitched on the chair they were all empty there were no cigarettes because he did not smoke no keys because he did not need them no wallet with cash because tough men in brixton queued to give him anything he wanted no credit cards or cheque book because no card company or bank had accounts in the name of albert william packer just been told mr packer judgell be back in five minutes the face was again at the open hatch he nodded then sucked a long gulp of air into his lungs on lifes ladder mister as he insisted on being called by those who worked for him and those who spoke to him on his constantly changing mobile phones had learned to trust few among the few was the eagle his lawyer on a heavy retainer his legal eagle the eagle had promised him he was going to walk and he trusted that prediction it hadnt crossed his mind until that moment that such trust might be misplaced it would go bad for the eagle if it were he breathed out steadily then stood and took his suit jacket from the chair back and slipped his arms into the sleeves he walked towards the cell door then straightened his tie through the hatch the voice said right mr packer if youre ready ill take you up oh dont worry about your bag ill see its minded he smoothed his hair against his scalp as the key was turned in the doors lock and put the dirt and squalor of the past eight months behind him in the themed irish pub across the street from the old bailey the eagle lingered over his lunch of steak and guinness pie with a side salad a hack called over to him with the familiarity of his trade henry the judge is coming back in going to rule on it the eagle merely nodded other than to deny his clients guilt and then only cursorily he never spoke to court journalists and crime reporters he regarded them as parasitical scum and it irked him that his given name should be used by a complete stranger there had been others at the top of the tree before his client mister packer had climbed into the upper branches who enjoyed the company of hacks and liked to read their names in the newspapers a long long time back he had advised his client that newspapers and their writers should be avoided in the eagles opinion newspapers were symptomatic of vanity and vanity was dangerous he carried on pecking at his pie his clerk close to him mobile phone at the ear murmured three or four minutes mr arbuthnot and the judgell be back in no panic josh the eagle said quietly ill follow you over his clerk josh ran for the pub door the eagle laid down his knife and fork on the small round bar table at which he was perched then changed his mind and hooked up a final piece of lettuce leaf he was an ample man and his backside splayed over the rim of his stool he wore an old suit that carried the stains of other meals his shirt was far from new and the collar was slightly frayed the tie had the crumple creases of frequent use with what the eagle earned from his solicitors practice and the retainer paid him by mister he could have worn as good a suit and shirt as might be found in jermyn street tucked under his knees on the stools foot bar were his scarred tan suede shoes when he left his home in the country to come up to london on a monday morning he wore gentlemens clothes and his first act on reaching his office over a launderette in clerkenwell was to strip off those clothes with their fancy labels consign them to a hanger in the cupboard and change into the tired suit shirts and ties of better days and ease on the suedes his last act on a friday afternoon was to reverse the process it was as if he switched identities before taking the train to guildford his london suit shirts ties and shoes were an essential part of what he preached to mister nothing should be flamboyant nothing should draw attention to wealth that could not be easily explained henry arbuthnot had only been twentytwo when he had first met the man who now paid him that healthy retainer introduced to him by his black sheep brother david who had done twentyseven months fraud in pentonville prison and met packer there twentyfour months aggravated robbery in the twentyeight years since then his client had never been convicted he finished his glass of pepsi and lemonade wiped his mouth with the paper napkin and eased himself heavily off the high stool as a twentytwoyearold fresh from college and his degree learning criminalcase law he had been a fierce drinker not any more he had been dry since he had met mister he was on call twentyfour hours day and night for his retainer which ratcheted up each year it was demanded of him that he be constantly available mister was his meal ticket and abstinence from alcohol was the price to be paid he left the pub and sheltered for a moment in the doorway to gauge the strength of the rain opposite was the main entrance to the old bailey the central criminal court word travelled fast photographers were gathering at the principal security entrance two police cars were parked at the kerb in front of the entrance and the armed men were already loading their machine pistols into the secure compartments behind the front seats their job over there had been armed police on the corners of the building since the trial had started he shuffled across the street because of his heavy gut he walked badly he went inside and flashed his card the eagle knew the way it would end had known for days the prosecution case had originally involved the identification by customs amp excise the eagle called it the church of his client in a car his clients fingerprints in the car and the evidence of an informer also in the car while mister had been on remand the eagle had systematically demolished the case with the help of the big mans enforcers the protected witness unit was supposedly secure and secret money had bought the location of the gaol where the pwu was housed and the number given inside the unit to the informer big money had bought the prison officer who had contaminated the mans food a stomach pump had saved his life but not his resolve if they can get me here he had whined they can get me anywhere he had withdrawn his evidence refused to testify mister was standing at the far end of the corridor wreathed in dull light the cell door beside his client was the only one in the block that was open at his shoulder were the clerk josh and a prison officer who clutched the bin bag as if he were a hotel porter the home office forensic laboratory was at chepstow across the welsh border the fingerprint evidence had been there a technician with a predilection for gambling at the roulette tables of a newport casino had been offered a choice for cooperation his debt of nine thousand pounds would be paid off for obstruction his mothers legs would be broken with such baseballbat severity that she would not walk again the fingerprint evidence had gone missing all right then shall we go there was a watery smile at the eagles mouth the churchs identification of his client by their surveillance team had been a greater challenge he couldnt buy the church and couldnt threaten it so the eagle had had to burn latenight oil to work meticulously through the surveillance logs for the fissure in that part of the case having found the point of weakness he had then diverted the attention of the enforcers the cards misters hard men to the leafy suburban detached home of the crown prosecution service lawyer on the specialcase desk it was all worked out it was the power of his client mister never looked round the prison officer passed the bag to the clerk the eagle led them back up the steps at the first landing instead of turning left and waiting at a barred grille gate for it to be unlocked and taking the route up to number court he turned right at that gate he showed his pass as did his clerk and the youngster pushed the discharge document under the face of the security man with the keys to misters freedom a big bluff redfaced exguardsman who wouldnt have brought coffee to a prisoner or carried his bag for him the eagle sensed that the security man wanted to sneer spit but didnt they emerged into the great lobby area of the building did you get the taxi josh yes mr arbuthnot side door like you said no way that the eagle would have albert william packer photographed closeup by a scrum of snappers then have the pictures used every time a lowlife hack wrote an organizedcrime story on the capital anonymity was what the eagle sought for his client and for himself two groups of men and women were watching them theyd have to pass them on their way to the side exit just walk past mister no eyecontact the first group were the detectives from the national crime squad as the eagle knew theyd have had a watching brief because the targeting of his client had been taken away from them and given to the church only fools played games when they walked past the detectives after a prosecution had failed he recognized most of them but behind him mister who had the keenest memory the eagle had ever come across would know their names their ages their addresses their childrens names and there was one who looked away that mister owned the eagle waddled past the detectives and towards the second group rolling on his feet arid panting a little from the climb up the steps you know what the church say mister the eagle spoke out of the side of his mouth of course there are professional jealousies between them and us church and crime squad were professionals and theyre jealous thats what the church says there might have been a death in the family the church people stood hangdog close to the side exit there was a senior investigation officer and what the eagle reckoned were all of the higher executive officers and executive officers who made up the sierra quebec golf team and they looked like they were too shattered to throw up sierra quebec golf had been assigned exclusively to his client for three years prior to misters arrest it was all budget sheets these days the eagle could snap the figures through his head he estimated that the church had committed a minimum of five million pounds to the investigation then all the extras of crown prosecution service and an old bailey trial the men and women of sierra quebec golf had good reason to think the ground had opened under their feet he couldnt help but look at them as he went to the side exit set in the frustration of their faces men and women was deep sincere hatred they werent like policemen the eagle had walked his client many times out of police stations no charges offered and had witnessed close up the resigned shrugs of men going through the form and doing something this was different personal he had to look down at his feet as he went past them because the loathing bled from their eyes he went through the door stampeded down a narrow set of steps and behind him was misters measured tread mister wouldnt have been intimidated by the church men and women the taxi was idling at the side door he dived for the security of the back seat he saw the way the driver looked nervously at the client following him then away all the cabbies in london would know that the quietly dressed man with an unremarkable face his client was albert william packer he gave the destination to the cabbie the eagle realized then that mister had not yet thanked him had not squeezed his arm in gratitude nor muttered a kind word to him as the taxi pulled out from the shadowy passage behind the central criminal court mister asked softly wheres cruncher the first time the sarajevo firemen had managed to get the grab hook onto the body and pull it out of the miljackas central flow and into slower side waters they had ripped off a sleeve of its jacket their rope went slack and they hauled it in to find the length of cloth the chief fireman steadied himself checked the coiled rope at his feet then swung the grab hook in faster circles above his helmet the trees restricted the length of rope he could swing to gain the necessary momentum there was a crowd behind them and another on the far side of the river frank williams wearing the light blue uniform of the international police task force was enough of a student of the recent war to understand why there were trees on this section of the bank this point in the river had been the front line the burnedout apartments over the water had been the home of the sniper nests crouched with their telescopic sights and looking down at a perfect view of the trees all over the city even in the worst of the shelling men had gone out with axes and saws to fell trees for basic warmth and take a chance with death here the trees had survived because death would not have been a lottery but certain he went to night classes to learn the language of serbocroatbosnian he was not especially bright not formally intelligent and the learning was difficult to him but his slight knowledge of their language was always appreciated by the local men he worked with it made an impossible bloody job marginally less difficult painstakingly but fervently in welshaccented patois he urged them come on guys lets get this shit business over with the chief fireman launched the grab hook it was a good throw he had made a clever calculation of the speed with which the river carried the body it was now on its back arms out as if floating at leisure in a swimmingpool the hook splashed into the water downriver of the bodys legs and caught the trousers he took the strain there was a ripple of applause on the far side of the river and a cheer from behind them frank williams winced when a body came out of the taff or the ebbw the usk or the tawe it would at least be accorded a degree of respect compassion here it was a diversion a brief show the body made a bow wave as it was dragged against the current he lapsed as he always did when stressed into english for christs sake do it with a bit of bloody care three of the firemen scrambled down the stones of the rivers wall gaining purchase on the footholds where shells had splintered the masonry or the weight of machinegun fire had chipped the stones they caught the rope and hauled the body over the slimy stones at the rivers edge frank leaned over the wall and peered down at the white face the big eyes and gaping mouth he had been thirteen years in the south wales constabulary and a week short of seven months on secondment to the united nations mission to bosniaherzegovina and he had not yet learned to be caustically removed from emotion at the sight of a strangers corpse the body was lifted up heaved on to the wall then lowered casually to the pavement where the river water subsided from it an ambulance pulled up behind them the crowd pressed forward to get a better view as he wound up the rope the fire chief said dismissively it is a foreigner how can you tell frank had been driving by twentyseven minutes earlier when he had seen a bunch of street kids pelting something in the water he had stopped reflex action as he would have stopped in cardiff expecting to find the kids target was a wingdamaged swan a duck or a drowning dog he had been on his way back to his base at kula beside the end of the airport runway from an earlymorning shopping raid at a coppersmith in the old quarter where he had bought a bracelet for his mothers birthday he was already late if the corpse was that of a muslim dead in the muslim sector of sarajevo then it was of no concern to the iptf if a serb died in the muslim sector there was iptf involvement if the body was that of a foreigner the involvement was heavy look at the watch on his wrist it is gold he is either a politician or a criminal if there is a difference or he is a foreigner so wheres cruncher he asked again and saw the eagles eyes flick once in surprise but his solicitor was never going to be superior with him would never make a fast jibe he knew the eagle was terrified of him and the combination of terror and greed kept the man in place misters life was about power and control whether at home whether free whether in a cell he formed few attachments but he was fond of the cruncher he had grown up with the cruncher him in cripps house and the cruncher in attlee house on the localauthority estate between the albion and stoke newington roads he had been to school with the cruncher lost sight of him then met him again in pentonville hed once heard the eagle call the cruncher wasnt supposed to hear it a bloody little barrowboy the cab turned off the north circular and drifted into treelined streets where the first spring blossom was showing hed been in maximum security since the last day of the previous july when the trees had been heavy in leaf he had missed the autumn gold and the christmas stripped bareness now the daffodils were out in full glory under the blossom trees but the crocuses were waning it was a time of year the princess liked they were at the top of his own road the houses were wide detached buildings brick stucco or mocktudor and there were neighbourhood watch stickers on many of the groundfloor front windows bumps in the road prevented illegal speeding by cutthrough drivers it was a quiet respectable road one of hundreds in the capital just as his own house was like one of thousands of similar properties only fools drew attention to themselves most of those who did were in long lartin or whitemoor or down on the island at albany gaol other than twice to ask the question about the cruncher who should have been there mister had not spoken during the journey he had listened to what had happened in his absence details of property purchases and sales and profits too sensitive for the prisonvisit booths and taken a careful mental note of it the eagle tapped the screen behind the driver and pointed up the road to misters house then said he should have been back last night the cards were down at the airport to meet him he wasnt on the flight didnt come through the cards called me i rang his hotel they said he hadnt checked out but his bed hadnt been slept in the last night i called again this morning he still hadnt been back in his room sorry mister thats as much as i know it should have been a perfect day he wasnt looking at twenty twentyfive years but at coming home to his princess but cruncher hadnt been there there was a bleat in the eagles voice you know what i worry about i mean it lose sleep about one day you overreach know what i mean take a step too far i worry it was close run this time he hit the eagle with a closed fist where it hurt just below the heart it was a short jabbed punch and his solicitor let out a little stifled gasp mister owned a detective inspector at the heart of organizedcrime investigations a prison officer telephone engineers in the sections where taps were monitored had a man in place wherever he was needed he could strike terror into rivals turncoats and lawyers he employed the best of solicitors on retainer and the best of accounting number crunchers so where the hell was cruncher the taxi pulled up mister slipped out of the cab with his bin bag didnt offer an invitation to the eagle to come in with him he hadnt thanked the eagle the work was well paid for he would never be in debt money or for services rendered to any man never under obligation hello mr packer nice to see you back he smiled at the young woman pushing the buggy with the sleeping baby along the pavement she was from four doors down and her husband imported italian fashionwear good to be back rosie a woman was clipping the early spring growth on her hedge two doors up her husband owned a garden centre in edmonton and her garden was always a picture they supplied the labour that kept the princesss lawns and herbaceous borders neat afternoon mr packer welcome home thanks carol thanks very much rosie and carol and all the rest of the road would have remembered clearly that morning the last day of last july when the road had swarmed with armed police and whiteoveralled forensics people as he had been led away in handcuffs by the church every upstairs curtain would have twitched theyd all have been in their nightdresses and pyjamas peering down at him as he was escorted to the car and pushed inside he knew from the princess that rosie had been by that morning when the police and the forensics team had gone with a cake and that carol had brought flowers they were ordinary neighbours in an ordinary road and they knew fuckall about anything he heard the taxi pull away behind him and rang the doorbell the climbing roses over the porch were in leaf but not yet in bud the lawn had had its first cut the door opened she had been primrose hinds their marriage had lasted eighteen years in which time he had never touched another woman she was the daughter of charlie the slash hinds who had emphysema a hot temper and a regular address in the scrubs and who was flash from his fatherinlaw he had learned all that was wrong about a lifestyle primrose was his princess she knew everything about him she was as discreet as her father was not she was the only person he fully trusted he could have bought his princess a castle covered her with jewellery and lived the celebrity existence as others did she had never worked since their marriage at which no photographs were taken by guests and no official snapper was employed a year after the wedding a doctor had told her that she was unable to have children good to see you mister good to have you h o m e he kissed her on the cheek it was not a kiss of devotion but of true friendship later she would give him the numbers of the new mobile phones that the cards had dropped off and when the house was last scanned for bugs and where the vans were in the road for the cameras she was a pretty woman an inch or so taller than him and had a good throat and good ankles he had insisted that she never visited him in brixton never came to the gallery for the magistrates committal hearing or travelled down to the old bailey he protected his princess from prying peering stripping eyes i expect youd like a bath and how about a nice lasagne then god its good to have you back she closed the door behind him as if it were his sole priority mister said we dont know where cruncher is he wasnt on the plane last night his hotel dont know where he is its ridiculous crunchers never gone missing the judge paused in the process of his laborious handwriting shrugged smiled helplessly and said that his daughter normally did the typing for him but sadly she was not available frank williams had just looked down at his watch its not a problem sir frank said you have my name number and workplace yes my involvement is purely coincidental i happened to be passing the river and saw the body it might be that of a foreigner which would make the death iptf business the routine sir is that we should have a postmortem and that ill set in motion an investigation to find out the identity of the deceased its all pretty straightforward i dont expect too many earthquakes again there was a selfdeprecating gesture with the hands it is because it is routine that you have been sent to me if earthquakes were anticipated you would have been channelled to someone more appropriate to someone more worthy i just need a signature sir for the hospital and the pathologist taking an age the judge filled out the form back at home the work would have been done by a brisk competent official in a quarter of the time he wondered where they had dug this old fool out from which stone they had lifted there had been no identification on the body and no hotel security card his starting point would be the better hotels in the city the clothes carried designer labels an italian suit a french shirt an italian tie german shoes and brief tight underpants of silk with a london l a b e l silk autumn he was watched he had been watched all through the day from the early morning it was late afternoon now the sun was low over the golden outlines of the trees on the hills to the west of the valley and he turned his slight body on the tractor seat to stare back hard at the big man who sat on a wooden chair by the door to the house the tractors wheels caught a rut in the field and jolted him shook his spine through the thinning foam cushion on the iron seat he lost sight of the hard eyes gazing at him from past the grazing fields the big mulberry tree and the fencing close to the house that he had put up the previous spring they were two old obstinate and opinionated men and each in a moment of privacy would have called the other a valued friend grudgingly but times were difficult and changing for the worse and on that day neither had called out a greeting or waved they lived on opposite sides of the valley separated by the bunica river and the events of the summer now slipping away to autumn had seemed to widen the differences of politics and culture no wave and no greeting cry each would have thought it the role of the other to make the first gesture above the noise of the engine he whistled to his dog years before he could have rounded up the cattle in the morning and the sheep in the afternoon on foot but age had taken a toll of his knees and hips and he relied now on the tractor and the dogs skill when the dog looked back to him for instructions he pointed towards the ford in the morning with his dog he had brought the cattle back from the grazing fields crossed the river with them and driven them back to the fenced corrals by his barns now he brought back the sheep the grass was exhausted the weather was closing for the winter his dog harried the flanks of the column of sheep and stampeded them towards and into the river at a place where his father and grandfather and his grandfathers father and grandfather had dumped cartloads of stones to create the ford husein and the man who watched him had only been away from their own villages in a whole lifespan for the two years of conscripted military training and that was more than forty years ago he looked back at the valley floor across the riverbank he saw the good grazing fields and the arable fields where the summers maize crop had been harvested the vegetables grown in strips had been lifted and the stark lines of posts linked with wire above the cutdown vines he looked beyond the yellowed grazing fields the ploughed arable land and the weeded corridors between the vines past the mulberry tree from which the leaves were flaking and the house with the shallow porch from which dragan watched him and up the hill track by the well towards the other village where smoke bent from chimneys and over the ochre of the trees that caught the last of the suns strength his hearing was no longer keen but he thought he had heard strident voices coming from north and south warring in the few seconds that his tractor had stalled but with the engine now straining to carry him up the far bank such sounds were blotted out as the wheels spewed water and slithered on the mudbank he saw the pool upstream and the fine trace of the wormed long line he had left out for trout it was the fault of the radios the radios that played in his own village vraca spat out poison as did the radios in the other village ljut against the tractors engine they were dead he braked he allowed the dog to take the sheep ahead he stood up to his full short wiry height he lifted his frayed cap from his sparse hair his mouth filled with ragged teeth was set in a weathered walnut face below a greyed drooping moustache it was husein thought ridiculous to the point of evil that the radios poison and hatred should destroy an old grumbled friendship he waved his cap and shouted dragan kovac can you hear me heh i will be back in two days if the river has not risen to plant the apple trees heh can we take coffee maybe we take brandy heh i will see you in two days if it does not rain he waited to see if his friend would wave back and strained for a faraway call in response but he saw no movement heard no answering shout for two centuries the ancestors of husein bekir had bought land from the ancestors of dragan kovac paid over the odds and bought every scrap every parcel every pocket handkerchief christian land was now muslim owned to husein it was incredible as it had been to his grandfather and his grandfathers grandfather that the serb village was prepared to sell precious land to a muslim village for shortterm gain he understood that the serb people prized a uniform more highly than hectares of grazing and arable ground orchards and vineyards the serbs were bus drivers hospital porters clerks in the revenue soldiers customs men and policemen dragan kovac had been a sergeant in the police before his retirement they sought the status of the uniform and the security of the pension not the scarred hands and the arthritis that came from working the land husein himself had bought the pocket of land right under the home of dragan that included the mulberry tree and the field where he hoped next week to plant the apple trees there was no more land left to buy and the radio from belgrade listened to in ljut said each morning afternoon and evening that muslims had stolen serb fields the radio from sarajevo heard on the transistors in vraca said every day that serb tanks artillery and atrocities in distant croatia would not intimidate the muslim leaders from the prize of bosnian independence they killed old friendships his wife of thirtynine years lila chided him for not wearing a thicker coat as protection against the evening chill and his grandchildren wild little mites charged excitedly to fence in the sheep there was a rumble of thunder as grey dark clouds chased the sunset the first splatter of rain fell on husein bekirs face he climbed down stiffly from the tractor the sun still shone on the far side of the valley on the land he owned that stretched from the riverbank to the scrubcovered slopes that rose to the treeline and the other village he was a simple man his formal education had finished on his fourteenth birthday and he could read and write only with difficulty he claimed that political argument was beyond his comprehension and he followed the simpler instructions of the mullah in the mosque he knew how to train a dog he knew also how to work land and get the heaviest possible weight of crops from the arable fields and grapes from the vineyard he knew how to catch a trout that would feed five people he knew how to stalk a bear and shoot it for its skin how to track a deer and kill it for its meat the valley was his place he loved it he could not have articulated that love but it burned in him because of what the radios said from belgrade and sarajevo he did not know what was its future he thought that dragan the retired police sergeant and a monument of a man separated from him by politics and religion shared the same love he walked awkwardly up the hill towards his home at the door he paused the sun dipped the rain came on harder the beauty of the valley was lost as the squall crossed it the russet and ochre colours were gone husein shivered then coughed deep in his lungs and spat out the phlegm he kicked the door shut behind him so that he would no longer see his valley the sign on the desk printed off a pc and stuck to a cardboard strip said cann do will do sitting at the desk stamping twofingered instructions onto his console then staring at his screen the young man pointedly ignored the chaos around him it was as if the work he did divorced him from the atmosphere of morose and sour heartache he was the only member of sierra quebec golf who had not been in court as sqg the dogsbody of the team he had been left behind to mind the shop when the rest of them had trooped up to the old bailey as he hit the keys and scribbled longhand notes on a pad he seemed to refuse to accept what all the others knew the team was finished some were packing papers into cardboard boxes others were going round the walls and stripping down charts and photographs viciously enough for the paint to come away with the sellotape downloading computers and stacking disks collecting the personal radios from the lockers around the room checking the surveillance cameras serial numbers against the docket sheets and those on the telephoto lenses then putting them roughly into the silver metal protected cases the senior investigation officer chainsmoked under the nosmoking sign it was over the inquest would start in the morning and it would not be pretty the sio would need to watch his back and the higher executive officers would be making damn sure they didnt have to field the blame when the inquest started all of them but the sio would either be taking the leave theyd postponed till after the trial or beginning life in a new team dont touch t h a t he must have looked up at the moment that the final picture on the wall was about to be ripped down it was a half lifesize picture full length of a man in tshirt and trainers handcuffed being escorted down a garden path at the foot of the picture one word mister was written in marker pen it was the venom in the voice that made the man hesitate leave the damn thing there the room had been ritually cleansed the boxes and cases filled all the computers switched off but one it had taken them long enough for the pubs in the city to be emptying of commuters they filed out joey could hear their fraudulent laughter in the corridor the team had been together for three years for nothing it was the senior investigation officers idea of leadership they were going to the pub to get so drunk they couldnt stand then theyd fall into ripoff minicabs and get home and in the morning theyd all have mindbending hangovers theyd have solved nothing and not eased the hurt he was twentyseven years old he was the junior sierra quebec golf formed to target albert william packer no other purpose for its existence was the only team joey cann had worked for for those three years he had lived slept walked crapped with albert william packer he had never seen mister face to face only looked at photographs and watched video he had never heard the mans voice clean only listened to it on tape from the telephone intercepts and directional microphones yet he would have said that he knew him for three years in the room at the custom house by the thames he had been buried in tapes surveillance logs photos reports forensic findings buried so deep he had sometimes needed to gasp for air it had come without warning if the sio had known that the case was about to fold or the heos or any of the older eos then none of them had thought to tell him just a call on a mobile phone to say that it was over he picked up a phone dialled hi jen its me im going to be working late tell me something new did you hear about what about the case dammit the case packer has it finished it wasnt supposed to finish before it went down jen sorry am i being stupid has he gone down what did he get jen the case went down he walked you had it sewn up from what you told me it doesnt make sense look its aerobics night do you want me to skip it im working late dont you want to talk no he rang off speaking to jen had put clutter in his mind the chaff was cleared when he cut the call doggedly carefully he began a long night of travelling again through the case work in the pub they would have thought what he did was futile each time the tiredness tugged at his eyelids he blinked it away from behind his big pebblelensed spectacles and looked up at the picture of mister in its lonely honoured place on the wall that alone was enough to shift the exhaustion and drive him back to the screen chapter two past nine in the morning and the fingers still beat rhythms on the consoles keyboard two hours before he had waved away the cleaners the room was a tomb of stacked boxes around the cleared desks and the locker doors hung open crazily when he had been fiercely tired his head sagging the sight of the photograph on the wall had stiffened him joey cann was near the end the computer hummed with the latest instruction then the format of crossexamination flickered on to the screen and locked he read question and you were alone in the surveillance vehicle answer i was question it was after eleven oclock that night answer it was question up to that time eleven oclock that evening how many hours had you worked answer seventeen question how many hours had you worked that week answer ninetyfour question you were tired you were desperately tired answer i was doing my job question how many hours sleep had you had that week an estimate answer thirtyfive or forty i dont know question what was the weather that night answer i cant recall nothing exceptional question according to the meteorological office there was low cloud and intermittent drizzle but you dont recall answer i dont remember question had you eaten in that seven teenhour shift answer we usually try and get a burger but dont remember what i eat question im getting a picture of a tired man and a hungry man you are aware that hunger increases tiredness answer i suppose so question the distance between yourself and the vehicle in which you identified mr packer was seventyseven metres is that correct answer i believe so question you were tired you were hungry the visibility was poor you were the length of three cricket pitches from the target of your surveillance but you maintain that you are certain that you could identify mr packer answer i do and am question had you yourself cleaned the windscreen of your vehicle answer no question when was the windscreen last cleaned answer i dont know question dont you have the records that will tell you records from the vehicle pool answer i dont have them question was there a streetlight close to the vehicle in which you allege mr packer was sitting answer there was enough light for me to make an identification question i asked whether there was a streetlight close to that vehicle was there answer i dont recall question on the map plan you have provided us with there is a streetlight almost directly above the car you had under surveillance did you know that answer the light was satisfactory for an identification question according to the records of haringey council roads department that light had been reported out of action eighteen days before and had not been repaired by the relevant date does that surprise you answer i identified mr packer question did you take photographs that night answer yes question where are those photographs answer they didnt come out question didnt come out answer correct question i see you wear spectacles are they for general use ansiver yes question how long have you been wearing spectacles answer since i was a child it was a public demolition the man in the witness box was as good as any of the sierra quebec golf team at surveillance and had been made to appear an unreliable amateur in court the cool reasonable politeness of misters qc dripped off the transcript joey heard the door open but did not look up he scribbled his notes an informant had retracted fingerprints had gone missing the star witness had fallen on his face it had been the systematic and clinical destruction of three years work there was a spluttered hacking cough behind him putting the world to rights he recognized the hoarse guttural voice of the senior investigation officer joey closed down the computer took his time then swivelled in his chair i was looking for what we did wrong bollocks i tell you what you are cann youre an arrogant little prick am i an arrogant shite with an attitude problem is that right joey stared at him his gaze unwavering he saw the blotched face and the puffy bags under the mans eyes he saw yesterdays shoes scuffed and scraped and a pair of suit trousers that had been thrown on the floor the mans eyes blazed at him we went to the pub last night i dont know how many pubs we went to some of us threw up some of us fell over two pubs put us out we had a kitty and a banker fifty quid each and we packed it in when the banker said he was skint we stayed together till all the minicabs were lined up and ready to go no one was left behind we got home we were a team the whole of sqg except you you were too fucking superior to be a part of the team i was looking for what we did wrong you think youre the only one who cared you think youre the only one with the intelligence to know what went wrong this is a team game cann and until you realize it youre going to stay an arrogant little shite without a friend in the world we dont have heroes here we dont bloody want crusaders some of the best investigators in the business were in this team but theyre not good enough for you and you piss on them i doubt youll ever learn stupid bugger we all care we all gave three years of our lives to put packer away go home go and dig your bloody garden i dont have a garden your bloody windowbox then i dont have a windowbox then why dont you just fuck right off out of here he knew that the sio had eight months until retirement the man would have retired well if he had been able to boast gently that he had prosecuted and put away albert william packer the untouchable little doors would have opened on to the wellpaid circuit of security consultancy the sio had had the big one within his grasp and he had let it go down the drain joey stood stretched then went to the wall and carefully took down the photograph of misters arrest prising it slowly away from the paintwork so that the corners werent torn then he rolled it up and put it into his bag the sio lurched towards him and the fat finger bright with last nights mahogany nicotine stains stabbed at joeys chest you know why we hate heroes and crusaders cann why we root them out why they put the safety of the team at risk they miss the point of what were trying to do theyre selfish and superior to colleagues any creep with a mission is not a team player fuck off and when youve had some sleep may be you should reflect on what to do about being too high too mighty to get pissed with the rest of us youve no future here joey walked out of the room and away down the corridor his bag banging against his leg he swiped his card at the door stepped out onto the pavement avoided the regular little clutch having their first cigarette of the day and headed for the underground station from bank he could have taken a direct northern line train south to tooting bee and his bedsit and he could have slept instead he bought a ticket to go north on the northern line to kings cross then to change for the piccadilly line trains heading out into the suburbs taking advice good or bad had never been an especial talent of joey cann hed often had coffee in the wide plantstrewn atrium but it was the first time that frank williams had been into a room at the holiday inn hed brought two local policemen with him reckoned it would be a good education for them to watch him at work would give them a chance to learn basic policing exercises the bed was still made the desk top was empty except for the hotels stationery pouch he found two suits in the wardrobe where two more italian shirts were hanging with a pair of soft leather shoes underneath them beside the telephone there was a pad for notetaking and he routinely tore off the top two pages and slipped them into a plastic sachet he was looking for a passport a briefcase anything to put flesh on the occupier of the room a family photograph but he found nothing sunlight streamed into the room if he had not been a policeman he would have felt that he intruded on privacy he had already tried the saraj the grand and the motel belveder but none had a missing foreigner it was the sort of basic police work that frank williams was good at he was slow and thorough and he made the local men wear the gloves with which he had provided them because they were young they were probably still honest but theyd soon catch on another six months and they wouldnt have been down on the carpet looking under the bed or climbing on a chair to peer above the wardrobe theyd have been out at a roadblock fining motorists cash only and no receipts for speeding or having defective lights no passport no briefcase no wallet no personal organizer no cheque book or credit cards no work papers no mobile telephone no tourist guides but the room was held in the name of duncan dubbs of river mansions narrow street london e the description of the rooms occupier was a probable match to the battered face of the man from the river and the certainty came quickly what sort of man with what sort of business left a hotel room sterilized of his work background and personality he was thinking about i t he saw the flash from the sheen of the material and heard the raucous laugh from the younger of the local men he had the bottom drawer of the chest open and was holding up a pair of underpants to be examined by the older one frank williams reached out and snatched the underpants checked the label and made the match they were silk shitty enough to die far f rom home he thought but worse when your secrets became joke for strangers mister was back for two men at the top of his priority list the news of the trials collapse came too late for them to take flight neither had had time to board a plane to miami the algarve spain or anywhere one during the eight months of misters imprisonment on remand had defaulted on a payment in excess of threequarters of a million pounds the other in misters absence had muscled into the dealer network and imported his own afghanproduced and turkishrefined heroin to mister it was necessary to show that he was back the defaulter had been taken from his apartment with his suitcase only half filled in a scramble of packing too quickly for him to get to the uzi submachinegun kept for emergencies under a floorboard that morning he was in the intensive care unit of charing cross hospital where a medical team struggled to keep him alive the muscler lay on a bed in a similar unit at university college hospital festooned with monitoring wires and drip tubes when the cards had come for him in the small hours at the drinking and snooker club he owned in hackney he had not known that his minders had flaked away from the front and rear doors liberties had been taken while mister was away it had not been expected that he would regain his free dom without warning it was not possible for mister to retain his authority his power after eight months away unless his strength was demonstrated he had sent a message that night twice a detective sergeant at charing cross hospital asked a consultant to speculate how the right leg of the victim had been taken off at the knee ashenfaced the consultant suggested the detective should go and look for a heavyduty industrial strimmer the sort used by workmen employed by parks and gardens to clear light undergrowth and scrub how long would that have taken to sever it completely not less than a minute maybe a bit more another detective sat in an alcove close to the cubicle at university college hospital alongside the useless presence of an armed police protection team and had been told the victim had suffered huge abdominal damage from the discharge of a shortbarrel shotgun a doctor had asked him who does that sort of thing we call it bad on bad for them its normal business procedure you and i would fire off a lawyers letter they do it with a twelvebore sawnoff the body stitched up was trolleyed back to the cold store the pathologist stripped off his messy gloves and his assistant untied the long aprons back cords and he shrugged out of it death by drowning the pathologist drawled english language and american accent considerable alcohol in the stomach and a meal i really dont have time to tell you what he ate there is no indication of criminality the injuries abrasions are consistant with what would happen to a cadaver after thirty hours in the river there is no reason why the cadaver should not be shipped home to the family for burial he paused to look up at frank williams now please excuse me frank thought the pathologist would be earning maximum five hundred german marks a month that would equate to around forty pounds sterling a week before tax the man was trained a professional had probably learned how to cut up bodies at an american university while he was attached to the iptf in bosnia frank made six hundred pounds sterling a week after tax and had no college education he believed nothing he was told by a government employee in sarajevo it could be that there were no criminal injuries it could be that there were criminal injuries unnoticed by the pathologist or perhaps criminal injuries that the pathologist had been paid not to identify they were in a basement area of the kosevo hospital and he could imagine what it would have been like here in the candlelight during the siege like a slaughterhouse a carnage hell a young diplomat from the embassy was beside him thats that is it hearn the diplomat asked he grimaced first time ive been at one glad i missed lunch frank said and overstated the irony well isnt that convenient youre staying in a hotel on business problem none of your business papers are in your room so incredibly you are one of sarajevos five tourists a year problem none of your guidebooks or local maps are in your room all right youre drunk and incapable problem how do you climb over the railings on the bridges or the walls on the rivers edge when youre fiftysomething and chuck yourself in after youve lost your wallet and every other piece of identification s o well its not good enough ive marked it thank you leave it with me and lets see where it runs the sio stood the chief investigation officer sat at his desk theres no way round it brian i think i know that the sio sweated sierra quebec golf in its present form is dismantled and you if youll forgive my bluntness are supernumerary its been more than thirty years of my life he shouldnt have said that didnt want to sound selfpitying hed known hed be called in but had hoped it would be later and that the drink would have been further through his system thats a shame and you have to believe its sincerely m e a n t but facts have to be faced im familiar with the facts we were unlucky thats all he heard his own voice and thought it petulant hed never been easy with the new man the outsider the blowin from the intelligence community never been able to talk to him the way he had with his bosses when they were promoted from inside closed shop for heavens sake brian be adult its not a time for sulking millions of pounds have been spent we were laughed out of court packer is the nearest thing we have in this country to a superleague organizedcrime player you had every resource you wanted everything you asked for a witch hunt is that what this is and im the bloody broomstick he hadnt combed what hair he had his head was throbbing along with his anger the new man wore a perfect suit a perfect shirt and a perfect tie with some bloody image on it that the sio couldnt quite focus on something from the spook days he supposed and the cio was cambridge and connected and had the ear of the elite you can either be transferred to vat investigations for the last few months or if you think it more appropriate take early retirement pension wont be affected goes without saying thats remarkably generous of you sarcasm never came naturally to him his wife whod been with him as long as hed been in the church said that when he tried sarcasm he demeaned himself it was ignored looking at you brian i dont get any pleasure from saying this gives me the impression you slept in a hedgerow last night senior men getting drunk with juniors is seldom wise i took the team out bloody hell dont you understand its what we always do when a case goes down these men these women theyd put their lives into this everything else secondary and me we went for a drink or three so what not a habit i sympathize with i would have thought an assessment of the disaster and it was a disaster would have been better prepared while minds were clear not through a hangover the sio laughed a hoarse snigger glacial eyes gleamed at him why is that so funny enlighten me please cann did that cann stayed behind he was at the computer all night why to see what we did wrong we didnt do anything wrong it was the system the process the cio had the palms of his hands together fingers outstretched a bishop in prayer always somebody elses fault i hear you brian keep saying it often enough and you might gain some comfort from it anyway im afraid thats the end of the line sorry there cannot be sentiment not when a man as prominent as packer walks free so whats it to be there wasnt going to be a party there might be a carriage clock sent on in the post and there might be a seedy secretive gathering in a pub and the handing over of a sherry decanter bought with a whipround he said quietly id like the rest of the day to clear my things up and say a few goodbyes sensible choice the pension people will be in touch he flared he was on his way out headed for the rubbish heap god look i wanted to put him down i wanted it as much as anyone but you didnt did you put him down thats the difficulty brian good luck the cio smiled goodbye lets hope others manage where i failed yes with the right people im sure we will the sio was on his way to the door the voice behind him was sham matteroffact oh the one in the team who resisted your leadership demand to get drunk give me his name again you dont want to worry about him hes not a team player but then he was only the collator did the archive kept the paper in order hes a nobody whats nobodys name sqg joey cann joey turned into the road he had never been there before he had filed perhaps two hundred photographs of it he knew its every detail when the trees were in blossom in leaf or bare and the gardens when they were stripped down or coming into flower it was as if he had lived in that road through the lenses of cameras secreted in canvas bt shelters parked vans and abandoned cars the road was usually in monochrome but it made little difference to his ability to recognize it he was a driven creature in the world of legal process a defence brief could have ripped to small pieces the slightbuilt young man palefaced hair dark and tangled with the large spectacles and the crumpled jeans who had turned into the southern junction of the road and who now sauntered along it towards the playingfields at the top end he had no authorization to be there no permission for intrusive surveillance merely being in the road broke church practice and bordered on the edge of legality he could not have stayed away excuse me a voice shrilled behind him he drifted to the side of the pavement and a woman pushed a baby buggy past him she turned and gave him a withering suspicious glance he knew her from photographs as rosie carthew he understood that he would have looked an outofplace cuckoo and she might have smelt his body her husband brought into the country italian topofthe range ladies dresses skirts blouses and handbags he also knew that eighteen months before rosie carthew had twice phoned the local police to complain about suspicious vehicles in the road and twice surveillance operations had been killed off a woman was sweeping the pavement of hedge clippings from the pictures he recognized her as carol penberthy three months before misters arrest at dead of night the security service a branch watchers had buried a fisheye camera in the brick gatepost on the drive of the house opposite his nothing to do with neighbourhood watch but she must have been restless and up at her bedroom window as they worked the next morning carol penberthy had been filmed by the fisheye trooping out of her own doorway down the pavement and up to the packer doorway for a fast whispered conversation with mister in his dressinggown and slippers that night a ramshackle van had come down the road and the fisheyes last image had been of its front fender before it had crashed into the brick column and destroyed the camera he doubted that either woman was in conspiracy with packer just inquisitive and nosy with flapping tongues joey was outside the house he had seen it through all the hours of the clock days of the week weeks of the month months and seasons of the year he knew the setting and size of the bricks of the walls the number of glass panes in the front bay windows on either side of the porch and the positioning of the spyhole in the door the chimes in the hall from the bell a year before the arrest a microphone had been set into the bark of the blossom tree by the front gate it had lasted a week before being prised out theyd muttered then that either mister had got lucky or that the information tap had leaked once again and the patterns on the curtains and the mesh on the net behind the door and the curtains he knew the layout of the rooms the house had been burgled by the a branch watchers the first time they had been involved they were the clever cats introduced to go where plodding policemen and mediocre church men couldnt reach theyd put a bug behind the cover where the tv aerial came into the livingroom wall and a pinhead probe inside the ventilation grille in the bedroom which had lasted four days both had gone out when the rubbish was put in the bin on the pavement he knew the rubbish went on a monday morning the a branch intruders had been in the house for seven minutes and had had time to photograph every room he knew everything about the pictures on the walls fine landscapes in watercolour but not megamoney and the wallpaper the pills in the bathroom cupboard and the food in the fridge it was as if he had been a house guest can i help you a woman was getting out of her car in the driveway opposite and two doors down leonora govan separated going on divorced two children surveillance said she was more often inside misters home for coffee with the princess than any other woman in the road no joey said may i ask what you think youre doing there was an accusing whip in her voice you can ask its a free country joey was smiling it was the first time he had smiled since he had taken the call on the mobile the afternoon before but he walked on well it was a good question which taxed him what did he think he was doing he turned once and looked back in the corner of his vision field was the woman leonora govan standing in the middle of her unloaded shoppingbags still staring at him he glanced a last time at the house he had brought it alive from the photographs simply by walking past it joey cann was not a romantic those who didnt like him said he was humourless and without feeling those who cared for him would say he was dedicated and focused flights of fantasy did not fill his mind what did he think he was doing in a north london suburban road looking at a house where the only sign of life was a single upper window an inch open he stood stock still on the pavement ahead of him on the playingfields was a class of boys learning football and beyond them a class of girls messing at hockey at the end of the school day theyd be charging for the school gate smelling of sweat and with dirty knees and on the street outside the school would be the pushers who bought and cut from the dealers the dealers bought and cut from the importers the importers made available the heroin crack cocaine ecstasy lsd and amphetamines produced in the far corners of the world and sold on for profit to the dealers and pushers a romantic would have said the importer an ordinary man from an ordinary house was evil not the word joey cann would have used the ordinary man living in an ordinary house was nothing more and nothing less than a target the bloody biggest target the church had target one he wondered if the bastard packer had laughed as he came out of court released he had heard misters laugh on the tapes seen it on the photographs what was he doing by walking past the house he was putting life on to the photographs and tapes he was making the man real he rocked with tiredness and leaned against the fence the man mister packer would have thought himself an untouchable he turned round there was no movement in the road he whispered what you should know mister wherever you go im with you im following you look over your shoulder and im there joey giggled out loud on the balkans desk at the foreign and commonwealth office they read the signal sent by hearn from sarajevo oh c h r i s t a woman said another body thats all we damn well need leadlined coffins paperwork like a phone directory its like interflora isnt it people shift bodies undertakers like florists shift flowers dont they itll take a whole morning and half an afternoon to sort it families always say yes then balk at the cost right i suppose zagreb would be the nearest for an international undertaker dont you think the man beside her nodded he was reading the signal for the third time he said quietly it doesnt seem that hearns too happy about this ill push it at the men in raincoats across the river give them something to do it worked away at him like an itch needed scratching where was the cruncher that morning he went to see his father other men suffered bad claustrophobia in gaol or deteriorated physically and mentally became weighed down by the burden of institutionalism but not mister he had survived imprisonment and now he believed his reputation was goldplated he had beaten them he drove the princesss series bmw three years old and had the front windows down so that the street air blew onto his face several times on the drive down green lanes from the north circular his territory before he had turned off for cripps house he had felt that peculiar buzz of excitement the product of power but each time as it peaked there had been the itch crunchers absence there were eight floors to cripps house the estate had been built in and was ageing decaying but the housing authority always found resources to daub new paint on the doors and windows the lift was regularly maintained there were no muggings or thievings in that block no drugs sold and no syringes left on the landings on the eighth floor at the end of the open walkway perched like a sentry tower with a view to the main road and the parking areas was the home of herbie packer retired bus driver widower never in trouble with the police elizabeth packer who when she had worked had cleaned rooms at the waldorf hotel had been dead now for four years by the time albert not yet mister had been twelve years old the regular visitors to the topfloor flat had been teachers and social workers when he was fourteen theyd been replaced by uniformed and plainclothed police the refrain from herbie and elizabeth packer to them all had been hes a good boy really heart of gold trouble is hes just got caught up with the wrong crowd there was no shifting them on that even when the police came and arrested him and he went down aged fifteen for a year in the youth detention centre at feltham and at nineteen when the door was broken open at dawn and he had been taken away to do two years in pentonville and still as he proudly told it they refused to blame him he took the lift up in any of the other blocks on the estate all named after cabinet ministers of the day he would have seen graffiti on the lift walls and the contact numbers of tarts and pushers there would have been the screwedup paper balls on the floor that held heroin wraps and even in daytime there would have been a mugging risk in the airless shadowed hall beside the lift shaft but his father lived in cripps house and the use of a pickaxe handle and electric terminals had secured the safety of the older residents and small sums of money in plain brown envelopes judiciously placed in the right hands ensured that the building stayed clean and painted and that the lift worked out of the lift he paused on the walkway and looked across albion road to the more distant highbury grove his sight line travelled past the holloway road and locked on to the central tower of hmp pentonville by screwing up his eyes straining he could make out the regimented lines of cell windows on the back of d wing during his two years there he had made the critical contacts of his adult life as a result of time in pentonville he had met the men who armed him distributed for him dealt for him and the eagle and there his ties to the cruncher had been strengthened he swore softly his eyes raked back over the dull skyline of towers church spires and chimneys over the wall of the walkway were dalton house and morrison house then the largest of the estates blocks attlee house attlee house had been the crunchers home he could put his life into boxes to each he allocated a varied amount of time and commitment one held the matter of the priority of discipline and respect and had been dealt with another box was his father he rang the doorbell and set the smile on his face the matter of the missing cruncher was isolated in its own box he held his father in his arms and felt the thin bones of the old mans shoulders years ago he could have bought a bungalow for his parents down on the coast but his mother had always refused to leave cripps house now in his seventyfourth year his father was the same wouldnt move closer to vicky alex may and julie his daughters he stayed put it was his home they went in through the door and mister kept his arm round his fathers shoulders the living room was dominated by the outsize widescreen tv and a soap was playing with the sound turned high because the old mans hearing was going youre looking well son not too bad dad considering im not too bad myself is there anything you want dad no nothing i want for nothing you just have to shout you know that nothing youre a good lad im pleased to see you back hasnt been right without you being around just a bit of a mistake dad they was putting two and two together making five nothing for you to worry about it was as close as they ever came to talking about his life he sat on the settee that had been pulled apart half a dozen times a year in the old days by the cid from caledonian road his heels resting on the same carpet that had been lifted by the police so many times beside the television was the shelf and cupboard unit that had never fitted together properly since the detectives had dismantled it for the first time thirtytwo years before whatever the teachers and social workers had said of him that he was a hooligan and a thug his father had never criticized him never raised a hand or a voice in anger to him all he had been allowed to provide for the flat was a new cooker and fridge for the kitchen the fancy electric fire with lit artificial coal and the widescreen television in turn he hadnt allowed his father to visit him on remand for the same reason that the princess had not been permitted to come to brixton or to sit in the public gallery at the trial they talked about the programmes on the tv and the new striker from the cameroons just signed by arsenal up the road in highbury and the weather and the girls babies mostly he listened and his father talked when it was time for him to be moving he said i thought i might call in at st matthews dad thought i might do that they were on the walkway over his fathers shoulder was the looming mass of attlee house and he could see the boardedup window where the cruncher had been a kid he kissed his father and hurried away the diplomats signal moved electronically to the secret intelligence service building on the south bank of the thames river the name duncan dubbs and the address river mansions narrow street london e were fed into their computers they failed to register a trace the sarajevo signal was recopied and passed back over the river to thames house home of the security service he asked for matron what name is it please the receptionist asked curtly packer albert packer the receptionist was new he hadnt seen her before and his name meant nothing to her do you have an appointment i just called by i know shes rather busy this afternoon just tell her that albert packers here thank you from the outside it was a depressing victorian building with a high facade of grimed brick inside there was all the light and warmth that freshcut flowers could muster with his eldest sister and his father he had brought his mother here four years ago the tumour in her stomach had been inoperable the receptionist spoke on the phone and he saw the surprise she registered she told him that he should go up the implication being that matron would clear her desk for him and he said he knew the way his mother had lingered for a week in st matthews hospice before ending her life in peace he loved the quiet of the building and the smell of its cleanness the light in the corridors and on the stairs the scent of the flowers it no longer held terrors for him matron met him outside her office wearing a prim blue uniform always decorated with her medal from the british armys nursing corps and from her chest hung an old gold watch she was a tall gauntfaced woman from the west of ireland she was formidable until she spoke severe until a stranger saw the sparkle of wit in her eyes on a cold february afternoon four years ago when he had brought in his mother and hed been refusing to accept the doctors diagnosis and hed seen matron for the first time hed asked defiantly is it ever possible does it ever happen that a patient walks out of here looking him straight in the eye shed replied no it never happens it isnt ever possible and it would not be helpful to think it few people told mister the truth unvarnished with no adornments in the next bed to his mother had been an artist who had exhibited with the best and on the other side of her had been a retired colonel from the brigade of guards his mother the hotel cleaner had been between talent and status given equal care equal love equal amounts of painkilling drugs good to see you back mr packer i was wondering she chuckled were you now what hoping the bad penny wouldnt turn up she held his hand they were both laughing with his other hand he reached into his hip pocket took out a small thickly filled envelope and passed it to her there was never less than two and a half thousand in fifties and twenties in the envelopes he gave her and seldom more than five thousand with sleight of hand she slipped it down the v of her uniform under her throat then winked she never mentioned his life or what she read in newspapers the first time he had gone back to see her a month after his mothers funeral hed asked her what she needed shed said that shed a list as long as her arm but a cheque would do he didnt do cheques but he did cash as long as there werent questions how do i put cash through the books if i dont have a donors name do i tell the financial controller that christmas came early shed asked hed grinned you dont tell anybody anything you do a bit of creative accounting you buy what you want to have you dont have to wait on a committees delay for authorization its yours to spend when and how you want to ill send along a man his specialitys creative accounting cruncher was the money man the cash in the little envelopes bought tilting beds painted the wards provided new tvs paid half the annual salary of a macmillan nurse put in the computer that tracked the daycare patients helped towards decent funerals for the dead without funds the bus for outings the comedians for parties and holidays for carers no other person knew of his financial contributions to the hospice and matron never inquired into the source of the money she gratefully spent he stayed away from public fundraising occasions his photograph had never been taken at the hospice shed told him once that what he did was raw no frills charity and told him another time that when alone late at night she struggled with income and expenditure she didnt know what shed do without his generosity hed blushed then and shed never said anything like that again what can i do i dont really like to ask you try me she rolled her eyes theres a mr thompson whos just joined us he might be with us for a couple of weeks not much more hes brought in a box of cowboy books and his eyes arent up to reading to himself and he says women cant read cowboy stories aloud i dont like to ask no problem half an hour later mister closed sunset pass having read two chapters of zane greys story to a former waterboard engineer suffering from terminal lung cancer well thats interesting very interesting at thames house the computer registered a trace when fed the name of duncan dubbs they were hard times at the security service the end of the cold war internalespionage threat and the reduction in irish mainland bombings had set in place a furious campaign to find work to justify the everclimbing budget a rightwing politician had described the service as one of sound mediocrity on the other side of the house a leftwinger had called it the worst and most ridiculed in the western alliance they were greyshoed plodders suffering institutional inertia they were boringly parochial and unable to bring intellectual debate to their future role as an apology of employment organized crime had now been dumped on their desks the computer clattered out the secrets of a man hauled from the miljacka river in sarajevo success bloomed a reason for existence the line manager pored over the printout fascinating stuff what will mister say dear me poor old cruncher best bit of news ive heard all day all week cruncher gone to his maker but in sarajevo what the hell was he doing in sarajevo i tell you what what is going to cast a certain pall over misters face going to wipe all that joy at walking out of the old bailey he turned to the young woman who had brought him the printout cruncher was at misters right hand number cruncher got it irene his accountant thats quite a victory for us him losing cruncher cant figure it what he would have thought he was doing in sarajevo i do hope the word spreads that misters righthand scumbag wore silk knickers wish it was me who was going to pass on the good news it was twentyfive minutes to midnight when the series bmw turned into the drive the sio sat in the passenger seat beside freddie the most loyal of his heos slowly after packer and the princess had gone into the house he counted to fifty then he eased himself up and pushed open the car door he stood up coughed and checked that his id in a slightly worn leather case was in his breast pocket the card had twentyfour minutes validity left in the windows the lights blazed he made his way across the road he walked up the drive and rang the bell heard the chimes as footsteps approached the door he stood flush in front of the spyhole opened the leather case and displayed the card brian finch senior investigation officer customs and excise sorry to disturb you sir or maam but im afraid its important its about a death could you let me in please the door opened to the extent of the chain and again he displayed the card the chain was released he assumed a cctv camera was on him good evening mrs packer its your husband ive come to see mister was standing in a doorway off the hall hed loosened his tie and discarded his jacket he seemed taller than he had in the dock at the old bailey there seemed to be a cast in his right eye for the lid was lower than the left and a finger went to the scar as if that were a nervous tic not particularly big or particularly powerful no display of threatening muscles in his arms or shoulders no show of strength in his stature rather ordinary and paleskinned from the months locked up and this was a man who as brian finch well knew created terror what do you want came to share a spot of bad news with you mr packer you got a warrant i doubt i need a warrant for what ive got to say mr packer its intrusion and harassment ill call my solicitor almost a family bereavement mr packer im afraid theyve fished a body out of the river in sarajevo wearing silk underpants takes all sorts in this life we think its the body of your very good friend mr duncan dubbs drowned probably pissed no suggestion of foul play we need a bit of help mr packer next of kin that sort of thing later the sio would count this as one of the more extraordinary moments of his professional life he was telling a major figure in organized crime that his principal lieutenant his financial guru his genius at hiding the laundered money was dead his eyes never left the face in front of him there was no reaction hed tried with his words to belt the man in the most vulnerable place as if he kicked the softness of the stomach no gasp no flicker no foot shift no tongue on the lips no looking away and also mr packer we cant figure out what cruncher sorry mr dubbs was doing there a dangerous place like that why would he have been in bosnia the door was closed in his face early summer who is he it is husein bekir what does he think hes doing i think hes bringing apple trees he tried to bring them last autumn but the water rose too quickly and defeated him it is the first time the water has been down tell him to go back the regular army unit had moved into ljut the previous afternoon and in the early evening the captain vokic had used the time to reconnoitre the land leading down from the village to the natural barrier of the river his orders stated that he should prepare the village as a defensive position and deny the enemy the chance to take it and so dominate the road behind in the late evening a woman had come down the hill to dragan kovacs house and cooked a meal for him and the retired policeman then the two men had sat on the porch waved away the flies and drunk brandy captain vokic was a professional soldier of the yugoslav national army looking on to the valley in the falling light he had been struck both by its beauty and by the simplicity of its defence at first light while dragan kovac still snored on a cot bed in the living room the captain had risen from his hosts bed offered to him with enthusiasm washed shaved and eaten a plate of bread cheese and an apple he had gone up to the village and found his senior nco and a detail of troops commandeered two wheelbarrows and supervised the unloading of the mines from the lorries into the wheelbarrows an old tractor pulling a rattling trailer was coming down the road beyond the river heading for the ford where the river flow boiled and charged over the shallow stones it came towards the fields in front of where the retired policeman now stood beside the captain in the sunshine the fields glistened with dew and the light caught the brightness of the wild flowers he has bought the fields they belong to him he bought them and his grandfather and his grandfathers grandfather he does not come across the river tell him dragan kovac did as he was ordered by the captain he cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed into the earlymorning air his friend husein bekir was not permitted to cross the ford and should go back but the tractor kept coming the instruction was ignored the captain peered through his binoculars into the earlymorning light he saw a short thin little man hunched over the tractor wheel the exhaust fumes hung in a trail behind the tractors slow advance it kept on coming towards the bunica river i think he is deaf i think he cannot hear me over the noise of the tractor the captain turned pointed to the rifle slung on a soldiers shoulder then reached out his hand for it he took it armed it heard the bullet engage in the breech depressed the safety and aimed the retired policeman protested he is a friend he is deaf he owns the fields dragan kovac was not to know that the aim taken by the captain was into mud and grass on the track in front of the tractor the captain squinted over the open sights then fired a single shot his shoulder rocked on the recoil there was a momentary disturbance in the track five or six paces in front of the tractor but the high velocity bullet did not bury itself a spent force in mud it hit a smoothed stone and ricocheted upwards into the tractors radiator the tractor jerked to a halt the bullets discharge echoed through the valley and then silence the bullet had killed the engine silence hung over them and over the dark ploughed fields the lush green meadows the vineyard that needed weeding and where posts and wires needed maintenance over the water in the river and over the villages of ljut and vraca the war had now been alive in sarajevo for a month on that day in sarajevo eight civilians would be killed and fortynine injured by shells fired from tanks and artillery the airport was closed the maternity hospital lost power until barrels with a precious two hundred litres of kerosene were fed into an emergency generator residential areas came under sustained attack tickets were issued that day for the rationing of basic foods but it had been the first shot fired over the valley a few metres short of the ford the old man sat starkly upright on his motionless tractor you think he can hear you now i dont know the retired policeman said sourly try tell him he should go back tell him that if he approaches the river again he will be shot tell him this side of the river is now a prohibited area under the control of the military dragan kovac shouted into the silence he had no heart in what he was ordered to do yet he was not a sensitive enough man to feel that the one shot had destroyed perhaps fatally the innocence of the valley in which he had spent his life and which was home to husein bekir his friend across the river heard him out then stood on the tractors footplates and shook his fist at them before trying to start the tractor again there was neither a cough from the tractors engine nor a turnover whine he watched the farmer step down clumsily then turn away and start to trudge back towards his home and his village i dont think you need me dragan kovac said grimly correct i dont but there is something you should not forget we are here for your protection if we are not here they will come across in the night and slit your throats as you sleep and if they let you live you will be the servants of their religion you will be dominated by fundamentalists i suppose s o what the officer said was only what they were forever repeating on tv and the radio he saw the diminishing back of husein bekir and the tractor marooned near the river then went back to his home the captain supervised the laying of the mines the previous evening he had drawn a closedetail map of the village the track down to the river the fields the mulberry tree and the riverbank the two wheelbarrows carried fortyseven mines and when each one was buried he drew a circle to identify its resting place on the map that filled the greater part of the printed page marked zapisnik minskoeksplozivne prepreke mep thirtyone of the mines were designated as pma the remaining sixteen were classified as pmr they were antipersonnel mines first the pmas were buried they were circular painted browngreen and ten centimetres in diameter they went into shallow pits scooped out by trowels so that only the threecentimetrewide sixpointed crown protruded they would take a fivekilo pressure to detonate ninety grams of hexogentnt at a metre on exploding they were reckoned fatal at five metres they would maim and mutilate at twentyfive metres they were ineffective the captain had six locations for them they were settled in the ground position noted then armed no mine markers or fences needed to be placed around them the soldiers who would guard the village knew where they were the pmrs required more care to site they stood thirty centimetres off the ground and were fastened to a wooden holding stake from each the soldiers played out twentyfive metres of fine wire tightened it then staked the end the tripwire taut was six inches above the ground inside the ribbed metal container which would fragment into shrapnel was a core of tnt they could kill anyone within a twentyfive metre radius of the detonated charge the positioning of each was marked on the captains map and the location of two proms and their tripwires as the war stretched out its greedy arms to them the villages and the valley were now contaminated chapter three what are you going to do go on or step back im thinking at a few minutes short of five oclock in the morning the sparrows tits and chaffinches were starting to sing and with the smear of grey softening the citys lights mister paced in the back garden the princess was now beside him she had been to bed had woken found he wasnt beside her panicked before clarity took over from the weariness thrown on her dressinggown and come to find him he did most of his thinking in the back garden and made all of his calls on the mobile phones from behind the screen of conifers that would block out their cameras can you do it without cruncher she murmured he was two years younger than cruncher at school he had made the money and cruncher had been his banker he had put the frighteners on the kids and theyd taken money from home and cruncher had minded it for him and told him where to put it good old conservative cruncher then aged fifteen had put his first hundred and his first thousand into channel islandbased bonds a numbered anonymous account hed lost touch with cruncher when hed gone to the youngoffenders prison and cruncher had moved out of attlee house if cruncher had been physically strong and a hard man he would eventually have taken over his parents fruit and vegetable stall in dalston market if hed had money real money he would have gone off to accountancy school he hadnt been strong hadnt had the resources so hed taken a flat south of the river and a clerks job in the city the way cruncher told it the supervising clerk was embezzling and doing it cleverly because when the books bounced the blame seemed to fall at crunchers feet a fraud conviction had put cruncher into pentonville and an old friendship had been resumed mister and hed always acknowledged it was fascinated in pentonville and afterwards by crunchers encyclopedic knowledge of the routes for moving covert money the day after hed been released two weeks before cruncher came out hed gone down to a suburban blackheath road kicked in the supervising clerks door beaten the man half to death good enough for him never to work again and cruncher had become his man i never backed off is it that important to you seems to be but youve never done anything big and this is the biggest without cruncher cruncher organized the network of bankers and dealers who would ignore the disclosure regulations and flush the money into the legal financial system cruncher liked to say that the size of the globe had been reduced to that of a computer screen accounts were held in the caymans cyprus panama mexico nigeria venezuela and canada and still there was the old jersey nestegg cruncher talked a language foreign enough to mister of cost flow franchising front companies and offshore half the year cruncher was in the air or swanning in the best hotels on misters business moving money and identifying the property investments that the eagle made legitimate if there had been records available to public scrutiny and there were not mister would have figured on any list of great britains top twenty for wealth it had been crunchers idea that he should move on soar upwards do his biggest deal the thought of the deal in the eight months in brixton had sustained mister have to learn then wont i like the start again of the good days the best days the good days the best days the days he loved were the early ones when he had made his turf sacred and cut down the legs of rivals the days of security vans and factory payrolls monitoring the competitors to rip off their trade enforcing respect with the sawnoff shotguns and magnum pistols buying the first drinking clubs the first bars and the first property in the marinas down on the south coast hed made the money cruncher had rinsed it and the eagle had kept him out of the courts the best days when he was on the rise to the top and rivals capitulated were heady and exhilarating then the plateau more than three years back he had realized he was going nowhere no more raids and ripoffs because from the middle eighties when mister was in his early thirties the trade had turned to importation distribution and dealing heroin had made the serious money that cruncher had laundered heroin from afghanistan imported into the country by the turks from green lanes down the road from the north circular had brought in the big money and the plateau had been reached when the competition had been wiped out mister ran the capitals supply some that went to birmingham a bit of what went to liverpool and manchester and most of what went to newcastle the only time since he had been on the plateau that he had been handson in a car and taking a sack of stuff to a warehouse he had been identified and lifted he hadnt needed to be handson but it was boredom that had put him in the car in the best days he had been in sole control and cruncher and the eagle had fed off him on the plateau there had been little for him to do but read the balance sheets that cruncher presented to him and authorize the contracts the eagle prepared he couldnt even spend the money because both chorused that yachts villas private jets and stakes in football clubs led to investigation and downfall the week before his arrest cruncher had come to him with the plan for the deal and the boredom had been stifled killed scraped out of his system the mobile in his pocket warbled quietly he snapped it on he listened then he said im sorry but i dont know what youre talking about you must have a wrong number he switched it off and pocketed it it was what the eagle told him he should always say when the crime squad man called him there was a thin smile on his face the guy who came tonight hes been fired hes finished his time ran out at midnight im still target one but his teams wound up her fingers touched his face youre the top man youre untouchable youre walking rings round them target one he mused rolled it round his tongue and the church teams finished cant do anything about it not right now but crunchers pad has to be clean mister knew everything of crunchers life he knew of crunchers three loves rentboys luxury and the handling of money he tolerated the homosexuality allowed the luxury and marvelled at the expertise in handling money the police would be crawling through the terraced docklands house he had to hope that the records had been stored safely in the safetydeposit boxes of the small private banks to which only he and cruncher had the passwords and entrycode numbers he didnt think that cruncher before he went away would have left behind evidence that would incriminate him or worse lead to the sequestration of his assets so im going to go with it mister said its what i want ill make a coffee dont think im not sorry about cruncher but i feel good on the first train of the day that clattered down the tracks south from glasgow a tall elderly man with a stooping walk came back to his seat from the buffet car his seat was in standard class his rank in customs amp excise entitled him to pullman or firstclass travel a full english breakfast in the restaurant and complimentary newspapers but it was his style that he claimed the minimum of available expenses the habit was unsettling to his juniors and frowned on by his more senior colleagues he revelled in the discomfort he caused he would not have admitted it to anyone he worked with but he rather prized the ability to create discomfort no one in the national investigation service whether drunk or hallucinating would ever suggest there was a possibility that this senior investigation officer had his price in work practice he was regarded as a dinosaur from before the stone age but his incorruptibility was guaranteed he had demanded and reluctantly been given a receipt for the single beaker of coffee he settled into his seat a young mother was breastfeeding beside him a businessman opposite shouted into his mobile he shared footspace with a student whod spread textbooks across the common table he travelled light in the rack above him were a small tartan sports bag and a waxed green coat a thin briefcase lay on the table close to his hand as if it were the only thing of importance he had brought with him he wore highly bossed but worn brown brogues a heavy check shirt a quiet braid tie and a threepiece suit of grey tweed with green flecks an antique gold watchchain hung across his upper abdomen the mother the businessman and the student would have been hard put to place him in society from an inside pocket he took a slim ancient flask and poured a dash of malt into the railway coffee sipped it growled in quiet satisfaction then clamped an unlit pipe in his mouth he unzipped his briefcase and took out a single sheet of paper faxed to him the previous evening after he had been called to london it was the preliminary report on a drowning in the river running through sarajevo late summer when dawn came the soldiers were nervous and tired after a night of standingto an explosion had initiated the alert dragan kovac found captain vokic by the well he saw the bags under his bleary eyes the retired policeman no longer lived in his own home he had been told it was too dangerous for him to stay there now that paramilitary bandits had moved into the village across the river and he lodged with his nephew his nephews wife and their children an awkward arrangement the captain now slept in one of the two stone and heavytimber bunkers had made a command post in the dank interior of the other kovac had come to resent the presence of captain vokic in the community because he the leader was relegated in importance all decisions affecting the village and its life were taken by the captain not that there was great life in the village the younger men had all been taken into the serb army and were scattered through bosnia and many of the younger women had left for the heartland of their own people far distant from the uncertainties of the wars front line dragan kovac asked for and was grudgingly given the captains binoculars he stared out into a blur before the captain irritably showed him the focus ring clarity came he was looking at the home of his former friend husein bekir when he talked with the old men and women who were left in ljut or his nephew or the young soldiers it was always of the enemy across the valley and the atrocities that they would commit if they were ever able to come in strength over the bunica river there had been no contact with the men and women of vraca since the soldiers had come to ljut he could see the smoke rising from the chimneys children playing and men with rifles sitting idly on stones smoking or reading he did not see husein bekir though he searched for him among the cattle and the sheep that scavenged the poor ground on that side of the river for fodder if he had not had the binoculars he would not have seen lila huseins wife and then he would not have thought of the man whose home faced his he handed them back to the captain what happened in the night a mine exploded did they try to come through captain i dont know perhaps the soldiers are scared like women dragan kovac said dismissively of course they are frightened they are not like the regulars who first came here they are not even conscripts they are village boys all they have of the army is the uniform always i am asked to send more men away for transfer to a more important front line i dont think that we could resist an attack pressed with determination how do you give them courage i put out more mines the more mines they have in front of them the braver they are later in the morning the soldiers carried forward two sacks of prom mines the captain fretted around them in the long grass of the grazing fields in the weeds that had grown up in the ploughed fields and in the overgrown vineyards the proms were bigger more lethal a few were buried in holes hacked out of the grass and weeds so that only four stubby prongs were visible before the plants were worked back over them and they were hidden they would be activated by nine kilos of pressure more were attached to short stakes and had a tripwire leading from the antenna to a second stake they also would be hidden when the grass and weeds grew and were activated by a threekilo vigorous tug on the wire among the military men on both sides of the war the prom was the most feared on firing a first charge threw the explosive capsule nearly a metre into the air then came the main detonation the shrapnel would fly out at a level to hit the genitals or soft lower belly of the victim it was deadly if he had not had the detail of his map the captain would not have been able to take his soldiers down into the fields where the fallen grass and yellowing seeding weeds covered that earlier sowing fourteen new mines were planted to stiffen the morale of the young soldiers and the location of each was added to the captains map the pollution of the valley had spread and other than the map there was no evidence of it we found where the mine exploded but there was no blood there no pieces the captain later told dragan kovic i think it was an animal probably moving too low on its stomach for the shrapnel you should go you know you should leave it is not safe here its my home the retired policeman said i have heard on the radio i am transferring in the morning to sarajevo the captain stood outside his bunker you will not have a professional to protect you only an idiot from foca some untrained kids and a minefield on arrival at heathrow airport the body was hijacked the slip of paper that authorized its removal was illegibly signed but that was good enough for the london firm of undertakers the hearse drove away empty from cargo and a closed van took the lined casket to the pathology wing of the west middlesex hospital the man requested by the home office to carry out the postmortem was an expert in the study of corpses retrieved from the water it was said of him that if there were a chance of the cause of death being learned suicide accident or murder he would find it on a quiet saturday morning the professor of pathology waited for the trolley to be wheeled into his workplace and for the casket to be unscrewed that weekend randomly chosen pubs and the back rooms of the spieler turkishowned cafes in green lanes were used by mister for meetings he set his business operations back on course on the doors and in the alleyways at the rear and side of these buildings were his cards shipments movements were authorized and tables were piled with envelopes of banknotes as debts and obligations were called in summoned by staccato calls on mobile phones men came to pay court to mister and wished him well he spoke little but that was his way there were three patients now in the capital citys intensivecare beds sufficient to emphasize his aura of power for fourteen hours on the saturday and a further thirteen hours the following day a man in a flecked tweed suit sat undisturbed and unseen in the small backroom annexe behind the chief investigation officers suite and pored over the papers profiles and tape transcripts concerning the life and times of albert william packer through saturday day and night and sunday joey cann sat listlessly in the bedsit that was his south london home or slept fitfully the telephone in the groundfloor hall two floors below never rang for him neither did his mobile on the saturday afternoon he should have been on the touchline watching jen play hockey but hed not gone and without explanation hed cut the clubhouse disco in the evening on sunday he should have been in somerset for his mothers birthday lunch but hed rung to say he had a cold and didnt want to pass it on the photograph of the arrest was now sellotaped to the wall at the foot of his bed there was a crowded schedule for henry arbuthnot in the surrey countryside where nobody had heard of the eagle pigeon shooting on saturday morning vulgar but useful for keeping the eye in practice for the serious matter of the pheasant season a moment of respite before spending the next day with maureen and the girls at the chiddingfold hunters gymkhana where his eldest banked on a rosette and then a couple of solitary hours in his study to prepare for mondays early journey to london a charitys lorry was loaded at the back of a villages church hall in the east midlands with boxes of woollens and castoff clothes for adults and outgrown toys for children an answer to a begging advertisement placed in a local newspaper for a haulage transporter to offer the charity a lorry had been answered by a mr duncan dubbs two months before not only would a lorry be provided at no expense to help those needy and unhappy people in the heart of europe but a driver too and mr dubbs had told the organizing committee that he hoped to be able to add to their generosity with clothes and toys his own community had gathered together a sudden squalling blizzard hit sarajevo the mountains were masked by greyblack cloud the streets were icy and treacherous in premature darkness gloom and danger fell across the city and the river running through it rose to a spiteful torren t crossing the main road cautiously into the city frank williams had reached the offices of the judge hed skipped indoor football over the weekend and instead had finalized the pouch of reports relating to the retrieval of a body from the miljacka river one more signature and the matter was closed the judges chambers were a chaotic mass of paper and the man was distracted he needed one more signature received it and then there was a final tying up of loose ends frank was given three eyewitness statements the testimonies of three citizens of the city who had told local police that they had actually seen a man staggering from a nightclub restaurant beside the river then leaning alone over the rail of the bridge and the last witness had heard a dull splash well done the local boys he thought good initiative good enterprise a welcome change in return he gave the judge a telephone number that had been retrieved from a notepad found beside the bed in the hotel room a finn he worked with had known the technique of covering paper with the finest grains of black powder to identify the indentation of writing on the lower sheets of a pad after the upper sheets had been used and destroyed they shook hands she found joey in the unlit room lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling she would not have seen him but for the streetlights that beamed through the window the bed had not been made and it was now middle evening the room was usually a temple to orderliness her eyes roved over the dirty coffee mugs tinfoil containers from a takeaway curry empty beer bottles and typed papers scattered on the carpet she had her own keys to the front door of the house and to the room on the second floor they all said the girls in her team that she was lunatic to keep the relationship going they were right and she didnt listen she saw the picture on the wall it was new hadnt been there last week he shouldnt have stuck the photograph to the wall it wasnt fair on violet whod put up good expensive wallpaper for her tenant normally she would have said it was a damn fine room airy and light in the daytime and even felt something like home when the curtains were drawn but this evening in the shadows cast by the orange streetlighting it seemed to her to hold a threat she looked back at the picture as if it were the source not the mess on the floor and joey prone on his unmade bed the room conspired to frighten her how long have you been here he did not answer his eyes held a point on the ceiling im speaking to you joey how long have you been like this the silence beat back at her joey im not asking much arent i entitled to expect an answer to a civil question entitled or not she thought she saw a brutishness in his face and something cruel at his mouth joey dont mind me youre being pathetic you dont want me here right im going not that she did the other girls said she was attractive and could have done better it wasnt love between them not the sort of love shed read of in the magazines from her teenage days it was just something bloody comfortable and shed learned to exist alongside the variations of rudeness or indifference theyd met when hed been sent to the school to liaise with the headteacher about setting up a remote surveillance camera in the roof space above the science block that would monitor a house across the road from the schools front gate shed had a free period and been deputed to show him the attic trap door shed liked him immediately and liked more the boyish shyness with which hed asked to see her again god the ground didnt move under them but they slept together went to the cinema together and watched tv together the last two years before and after the arrest of the man sellotaped to the wallpaper shed come to the empty more often than not room cleaned and cooked and sometimes taken his washing to the launderette all the other girls said she was an idiot she knew the answer but asked havent you been to work today not wanted told to go home put my feet up they said relax enjoy myself think about something else so here i am she was always couldnt help herself most an idiot when he seemed so vulnerable she doubted anyone else in the world saw the fractured weak aspect of him for two years he had been unable to think to her knowledge of anything else when they were together shed shared him with sierra quebec golf what a stupid name no hobbies no interests some of the men she worked with were into sport or photography hill rambling boozing or skirtchasing he only had his team and his target she didnt count against his team or the man whose photograph was on the wall she sat on the bed beside him whats special about him she took his hand why does he matter so much with her thumb and forefinger she kneaded the rough skin on the back of his hand isnt it just another job another day while she held his hand she turned away from his face and the pain she saw there and looked up at the photograph is it because of corruption shed hit the cord his fingers jerked tightly around her hand and his nails gouged her his mouth slackened then tightened in a spasm did he buy his way out thats the worst isnt it corruption hurts most yes he loosened her hand corruptions the worst right youre all looking at each other all tainted by suspicion i suppose men come in and search the files go through all your assessments get the computers to hack into your bank accounts and look at what car youre driving what your mortgage or your rent is pry into your lives theres no answer to it is there cant get rid of the smell trusts gone im sorry joey believe me i dont know what else i can say she knew the way from what hed told her no confidences but the basics that the investigation had involved the national crime squad the national criminal intelligence service and of course the crown prosecution service and the national investigation service ferocity in her voice dont let anyone ever say it was you dont let anyone ever say the bastard bought you or frightened you she pushed herself up from the bed stamped to the door switched on the light then went back across the room to the window where she ripped the curtains shut she seemed to smack her hands together as if it were time to start afresh she had her back to him as she crouched on the carpet and started to pull together the scattered papers and pack them away haphazardly any old order into the file boxes then dropped the lot of them beside the door he didnt protest had turned to face the wall she went to the cupboard under the sink retrieved a bin bag and stuffed the takeaway tinfoil boxes into it she swept up the bottles and dumped them too into the bag the mugs went into the sink the clothes from the floor and the shoes she threw headlong into the back of the wardrobe she rinsed the mugs and his knife and fork then banged them down on the drainingboard she took the vacuum cleaner out of the cupboard beside the shelf on which his crockery was stacked and ran it over the carpet searching for rice grains dust purging the room she went to the bed caught at his tshirt and spilled him off it onto the floor she made the bed smacked the creases out of the blankets sheets and pillows then turned to face the picture on the wall she reached up to it and carefully so that violets wallpaper would not be damaged freed it from the floral pattern she held it in her hands and her fingers quivered that bastard doesnt own you joey she hissed you leave him there and the bastard dominates you watches over you dont let him joey or hell destroy you he may think the fucking bastard that he can buy anybody frighten anybody but not you joey hes a piece of shit she was crying as she tore the picture into pieces and flung them into the rubbish bag how is it that people like that can have such power the tears streamed down her face she shrugged into her coat the telephone was ringing in the hall downstairs she closed the door after her and stumbled down the stairs with the rubbish bag joeys landlady violet was speaking into the phone his workplace you say right ill go and get him its two flights of stairs so itll be a moment she should have done it herself should have gone back up the stairs and saved the elderly lady the trudge but she could not face the doom atmosphere of his room again she went out into the street and dropped the bin bag into the dustbin but she knew that the mans power remained in the room with joey he sauntered a pace behind atkins his armourer for a man hard to surprise it was an eyeopening experience mister had never before been to anything like the defence systems and equipment international exhibition outside the spring morning tipped with rain atkins had picked him up at a service station on the north side of the motorway ringing london and brought him down in the fourwheel drive theyd been clogged in traffic as theyd approached the site and had crawled past demonstrators at the gate hemmed in by a police cordon as they held up placards denouncing the death supermarket that he was there that the arrangements had been put in place was a reflection of his confidence in the eagles assurance that he would walk from the old bailey he seldom spoke but he listened his armourer knew enough to initiate conversations that he thought mister would be interested to hear but not to involve or introduce him they went down the aisles between stands that displayed the pride of military hardware everything was on show from tanks and armoured cars to titaniumplated aircraft cockpits rotating helicopter mounts for rapidfiring triplebarrel machineguns protective clothing for troops in a chemicalwarfare environment land air and sealaunched missiles at the main door as their entry passes were processed atkins had asked what in particular mister just what im getting had been the laconic reply in how long no hurry in the past he had taken the princess to the ideal home exhibition and the motor show not a lot of difference from behind the stands salesmen who hooked on to any interest darted out and tried to pressure drinks into hands but they stayed dry atkins knew enough of mister to know that alcohol was frowned on mister had made a major financial commitment to what he was getting but he regarded it as necessary if the deal were to go through the deal had been crunchers concept it was all about peace mister noted peacekeeping peace enforcement peace maintenance were the slogans of the day he didnt hear the word kill or read it he hung back when atkins met a general hed served under and who knew his father hello hello how are things going now that youre out struggling along sir but not too bad sir cant complain its an eyeopener sir but i havent seen a bayonet its all so damned sophisticated easy to forget that fighting is done by men the better the equipment you give your men the bigger the chance that itll crash if it crashes hes lost in real combat its man against man but all the foreign people want is the best so they can drool over it and hope to god they never have to use it must be getting along jolly good to see you they came to a mockup of a frontier post where the british army were fighting for peace he looked over the landrover with the machinegun mounted a sniper in a gillie suit and a mortar team in front of him were a cluster of tiny asians chinese and thais and towering over them were their escort officers they were looking down misters eyes ducked and atkins eased the smallbuilt men a little to the side did it with care so that no offence was given prone on the ground in front of the frontier post were two camouflaged soldiers who made a tableau with a squat thuggish piece of gear mounted on a shallow tripod the dull light reflected from the launchers lens a sergeant was telling the asians the qualities of the antitank weapon system destroys tanks helicopters and bunkers can fire up to three per minute aim point is hit point and its effective up to yards you can change target during the missiles flight and because of its lowlaunch velocity the chance of detection and countermeasures is minimal it has a doublecharge warhead for penetration packs a hell of a punch misters question was whispered is that what im getting the mediumrange trigat mr trigat thats what youre getting sorry thats what youve got its an excellent weapon mister the best of its kind he had absorbed everything he had heard en route to bosnia was a weapon that could not be afforded locally that was sophisticated and would be a prized symbol of superiority on one of his rare visits to brixton cruncher had told him that he should take with him gear that would turn heads the gear was an offering a gift so cruncher had explained it to convince doubters that mister was top league when mister came bearing gifts he would be listened to he was going to ride on the back of the mr trigat it was heavy stuff new to anything he had had before atkins the armourer had provided him in the past with uzis and glocks skorpions hecklers and a kalashnikov and with twoounce measures of semtex explosive to blow a reinforced warehouse door for a protege he liked atkins nine years in the royal green jackets with a final rank of captain the mans leaving his regiment in the wake of a scandal impregnating a brigadiers daughter and running from the consequences then setting up as a freelance military consultant had slotted in well with misters plans atkins had a mannered drawl offhand but he took no liberties and he delivered atkins had also done time in bosnia mister had no complaints atkins had suggested the way to acquire four mr trigat launchers and twenty missiles as well as seven handsets and the control unit for an ittbuilt advanced tactical communications system combining data and voicenetwork capability and security when mister travelled he would be well laden with gifts he did not understand how the antitank weapon or the communications system worked but that didnt leave him with any feeling of inferiority the gifts guaranteed that he would win a hearing and respect cruncher had been laying the ground what about lunch mister youve seen about everything other than the openair displays but theres no call for you to get soaked i expect itll be a salmon steak in the vip restaurant why not he could beat the legal system and he could buy into supplies of the latest most restricted military equipment and they could not touch him tell me all this stuff here who are the customers other than you mister theyre governments thats the level this place is at the pathologist had few illusions as to the technical knowledge of those who would read his reports so he doubled up one report for men and women with a medical and forensic background and a second for policemen security service officers civil servants from the home office and customs amp excise the second report for laypersons explained the finding of a narrow bruised contusion at an upper position at the back of the cadavers dubbss neck the blow causing the contusion would have been sufficient in the pathologists opinion to cause death or at least total disablement it followed that the cadaver could not in the pathologists opinion have then mounted a railing or a wall and pitched himself into the river an intervening paragraph stated that the injury had not been sustained during the cadavers journey down the river the halfpage report concluded the blow was probably effected with the heel of a hand by a man of considerable strength and with a knowledge of where to strike assume he is trained or has familiarized himself with the techniques of unarmed combat as taught to special forces conclusion murder after anxiously telephoning the chief investigation officer a civil servant agreed to follow the unusual and possibly illegal road of withholding the postmortems findings sine die rank was pulled the civil servant was left in no doubt as to the importance of the connections of the cio and his whitehall influence and took a sensible course the pathologists conclusion would not enter the public domain hardly a month went by without the cio telling colleagues theres no point having authority if youre not prepared to exercise it the final twisting of the civil servants arm close to verbal breakingpoint was the cios clear message that the findings represented a matter of national security both reports technical and laypersons were locked away you come with a backpack of recommendations i didnt put them there the chief investigation officer dennis cork poured tea from a silver pot into a bonechina cup he held up the milk jug an invitation but across the desk there was a shake of the head he pointed to the lemon slices but there was a handgestured refusal he passed the black tea to his guest it was passed back ill take three sugars please three sugar cubes went into the cup it was returned then stirred vigorously thank you its the way my father always took it the recommendations wrap round and protect a considerable reputation thats for others to say and i dont believe compliments sincere or otherwise ever contributed much the cio liked him his office was temperaturecontrolled a new system hed had put in when the suite was refurbished at expense enabled him to be shirtsleeved and comfortable he thought it displayed eccentricity and character that the guest still wore the heavy tweed jacket and the buttoned waistcoat with its watchchain they were bright eyes facing him a little rheumy with age but they were hard and when they were fastened on him he found them difficult to meet youve read yourself in ive read as much as i can in two and a half days of a threeyear investigation its wounded us when a man like that walks its always hurtful particularly if you have to account for the expenditure if the cio had been looking to be rewarded with sympathy he would have been disappointed he doubted this man was big on commiseration it was hardness he wanted and chilling coldness and leadership he pressed on you are fiftynine years old facing retirement you have done us the kindness of travelling south at short notice personal inconvenience and now i am asking you it is a request to spend a few weeks maybe a month of your last year with us to squat down here a last tilt at packer while the irons still moderately warm if you know what i mean if it all goes cold then it might be years before i can justify the same level of resources to target him a final throw will you it was a plea for help he was offering the best and most responsible job in the service and the most difficult short of getting down on bended bloody knee he could hardly have gilded that particular lily further the guest pondered took his time it seemed an age the cio drummed carelessly at his desk top with a pencil a frown had cut the mans forehead his fingers were locked together and creaked as he opened and closed the palms of his hands then he sipped the tea and made up his mind my way without let or hindrance any way you want within the law i dont know how often youll get backup there theyll still be there when ive finished the cio imagined mountains and sea cliffs that were as remote and inhospitable as the eyes that were again locked on him the file told him this dour man spent his weekends away on a peninsula up the northwest coast from glasgow he supposed a flight of fancy that the terrain and the seascape harsh and without charity had moulded the character of the man the response was a challenge itll be a new team agreed chosen by me from outside london from outside the custom house agreed he started to beam his charm but with one exception im not hearing you he hadnt wanted to recruit an easy man to take over sierra quebec golf he wanted a man who was contrary awkward and dogmatic a man who bullied a new team from outside london chosen by you is what youll get with one exception im not a negotiator the response rasped back was immediate the record says which is why youre here that you dont compromise the one exception i think you should consider it was described to me as an arrogant shite at least meet him joey cann sat alone in the room with the empty lockers clean walls and blank computer screens and waited he did not know what to expect chapter four his head rested on his hands in front of the screen he heard the door open and the beat of heavy shoes on the floor he felt the presence of the man behind him are you joey cann thats right the names douglas gough dougie to friends but slow to make them he had used a cold pebblerattling voice it took joey a few sharp seconds to realize why there was no warmth they were not friends pals chums mates he had been told during the phone call bringing him in from the cios personal assistant that a new team would reactivate sierra quebec golf and that he was to meet and brief the teamleader replacing finch he thought that the banter wit and crack of the old team was dead he turned to face gough and saw no welcome offered him im lumbered with you dont expect me to apologize i was told i needed you because youre the archivist i know more about it than anyone else and that youre an arrogant shite i do my job as best i can the best is only adequate go short of the best and youre out on your neck thank you he meant it joey felt a surge of gratitude and relief in his room over the weekend he had lain on his bed toyed with a takeaway sipped and not enjoyed his beers and imagined a life divorced from albert william packer anything hed thought other than the work around packer would be secondrate he noticed the scrubbed clean babylike outofdoors complexion of gough the skin on his cheeks veined was the same as his fathers down on the estate in somerset the shoes polished and cracked were the same as his father wore and the suit when his father went up to the house to meet with the owners there was the scrape of a match then the face was diffused behind pipesmoke a gravelled question how did you come in joey i walked to the underground took a tube from tooting bee to bank then walked did you see any soldiers no did you see any police with guns no did you go through any roadblocks were you bodysearched did you have to produce id i didnt this is just so that we understand each other so you get to appreciate where im coming from and where im going to if the threat were terrorism a similar threat a threat on the scale we face now and today then there would have been troops on the streets guns blocks and identity checks headlines in papers worried faces on tv pundits chattering but its not terrorism its crime at the height of a terrorist campaign assassinations and bombs in railway stations how many people get hurt get killed ten a year maximum ten what im saying joey terrorism is pine martens piss compared with the threat of crime where i come from where i was reared we have a small church a free church that makes a deal of laughter from people who dont know us our church believes in the power of evil we dont make excuses for evil we believe it should be cut out root and branch then burned crime is narcotics narcotics are evil they kill and they destroy they threaten our values there are no sunlit uplands in crime fighting no bayonet charges heroic it is n o t do you get where im coming from and where im going i think so do you think im a mad daft beggar i think id feel privileged to work on your team you can walk now id like to stay why did the case go down all the usual suspects incompetence intimidation and corruption listen hard to me young man we are losing the war against the importation of class a drugs with our seizures we are not even touching the customers supplies we are incapable of creating shortages on the street we are hemmed in by the restrictions of legal process by the decisions of the european court of human rights and we can shrug and walk away and say tomorrowll be better it wont itll be worse i dont accept that i have to win joey and i will walk over people in my way to do it ill walk over you if i have to and not break stride whats going on now the volume of narcotics importation shames us itll destroy us its a cancer in us ill tell you what i like when a judge says fifteen years take him down what i like better is when the guy then turns and shouts ill fucking kill you see if i wont if you go after them hard you break the power without the power theyre rubbish you bin rubbish when the pressure is exerted on an evil man he makes mistakes when he makes mistakes you have to be there you may be arrogant you may have an attitude problem but it means nothing to me as long as youre going to be there and ready when the mistakes made joey said i want to be part of that being there do me a cartwheel joey switched on the computer a cartwheel was a diagram to show the organization of a criminal enterprise he drew a box in the centre of the screen he typed the two names in the centre of the box mister and the princess hes always called mister its the code on the phones and how he expects to be addressed we think it started off as respect he wanted to be mister packer shes primrose her code and what he calls her is the princess shes a part of his firm talked to and trusted he doesnt play about hes totally loyal to her joey drew a circle around the box and then the spokes from the box to the circle he typed at the end of a spoke the cruncher all the prime associates are coded names the number cruncher the accountant duncan dubbs he does the finance on every significant deal wasnt at the old bailey he was passed a sheet of paper by gough his brow furrowed as he read the pathologists report the laypersons version i dont understand what was for them in sarajevo itll keep go on he typed another name henry arbuthnot is the eagle thats legal eagle hes the solicitor on retainer and he does all the contracts more names and more spokes and the cartwheel formed joey said that atkins the soldier tommy atkins was bruce james exroyal green jackets the armourer who produced the weapons used by the cards the cardmenhardmen who were the enforcers and he named the three principals then there was the mixer mixerfixer who acted as the firms general manager and made the routine arrangements he drew the last spoke line and he wrote in the eels eels is wheels thats billy smith and jason tyrie they drive for him theyre both from the block he grew up in and both from pentonville days thats the inner team oh and theres a name i dont have and a code its the information spoke might be us or the crime squad and its important its on the inside gough gazed down at the cartwheel the drawing represented the fruits of joeys life over the last weeks months years the cartwheel was the obsession that held him the hook had caught him from the first day he had been given the archivist job in sierra quebec golf all the photographs and all the tape transcripts were on the computer but they neednt have been they were lodged in joey canns mind locked in that room with the screen for company he had learned more about mister than any of the men and women who had tracked the cars watched the house tried to follow the money and who could go out at the end and drink until they couldnt stand he had overheard it said but never to his face that it was obsession and sad joey thought he had been thrown a lifeline whats the weakest link there may be one but we never found it what i t h i n k what do you think joey he reckons hes beaten us and hell be running now to catch up on his life i think the weakest link is mister it was off his tongue and he wished he hadnt said it he looked at the cartwheel hed made laughing at him prettily from the computer screen and wondered whether gough thought him foolish he looked round to see if his opinion was sneered at but saw only goughs back going out im taking you with me mister said the eagles voice fluttered are you sure is that really necessary yes thats why im taking you dont you think id be more use here no or i wouldnt be taking you there were two locations where mister had always felt talk was safe one was the clerkenwell office of henry arbuthnot solicitor at law above the launderette under the terms of the published intrusive surveillance code of practice authorization for bugs and taps in premises where client met legal adviser could not be given by a policeman or a customs officer section paragraph demanded that authorization came from a commissioner section paragraph stated a commissioner was a person who holds or has held high judicial office and has been appointed by the prime minister for a term of years to undertake functions specified in part iii of the act police act serving and retired judges were likely the eagle swore to it most times out of ten to throw back the request the office was safe territory josh the clerk was making coffee and never came in before hed knocked and been told to enter we go on thursday mixers doing the tickets im not sure that ive the background or indeed the expertise required are you turning me down the eagle never disagreed with mister privately personally buried from sight he had been against the venture from the day the cruncher the barrowboy had raised it with mounting dismay he had noted misters evergrowing enthusiasm for the branchout into new territory he knew how far to go there was a line over which he would not step when he was maudlin worst when he took the mondaymorning train from guildford to london and left behind the comfort of his family his land and his home he thought of himself as a victim he could do his own deal of course and go queens evidence but he had no doubt that he would never live to enjoy the parts of his life that mattered to him the family the land the home he would be killed ruthlessly and painfully he knew what the cards did and he knew that mister was more vicious than the men he employed the eagle took the money and did what he was told to do howd you get that idea you want me to go with you i go its as simple as that just for a moment i thought the old eagle was giving me the shoulder never mister never in a million itll be a good trip he was a cautious man and saw the journey as danger there was the quiet cry of a mobile phone in the dull room coming back off the booklined walls and off the floor where the files were stacked the territory of grime and spiders he liked to work on his own ground where he had confidence he needed to be alongside a legal system that he could waltz around where rules were laid down that could be bent with ease and broken but he would not have dared to stand up in open opposition mister dragged the mobile out of his pocket listened expressionlessly then snapped it off got to be going something to be dealt with atkinsll be with us well talk yes mister ill be here and waiting just let me know where you want me the eagle understood but had little sympathy for the new restless drive he saw in mister himself he was tired looking for an easier road he shuddered at the thought of sarajevo he remembered the tv images of bodies and wreckage drunk teenagers with guns autumn it was first light when the troops began to come back over the river he had not seen the fighting but he had heard it husein bekir had let his wife go to their room and had refused her entreaties to follow her he had switched off the lights in the house wrapped himself in a thick coat and gone to sit on a fallen log that was halfway between his home and the well that served the village it was a bright night there was a star canopy and a wide moon it was a night when he would have backed his chances when he was younger of succeeding in hunting deer the troops came out from the trees behind vraca went through the village and down the track towards the ford earlier in the evening before the attack was launched an officer had come to him and expected him the patriarch authority of the village to tell where the mines were laid in defence of ljut that had been difficult for husein because there were friends from his whole life across the valley and he had pleaded that he was old and could not remember where he had seen them sown he had thought it the worst problem he had ever confronted telling where the mines were or not when he had heard from the darkness the crumpling echoing crack of the detonations earsplitting noise that blasted between the valleys walls and among the smallarms fire and the shouting and the officers whistle had been the awful humbling screaming as when the dogs caught a fox and could not kill it quickly no flares were used in the battle as he and his friend dragan kovac had been taught to use them when they had gone away for conscription training he had relied on his deteriorating hearing to follow the course of the fighting four men had been carried back from the far side of the river one had lost half a foot one the whole of a leg below the shred of his uniform trousers at the knee another as they had carried him held his hands across his stomach to keep in his intestines one had had the side of his face taken away all of them had screamed except the one with the stomach wound who called softly for his mother and the men who brought them back had cursed the mines from his place on the log he had known from the firing that the muslim troops had reached the village and then there had been a strange frightening quiet he had thought he heard but could not be certain shouts and cries from far away he had pulled the coat tighter around him and cupped a match in his hand to light a cigarette he had been careful not to betray his place with the cigarettes glow darkness had never in his life caused him worry often he had thought when he hunted or when he fished for the big trout in the river that the darkness was an ally that he was more familiar with the darkness than with the deer and the boar or the big trout but the quiet in the valley had been hard on him it had broken the battle had restarted husein bekir an old farmer but a shrewd man had imagination it would have been handtohand fighting at first but he could see nothing of it only hear the sound of it and then serb soldiers had driven the muslim troops back down the hill he had not needed to see it to understand what had happened they were in a straggling confused formation a rabble they were soaked from swimming their eyes shone and were wide and husein saw madness in their faces there were more wounded with them and he saw again the work of the mines the sight of the injuries troubled him because he had not said what he knew at dawn there was always in the autumn cold a mist low over the river and the fields and the troops emerged from it they seemed to bless the cover it gave them and some turned to fire their rifles uselessly through it back towards the village they had taken and lost they came past him and their madness made them shout obscenities towards the unseen enemy he saw a knife in a corporals belt dark blood stained the blade and more blood had dripped from it on to the upper trouser of the mans camouflage uniform husein bekir began to look at each man who passed him the dead carried over the shoulders the wounded brought back on litters and the men who were not dead and not maimed the officer came last husein bekir sat on his log lit another cigarette he could see as the mist cleared a pall of smoke over ljut the old gold of the trees behind the village the fallen yellow grass of the fields he had not ploughed that spring and the sagging weeds in his vineyard the house of his friend dragan kovac he asked did it go hard for you the officer stumbled he would have fallen from exhaustion but was able to collapse on to the log and his breath came in great heaving pants it was the mines because we did not know where they were i dont know i have to check i think i have twenty men not more killed or wounded and the mines would have been fifteen or fourteen what has happened to the people of ljut the village is cleaned it is no longer a threat to you the officer said husein thought of the blood he had seen on the knives and of the people of the village across the valley whom he had known did any escape a few ran away because we were held up some minutes by the bunkers most stayed in their homes in their cellars and you had time to find them before you were pushed back husein asked grimly we are a platoon and they were a company when the reinforcements came it was one man against three yes we found them in the cellars before that if i had wanted to stop the men i could not not after they had seen what the mines did husein gabbled his question was there a big man there a boar of a man he is a retired policeman big shoulders big stomach big moustache a leader did he escape is he alive if he ran away he is alive if n o t the officer shrugged and struggled to his feet i dont know i didnt see him there were many i did not see did not care to see when his wife came with coffee and a slim glass of brandy the old farmer told her that in the night the life of the valley had died she steadied his shaking hand so that he did not spill the coffee and he gulped the brandy he did not have to tell her because she knew it that it would have been the old people who had hidden in the cellars they knew it because on other mornings they had stared together across the valley and the river and seen the distant figures going about their lives the sun rose and threw clear long shadows from the trees on the far side of the valley he watched as the serb soldiers emerged from the smoke of the village with a wheelbarrow and heavy sacks he saw them fan out then gather in little groups and kneel more mines were sown in his fields to replace those detonated during the night and he tried to shut out the screams and the whimper of a young trooper who had held his stomach and asked for his mother dougie gough would go a long way for a good funeral if it were up on the ardnamurchan peninsula many times hed helped to carry the coffin from the free presbyterian chapel at kilchoan to the cemetery that was neatly cut out from a grazing field he liked to stand in that cemetery high over the sea that stretched across to mull and ponder on the life of a friend and fellow worshipper to feel the wind the rain or the sun on his face it was the best of places for a temporary parting and he always looked to the cliffs to see if an eagle hunted or over the water for a glimpse of a seal or a porpoise his faith gave him a sense of fatality and a feeling of inevitability that did not frighten him he had no fear of death or of hardship the lack of fear toughened him this though was a pathetic funeral he thought there was no dignity no love no respect at the crematorium the coffin carrying the stitched remains of duncan dubbs whom he now knew as the cruncher was wheeled into the chapel by strangers he stood at the back the coffin was followed by a couple in their seventies and he thought they understood nothing of their sons adult life only four women had taken places in front of gough the same age as the parents and two young men in loose gaudy shirts without jackets the vicar another stranger hurried through the service of committal gough thought the churchman knew little more of the dead man than his name and therefore fell back on to familiar ground duncan was above all a private man whose loyalties were primarily directed towards his beloved parents to whom he accorded all the love of which he was capable he was a popular and wellliked member of his community and will be sorely missed by his many friends a reedy hymn was sung as the curtains closed and without the vicars strength of voice the words would have been drowned out by the power playing of the female organist outside in light rain his waxed coat heavy over his tweed jacket he stood back and kept his distance as the mourners paused beside the show of flowers the parents gough reflected would now be millionaires from their sons last will and testament and the rentboys would be hoping that the suddenness of the crunchers death had not precluded generous bequests but he had come to see others and he was disappointed no packer and his wife no acolytes or enforcers an official gently but firmly hurried them on behind a low wall with a trellis above it supporting climbing roses a new funeral party was forming up the vicar sheltered under an umbrella was pleading urgent business elsewhere and shaking hands theyd stayed away in the car park the parents climbed into and were lost inside the big black limousine and the young men left by scooter he stayed put until a car on the far side of the car park had driven away hed seen the camera lens it would have been routine for the crime squad to send along a police photographer and he had no wish to be pictured and identified by them it was interesting to him that packer had stayed away it told him something of the coldness of the man and something of the care taken by him not to display himself he had learned from the funeral he said that thats what the little shit said mister tell me again what he said he said i can quote it because i heard it misters gone washed up history then he said misters not handson any longer you dont have to worry about mister anyone who pays him is chucking money at a hasbeen you just ignore mister its all gospel i heard georgie riley say it in intrusive surveillance code of practice section paragraph states any person giving an authorization for intrusive surveillance should first satisfy himherself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence no intrusion should be authorized which is out of proportion to the crime committed or planned this is especially the case where the subjects of the case might reasonably assume a high degree of privacy or where there are special sensitivities such as where the intrusion might affect communications between a minister of any religion or faith and an individual relating to that individuals spiritual welfare safer than the eagles office was the sacristy of a turnofthecentury brickbuilt church in hackney along with the vicar two churchwardens and a cleaner mister was a keyholder to the rear door of the church and the sacristy he had never worshipped there but his contributions to the upkeep of the grounds surrounding the building and the generosity of his donation to the roof fund ensured him access to a building where there was no possibility of bugs and taps i appreciate what youve told me in an east london pub a mediumscale importer dealing primarily in amphetamines ferried over the channel from holland with drink taken had shot off his mouth that man riley stood on a rung far below the one occupied by mister at that time he represented no threat to misters commercial dealings mister knew the way it worked because he had climbed that ladder himself and pitched off it men who had believed themselves superior it would start with talk then there would be the elbowing in on misters territory then he would similarly be thrown off the step to hold his place at the top he must act at the first sign of talk cruncher would have understood but maybe not the eagle he knew riley thought he was clever arid careful except when drink was taken the informant scurried away perhaps believing that he had ingratiated himself and that mister was now indebted to him it would be the informers error if he acted on that conviction alone in the sacristy mister made several short pithy calls on his mobile using an alwayschanging code to cover names and locations he had just switched it off when the vicar half drowned came in behind him hello reverend how did it go well we could have done with a few more there but i think those who did attend valued the occasion i regret not being with you difficult times mr packer there was a wretched photographer hiding in a car looking for you i suppose no sense of decency or occasion and one man i didnt recognize who neither the family nor the boys acknowledged the funerals stranger was described and the vicar said he had not been dressed like a policeman but as if from the country he had had the appearance of a rural vet then he dropped his voice and grimaced a miserablelooking vet the sort whod put down a family dog and not console you but he sang well knew all the words of the hymns id chosen never looked at the hymnal if the eagles court strategy had not accomplished the halting of misters trial the vicar had been lined up ready to take his place in the witness box and swear firmly to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and say that on the night mister was alleged to have been in the car he had in fact been in the sacristy discussing further fundraising for the repair of the rotting roof ill be away for a bit mister said casually somewhere nice the vicar was discarding his vestments darkened at the hem by the rain doubt its nice dont know whether its warm ive a bit of business in sarajevo where poor mr dubbs died he was setting up a deal too good a deal to let go thats the trouble with business these days youve got to run fast just to stand still i wouldnt know but i read that sarajevo is an unhappy place quite brutalized by that awful war ill be concerned for you mr packer mister stood up and wrapped his coat around him dont worry about me i can look after myself david jennings had taken home the carriage clock two years ago hed have preferred his farewell from the custom house from the sierra quebec golf team to have been marked with a crystal decanter but theyd given him a clock it didnt work now and the jeweller hed taken it to had said repairs would cost more than it was worth enforced retirement had been a bitter blow to him one day an experienced executive officer working on heroin importation then targeting albert packer the next thumbing through conservatory leaflets and estimating what a new back patio would cost at first his wife had said that it was wonderful to have him home and around to help with the shopping but that had palled an increasingly testy marriage was kept alive by offpeak sunshine holidays all the girls in the travel agency were busy so jennings settled himself on the bench by the window ready to book a presummer break in tenerife he didnt have to see the fixers face to know him most times hed seen him from the back on buses and tube carriages and pavements he knew him well hed been close up in pubs with him close enough to count hairs on the back of his neck trying to get overheards his last year before retirement when the team had been expanded to a branch kitted with body microphones with an eyeball on the fixer hoping to hear him talking dirty rather than talking social hed spent hours nights weeks months on the fixer who was target six god and he missed it the old life was still a microbe in his bloodstream when the fixer was finished and had left with his tickets three of them jennings slotted into the empty hair in front of the girl former habits died hard he was a good pump man always had been he asked casually where his pub friend was going and not taking the darts team was he not with the quarterfinal coming up funny old booking she said grinning takes all sorts b u t ferry to calais hire car then amsterdam to zagreb on klm and on to sarajevo first time ive ever booked for there hes not taking brennie and pete we wont ever win anything without brennie please tell me its not brennie and pete a mr packer a mr arbuthnot and a mr james thats the passengers names thats not george james surely hes not as tasty as brennie but hes useful in our second pair bruce james when are they going then travelling thursday arriving friday now do you want some help or do you want to talk about your darts team he laughed she giggled he started to explain the hotel details of the last trip to tenerife and how they wanted a back room because the front rooms were too noisy and as high up as possible because of the row from the discotheque by the time he had finished explaining about the hotel the girl had forgotten her breach of customer confidentiality david jennings hadnt forgotten when the old target one was travelling with his eagle and his atkins or when he was arriving as he always used to tell the few who were close to him and who put up with his formerlife anecdotes it had never been flushed out of the system nursing his small morsel of information he went home his sunshine break reserved and made a telephone call to an old chum at the custom house its probably nothing but i thought youd like to k n o w a message was sent from a spieler a turkish cafe in green lanes the cafe was sandwiched between a halal butcher and a greengrocer specializing in near eastern vegetables from the long street in london that represented the heart of the immigrant turkish population it went by digital phone to the bascarsija district of sarajevo the turkish community in green lanes and in sarajevo understood the value of strategic alliances at any time day or night there were in that drab street with renovation and refurbishment yet to arrive the parked cars and vans in which sat surveillance experts of the church the crime squad criminal intelligence and the spooks any of those men and women idling away the hours waiting for the next greasy burger and fries watching recording and photographing would have known the statistic that dominated their work of every ten wraps of heroin imported into the united kingdom nine passed through turkish hands and most of those hands were in green lanes the trail started in the poppy fields of fundamentalist afghanistan a train of camels would carry a tonne of raw produce over the porous iranian frontier from iran the cargo moved by lorry passage cased by backhanders across the turkish border in turkey the opium was refined to highgrade heroin too strong for the human body to accept by swallowing or inhalation and the tonne was divided into one hundredkilo loads each with a final street value ol eight million pounds sterling hidden in longdistance transport lorries the loads were moved through the balkans germany and france and up to the choke points of the channel ports where the danger of discovery was greatest for the turkish importers once inside the united kingdom the turks sold it on to the major dealers mister bought in green lanes for all of the efforts and the quality of the surveillance equipment the clan communities of the street of dingy shops and paintscraped homes were almost impossible to penetrate the culture of secrecy could not be broken into informers were unknown the spielers were regularly scanned with highgrade equipment to detect bugs and probes and entry into a cafe by an executive officer of the church or a detective sergeant of the crime squad would be noticed immediately they sat in their vehicles and watched and waited for lady luck but she called rarely the same routing from the cafe to the apartment in sarajevos old quarter had warned of the visit of duncan dubbs esquire the cruncher and had vouched for him in the early evening a transmitted message to a mobile phone in an elegantly furnished apartment in bosnias capital announced the imminent arrival of albert william packer with two companions and urged that they be treated with the respect due to important players the entry into the terraced house was fast and brutal the man riley was taken by men wearing balaclavas from the kitchen table where he was eating with his partner and their children and dragged out through the sagging door he was driven in the back of a van chicken trussed he wet himself a length of sticky tape blindfolded him he was taken from the van his feet scraping the ground helplessly and into a great echoing vault that he thought was a disused warehouse there seemed to him to be several men in the room a chair scraped as if the man sitting on it leaned forward a whispered voice and his hope died people tell me georgie that youve been talking about me itll have to be the youngster gough said isnt there a way round ita bead of sweat rolled down the chief investigation officers cheek ive a room full of people who dont know each other let alone the target is he up to that sort of work have to wait and see wont we youre a bundle of encouragement mr gough i can arrange for a surveillance expert to accompany him thatll be useful providing theyre decent the cio scribbled briskly on his pad and passed a name and a telephone number if hes flying tomorrow he should meet this fellow tonight we wouldnt be endangering him would we dont know dont know anything about the place because hell be close up to packer that animal the cio breathed heavily nol very close itll be surveillance watching from a distance shouldnt be dangerous if hes sensible what youve got to understand mr cann is that it is a remarkable corner of europe you could say that it is unique in its diversity and richness of culture cann hadnt been to university he had left the comprehensive school in his small somerset town applied to join the police and been rejected on the grounds of eyesight and physique if the school had possessed more ambitions for higher education he might have made it but it hadnt hed been mooning around the estate where his father was the factor undecided getting in his parents way a sharp stone in their lives when a customs amp excise vat team had come to look over the estates books hed seen the way the newmoney owner a bullying blustering man had cringed before their power his mother who helped with the books had talked after their departure of the reach of their authority slightly built relying on heavy spectacles a disappointment to his father and a worry to his mother it had seemed to cann like some sort of answer hed applied and been accepted the man who talked to him was a lecturer at the school of east european and slavonic studies part of london university it was created by the great empires those of greece then rome then that of charlemagne and after that the ottomans and the austrohungarians and finally communism with the empires came the religion western christianity the eastern church judaism and islam then political atheism throw those origins together and you have a bed for artistic brilliance to breed in and also ethnic hatred of course each new regime interbred with what they found but the bosnian heritage is having a foreign power sitting on the territory and hating it there was a little window of independence while they were at war and being carved up but now as youll find a new foreign power sits on them just dont expect to be welcomed as a liberator it was past ten oclock in tooting bec jen would be waiting for him at the bedsit and his bag would need packing he had been told by gough that it was an instruction from the chief investigation officer that he should ring the number and beg an appointment whatever the hour he had beaten a retreat from the first meeting of the new sierra quebec golf team and had done as he was told the meeting had been bizarre and hurtful hed felt himself regarded as an intruder the only survivor from the old disbanded and disgraced unit the team assembled that afternoon arriving with small bags off trains and in their cars had been recruited from the northwest of england the west the midlands the northeast from scotland and one was from belfast gough had told them that incompetence intimidation and corruption had combined to win albert william packer his freedom they were all older than him the nine men and one woman and gough had said that each had been selected for their skills their lack of fear and their integrity then the eyes had fixed on him as if he were the least solid of the chains links to be treated with suspicion tolerated because he was the archivist after the preamble gough had made him get up talk through the cartwheel and give a detailed biography of mister at the end the eyes fastened on him seemed to wonder if he was the weak link when hed finished his stumbling address gough had taken him out into the corridor and told him in clipped sparse sentences where he was going that evening and where he was travelling to in the morning he listened and wondered what was the relevance of it take a map look at it the geography is of spines of mountains and valleys cut by impassable rivers the common phrase of today would be bandit country thats not something theyve learned recently back in the reign of king stephen tvrtko theyd achieved a semblance of discipline but after hed died and things slid a french pilgrim wrote they live purely on wild beasts fish from the rivers figs and honey of which they have sufficient supply and they go in gangs from forest to forest to rob people travelling through their country and right from those days honour and sticking to ones word were seldom important a turkish janissary serving in sultan mehmets invasion army thats wrote of the flight of king stephen tomasevic to a fortress at kljuc in central bosnia where he did a deal and surrendered on the promise of safe passage when the kings servants who were in the fortress saw that their lord had surrendered they gave themselves up the sultan took possession of the fortress and ordered that the king and all his companions should be beheaded and he took the entire country into his possession be wary of criminals cann and be doubly wary of promises oh and be most wary of the women two thousand years ago silver was mined by the romans at srebrenica the roman garrisons barracks have long disappeared but you can still find there a medieval castle in ruins on a high hill south of the town it was built by jerina a warlords widow with slave labour when shed occupied the castle it was her habit to have a slave brought up to her bedroom each night and every following morning an exhausted slave was precipitated to his death from the castle walls summary a history of oppression violence plague and thieving ruthless cruelty and utter dishonesty they were seated in a hot little room in a gower street secondfloor flat the only light shone on the desk where the lecturer sat a baby was crying in another room and a womans voice tried to soothe it the coffee hed been given was too bitter for him and was now cold the light shone on the map the lecturer chainsmoked so youre telling me that a major figure in organized crime in the uk is going to bosnia and you dont know why lets begin with a tasty quote the presentday foreign occupying power operating under various names that add up to united nations was headed a couple of years back by elisabeth rehn un special representative of the secretary general she said if we fail to do something this country will become an eldorado for criminals normally that wouldnt matter take a look at that map again look at bosnias position it used to be called the balkans route it is a crossroads a junction it is the natural melting point for the roads linking the middle east the mediteranean central europe and the northern countries of the continent people using that crossroads were rather inconvenienced by fortyfive months of fighting but thats over now and the lorries are rolling again whatever it is that you want to bring into bosnia once you have brought it there you have many options as to where you ship it to nothing was done and its now eldorado do i need to say more joey assumed that the chief investigation officer god to him a distant figure he had never met and only seen in a presentation speech had activated a contact from his former home the secret intelligence service he stirred you dont need to say any more youll excuse me ive got to pack an early start do you not have a feel mr cann for the worth of academic history im only an executive officer five years service with the investigation crowd and im going away fortyeight hours or seventytwo hours to watch a man write reports and come home theyre sending me on sufferance im grateful for your time i apologize for delaying you mr cann forgive me but having time to pack is the least of your problems ive tried to give you three or four snapshots postcards from bosnia violence and treachery a hatred of foreigners and a culture of smuggling are as ingrained in that society as mineral iron in granite rock dont forget that bosnia is not bognor it is not birmingham not brighton watch your back mr cann he felt the shiver in his body and ground his fingernails into his palms to halt it he stood up and said weakly its nothing serious if it were a big deal then it wouldnt be me theyd have sent chapter five you call me each day i need to hear from you every evening gough was awake alert joey reckoned him the sort of man who didnt need sleep i want a total log of where he goes and who he sees they dont protect themselves away like they do at home they get sloppy ive a team put together that has to be fed got to have something to bite on i want everything and anything himself he was dead to the world and the last thing he needed was gough nannying him at heathrow with the unlit pipe in his mouth and the smell of it on his breath its in the balance joey if you find us material to work off i can hold the team together cant if you dont the church is like any organization in these sad days results fast and furious justify the balance sheet if its taking too long if its going to be too expensive if there isnt a knock in sight and handcuffs then well be wound up joey had come by minicab but gough the first thing he was told had caught two buses to reach the airport with his rank gough was entitled to a car and a driver joey realized it was goughs way of telling him fiercely that the journey and the work were not holiday joey didnt know of another senior investigation officer who would have come out to heathrow at ten to seven to see off a junior on a flight his bag was checked in he thought that soon if not already the new men and women of sierra quebec golf would be drifting into the custom house they were a miserable crowd not like the old team what hed seen of them there was no wit among them they looked puritanical in their serenity pulled in from around the country so there was no possibility that they were tainted by association they were all hard and humourless and suspicion of him had blazed in their eyes they would be drifting into a room where the doors locks had been changed and where new lockers would be installed later that morning with new keys and there was already a spyhole set in the door and a voicebox for visitors to announce themselves within days the room would stink because no cleaners were to be allowed inside during the night but and this is but and big you do not put yourself at risk at all times you are professional and you are there to collect evidence if what you do is illegal cant be used then you will get no praise from me i dont want a bag full of material that a lawyer can pick holes in you are legal at all times and that is not negotiable he had told jen that it was just two or three days shed been waiting for him and his clothes had been laid out on the bed shed washed all the shirts put them through the dryer then ironed them shed brought him said sweetly shyly that he might want to take it with him a strip of four photographs of herself froma supermarket booth she smiled in one frowned in another pulled a solemn face in a third and stuck her tongue out in the last shed stayed the night theyd both been half awake half asleep after the alarm had gone off hed have forgotten the strip ol pictures if she hadnt pointed to them and they were in his wallet against his backside she hadnt cried as hed left but she might have done when hed closed the front door and run to the minicab in the street thats her the ladys privilege tardiness goughs voice dropped i want his head i want the blood running on the plate like its gravy but legal dont dare forget that following goughs eyeline joey saw her hed expected one of the style of women he worked with in the custom house the style was flat shoes square hips small chests chuckedback shoulders no makeup bobbed hair hed said to jen often enough and it mattered nothing to him that femininity in the church was the endangered species they swore with the men drank with the men had failed marriages with the men and pissed in the bucket with the men when they were cooped up in the vans on surveillance he was staring because it was not what he had expected or was used to she looked like kensington or knightsbridge woman she was looking around her as she headed for the checkin of croatian airways as she wafted into the queue gough removed the pipestem from his mouth and advanced on her joey trailed after him he heard gough say youre miss bolton good to meet you im gough glad you made i t joey reckoned that lateness in goughs book was a cardinal capital offence it was a sparsely veiled rebuff and she ignored it her accent was class no point hanging around this bloody shed yes im maggie bolton whos he she jerked with her thumb towards joey he didnt wait for gough he said im joey cann were travelling together with the kindergarten am i not to worry i expect well manage the queue moved forward joey feeling himself the hired hand reached to push forward the heavy metalsided case that she had brought along with a lightweight one dont touch it she said sharply im quite capable touch it and ill kick you bloody hard she heaved the heavy case forward then delicately toed the lighter one up against the checkin conveyor she told the girl as an instruction not for debate that the heavy case would be going in the cabin with her and slapped her ticket down on the counter with her passport she had the weary look of a frequent traveller as if life was a chore he wondered how her job description was listed in the passport there was stamping and the tearing out of the tickets flimsies and she was given her boarding card come on then she said lets go shed been very pretty as shed approached them small elegant and finely made like a detailed little figurine closeup leaving the checkin joey saw the depth of her makeup her alarm must have gone an age before his because her face was a minor work of art she might have been ten years older than him but he couldnt have said so because the makeup blanked out crows feet and mouth lines her hair gathered into a short ponytail was soft gold but he didnt know whether it was real or from a bottle she wore a loud bluegreen blouse silk and a dark skirt suit with a knee showing above neat ankles and lightweight halfheight shoes there was an old necklace supporting a gold pendant at her throat and her fingers flashed small diamonds but no weddingring hed been told she was a technician expert and had not expected a businesswoman she lugged her bags towards the departure doors not hurrying as the third and final flight call was made she stopped turned right mr gough now dont worry yourself ill look after him make sure he changes his socks and bring him back safely bye oh hows porky i dont think gough answered stiffly i know anyone of that name i thought you worked for him your boss isnt he porky cork dennis cork he wasnt going anywhere with us so he transferred to run your crowd how is he gough growled hes well hes happy in his work because he is now doing a job that is worthwhile the job is worthwhile because it affects peoples lives bye mr gough and she was moving they went through the gate he saw the passport as it was opened and handed over for cursory examination she was a personal assistant they walked towards the planes pier she was struggling with the metalsided bag but joey was damned if he was going to offer help there was a small sweat rivulet on her brow about to carve a little canyon through the blanket of makeup on the pier at the aircraft door she slipped the bag down and flexed her fingers joey said why were you so rude miss bolton about me and to mr gough call me maggie its not the sort of work im used to and youre not the sort of people im used to working with and its hardly a target that excites me he had overseen the burning of his clothes and those of the cards who had held the man down in a metalworkers coke oven then he had gone home mister showered he was a long time under the scalding spray and he used a heavy soap to wash every inch of his skin and every orifice of his body he sang quietly to himself in the bathroom he felt elation the princess had been asleep when hed come home and would still be sleeping when he went out again the exhilaration coursed in him powered by the waters heat and the days ahead would challenge him it was what he wanted what he had dreamed of the wife wouldnt speak nobody would speak not the family not the neighbours and not georgie riley and the name would not be written down of the man responsible for the injuries inflicted on georgie riley his name and his fate were not spoken of in the pub where thirtysix hours earlier he had slagged off mister albert william packer the neighbours of his terraced home had seen nothing heard nothing and knew nothing the wife crouched over the hospital bed had laughed into the face of the detective sergeant then snarled that he should fuck off and get lost the victim georgie riley had he wished to could not have named his attacker because his tongue had been cut out with a stanley knife he could not have written down that name because the four fingers on each of his hands had been taken off with an industrial stonecutters circular blade he might live a whitefaced physician told the detective sergeant out of the hearing of the wife for twentyfour hours and it was possible that he would linger for fortyeight but he would not survive the damage was in the trauma and in the loss of blood georgie riley had lain unconscious in a ditch at the edge of a quiet road leading into epping forest for an estimated seven hours before a telephonekiosk call when a voice disguised by a handkerchief or clothing over the receiver had given the location and summoned an ambulance how do you get the creature responsible the physician asked i dont know why it was done and i couldnt on oath say for certain who is responsible the detective sergeant said its about fear riley is a mediumscale villain more time in gaol as an adult than out of it but hes done something thats caused offence he wasnt killed outright because the point of the exercise is to create terror and to have that talked about men like riley think themselves big shots and brave with it a shootout death is acceptable topoftherange funeral and buckets of flowers thats all fine and they think theyll go into history whats happened is that he has been humiliated and made to scream and hell have wet himself and shat himself and begged for his life theres nothing noble about the way hes going a piece of dismembered meat wont somebody eventually inform probably when the man who ordered it maybe did it no longer has power thats what we live for when the power dries up you see sir for that sort of man there is no retirement theres no day that the birthday comes and he goes down to the post office and draws a pension or heads off to a decent little villa outside marbella to live off the interest they cant walk away and protect what they have and live out their old age when theyre handsoff theyre finished and the information flows the man who did this is not handsoff he is up and running and wants his dirty world to know it and until then nobody will inform people wont stand up take you sir me where could i possibly fit into it riley has never in his life passed the time of day with a policeman but hed trust you wouldnt he sir what about this for a scenario i make available a video camera with microphone attached you come in here in the dead of night when his wifes asleep next door youve cut down the sedation dose and he can hear you and see you you hold a photograph in front of him a photograph of the man most likely to have inflicted these injuries on him you ask him if thats the man who did it and you tell him to nod or shake his head lets say wonder of wonders he nods and its on the tape are you with me sir the physician blanched i really dont know id have to think theres ethics very sensible sir the detective sergeant said gravely lets say it all happened of course wed offer you and your family protection wife down the supermarket with a heckler amp koch machinegun for company kids at school with a glock pistol alongside for how long try the day after the trial finished then youre on your own and scared witless every time the wife and the kids are out of your sight and looking under the car each morning with a mirror much better sir not to get involved and cross over to the far side of the street and hurry on like everybody does you make me feel ashamed i dont intend to sir take me lets say a lowlevel plodder like me turns up the dirt on this man and my evidence is going to send him down he can pay me and not notice it what ill work for twenty years to earn or he can have my family blown away do you know who he is a very fair idea its not a level playingfield sir i go into an interview room to confront him and ive a camera on me and a tape recording me and a lawyer there to make sure my questions arent oppressive and because society demands it ive a book full of regulations tying my hands when he goes into an interview room to talk to georgie riley all he has to worry about is whether the stanley knife blade is decently sharp and whether the motor on the concretecutter works well youll understand that ive a ward full of patients to see you called him a creature sir thats selling him short if hes who i think then hes a very clever very cunning man stands to reason hes at the top the physician was at the anteroom door and flustered how do you nail him by getting lucky sir whos going to get lucky not me sir its someone who can look him in the face straight in his eyes and show he cant be bought cant be frightened dont know where youll find him late by ninetyfive minutes into zagreb they had missed the connecting flight to sarajevo and been told that the following flight in the afternoon was cancelled they had to be in sarajevo that night joey had said then he should go and hire a car shed replied tartly hed done it hed picked her up outside the terminal in a small ford shed gone and bought a road map of croatia and the look on her face said this was mickey mouse and more of what she was not used to theyd driven away from zagreb caught the sisak road and gone through the ghost town of petrinja shed had the wheel and hed navigated off the map it was only when hed missed a turning that he realized an apology wasnt necessary because shed caught it she knew the road then hed sulked and tossed the map over his shoulder so that it fell on to her metalsided case on the back seat two miles after the first signpost to dvor she had swung the car abruptly off the road bumped up a track into a wood and not stopped before they were hidden from other motorists view hed watched his help was neither asked for nor offered she stripped out the back seat with the metalwork under it and the door panels then opened the heavy case there were probes terminals a variety of light sockets power units and gear he could not recognize hed thought hed seen everything of surveillance equipment in the room used by sierra quebec golf but some of what he now looked at was smaller and more compact and the rest he had never seen before it all went into the door handle and under the back seat then she rebuilt the car last she took half of her clothes from the soft bag and casually dumped them into the case he saw before the case was closed and locked a couple of cocktail dresses items of underwear and a pair of heavy walking boots and theyd driven on he carried only his camera with the mm lens and that could be explained he had no paperwork with him the border was a line in the river between dvor and bosanski novi the bridge over it was military an iron frame and rattling planks the old bridge was collapsed and unrepaired from the precision of a usaf strike five years earlier they crossed and were waved down as she braked she asked for his passport she snapped out of the vehicle she took charge she flourished the passport and a packet of cigarettes had emerged from her handbag then another as if they were loaves and fishes the customs men who had been bored and lounging and smoking were around her she was their honeypot she flashed smiles and the cigarettes slipped into clawing hands she spoke their language and they laughed with her she marched a man with sergeants stripes back to the car flicked open the case and her bag then joeys bag and there was more laughter as she rolled her eyes when her underwear was exposed she went into a dismal woodplank shack he wondered how many languages she spoke and where she had been and he knew in truth that he had just not thought through the question of going into a customs check when she came out holding the passports she offered her hand to the sergeant he took it formally slobbered a kiss on the back and they were gone well done joey said gruffly thrilled im sure to be honoured with praise youve been here before it seemed a pointless question where do you know best she asked nowhere not abroad he thought his answer confirmed that he was low grade workwise well bits of london on my team it would be green lanes but the last three years ive hardly been out of the custom house yes it would be green lanes thats north from stoke newington and south from yes yes theres a dozen places i know best heres one and you dont need to know the others she drove fast twice he closed his eyes as late she swerved out of a lorrys path shed have seen that he flinched and that hurt she seemed not to care about the potholes in the tarmac it was dismal country pocked with isolated farmhouses and he saw women doing the subsistence work and digging in fields his mind raced serb territory and the atmosphere was of poverty from which there was no recall and helplessness they went past gaudy ghastly roadside bars painted to grate on the eyes and lonely little fuel stations he thought he was in the land of the abandoned where the people paid a collective price for their crimes coming towards prijedor they skirted villages where weeds grew inside roofless houses and rakethin dogs chased the cars wheels no living person moved in these villages which were being overwhelmed by undergrowth he had seen these places on television when it had happened but he had not seen them since they were destroyed brambles and thicket bush survived where people had not she said quietly the northwest and the southeast were the worst for cleansing thats their word used in their army manuals the word is ciscenje to clean as in minefields barricades enemy positions they merely transferred it to people they surrounded these villages one at a time and told the muslims they were leaving first they made them sign away their property rights and took all evidence of property possession from them then they separated them the women and children went into un camps over the croat border the men were taken to camps close to here they killed as many of the men as they could by beheading beating disembowelling you name it and they bulldozed the cemeteries poisoned the wells and blew up the mosques they involved a lot of people in the cleansing and the killing so that the guilt was shared round the guilts collective that was the skill of the leaders the other part of the skill was the destruction of the heritage of those forced out but remember always remember there were no saints among the warlords whatever side were talking about only sinners i dont suppose you feel hungry you can go off food here easily im not hungry joey said she told him that outside prijedor had been the worst of the camps source of the skeletal human images on the television where there had been the worst of the killings could we have done that joey blurted could we have done those things in the camps you and me of course we could she drawled its about environment a sense of survival and propaganda and its about wanting to humiliate an enemy scratch anyones skin and youll find an abscess of beastliness hidden away where theres an obsession of hatred where the loathing is targeted where theres a desire to prove supremacy any of us can get to act like that go to germany stand in a queue with the pensioners dear old folks and ask them he felt the growing sensation of an awesome helplessness more acute than when they had first driven through the ravaged villages on the road near to banja luka high above the town he saw a great metalfabricated complex which she said had been an old steel works he could make out the tanks armoured personnel carriers and troopcarrying twinrotor helicopters and she told him it was the headquarters of the british army contingent attached to sfor in bosnia and explained that was stabilization force she drove hard beyond banja luka the road deteriorated it was hairpin and cut out of a rock wall beside a fast river there were stones in the road that she swung the wheel to avoid and crashed vehicles that teetered on the cliffs above the water torrent he had thought there might be pride in rebuilding a country after war but he saw none of that there was a lake where the river was dammed and men fished among a debris of floating bottles and rubbish bags he must have shaken his head must have shown his bewilderment you dont just pack up after a war joey like nothings happened nobody escapes everyone is scarred because you dont read about it any more that doesnt mean the scars have gone all it means is that the rest of the world which once cared has got bloody bored cant actually say that i blame it god helps those who help themselves if youre with me they dont know how to help themselves the light was slipping as they skirted jajce they bypassed the town which was dominated by a medieval fortress perched on a rock crag and she said with the casualness of a tour guide handing down morsels that the place had been a second world war headquarters for titos partisans where the german forces had not been able to reach him more history as if she too thought history as important as the academic had the night before they had the heater on in the car but the cold was creeping in he had started to shiver through tiredness hunger and a bright sliver of fear headlights speared them out of the serb territory into croat and muslimcontrolled land the road climbed it was a better surface but there was ice on it there were oases of light which they sped through donji vakuf travnik and vitez with shadow figures walking nowhere on dull pavements the blocks of old socialist architecture and closeddown factories when she stopped at a roadside cafe there were foul toilets round the back they were the only customers but the atmosphere made them feel intruders three men and a woman lolled on the cafe counter eyed them and never spoke or moved other than to agree the order then bring them coffee and a cocacola chaser there was a broken ceiling fan above them short of a spoke and around them were faded pictures of grand prix cars he noted that she didnt speak their language to them but english their eyes never left her she smoked a long darkwrapped cigarette and he muttered that she could have lit up in the car had she wanted and she said that it was to cut down that she hadnt smoked not out of consideration to him did she want him to drive and shed laid her small precise hand on his and told him it was better for her to drive the road away from the cafe ran towards a mountain pass the ice glistened on it and there were snow heaps at the side four times he saw places where the crashbarriers had been pierced by skidding vehicles each time the wheels slipped momentarily on the ice he felt the further fraying of his nerves they came round a corner low gear and struggling and ahead of them and far below a long finger was illuminated and laid out she pulled into the side of the road opened her door and stepped out the blast of cold air jolted him and he followed her his feet crunching in the drift thats it she said thats sarajevo the cold settled on his nose and lips and the wind hit him he felt far from home ignorant and uncertain she must have read him she tucked her hand into his arm i hope hes worth it your man he was tired stressed and the hand on his arm irritated him can i just say something please and im asking you pleasantly dont patronize me ive never worked with your crowd i dont know whether youre good or bad or indifferent at what you do i have to take you on trust why did they send me because they assess me as being inside the targets skin i hope thats enough of an explanation she squeezed his arm i stand chastized whats the immediate priority we work inside a legal system i dont know about you what you normally do but for us the legal system is the bible as a customs officer i cant just swan in here without local authority and poke about at what is called intrusive surveillance i need permission if i dont have that permission then anything i discover sorry we discover on target one would be ruled as inadmissible in court as would anything that leads from initial information gathered here without authority i would be bounced so hard when i get back that my feet wont touch before im standing at dover in uniform poking into holiday suitcases in addition if i thats we show out and get lifted by the local police and theres not a signature on a piece of paper were dead in the water whos the local authority who signs a local judge a magistrate she was laughing at him mocking dont you know anything about this place bugger all joey said its bent corrupt youre not telling me you believe judges and magistrates here are independent theyre owned he gazed down at the myriad dancing lights around which confining them were the darker expanses of towering snowcovered mountains then i have to find one who isnt its all i need just one you asked if the target was worth it he could see the first photograph he had filed of mister mister wore brown shoes fawn slacks and a blue polo shirt he could hear the first tape he had transcribed of misters voice mister had been on his doorstep and had been going over item for item the shopping list for the supermarket given him by the princess and the cruellest cut the rest of them in the old sierra quebec golf hadnt even thought to warn him that the case was going down and mister would walk he is maybe not to you but to me yes well worth it cruncher was cremated gone by now the few flowers would have been dumped or taken to a hospital a hole had appeared and needed filling would abie wilkess boy slot into it it was a big decision to make but young solomon was well spoken of even cruncher had said good things of sol wilkes and had used him a different man from mister would have floundered at the disruption of his business life men at the fringes had been discarded but the inner circle had lasted the course they were either family or from the estate where mister had grown up or they were trusted contacts from the pentonville experience they were all longterm on the team before he went to a rendezvous with young sol wilkes mister travelled alone into central london to open up the safety deposit boxes the contents of which had been known only to him and to cruncher there were four locations for him to visit since he had heard of crunchers death mister had ordered a surveillance operation mounted on the four buildings where his boxes were lodged he had been assured that none of the locations was watched and he had also had the streets in which the buildings stood scanned for the type of radio communications watchers would have used he was now convinced that cruncher had left nothing behind in the home that investigators could find the other set of keys not misters would have been placed in the care of a solicitor not in the eagles safe it was a simple procedure he visited each building opened the boxes and cleared them loaded the contents into his attache case handed in the keys and discontinued the contracts he walked to a west end of london hotel no reservation made and booked into a room he emptied out onto the bed coverlet the legal proof of his great wealth there were bank statements bonds title deeds for five hotels and three aircraft more deeds for residential property in france greece the bahamas the caymans and gibraltar and a stack of computer disks he could not in the hotel room enter the disks but he speedread the documents as if he needed to remind himself of the resources available to him the fact that he did not spend the wealth on himself and the princess that he hoarded it and seldom released it other than to underwrite further ventures did not in any way detract from the pleasure he took in glancing over the figures and the property descriptions with the income generated wealth was power power although he would not have recognized this was the drug that sustained him he used the hotel room for fifteen minutes then checked out he paid two hundred and sixtyfive pounds for it cash to the cashier and slipped anonymously into the street he walked across central london it was his city his wealth gave him the power he craved hundreds of people the huge majority of whom had never heard of him worked in that city to multiply his wealth in the evenings and at night thousands of the citys seething moving stirring population bought the product that he purchased after importation and sidled away into dark private hidden corners to inject themselves or to inhale he was buffeted by the homegoing office workers shop women and the tourists and he felt contempt for them because they would never none of them approach the power and wealth that were his he saw the young man sitting at the back of the cafe in the new piazza square of covent garden sol wilkes stood up as he approached mister wove a way between the tables hed checked outside for watchers and not seen any inside he took a zigzag route to the table in the rear recess of the cafe it gave him the chance to observe most of its clients and look into their ears any of the church watchers men or women would have moulded clear plastic earpieces it was an old routine but useful he liked the cut of the young man the suit was good new and quiet the shirt was a gentle cream the tie wasnt loud and the haircut was tidy the financial times on the table was folded beside the halfempty glass of orange juice it was a good first impression evening mister packer evening sol you dont mind if i call you that not at all what can i get you cappuccino please the coffee was ordered there was an attraction in going for new blood mister thought it spoke of his personal virility if he went after youth wouldnt have considered it of course not if the cruncher hadnt ended up in the river but he had and maybe as the operation into the balkans expanded and came alive it was the right time to think the unthinkable the eagle was old the fixer might just be past his best years new people and new ideas it was something to chew and think on but carefully everything must be done carefully ive known your family a long time sol so my lather told me trusted your family sol for many years as my fathers trusted you always had respect for your father and him for you and now im short of someone i can trust and respect and wholl show the same to me and who will handle various of my affairs look after your investments mr packer and see them grow that sort of thing sol move in where the cruncher was with discretion my father would walk on hot coals for you mr packer id work for someone with someone if i knew id have the same loyalty back that my fathers shown you of course but my father was surprised that you werent at the crunchers funeral there had been no change of inflection in sol wilkess quiet conversational tone but the statement smacked the air separating them mister would have gone and taken the clan but the eagle had counselled against it the eagle had said it would be a photographic jamboree for the crime squad and the church and hed taken the advice he thought the young man had balls questioned whether it demonstrated due loyalty to an old and trusted colleague if a cold shoulder was turned at the end the funeral he was jolted the young man wasnt frightened of him not in the way the eagle was he couldnt say to sol wilkes that hed stayed away because the eagle had told him to that he wasnt his own man when it came to a last farewell to a friend perhaps he should not have listened to the eagle but he had there was no fear in the young face as there had been terror last night in an older face his reputation created fear but sol wilkes was holding his eye not wavering and waiting for an answer if you worked for me sol youd get to see the bigger picture youd know more youd find it easier to make judgements he smiled whether thats good enough for you or not thats what youre getting what are you offering me mr packer to come on the payroll with a percentage of profits as the cruncher was are we running before we can walk there was menace in his voice he was not in control of the talk his fist was clenched on the table as if in threat if im inside mr packer then theres no going back i understand that its not shortterm its as far as i can see for ever five per cent comes with my guarantee of loyalty of respect their hands met mister took the smaller fist of sol wilkes in his and the deal was sealed he squeezed the hand until the blood had drained from it and he heard the crack of the bone knuckles but the young man did not flinch he took the papers and the disks from the attache case and passed them across the table they were read fast and there was no expression of either surprise or admiration on sols face just as there had been no fear a twentyeightyearold trained investment broker the son of a friend of forty years was invited into the inner circle when the papers were read they were returned with the disks to the case rules of engagement were discussed then mister launched into his description of the future and of trade through bosnia he didnt think it necessary to spell out that should he be doublecrossed rippedoff then all of the wilkes family would suffer wish they had never been born the father and mother the sisters and brothers and especially young solomon it wasnt necessary to say it because albie would have made it clear in onesyllable words to his favourite boy the arrangements were agreed for new safetydeposit boxes they would meet again when mister was back from abroad he walked out into the evening crowds he felt good lifted by sols youth and he knew that the attraction of the eagles worried fussiness was waning he was the big man and supreme pitching up there had not been joeys idea the crush of bodies was all round him and the smoke and the loud laughter and the big voice boomed at him youre joey that right joey im joey cann yes with maggie youre maggies bagcarrier something like t h a t and you are francis we werent introduced francis im your host here this is my pad im hms man in sarajevo shes a great girl whyd you make her drive the whole way she says shes driven from zagreb couldnt you have done a bit at the wheel its what she seemed to want terrific girl wheelbarrows of fun your first time here joey yes let me mark your card explain the ground youre on id be very grateful he would have preferred his bed something to eat a slow bath and bed the message at the hotel had been for her the party at the residence was to celebrate commonwealth day he thought she would have despised him if hed pleaded exhaustion and the need of food a bath and bed shed driven for eight hours and she was still up for a party he could see her on the far side of the room she must have sluiced herself under a shower slipped into that little black dress and done her face she had a cluster of older men round her was honeypotting again as she had done at the customs post at bosanski novi it was a brief little black dress the men leered at her and joey thought each of them believed himself to be the centre of her attention in with a chance she must have told the ambassador cheerful noisy francis that joey cann was her burden of the day and wasnt up to driving across bosnia he readied himself for the lecture and snatched a drink off the waiters tray im not going to ask what youre doing here because i dont want to know what i usually do when maggies people are in town is take the phone off the hook and head off up country do not embarrass me theres a good fellow what i mean is dont step on any toes last thing i want is muddy water we may thats the foreign community run this horrible little place and bankroll it but they are extraordinarily sensitive to overt interference the local talent is for obstruction we tell them how to live we send them our best and our brightest we shovel money at them but it isnt working nothings moving right now theyre seeing the signs of what we tell them is attention fatigue were running down theyve decided all they have to do is sit tight and wait till were off their backs nobody listens in london when i tell them that its all been a very considerable failure truth is that you cannot make people live together when they actually hate each other then hate us nearly as much can i top you up joey shook his head even me joey and im an old hand i was here during the war where i met maggie im quite astonished at the viciousness of the place we havent even started havent begun to start getting rid of this brutality do you know in the brcko region the serbs held muslim civilians in a furniture factory they had shredders there to make wood chips out of raw timber for chipboard you know they fed muslims into the shredding machines got human chips out of raw bodies then spread the choppedup stuff on the fields just to give you an idea of what were up against id better circulate anyway nice to have met you have a good stay and please dont cause me any problems you know what i mean have another drink joey stood alone against the wall he watched her there was a little bag in her hand leather and delicate one moment she was in the group the next she was gone and the knot of older men were peering around over their shoulders he looked to see which appeared the most bereft then she was beside him come on time to go joey said sourly only if youve finished enjoying yourself i was working looked as if you were working hard dont be so bloody pompous they left she didnt bother to wait in the queue and thank her host moments later they were out in the cold air walking down a winding cobbled street the partys noise behind them her hand was back in his arm and he could smell her scent the little shops they passed were shuttered with steel and wooden grilles the street was empty what was the work you wanted a name im sorry im not focusing what was the name i wanted a judges name you know the needle in the haystack come again the name of a judge to trust god you didnt think i was talking to those deadbeats for the good of my health cop on cann here the judges cooperate with politicians and mafia drive a big car live in a big apartment and their kids get university places or the judges dont cooperate and they listen to all the horseshit the foreigners give them about the sanctity of the rule of law and theyre machinegunned or carbombed and theyre dead least likely theyre marginalized and dont get involved not noticed actually its not they its only one hes straight but the problem is if you want to stay legal hes useless he stays alive and lives like a pauper if you want straight then zenjil delics your man thanks they walked fast what is this place its the old market the heart of the old city the serbs hit it with a mortar the final straw that brought in the americans thirtyeight dead and eightyfive wounded he gazed over the gaunt frames of the market stands now cleared for the night a floodlit mosque minaret reached up towards the low cloud the spit of snowflakes cavorting in the beam were you here did you see it you never ask for war stories in sarajevo joey you get enough without asking how near was the front line a few hundred yards maybe four hundred how was the line held it was held because there was nowhere else to go werent they heroes the commanders who held the line saved the city bad luck joey nothing here is as it seems one day they held the line the next day they did deals across it for the supply of blackmarket food cooking oil and bullets they werent heroes they were thugs in the folklore of the city he was the man who had preserved its name identity its heartbeat he had the title of legenda he could strut the streets of the old quarter walk at liberty on the mula mustafe baseskija the branilaca sarajeva the obala kulina bana and the old and the young would recognize and make space for him some of the oldest would wish to touch his hand as their saviour and some of the young would dream of working for him a message reached him from london passed by cutout figures from the turkish community there to the turkish community in sarajevo that albert william packer travelled to his city the next day and that he and his colleagues should be shown respect in his apartment richly furnished and luxuriously fitted he talked of this matter with the deputy commander of the agency for investigation and documentation and with the nephew of the ruling partys politician controlling the ministry of justice the latest message came by the same route as that which two weeks before had introduced the first visitor now dead taken from the river and freighted back whence he had come the legenda called himself serif he was ismet mujic old police files had listed him as born in reared in an orphanage following the disappearance of his father and the committal of his mother to a psychiatric ward after a nervous collapse but the files had long since been taken from the shelves and destroyed after running from the orphanage a few days after his fourteenth birthday he had joined the street kids roaming loose in the city and had begun a life of thieving his early career had had two sides he had also gained rich rewards from informing the police about other kids who followed the same trade then and it had not seemed unnatural to him he had become a policeman he could remember very clearly the man who had come and he could roll his tongue over the strangesounding name of duncan dubbs by olympic year and a year of prime pickings he had been a police bodyguard to the same official who was now paramount in the ministry of the interior and had mixed his duties with the lucrative provision of protection to those traders clubowners and restaurateurs who made fat killings from the winter games when the war had started and chaos had gripped the undefended city the legend of serif had taken flight the city had been about to collapse under the onslaught of the serb forces and its muslim community had neither the men nor the munitions to prevent its fall the scale of the impending catastrophe had thrown up spewed out a fighting leader he had gone to the old prison cleared out the hardest of the convicts driven them in two lorries to the central bank and rifled the cash tills then gone on to the marshal tito barracks on zmaja od bosne and thrown the banknotes at the officer commanding the regular troops armoury then taken out all the small arms that could be loaded onto two lorries and they had gone into the line on those first days the greatest threat to the citys survival had been the serb infantry push from grbavica towards the former olympic complex of skenderija in fighting of primitive ferocity the line had held it had been rifle against rifle grenade against grenade knife against knife fist against fist he became a fire brigade first he deployed in grbavica then on assaults up the hill between the gravestones of the jewish cemetery then in dobrinja to protect the tunnel linking the besieged city to the outside world and his wealth had grown by the end of the war his power over the city had been absolute serif discussed again with the intelligence officer and a politicians nephew the proposal that had been made by duncan dubbs two weeks before as they had discussed it before the visitors death and after it sipping good imported whisky it was a natural arrangement in that city that a businessman and an official sworn to defend the security of the state and the young relation of a principal politician should meet to talk over the merits of a contract offered by an outsider what does he know nothing the intelligence officer said a list of witnesses has been given to the idiot judge delic who will sing the same song and the pathology report is in place there is nothing he can know the politicians nephew said and because he knows nothing he comes with the promise of gifts serif mused the intelligence officer murmured gifts should always be accepted and after they have been given the decisions can be made they left the apartment as his boy enver his sweet boy returned from walking his rottweiler dogs they went out on to the street where the guards had machine pistols hidden under their coats they walked with a cordon of guards around them serif had physical presence he was short broadshouldered with a cleanshaven head and dressed always only in black in bascarsijas narrow lanes he owned the disconite and the platinum city where those few with money came and filled the tables but in each a private room was always kept for him the platinum city was near to the river and they headed for it it was where he had entertained duncan dubbs on the night of his death at the door he paused the man who came dubbs he understood nothing of us the man who is travelling with gifts who looks to buy us whom we are urged to treat with respect i doubt that he understands more of us his mobile phone rang it sounded sharp in the night air he answered it yes yes yes this is that number who is that who is it do you have a wrong number who are you go fuck your father he closed the call and pocketed the phone he shrugged just some woman she asks me if she has the right number and reads off the digits then says nothing some crazy bitch they went down the stairs and into the throb of the dance music new years day the radio said that the war went badly they did not need to be told the tanks had come to the far side of the valley on the day before the enemys christmas festival they had not fired on the day of the festival but the shells had hit vraca each day afterwards the troops at vraca had no tanks no artillery and no heavy mortars for retaliation led by husein bekir those villagers who had stayed in their homes spent the nights in their cellars and the days cowering in the outhouses at the rear of the houses or they had gone to live in tents in the cover of the trees that climbed above the village in the daylight hours it was assumed that the tank crews slept or drank themselves stupid but it was still not safe to walk between the houses because two snipers operated from close to the river and the bullets from their longbarrelled rifles could reach vraca and it had rained ever since the enemys festival the day the tanks had arrived across the valley the low clouds had scattered a fine carpet of snow over the two villages and the valley between them from vraca husein had been able to see the track trails they left as they nudged into the hidingplaces chosen in the wreckage of ljut he had seen the lorries arrive and the unloading of the bright brass shell cases then the rain had started snow was seen only rarely in the valley but the rain came down with a particular and cruel intensity battering the roofs of the damaged buildings and through windows and doors that had been blasted off their frames and with the rain came the cold smoke from the fires the villagers lit to warm themselves was a beacon to the tank gunners even when it had been safe to light fires the kindling and split logs were too damp there was no heatingoil left in the village it had been finished a month before the snowfall and the arrival of the tanks they lived like animals day and night in darkness wrapped in wet blankets their food and the troops rations were near to exhaustion at dawn on the enemys new years day the officer came to husein bekirs home he was panting because he had sprinted from the village across open ground to the house and then down into the cellar there was no coffee if she could have heated it that lila could offer to the commander of the troops i have bad news and then perhaps worse the officer grimaced over the weeks since the troops had come to vraca they had almost become friends husein thought the officer a good man and did not believe him responsible for what had happened across the valley in ljut on the autumn night of the attack over the river they could never be close friends but he respected the mans honour and in return was always treated with courtesy he was the first of the villages civilians to be told of military plans the officer was from the east and the town where his family lived his wife and two children had been purged of muslims and he did not know whether his family had fled successfully or been killed the officer talked with them husein and lila as if they were his own parents brigade does not believe that vraca is of sufficient strategic importance what does that mean that we will pull out retreat to a more defensible position a n d we have information from behind the lines on the other side that the tanks have come to soften our defence before an attack on the village when it comes it will not be from soldiers but from the scum of the white eagles they are the same as arkans criminals or seseljs when they come esteemed friend they will kill every male old or young they will violate every woman old or young and they will destroy the village and flatten the cemetery where your people are buried and mine they will make the men watch the violation of their women their daughters their sisters and their mothers and then they will kill them as the chief man of the village you would be selected for torture in front of all the men women and children it is what they have done all over the country the military do the fighting then the scum come to scavenge and kill because of what your men did in ljut i cannot justify that madness but we did not begin the barbarism and you will abandon us we will escort you from a place that is no longer defensible i am taking casualties for no gain our position does not make military sense can you not put down mines as they have done we have no mines we do not have the factories as they do we have to go husein and we will take you with us the old farmer pulled himself to his full height the crown of his balding scalp brushing against the beams and the sodden plaster of the cellar ceiling emotion broke his voice it is my home they are my fields we all have homes the officer said grimly we all have families and we all have cemeteries where our people are buried my orders are to evacuate you where will we go i dont know to a camp or abroad what can we take what you can carry no more when do we go tonight the officer climbed out of the cellar huseins wife held him and the tears streamed down his cheeks he smelt the damp of her clothes without speaking they clung to each other for several minutes near to a quarter of an hour the village was their lives and had been their parents lives and their grandparents and until the madness came they had assumed it would be their grandchildrens lives she took a grimy handkerchief from the pocket of her apron under a heavy coat and defiantly wiped his eyes she had not wept he climbed the steps treacherous from the damp from the cellar she would pack she would know better than him what they old people could carry he went out of the back then tried to run to the outbuildings he could not go quickly and his best effort was a slow crabbed short stride and he bent his spine to make a smaller target the one shot was high he reached the buildings where the cattle bellowed in protest they were hungry no fresh fodder had been brought to them for three days he went to the main double door of nailed planks and threw it open the rain spat on to him husein bekir looked out over the valley peered through the driving rain past his rusting tractor and his fields that had died from inattention past his vineyard where the weeds sprouted and the posts sagged grey streams of water ran down the hill from the village of ljut and from the high ground that flanked it the track from the far village was a watercourse but many more streams were pounding in torrents from the hills and pressing past the bare trees to the flooded river which had already broken its banks although he was not stupid with a deepset experience of agriculture and cunning where money and commerce were concerned husein bekir did not have the intelligence to consider that a minefield was in effect a living organism with the power of movement his eyes roved over those places where he had witnessed the mines being laid and he did not know that some of the pma antipersonnel mines were now being buried deep under silt that would provide a protective layer over them and that others would be lifted by the floods force and carried metres from where they had been sown neither did he know that the wooden stakes holding in place the pmas and the proms could be pushed from the ground by the streams as the stakes holding the tripwires had been dislodged he did not know that some of the points he believed to be poisoned with the mines were now free of them and some of the places where he had thought the ground safe were now lethal as he looked across the valley there was nothing to see of this secret movement the whole of the afternoon he stayed in the outbuildings and talked quietly with his cattle the beef calves and the sheep he told them what he would do and in his simple way he wished them well and said that he would return he would come again he said and they nuzzled against him at last light the main door to the outbuildings left open he went back to his home where lila had filled two small bags he shouted at his dog his voice was sufficiently angry to ensure that it ran from him and hid he could not take it or bring himself to shoot it his animals were already out and foraging for food when husein bekir lila the villagers and the troops in the growing darkness trudged slowly away from the village he found only minimal comfort in the knowledge that when he came back he would remember where the mines had been laid bent over his desk her father had not noticed for a long time after the call had ended jasmina delic sat with the phone in her hand she had been helping her father to clear his desk she had to nag him to keep control of the paper mountain that covered it there were no resources to employ the staff who should have worked for a judge she had taken one file from the pile in the corner where they were stacked and casually opened it at the top had been the note from the iptf policeman williams concerning the drowned englishman and the telephone number retrieved from a bedside notepad idly she had rung the number she had heard the voice she had asked if the number was correct and it was confirmed she had recognized the voice had listened to it until the call was cut she put down the phone closed the file wheeled herself to the corner and dropped it onto the floor her father noticed nothing she would tell him in the morning always the busy man without time to waste mister had three more meetings between the time he left the covent garden cafe and his arrival home at one meeting he authorized the payment on delivery at felixstowe harbour for a container now at rotterdam docks that held a fraction under a million pounds worth of heroin street value bedded in madeinchina ornamental garden tubs at another he rubberstamped an agreement for him to be paid a little more than a thousand pounds a year by a noveltystall holder operating in trafalgar square up from the previous rate by seven per cent at the final meeting he talked over with an architect a development project for four hectares of mediterranean coastal land west of cap dantibes whether the profit margin was measured in millions or hundreds was immaterial to him he despised laziness he kept the same close eye on all his deals that night the negotiation that gave the greatest satisfaction was the one with lennie perks for the safety of the stall in trafalgar square because he had taken lennie perkss money for twentynine years and the job went at a loss but he never gave up on a customer would never accept that he was now too grand to deal with the bottom end of trade he spoke on his mobile phone with albie wilkes as he walked the night streets to confirm what they both already knew because it had been well worked out before he had cast an eye over young sol he spoke also to a detective chief inspector in the national crime squad and was told that investigators were without leads in the matter of georgie riley who was not expected to last the week then he took a taxi home there were aspects of his life on which he would not have dreamed of acting without the approval of the princess his dress was one of them he had not as she had not ever been to bosniaherzegovina she would have checked on the tvs text earlier in the evening for localweather advice and that would have decided her on what clothes he should take on his return they packed the case together then they drank together champagne but only one glass each and she toasted him and wished the venture well he knew she looked at him over the glass and he thought he saw in the sparkle of her eyes a sense of triumph for him because he was on the road he wanted to travel and also of apprehension but he knew there was no cause for fear not for her and not for him nothing frightened him nothing ever had he kissed her eyes his lips brushed them and when he looked again he thought hed chucked out the anxiety he was fine he said had never felt better it was good days ahead back at the hotel joey rang jen he told her about the plane delay and the drive she said she loved him and he rang off he was too tired to work out in his mind whether he loved her or not in the hotels car park underneath his window the light fall of snow caked on maggie boltons coat as she stripped down the hire car retrieved her equipment then rebuilt the cars interior and joey didnt know that her work was not yet finished he slept small pieces of a mosaic were falling into place and he was dead to them unaware of their importance chapter six im not coming shed said please yourself he must have sounded crestfallen i dont trail around after you ive my job to do which is dock in the hire car rent a van and finish my breakfast joey had said when he would meet her and what time the flight was due in and hesitated i dont suppose i take anyone from the embassy with me i dont suppose you do just make sure youre wearing your charm boots shed gone back to her breakfast joey had left her there surrounded by rolls jam cheese and coffee she hadnt even wished him luck hed never worked alone before but what little joey cann knew of judges was that you didnt make appointments you pitched up early in the morning the room was high in the ministry of justice building the lift was occupied groaning slowly above him he hadnt waited but had gone up evernarrowing flights of stairs to the floor under the roof the building was damaged damp ran on the walls and the ceiling above him had been crudely plastered the floor at either side of the judges door was piled high with cardboard file folders that were held tight with string and elastic bands he steadied himself if he were thrown out on his neck had the door shut in his face then he was in trouble deep he needed the legality of authorization he rapped on the door and breathed hard maggie had said dismissively that she wasnt an interpreter and that any judge spoke english he heard a light squealing sound metal on metal without oil before the door was opened inside the room was chaos it was a disaster area of failed organization a home for lost files a dull single bulb without a shade hung from a ceiling that was a trellis of cracks what he could see of the walls above the piled files showed more cracks but wider ones there was a desk at the far end and half hidden by more files that formed a barricade to mask his chest a small man peered at him over halfmoon spectacles above the man behind him was a faded framed photograph spiders web lines in the glass showing the man in younger days a handsome woman and a girl child with pretty hair and in a party frock holding flowers near to the photograph hanging from a nail was a calendar with last years date on it now being recycled because there were fresh ink notes in the days boxes at the side of the room under a narrow window that was smeared on the inside where failed attempts had been made to clean it and opaque on the outside was a smaller desk dominated by an old computer screen something from the ark or a museum from the ceiling to the floor from the crack lines and the dim light to the worn apology for a carpet the boards that needed staining and the electric fire where a single bar glowed dismally he took in the scene the man wore an overcoat and the smell of damp and dirt clogged in joeys nostrils zdravo da maggie had told him what to say zovem se joey cann gavorite li engleski molim yes i speak english a little my daughter speaks it better joey heard the squealing sound he turned his head sharply the young woman had been hidden by the open door it was the wheelchair that needed oil he would not have recognized her but he knew instinctively that it was her face in the photograph her complexion was so very pale and there was a desperate tiredness in her eyes he felt ashamed of staring at her her thin blonde hair was tied loosely behind her head and he saw the power of her shoulders which would have strengthened to compensate for her disability the smile was radiant i am jasmina you have come to see my father judge delic we do not have much time before court how may we help mr cann ill try not to waste your time he remembered what he had been told im an executive officer of british customs and excise i work in the section thats called the national investigation service our work deals with the most serious cases of organized crime involving the importation into great britain of class a drugs when we go abroad in order that any evidence we obtain should be legally admissible in our court we must have the appropriate permission from a local person in authority who can be a judge he breathed out tried to relax i was given your name i need your help in the uk we have a target one albert william packer he is first among equals for trafficking in class a narcotics he would regard himself as an untouchable we are clutching at straws having most recently failed to convict him he arrives in sarajevo this afternoon we dont know why he is coming here what he is attempting to set up or who he will meet our experience has shown us that when our major criminals are abroad they behave with greater confidence its when they make mistakes i have to say that packer makes mistakes rarely he may open a small window for us and he may not we need the authorization for what we call intrusive surveillance im asking you for that authorization maggie bolton had told him that a judge who cooperated with the mafia drove a big car and lived in a big apartment and that a judge who did not cooperate was machinegunned or carbombed hes a bad man sir his place is in prison with the key thrown away his wealth from the drugs trade is estimated at around one hundred and fifty million american dollars we regard him as a prime enemy of our society if i had done this properly by the book the justice ministry of bosniaherzegovina would have been contacted by our embassy and being frank with you sir the probability is that i would have been shuffled into the office of a senior civil servant given cups of coffee and put off while bureaucracy slowly turned over and there would have been requests for more information and id have kicked my heels and our target one would have done his business and gone home i accept sir that we have taken a liberty in involving you i am in your hands and maggie had also told him that one judge was useless insignificant did not get involved lived in squalor and was a judge to trust last week the day that our case against target one failed the body of his financial associate was taken from the river in sarajevo he would have been preparing the ground for his chief man at the time the associate flew here target one was on trial but his network of intimidation and corruption in britain guaranteed that he would be freed this is possibly a considerable opportunity for us the voice of the judge growled at him what was the name of the associate duncan dubbs if you refuse me then i quite understand im poorly informed on sarajevo but informed enough to appreciate the difficulties im creating for you there is no threat to me in the uk i have never felt in personal danger you will not see me standing in judgement if you tell me that you cannot help and do not wish to be implicated in an investigation of this sort i have to assume that our target one will meet deal with a principal figure in this citys organizedcrime network that makes for involvement ill be going home i wont be here if there are consequences an authorization for surveillance from me thats what im asking for sir joey didnt know whether he had won through or whether he had failed he felt the silence in the room press around him if a judge had come to london from sarajevo or zagreb budapest or bucharest sofia or prague he would have been passed round the foreign and commonwealth or the home office pushed into obscure corners of new scotland yard or the custom house would have been treated with the dignity accorded to an unwelcome blowin judge delic wearing the deep frown of a troubled man ferreted among the papers on his desk then came the persistent and rhythmless tapping of his pencil point on the desk top he looked at his daughter joey heard the scrape of the wheels behind where he stood then she propelled herself to her father and handed him a file joey did not dare to hope the judges face was expressionless as he opened the file but joey saw her face and the way her jaw jutted out as if in a demonstration of defiance the piece of paper in the judges hand was small enough to have been torn from a notepad and it was encased in a cellophane sachet he looked at the piece of paper for a long time she asked da ne joey had said that he would be going home and would not be there to see the consequences he thought he had asked too much judge delic nodded da she said my father says yes i will type it for you mr cann and my father will sign it the authorization thank you she wheeled herself to the small desk by the window switched on the computer after an age while it warmed the machine clattered under her fingers joey had nothing to say the judge never raised his eyes but he shivered under his overcoat joey stared at the floor following the lines of the carpets troddendown threads and thought of the man due to arrive in sarajevo who reckoned himself an untouchable she worked the printer and brought the pages to him he leaned over the desk and wrote his and maggie boltons names in the spaces provided then she gave them to her father and he signed each sheet briskly before pushing them away as if they were a nagging dream that might wound him she put the stamp on the document of authorization thank you sir to be used with discretion of course sir joey canns promise of discretion was worth nothing if evidence were found if target one were held then the authorization would be in the public domain in open court there were telephone lines fax lines email lines between london and sarajevo with his scrawled signature judge delic had compromised himself and would have known it the promise was empty the judge had turned away and was staring up at the photograph of a family jasmina told joey of the telephone number on the pad beside duncan dubbss hotel bed that the number had been answered by ismet mujic and she gave him the list of three eyewitnesses and copies of their statements to the local police he felt he was a stormcloud settling on their lives at the door joey said im grateful to you sir and to you miss very grateful for involving yourselves the judge said flatvoiced i have broken a rule of my life the rule says that to survive here you must remain unnoticed the rule was given me by my mother because of my fathers death i was one and a half years old when my father died my father in the difficult times of the world war and the german occupation thought it right to involve himself in the fight against the tito partizans he was recruited into the handzar which was the th ss division all muslims the word is the turkish one for the curved dagger of our people he was proud of his involvement and the uniform they gave him he was trained in germany and france a little later tito formed the th muslim brigade my father had joined the wrong side it would have been better for him to remain unnoticed he was shot after the war then why sir did you break your rule from the claim of blood because of blood that was spilled from stupidity not a story to be told to a stranger be satisfied with what you have she opened the door for him joey ran down the flights of stairs through the cavern of the hallway and out into the street if he had not checked himself he would have punched the fumefilled air in triumph the aircraft bucked mister wondered whether the eagle was going to throw up sitting beside him clutching the seats arms choking and coughing the lawyers face was greenwhite on the other side of him atkins was looking out on the dense grey mass of cloud they were in powerful crosswinds and the plane was thrown sideways forced down climbed again then plunged down further the eagles discomfiture made mister feel good and took away any anxiety he might have felt is this the way you used to come in what he liked about atkins was that the former soldier never spoke unless it was required of him in all weathers mister and the rougher the better this isnt bad worst was good weather no cloud were on approach now we used to call the raf flights c transports maybe airlines over the mountains and then the khe sanh dropdown khe sanh was an american fire base in vietnam where they had to come in against triple a antiaircraft artillery the pilots technique was to corkscrew from twenty thousand feet a little disturbing on the bowels in good weather theyd shoot particularly if they were pissed in bad weather they couldnt see you wasnt there any response blue beret time mister take it on the chin one day ill tell you about united nations soldiering they hit a bigger pocket the eagle gasped mister felt better than good do you know what were doing here atkins i dont but youll tell me when youre ready to his voice was faint against the thunder of the engines right now im ready i cant suffer boredom atkins cant abide it i was going nowhere i was doing what id done three years before what i needed was challenges new scene new drills new business the cruncher put up the idea the afghans produce the stuff and the cruncher said theyd get x amount and that wasnt negotiable the turks pick it up and ship it across europe then get it over to the uk and they charge y i sell it on and thats z three factors in the street price x is beyond my reach and z is my money anyway so its y that im going after the turks ship it through here my proposition crunchers is that i buy for delivery into bosnia for y minus forty per cent or y minus fifty per cent then i ship onwards i run the transport organization from bosnia i go into an international league and that atkins is big bucks wed have been here earlier if id not been away got any cold water the aircraft kicked a last time then broke through the cloud ceiling light flooded into the cabin he steadied the tray as they banked sharply he had a clear view of the mountains and the snow streaks between the pineforest plantations not for me mister to pour cold water on anything you put up the triple a was up there and this was when theyd hit you the bastards when you were helpless and steadying to come in if you can get the turks on board youve done well if you can get the bosnian lowlife on board then youve done better than well but you know that i pay you to tell me what i should know who are we dealing with from the lowlife hes called s e r i f the undercarriage slipped down the aircraft yawed atkins was pointing through the porthole window apartment blocks slipped by it took mister a moment to realize why they had been pointed out he squinted to see better the buildings were empty carcasses they had been devastated by artillery great holes punched in the walls they had been ravaged by fire scorched patches around the gaping windows they had been pocked by smallarms bullets and shrapnel diseaseridden and spotted from the volume of it atkins said to him there was a tunnel under the runway from butmir on the far side to dobrinja where were looking it was the muslim lifeline and the serbs couldnt break in to close it serif was instrumental in defending the link the army brought their supplies in through the tunnel and serif brought in the blackmarket stuff he made serious money out of it and he sealed his deals with government dont ever forget mister serif is protected from the top of government down hes hard and if the cruncher was around thats what hed tell you hes a dangerous man not to be taken lightly they hit the runway hard mister laid one hand over the eagles fist clenching the armrest and with the other he punched atkins he said against the thunder of the reverse thrust well eat him you see if we dont an old blue japanesemade van was at the back of the airport car park from where it was parked the driver and his passenger had a clear view through the wiped windscreen of the two black mercedes saloons that had stopped directly in front of the outer arrivals door joey was behind the wheel maggie talked in terse code into the microphone clipped to her blouse theyre in place cork said youre lucky to have her endicotts smile was superior shes bloodstock dennis cork chief investigation officer had stalled the meeting to answer his mobile call in the home office ministers private room giles endicott had been his desk chief at the secret intelligence service before the transfer to customs amp excise the transfer had brought cork a substantial increment in salary and in civilservice grading so that he now ranked as equal to his former master but old habits died hard he remained in endicotts book a junior cork responded tetchily i am merely reporting that my man is in place and i merely observing that he has a firstclass operator up alongside him the minister intervened i made a speech last week you may or may not have picked it up in which i spoke of the devastation caused by the drugs trade i said in every city town and village children are in danger of being ensnared by drugs and crime you both know that an elections looming an essential part of this governments battle plan is our determination to break the link between drugs and crime i went on to say addicts ruin more than just their own lives they mug burgle and steal to pay for their next fix every year heroin users criminally take more than a thousand million pounds to feed that disgusting habit the equivalent of sixty pounds from every household in the country we want action gentlemen we need visible action bickering over minor scraps of turf is not the action im looking for i the government demand results require arrests and convictions so that these foul narcotics are cleaned from our streets in the case of packer whats happening weve sent a man with a firstclass operator alongside him the minister the supplicant clasped his hands together in a prayer of frustration dont you see dammit what im trying to say a criminal waltzes from the old bailey a free man the response of the lawabiding community is to send a man after him who you tell me is twentyseven years old therefore inexperienced earning the rate paid to people at the bottom of the ladder the minimum response because you plead the strictures of expense and the uncertainty of success you send along with him a woman with a box of tricks i want results that are highprofile i want people to read in their morning newspapers all of those people who are scared witless that their children and grandchildren will be caught up in this ghastly lifethreatening trafficking and who vote for us that we are doing something endicott asked coolly doing something worthwhile minister or doing anything cork said a little sadness in his voice if when packer has sealed whatever business deal hes gone to make he were to return and fall happily under the wheels of a number seventythree bus the effect on the availability of heroin on the streets of london would be less than negligible that is a fact thats not good enough endicott said we are not minister soldiers in a holy war cork said we deal with the real and unpleasant world i need require success cork said its not the way things work im sorry to say its slow tedious and undramatic hes called joey cann he may with considerable luck put one building brick in place and thats only one but its ridiculous to assume he can win you those headlines bring packer down the meeting broke up they went together from the ministers room out onto the pavement and into brittle spring sunshine they paused before parting even for a politician that fellows not the full shilling endicott said if i thought cann and bolton were going for packers jugular with a hacksaw were going to endanger themselves in that snakepit theyd be on the first plane home joeys eyes were on the arrivals door fastened on it he saw mister between the eagle and atkins he edged the gear from neutral that them she asked thats target one and the fat ones target two the younger ones target three happy days she said and her cameras shutter clicked beside his ear the photographs hed seen scores of them were good he had recognized mister immediately and watched him with fascination for the first time the man was in front of him flesh where before there had been only monochrome images the greeting party lounged against the two waiting cars he saw misters head incline towards the eagles and saw his lips move it was a private moment of exhilaration he could not have explained it to jen there might have been an opportunity the previous summer when finch had put together the arrest team for him to have piped up and asked to be included hed hesitated the team might have laughed at him he might have had to stutter why it was important to him their archivist and the bottom of the tree to be there when the handcuffs went onto misters wrists and the moment of opportunity had gone that night alone in his room and knowing what was to happen at a quarter to six in the morning he had beaten his pillow in frustration yet those who might have refused him or laughed at him were all gone he had survived the moment was his he needs to know this serif whos the boss polite and firm but its understood from the start we are big players hes a small player thats what he should be learning now he was about to start forward but atkinss hand was on his arm theyre big on pride mister they think they won their war they didnt it was won for them but its what they like to believe i hear you the cruncher should have been back to london to brief him and should have been with him for the return not the eagle across the paving from them were four men their weight against the doors and bonnets of the cars in a uniform of black windcheaters shaven heads black shirts tattoos on their necks black jeans gold chains at their throats black boots cigarettes mister wore a suit and a white shirt the eagle carried a businessmans attache case and was dressed in a blazer slacks collar and tie and a maroonbrown overcoat atkins was the officer boy in brogues chocolate corduroys sports jacket and was loaded with the three bags a cigarette was thrown down then three more the back door of the front car was opened which ones serif mister murmured hes not here atkins said if i remember him right shit the eagle muttered thats one hell of a good start a policeman with a heavy pistol slung from a waist holster approached the cars gold rank on his tunic he slapped shoulders gripped fists and was given a cigarette from an american pack as if he was meeting friends and then he was gone mister wondered whether it had been arranged to send a message the boot of the front car was opened the bags taken from atkins and lifted inside a pudgy hand with gold rings on it gestured to the cars back seats where is he mister asked atkins atkins asked mister saw them all in unison shrug theyre saying they dont know there was a sigh from the eagle it was the nearest he ever came to saying there were always consequences when his advice was ignored i told you so would have been too bold for the eagle to utter they were pressed together on the back seat of the mercedes a driver and a minder in the front the second driver and second minder in the car behind they were jerked against the leather as the car powered away the sign they swept past proclaimed that the airports new terminal had been built with dutch money they went past the guarded entrance to a french military camp the driver didnt slow as he approached the barrier at the perimeter but hit the horn the bar was lifted the car accelerated a policeman waved a greeting apache gunships american flew over them in formation and mister craned to watch them before their disappearance into the cloud ruined buildings confronted them as they swung onto the main road the closeup mayhem wreckage of what he had seen in the aircrafts final approach for a moment he was unsettled a slight toll of his confidence taken by the absence of the man due to meet him the closeness of the police officer to the escort the scale of military power the extent of the war damage atkins looked at him queried with his eyes did he want a running commentary he shook his head he was absorbed he had never seen anything like it whole streets were burned shot away roofless kids played football in the roads where snowcovered debris was bulldozed to the side and people lived there in the wrecked homes people existed as if the houses were caves there were sagging skewed balconies on which limp plants were stacked and from which washinglines hung taut under the weight of sheets shirts skirts it was five years since the war why hadnt it been rebuilt he didnt know and didnt want atkins to tell him the loss of confidence had been momentary he was here because it was what he had wanted at a junction stood a massive collapsed building it looked as if it had been dynamited at the base it was five bloody years what did these people do why didnt they clear it up but he didnt ask atkins they drove into the dense streets of the city his first impressions and mister always thought them the best were that the place was a grade a dump a tip they hit a long straight road on the plane atkins had told him they would come into the city on buleva mese selimovica eight lanes that merged into the zmaja od bosne which had been called snipers alley at high speed they passed a building whose roof was festooned with aerials and satellite dishes and he thought it must house the telephone headquarters behind it he glimpsed a dispersed mess of portakabin huts with signs leading to them for the international police task force but he knew nothing of what they did then a lorry park was on the left and another and another he saw rows of cabs trailers and containers more rows and warehouses some intact and some destroyed the crunchers last message from sarajevo had given the address the number of the warehouse in a lorry park in halilovici where the charity lorry should arrive he wondered if it was there it should have been there that morning or the night before tucked from sight in the warehouse they hammered over a bridge he saw the murky earthbrown water foaming on the weirs running fast hed always been fond of the cruncher hed never feel for sol wilkes what hed felt for the cruncher i want to know where it happened where the cruncher went into the river i want to go there i want to see it atkins spoke to the driver there seemed to be surprise on the mans face but mister couldnt tell whether it was at what was asked or that he should be told what to do the eagle sat bolt upright and clutched his attache case as if he believed it might be wrenched from his grip drab streets drab people drab shops kids waved to the cars as they went by and where there was a traffic block they headed into the oncoming lane and sped past once a car had to swerve onto the pavement to let them by at a junction a policeman held up the rightofway vehicles and they overtook jeeps loaded with armed italian soldiers whose drivers seemed not to notice them when they braked hard they were level with a restaurant whose doors and windows were surrounded by silver aluminium the sign said it was called platinum city opposite was a narrow ancient footbridge over the river the cars stopped the doors were opened mister pushed out the eagle then followed him there was a low wall between the pavement and the riverbank and a waisthigh railing on the bridge an old woman in black squatted beside buckets of tired flowers he saw that men and women in threadbare clothes stepped off the pavement risking the road traffic to stay clear of the minders mister pointed to the flowers atkins spoke to the minder from the front of their car the man went to the old crow dropped banknotes into her lap and her face lifted in gratitude he took a single bunch from her buckets and she offered more for what he had paid but he shook his head curtly the blooms were handed to atkins a halfdozen drooping smogencrusted chrysanthemums atkins gave them to mister who walked to the centre of the bridge he was a man to whom sentiment came rarely he looked down at the rushing water he was not troubled by history he did not know that he was close to where gavrilo princep had held a hidden pistol and waited for an archduke and archduchess in an open car and what had been the consequences of the shots that he had fired neither did he know that the bridge on which he stood was a monument to the skill of ottoman architects now dead for centuries nor did he realize that had he stood on that bridge looking down on the water seven years earlier or eight or nine a snipers scope would have magnified him in the seconds before he was shot he held the flowers he sensed the cold and the power of the rivers currents neither atkins nor the eagle had followed him he was not aware that the space and quiet around him were not accidental and did not see that the minder from the second car had crossed to the far side of the bridge and diverted pedestrians away his mood lightened people died didnt they i mm her had died hadnt he could have been a ira i lie accident could have been slipping in the shower could have been a rentboys knife could have been pissed and fallen into a river life goes on isnt that right my old friend life goes on with new challenges it was the nearest mister could grope towards feeling sentiment at the death of a friend he threw the flowers into the river and watched the muddy waters suck them down there was a flash of colour then they were gone had he looked around him at that moment turned sharply and not stared into the flow of the miljacka he would have seen the faces of the drivers and the minders he would have seen amusement and the curl of contempt at their mouths he walked briskly back to the cars he was driven the reverse way along snipers alley to a square block of gaudy yellow topped with the logo of the holiday inn when do i get to see him through atkins he discovered that serif was busy at the moment but when he was free he would see his respected guest the cars drove away they picked up their bags and walked into the lobby the eagle said that mister is out of order it is plainly insulting atkins said its his patch mister and hell think crude pegging you back will make him a bigger man mister smiled cheerfully hell do it once hell not do it again thats my promise to him and im good on my word doesnt seem too bad a place considering the rest of it across open ground where the concrete was holed ankle deep by artillery explosions was a line of sparsely filled shops and bars where a few men and youths desultorily made their coffee last above the shops and bars were apartments that had been repaired with a patchwork of bricks and cement in front of the long building a blue van paint scraped unremarkable was parked in a position that gave its driver and passenger good sight of the front door of the holiday inn hotel it may be a slow old trade maggie said but at least were legal thats right joey answered ink on paper i thought you had a chance b u t he was good as gold the judge i think its the first time ive ever been legal is that a cause for celebration or tears dont know tell you what i also dont know why why did judge delic sign you didnt break his legs did you you didnt drop him a couple of thousand dollars did you i didnt ask he signed i ran with it she eased back in her seat the camera settled on her lap behind her in the vans interior the workshop of her trade was neatly laid out cosseted with foam and bubblewrap itll be from something out of the past dont take too much credit for it he said coldly youd know about that because you worked in dirty corners that are now history you wont mind me saying it but the cold war was utter shit irrelevant perpetuated by spooks to keep themselves on the payroll this is something that matters i worked with men i was at the cutting edge i was with real men she flared all this business about legal its pathetic they were real men the best and the finest dust in the past he said he disliked so much of her and didnt know where to focus the beam of his dislike there was the crimped care of her makeup and her dress and the crispness of her accent and the fact that she had been there before and knew it all when he knew nothing and the academic precision of her kit in the back of the van there was the sense of class privilege and superiority in her every speech and movement for joey being in sarajevo and close to target one was the sweet pinnacle of his short career for her as she showed him it was a tedious spell of tacky work to be endured god help your lot she said if youre the best theyve got silence cloaked them she smoked the evening descended around them when she dragged hard and the tip glowed he could see her face utter calm contentment she should have been was meant to be offended by his rudeness he thought a test had been set for him a provocation to make him expose himself as if then she could calculate his value his competence he eased himself out of the vans cab before he closed the door after him joey asked ruefully youll be all right course i will she said why not this is bosnia spring two old men though they were far away from it dreamed of the valley they remembered only the best times when the first of the years warm days heated the soil and the flowers came and they could hear the river flowing over the ford and a friendship of more than half a century the new home of husein bekir his wife and grandchildren was a belltent in a camp on the edge of the town of tuzla some three hundred kilometres to the northeast of the valley she had taken the small ones to the queue for bread baked from the flour brought by the united nations convoys he shared his home with two other families and it was an existence that was a living hell to him when she had stood in that queue for perhaps three hours she would bring back the bread and then she would go away again to queue with the children to fill the plastic buckets with water from the tanker that was also provided by the united nations with the sun on his face husein sat outside the tent too listless to move and tried to scratch from his mind the detail of the colours and contours of the valley fields the camp was a place of filth and in it there were early signs of epidemic disease increasingly frequent warnings of the risk of the spread of the typhus bacteria came from the foreign doctors it was only by struggling to recall the valley more blurred now than the previous month more hazed than in the winter that husein stayed alive there were others who had come from similar valleys and been displaced as he had who had given up the fight to remember and were now buried or lay on the damp mattresses against the tents walls praying for death husein had promised himself that he would return with lila and the grandchildren to the valley he heard nothing on the radios that blasted through the avenues between the rows of tents that gave him cause to believe his pledge could be redeemed but his fierce awkward determination kept him alive a wind came off the ostsee and beat at the high windows of the block with two other families dragan kovac had been dumped in a twelfthfloor apartment on the outskirts of the town of griefswald all day each day he sat by the window and stared out that morning he could see little because the wind carried loose flakes of snow from dark low cloud the arthritis in his knees worse through lack of exercise would have made it hard for him to walk outside but he yearned even with the pain to stumble forward into clean air so that he could better remember his home and the village of ljut he was trapped in the building the twelfth floor was his prison it was forbidden for him as it was for the other refugees housed in the block to leave it from his vantagepoint he could see the police car parked across the street from the front door engine fumes spewed from its exhaust a police car was always there now the food they needed was brought to them by earnest social workers the imprisonment of dragan and the other refugees in the block of the baltic town had begun five weeks before when the crowd had gathered under cover of darkness rocks had been thrown to break the lower windows then lighted petrol bombs had rained against the walls and there had been the shouted hatred of the young men with the shaven heads the screams of old slogans he had thought that night as the yelling of the skinhead nazis had beat in his ears and every day since that it would have been better to have died in his village when the fundamentalists had attacked better never to have left his home but he had not stayed he had been one of the few who had escaped he had lumbered as fast as his old legs would carry him flotsam with the flight of the soldiers away from his valley without the time to pack and carry with him even the most basic of his possessions he had been put with many others onto a lorry that rumbled into croatia then onto a train that had wound closed and with the blinds down across austria and into germany then had traversed the length of that huge country his home was now and he had little understanding of great distance some three thousand kilometres to the northwest of the house with the porch and the chair and the view to the farm of his friend the two families who shared the apartment with him showed him no respect and said he was lazy and a fool and that he the former police sergeant was responsible for what had happened in their land tears ran down his cheeks as the snow melted and slithered down the glass of the window it was so hard for him to remember the valley but he thought trying to see the image of it that it would still be a place of simple beauty neither of these old men abandoned to live as statistics sustained by grudging charity protected from the fascist gangs knew of the harsh realities of the valley that was their talisman of survival neither remembered where the mines had been sown neither could have imagined that those little deathly clusters of plastic and explosive would have shifted they remembered only the good times before the mines had been laid when the valley felt the sun and was a bed of bright flowers and the bunica river was low enough to be crossed and they could meet and talk good times before the madness had come they used the hotel restaurant atkins had asked mister if he wanted to go out said reception would recommend a restaurant but hed shrugged away the suggestion it was a slow meal poorly cooked and ineptly served but that didnt matter to him hed ordered mineral water with his food and the eagle had taken his cue from him but atkins had a halfbottle of slovenian wine he didnt have to tell them that he was tired had no interest in talk the restaurant was on the mezzanine three floors below his bedroom and close to empty he used the mealtime to think about a riposte to the insult he had received from a man too busy to meet him it was not in misters nature to turn the other cheek weakness was never respected atkins told the eagle about the hotels history in the war it had been the centre for journalists and aid workers it was continually hit by artillery fire only the rooms at the back were safe for occupancy for weeks at a time there was no power to heat the building but it stayed open staff and guests living a cavedweller existence pointing out of the big plateglass windows and down at the wide street that had been snipers alley to the dark unlit towers of apartment blocks beyond the river atkins told the eagle about the marksmen who had sheltered high up there and fired down on civilians going to work or queuing at bread shops and water standpipes trying to get to school or college and the callous disregard of it the eagles face showed that he wished he was anywhere other than in that restaurant in that city mister ate only what he thought was necessary for sustenance each plate brought to him was taken away half finished the insult and what he would do about it consumed him out of an insult and its answer came strength the insult provided an opportunity for him to demonstrate his strength when he was twelve years old a teacher had called him an evil little swine a thief in front of the class he had followed that teacher home after school put on a balaclava punched the man to the ground and kicked him again and again charges could not be brought the teacher could not make an identification he had become king much feared among the twelveyearold kids as hed grown older hed left a trail of the same fear behind him in gaol and on the streets the man running hackney and the east when mister was climbing the ladders rungs had said that mister was a tittle shite with no future and was now walking on sticks because pistol bullets had disintegrated his kneecaps a man in eindhoven a dealer who was careless with buyers money had fled naked during the night with his wife and two children from a house that had cost him a million and a half dutch guilders while the fire that destroyed it blazed around him a man who had hacked him off in a pub who now had no tongue and no fingers might today have died mister was experienced in answering insults he had considered his problem decided on his response he didnt wait for coffee in his room he felt safe in control he knew of nothing that should make him feel otherwise a full day awaited him in the morning he was soon asleep under his room the citys latenight traffic prowled and did not disturb him is there anything more about that lorry it was late evening and monika holberg was just back in her office in the unis building tower a and she was tired which was rare for her and irritable which was rarer she had been on a field day out in the country west of the city she kicked off her muddied hoots and slung her heavy anorak at the door hook whether she was in the city and trawling through office appointments or away in the country villages she wore the same anorak and boots she had no other life in sarajevo other than her work for the united nations high commission for refugees she was tired because her driver had gone sick there hadnt been another available so she had driven herself and on the way back on the mountain road from kiseljak the rear right tyre of the nissan fourwheel drive had punctured shed had to change it herself and the nuts had been hell to shift she was irritated because the village shed visited beyond kiseljak was light years from being ready to receive and impress the visitors she would be escorting there next week she was a driven woman it was not in monikas character to accept that second best was enough whether in vehicle maintenance or visit preparation her secretary was on the other side of the thin partition that separated their cubicles brewing coffee and making a sandwich what lorry is that monika the lorry from those british people what do they call themselves bosnia with love isnt that what they call themselves i need that lorry maybe ankie took the call when i was at the meeting or at lunch monika rolled her eyes her secretary was not a driven woman her main concerns were what she was earning in salary and living allowance from unhcr and what a sacrifice she made and how she hated sarajevo she was fat on the citys back and her hair was always freshly styled the desk was littered with small squares of sticky yellow postit notes fastened where there was space among a haphazard strewnpaper sea she was bending over her table skipping the secretarys messages and identifying those of ankie the dutch girl who fielded her phone when it rang unanswered there isnt a message from ankie about the lorry perhaps there was no message can we talk about it in the morning she was brought the sandwiches and the coffee monika had eaten nothing since a rushed breakfast at dawn and it was the first halfgood cup of coffee her secretary was gone but she needed that lorry and its load the village had been sullen and unresponsive ambassadors functionaries and officials from the international community were coming to the village next week unless the mood lightened the vips might be whistled jeered at or worse ignored and coldshouldered a little man dapper and dancing in expensive shoes had waltzed into her office two weeks previously come in off the street fra andela zvizdovica and had offered a lorry full of clothes toys basic household goods and talked about what he called jumble sales and coffee mornings and fete collections monika holberg spoke fluent english as well as spanish german and italian but these were words that she could not translate from her experience of an island upbringing off norways coast north of the arctic circle she needed the lorry and its cargo to wipe the morose depression off the villagers faces before the visit donors she had learned wanted hope required stoic optimism if they were to dig again into their pockets and deeper than the last time she had a promise of the lorry but no word of its arrival in the city she wolfed her sandwiches and slurped her coffee she had believed the promise that the lorrys contents would be hers to distribute thirtythree years old tanned weatherbeaten blondhaired and uncaring about her appearance monika holberg was another piece of the mosaic that was falling quietly into place and she also had no knowledge of it she threw the cardboard sandwich plate and the coffee beaker at her rubbish bin missed and started to rip the messages off her desk joey had said on the stairs well call him the cruncher target ones accountant he was murdered what you suspected is proven when i find out how he was murdered and why the door will begin to open for me then i get to know what our target one is here for ill do my best the policeman had said and had hit the door with his fist cant do more than my best there was a veneer of respectability cigarettepaper thin about the room and its tenant she was middleaged going on elderly and her face was deeply lined but on the dressingtable were the jars and powder tins that would have helped her shed a few years she wore an old dressinggown that had once been flamboyant but which was now faded and joey could see the careful stitches where it had been repaired her hair was gathered into curling rollers her hands betrayed her immediate past she had seen better times now they were scarred reddened and swollen she smoked as she talked clamping a short cigaretteholder between yellowed teeth she had only one room her name had been the first typed on the page that judge delic had given joey hed had no option but to call the only other official link to the killing the policeman frank williams the policeman was involved because he had pulled the body from the river and written the report it was against joeys instincts to break church ranks and confide in a policeman even if the man was separated from the world of crime squad and criminal intelligence sawing on a buried nail in a log hed been told the policeman had to clear involvement with a superior and if that was achieved get away when he could he would not have been there without the policeman would have had no chance of finding the attic garret room and having gained admittance he would have had no language to hear her statement she sat on the bed from which she had been disturbed frank was opposite her at the table under the ceiling light beside his hand was a onehundred deutschmark note that was on offer but not yet handed over she talked joeys eyes roved round the room as he listened to franks translation he was trained to notice listen and suck in the relevance of what he heard and saw it is what i have already told the police who came to see me i can only say the same because that is the truth i can tell you what i saw and nothing more i am truthful i have always been truthful you want me to repeat it i will repeat it it is hard in they went out into a dark empty street the gloom clinging to them joey said what should happen the next day he had his street map and he thought he was only a few minutes walk to his hotel he was about to drift away when his shoulder was caught and he was spun round the lilting softness was gone from franks voice you do understand thats a powerful man as powerful as they come in this city what do you suggest i do go home chapter seven a good journey no problems mister the eel said jason tyrie had driven for mister for sixteen years and his uncle before him i did the border at bihac it was two fifty dms on the croat side and seven fifty for this sides crowd the warehouseman is one fifty a week you can buy anyone here the eel had been in a column of lorries bringing supermarket food over the frontier from croatia the sums hed paid out to customs on both sides of the line had been the going rate for avoiding inspection and duty and getting the documents stamped all the drivers carried wads of german notes the lorry bosnia with love painted gaudily on its sides was parked in the shadowed rear of the warehouse the eel had left the bonnet up had scattered tools on the concrete floor the inquisitive or the prying would have thought it was there for repairs the warehouseman minding his own business was out in the cold morning air hosing vehicles clean and sweeping away the lakes of water into the drain right mister said lets get to work he had the eagle the eel and atkins to help him atkins had been up early and had been to a vehicle dealer the toyota fourwheel drive smokedglass windows had been bought for cash the papers that went with it which made a pretence of a legal purchase were economic with its history they made no mention of its former ownership by the osce the toyota had been stolen from outside a hotel in vitez used by the organization for security and cooperation in europe had been resprayed and the plates had been changed close examination would have shown the osce logo on the doors but atkins had said that didnt matter no one was looking for such things they made a tunnel into the back of the lorry mister and the eel passing boxes down to the eagle and atkins they burrowed towards the bulkhead shifting only enough of the clothes and toys collected by the charities to give them access far to the back of the lorry were the heavier boxes mister was in charge and revelling in it the eagle was sweating had taken off his coat loosened his tie and when he thought mister wasnt watching him he left atkins to take the workload atkins stacked the boxes the ones they were after were bulkier more awkward to push and lift though the contents had been stripped down to the minimum the first of the bigger boxes came down passed to the eagle who sagged under its weight atkins used a penknife to slit the adhesive tape holding it shut and lifted out the first launcher mister watched him he felt warm pride to cut down on the weight and the bulk the launchers had been transferred from the slattedwood boxes and put into cardboard containers the eel had been told not to drive fast and to keep clear of rutted road surfaces atkins had it on the concrete floor knelt beside it and threw a small switch there was a faint humming sound and a red light showed at its rear good old cruncher while mister had been in brixton cruncher with atkinss help had given six months of his life to getting his hands on four of the mediumrange trigat launchers there had been an exercise in northern finland while mister had languished in his cell cruncher and atkins had done the deal with a major on a lapland range for fifty thousand american dollars in highdenomination notes the major responsible for driving the four launchers back from the range where they had been tested in minus degrees c not allowing for windchill had dropped back in the convoy on the iced road he had made easy excuses for his driver to travel in one of the lorries ahead at a carefully chosen point where the road between the range and the barracks wound above a sheer cliff that fell to a deep icecovered lake the jeep had skidded off the road as the official report stated plummeted down fractured the ice and would have come to rest among jagged rocks some two hundred metres below the frozen surface the cruncher and atkins had collected the four launchers and the twenty missiles taken from the jeep before the accident and driven them away before they left atkins had beaten up the major giving him injuries consistent with being thrown clear from the jeep as it had started its descent the major had been abandoned in a state of theatrical shock to walk eight kilometres to the barracks the pride of the finnish military determined that the manufacturers euromissile dynamics group of fontenoyauxroses in france were given an horrific picture of the road mishap the loss was forgotten the launchers and missiles were written off they had been loaded onto a lorry carrying pulped timber driven by the eel known to his mother as billy smith they had reached a british port a week after the scarred trembling major had shown investigators the tyremarks on the packed snow and the scars in the ice below well done cruncher seven weeks before the start of his trial mister had been told by the eagle that the launchers and missiles had reached safe haven and hed nodded as if hed never doubted they would three of the boxes were manhandled by atkins and the eel into an inner room at the extreme rear of the warehouse after a handgun had been taken from each before the fourth box was loaded into the toyota a map was spread out on it in magnified detail it showed the streets of the old quarter of the city as he outlined what would happen mister saw the way the eagle craned forward over atkinss shoulder to listen and watch his darting fingers he noted how the eagle hated all of it and could not help himself the map was folded away a small loaded ppk walther went into the back of his own belt and two filled magazines into his jacket pocket atkins drove away with the box with a luger pistol in the glove compartment he told the eagle that they would walk and find a taxi didnt bother to offer him a firearm mister left the eel a makharov in his anorak pocket to mind the lorry and stepped out into the streets of sarajevo to put right the matter of an insult i still dont see why i have to do it youre doing it because thats what im telling you to do and youll do it just like ive told you to maggie bolton said decisively it doesnt make sense everything just like ive told you joey shrugged and sighed so that she could read his annoyance and took the case from her hand they did a last check on her button microphone and his earpiece then on his microphone clipped to his undershirt and her earpiece folded in his shirt pocket was the authorization for intrusive surveillance signed by judge delic typed by his daughter if it was needed if he showed out at the custom house they would feed him to the rats on the thames mudflats she had a copy run off on the hotels machine hed argued all through breakfast and all through their walk from their hotel to the holiday inn and shed taken not a blind bit of notice and had carried on with her briefing detail of where in the room the bug should be placed she was quiet businesslike the speech microphones were presstotalk if speech was not possible then the crashout code was the repeated click on the button the atrium area of the hotel was empty now the ashtrays had been filled by the delegates to a foreigndonor conference but theyd started their meeting and the lethargic staff had not yet stirred themselves to clear up the pot plants were dying slowly outside through the plate glass of the picture windows were the two black mercedes saloons and the hoods they werent lounging as theyd been at the airport but were agitated smoking hard shouting into mobiles its not my job this isnt my area of expertise he knew the argument was lost can we go to work or shall we just carry on squabbling be a dear boy stop messing hed argued because he was frightened could neither help it nor hide it he walked towards the lift with the bag he turned once and looked back at her she winked gave him a little wave then headed for the revolving glass door from where the van was parked closer than last night shed have a clear view of the door and anyone who went through it if they used the revolving door and not the coffeeshop entrance the lift took joey to the third floor hed stood back when theyd arrived at the holiday inn and shed gone to reception she was a travel agent from london handling business packages she booked flights and hotels in the commercial sector she was checking through accommodation facilities in zagreb podgorica in montenegro pristina in kosovo and in sarajevo could she please inspect a room were all the rooms the same businessmen she had learned were happiest on the third floor not too high if they had a vertigo problem not too low to be disturbed by a hotels bars and the street traffic she had been shown joey trailing her unintroduced the bag carrier a room on the third floor and assured that the rooms were all the same exactly the same as was the policy of the hotel for a few moments joey and the woman from reception had been together in the bathroom and hed made a little point of examining the bottles of shampoo and bath foam and had seen the polaroids flash from behind the nearly closed door when theyd come out maggie had thanked the woman profusely and told her they were excellent rooms then moved on to rates and creditcard acceptability over coffee in the atrium theyd studied the photographs and shed told him what he should do and where the bug should be placed he went in the lift to the third floor shed shown him at their own hotel how to open a hotel room with a plastic bank card room he closed the door behind him the maid had been in and the room was clean the bed made pyjamas were folded on the pillow the wardrobe doors were closed a suitcase was on a rack a pair of shoes was underneath it he felt the room was a trap he did not know how long he had only that the opportunity might not come again he must hurry but not so that he made errors he had the photograph to guide him the telephone was too obvious shed said the first place that would be checked if the room were searched for bugs the light and power sockets would be the next he took a towel from the bathroom laid it on the upright chair from the desk carried the chair to the wardrobe and kicked off his trainers he stood on the towel no shoes so that he would not dirty it and the towel so that he would not indent the chair maggie had identified the waste space above the wardrobe below the ceiling as suitable housing with a screwdriver he prised back the wardrobes upper fascia board into the space behind went the power unit a black box the size of a paperback book he used the fineneedled spike shed given him and pressed it in sharply drove it in until he could feel the pressure on the front against his finger he made a tiny hole in the outer stained wood threaded the microphone a pinhead into the hole and worked it until the head was flush with the hole he threw a switch in the control saw the green light glow and held the board in his hand joey whispered testing two three four testing in his ear you close up right beside it is it back together not yet may need a volume tweak before it goes back together try it from the window then from beside the phone will do he put the board crudely into place and slipped down from the chair he went to the window and looked down to the pavement a full hundred feet below there was no balcony he saw a taxi swing off the road and then disappear under the flat roof sheltering the main door joey said im by the window this is normal speech level two three four testing from the window give me the ok then ill go to the phone position silence in his ear maggie im at the window have you got me at the window come in maggie a plaintive voice shrilled in his ear oh christ hes back i bloody missed him gone through the door get out out out target one is through the door i missed him he froze his trainers were on the floor by the desk the chair was by the wardrobe with the towel on it the fascia board was still loose out of place unfastened and cables were visible above it in an act of will he had to throw almost one leg in front of the other to get himself moving he lurched across the room towards the door the board was priority board chair towel he was on the chair using the heel of his hand to batter the board back into place maggie was screaming in his ear he could see the pinhead hole in the board and with his palm he made the last adjustment looked at it and jumped towel into the bathroom he slapped it on the rail but it slipped off more of the precious seconds were used hanging it as neatly as a maid would have out of the bathroom he ferried the chair to the desk he turned for the door and his toe right foot toe stubbed the chair leg no shoes no bloody shoes he shovelled on the shoes the voice in his ear calm now said you ran out of time joey hes on the landing outside the room there were voices in the corridor he knew the one voice from the hours of the tapes and the earphones the door was the only way out the bed was too low on the floor to slide under he heard the room card go into the door lock he went to the window where there was the drop that would kill him and insinuated himself behind the curtain there was silence in his ear as if there was nothing more she could tell him no more help she could offer the door opened then the inner bathroom door he heard mister urinate then the flush the creak of the wardrobe door being pulled open mister was whistling joey found himself trying to recognize the tune and couldnt mister belched looking down at his feet joey saw that one of the untied laces would be protruding from behind the curtain would be in view from the files he knew of every killing attributed to mister knew the details of every death all the killings featured pain before death were never quick he was bursting to wet his trousers he heard the door close and the footsteps retreat joey counted to fifty tied his laces then let himself out down the corridor into the lift down in the lift into the atrium he thought shed have been there waiting but she wasnt the two black mercedes cars were pulling out of the hotel parking area and into the traffic flow of zmaja od bosne there was a piercing horn blast he ran towards the blue van which had been driven onto the forecourt he fell into the passenger seat did you hear him whistling he asked like a nightingale maggie said she drove fast towards the road what was the tune what was its name i couldnt remember its bloody name joey said flatly it was elvis come on or are you too young wooden heart recorded during his army service werent you born then it was clear as a bell are you all right i was actually about to piss in my trousers i suppose youre too important to put your own bugs in place give the job to the boy who would have checked the gear seen it was working you it was icily said he hadnt thought of it he subsided she was in touch just with the second mercedes he was thinking dully of the fear he had felt and he had not even seen the man he had feared the whistling closeness and did not know how to confront the fear he let the anger burst you were bloody damn late on the warning i could have been killed because you were late i had fuckall time to get the room back in place because of you he kills people do you know that he hurts people before he kills them this isnt some bloody game with diplomatic bloody immunity you said it yourself i bloody missed him you couldnt have given me less warning if youd bloody tried miss fucking superior who the fuck do you think you are maggie bolton had a soul but precious few could find it her father hadnt a ministry of defence qualitycontrol engineer at the aerospace factory at preston in lancashire would admit to colleagues and relations that he could not reach close enough to touch the emotions of his daughter christened margaret emily eight years back he had gone to the crematorium two months after being declared redundant still not knowing her proud of her yes but not understanding her mother too was kept at arms length had been there through maggies childhood young womanhood and was there still as her daughter drifted into middle age was phoned once a week if it was convenient was sent postcards if maggie was away and it did not breach security but was not confided in there had been no schoolfriends who had lasted into adult life a bachelor uncle had taught at a minor public school in the west country and since the school was short of girl entrants had arranged a bursary for her she had taken no interest in sport as the other girls had and had devoted her time to the physics and electronics laboratories she had won a place at sussex university to study electronic engineering the only female in that years intake on the course at the end of three years her exam results had disappointed her lecturers she had taken only a lowersecond degree she had spent too much of her last academic year working on a programme of research and development hived out to her department by technicians from the secret intelligence service routinely such organizations looked to the universities to upgrade their equipment into stateoftheart standards afterwards regardless of her poor degree the sis managers had snapped her up the secrecy of intelligence work suited her it was a wall behind which she could live she could even justify her lack of communication with her parents they were not on the needtoknow list as a new recruit she was in the basement workshops of the building they called ceauescu towers below the waterline level of the thames in the evenings she spent hours with the master technicians of imperial colleges laboratories after the lecturers and students had gone home no one in her life was allowed close to her at parties home or away her prettiness laughter trim figure and ringless finger ensured that she was a central attraction but although she flirted shamelessly in public she was alone in bed her fingernails were the giveaway to her skill clipped back to the quick the fingers were small and firmly boned perfect for the precision of her work with microphones infinity transmitters tracking beacons and fisheye pinhead cameras in the basement work shops and in the universitys laboratories she was admired a foreman at imperial had once said she could get a probe bug up a crocodiles bum and he wouldnt even know his sphincter was being tickled her research was focused on two specific areas both equally critical for sis operations the downsizing of equipment and the clarity of reception it was not on her file but she had only loved two men in her fortyseven years in the summer of she had gone to warsaw travelling on a diplomatic passport and with her gear in a diplomatic bag the contact introduced to her by the station officer was a young male clerk working in the polish ministry of defence with access to the permanent secretarys office she had provided the bug hed put it in place she was then thirtyfour and a virgin and he was eleven years younger frightened witless at what he had agreed to do it had been a sort of love more in the mind than in the muscle furtive kisses and hands held briefly in the clandestine night meetings the bug was the best she had ever made its low transmission of power signals ensured it defeated the monthly scanning of the permanent secretarys office and intelligence flowed to the antennae on the roof of the british embassy six months later long after she had gone home she was told that the clerk had been arrested tried in camera for treason and hanged in the central prison when she was told she had been offered and had accepted a pink gin her composure had not flickered in she had manufactured the tiny microphone bug to be fitted into the mobile phone of an iraqi official of the mukhabarat who travelled to meet fellow secret intelligence officers in tripoli libya the beauty of the device was that it could be activated to monitor both telephone transmissions and voice conversations that did not involve the phone she had spent five days in malta with the libyan police bodyguard who had been turned and had the task of inserting the bug in the targets phone it had worked she was told like a dream and she was told also two months later that the bodyguard sweet charming courteous vulnerable and loving on evenings on the hotel veranda overlooking the sea had been held tortured and shot again the gin had been offered her again her composure had held if she cried it was only in the silence of her tiny flat she was a part of the old world a cold war warrior she had protested viciously when her linemanager had assigned her to sarajevo told that her annual assessment interview would be postponed given to understand that the latest rate of per diem expenses should not be exceeded unless she was prepared to stump up the excess herself yes she had been to sarajevo in the war but with her own people and in a time before the linemanagers had taken control of ceaucescu towers a time before assessments were de rigueur for experienced experts when expenses were passed without quibble there had been bugs in the presidents office and in the un generals operations centre and nearly if there had been another week to work on it in ratko mladics headquarters as far as she was concerned this assignment was vulgar plod work a waste of her time she was damned if she would easily give a sight of her soul to joey cann forget it maggie said its in the past is that all youve got to say too right thats all youre getting hed subsided into silence and let her drive shed been on the courses run from fort monkton at gosport from the old strongpoint built to deter napoleonic ideas of invasion on the hampshire coast overlooking the english channel shed learned to drive surveillance cars through the close portsmouth city streets in country lanes and up the motorway towards london she knew what she was doing but it was hard in the clogged traffic to hold the link with the mercedes and she didnt need his righteous scared anger you dont know as much as you think do you she said w h a t you say you know everything about the target but you dont you didnt know he liked presley for starters its only small but its the small things that matter in my experience the better people in this game have humility he brooded she didnt regret chipping away at his arrogance she braked they were in the old quarter the cars were parked half on the pavement a hundred yards ahead she saw packer target one and the gang of the hoods and targets two and three and then she saw serif mister said youve been kept waiting i do apologize i had business to attend to its so annoying isnt it when business holds things up mobile to mobile sarajevo to london cruncher had reported to the eagle that serif spoke good english serif said and i should apologize to you mr packer because my business prevented me from meeting you at the airport yesterday thats fine no offence and thats the apologies out of the way good other than to his mother who was dead and to his father in cripps house mister never apologized and meant it i am happy and i welcome you as i welcomed your associate mr dubbs very sad what happened to mr dubbs he was a trusted friend a great loss to you and a great hurt to me that such a tragic accident should happen in my city well talk about it first im going to ask a favour of you serif if i may call you that id be gratified if youd accompany me something of a bit of a surprise for you mister never asked favours and seldom expressed gratitude predictably serif hesitated mister smiled guilelessly at him they were standing on the pavement outside the guarded staircase that led to serifs apartment in a district of narrow streets and alleyways of traditional jewellery stores little restaurants coffeehouses and bookshops all dominated by a slender mosque tower misters smile calculated and the gentle way he took the sleeve of serifs jacket made it difficult for the man to refuse it was as he had intended they rode in the two mercedes he shared the back seat with serif and the eagle was sandwiched between them his shoulder in serifs armpit and the impression of the holstered weapon digging into him mister saw the nervous flutter on the eagle face misters ppk walther was against his buttocks it was fourteen years since he had fired a handgun in anger across a street and into the upper thigh of chrissie dimmock it was eleven years since he had fired in vengeance point blank into the back of the skull of the yardie ivanhoe pilton chrissie dimmock and ivanhoe pilton had disputed territory with him if the roles had been reversed if the bosnian had come on to his turf he would have shot him and left the mixer to dispose of him washed himself down and gone to have a good lunch or dinner the road climbed past the crumpleddown pylon of a skilift they stopped on a piece of wasteground at its furthest edge he saw the tall upright atkins there were kids who watched over a few skinny goats looking at the cars mister stepped from the car the eagle at his side sealed to him as if they were siamese he waved for serif to catch him up and walked towards atkins behind him a voice at the kids and they ran at a sharp pace he crossed the wasteground to where the mediumrange trigat launcher squatted on the ground its tripod legs set in the earth a sheet of plastic behind it beside atkinss feet it was aimed back over the city into the indistinct mass of roofs and windows atkins nodded to him briskly mister thought atkins brought class with him mister said a little present serif something that expresses my goodwill you got a mobile i have a mobile you got someone in your address i have a friend there you should ring your friend and tell him to open the front window the big one then stand there please could you do that for me the call was made mister said since this is going to be yours serif i expect youd like to know about it mr atkins is your man atkins said as if he was an instructor at a class this is the trigat a multimission mediumrange system for infantry its designed for use against tanks helicopters and reinforced bunkers the range is two hundred to two and a half thousand metres and at two thousand metres the missile flight time is under twelve seconds when it will have reached a speed of one hundred and fifty kilometres per hour the aim point is the hit point and cannot be affected by countermeasures with a double charge for maximum penetration it will come into full service production next year it will work equally well at minus thirtyfive degrees or plus forty degrees its the best would you like to see what it can do what here in the city serif giggled mister said perhaps youd like to see serif what mr atkins chose as a target take a look through the sight he thought it would have been obvious to serif but the man knelt and then lay on the plastic sheet his eye to the aperture the view through the sight times ten magnification would carry serif over the rooftops over the river and the bridges over more roofs to an open window where the curtains blew in the wind where a man in a black shirt and black jeans stood and behind him the most prized possessions of serif lowlife hood if the missile were fired its bright flame exhaust fizzing across the city it would explode iinside that room mister flicked his eyebrow the slightest movement but it was picked up by atkins a good man alert atkins crouched beside serif and depressed the main system switch there was the sound of a bees drone he said easily without malice its live serif just press the tit and youll see how good it is only destroys the target everything around the targets ok you up for it serif wriggled back on the plastic sheet as if he were frightened that any slip any clumsy movement against the launcher might trigger its firing mister grinned the detective chief inspector he owned in the crime squad had once quoted to him the remark of the detective superintendent then leading the hunt for evidence against him always watch his eyes the rest of his face can be all sparkling and laughing never his eyes theyre fucking evil eyes hed stood the night he was told that in front of the mirror and had stared into his reflection hed not told the princess how the detective superintendent had described his eyes he reached out with his hand to help serif up and atkins switched off the trigat he held serifs hand and with the other he slapped the mans back youll find me a good friend serif im not the sort of little man who takes offence when im stood up at the airport by a guy who has more important business than meeting me its yours because youre my friend and theres four warheads to go with it and theres more where its come from for you for when weve done trading and theres different presents as well when youre with me youll feel like its your birthday every day lets meet tomorrow and ill see that nice apartment of yours itll be my pleasure what is it its an antitank launcher maggie said as she took the binoculars back from him she slung their strap around her neck against the gold chain and the hanging st christopher half a roll of film had been exposed in her camera bloody hell joey mouthed he thought he could see without the binoculars the launcher being loaded into the boot of the second mercedes she had turned the van round so that it faced down the hill and away from the wasteground she said softly i wonder if our friend ismet knows the expression beware of strangers bearing gifts theres going to be tears if his mother never told him that they left as the second mercedes boot was closed down they drove away they were too exposed where they had parked what would that thing do joey asked she was thoughtful its not about what it can do possession of it gives a man power but not as much power as goes to the man who provides it thats a big play for serious business am i not obliged to report that tell the authorities the international police task force shouldnt i dont be ridiculous maggie said dont make me wish youd stayed in your pram they went back to the holiday inn parked within sight of the main door and maggie crawled into the back of the van and settled with her earphones and tape decks while joey went to look for sandwiches summer he was called rado the new men stationed in the village of ljut called him by that name because the previous unit had and the unit before them each morning they had watched him wander purposefully from the ruins of the village opposite down the track to the ford across the river which was now low and wade across then seen his stride quicken as he stampeded out of the water and settled for his days feeding in the overgrown grasslands of the grazing meadows in the evening when the sun dipped he reversed his route and went back to a lonely sleep in the byre near the well of vraca village during long days rado was the mens only sight of movement in the fields to the front of them their only source of interest they bet on his survival as had the unit before them and the unit before that the soldiers were little more than boys from villages where their parents had farms and far from home they took comfort from the sight of rado each day because he represented something familiar his story was handed down on the day each unit was relieved on new years day nineteen months before the fundamentalists had abandoned the village across the river and the livestock had been turned out to fend for themselves rado then unnamed was a recently castrated bull calf of limousin stock the dairy cows had died in trumpeting agony because they were not milked the sheep had been scattered by a wolf pack some had been hunted down and some had fled to the high woods behind the village the chickens and geese had been the prey of foxes the heifers dominated by the one bull calf among them had come down to the ford in the spring fifteen months before when the rivers pace slackened and its depth dropped they would have scented the good new grass ahead of them and had crossed each in sporadic and haphazard turn had stepped on disturbed or shifted a mine last summer all but three had been killed they went back these survivors each evening to the byre over the river where a dog waited for them the autumn had come the river had risen and the three heifers and the bull calf had been blocked from coming over then it was spring again and they were back they had returned for their daily feeding in the grass meadow in the first week in april by the third week of april after two dulled smokerising explosions there had been only one heifer to walk beside the bull calf lost sad mooning lovers on the last day of april the ground had erupted in a mess of noise and upthrown turf sods and the bull calf had been alone the story handed down to each successive unit occupying the bunkers flanking ljut village was that the bull calf had stayed with the maimed heifer all that day that it had steadily licked the heifers head hour after hour had quietened her screams of agony had stayed with her until death and release then as the evening had come on he had gone back to the ford and crossed to sleep alone through may june and july into august the daily return of rado was watched by the troops and he was given his name it was the familiar abbreviation of radovan the given name of their leader karadzic to confer respect and admiration the sector was at peace there was no fighting in the valley on the orders of their sergeant the soldiers manned the two bunkers every morning for the hour before and after dawn and every evening from the hour before and after dusk then they had no duties other than cleaning the bunkers their sleeping quarters and their weapons rado was the attraction the betting started at the time he was named in the grazing fields among the weeds of the unploughed arable fields and between the fallen posts and sagging wires of the vineyard lay the skeletal outlines of the heifers rado seemed not to notice the upturned weatherwhitened ribcages occasionally not more than once a day he would raise his massive neck throw his huge head high and bellow for company he was doomed all the soldiers knew it and they bet on which hour which day which week his great hoofs would wrench the tripwire of a prom mine or brush the post holding a pmr mine or drop his weight onto the squat antenna points of a pma mine he seemed immune invulnerable so they watched him fascinated from the high ground and the bets were laid the sergeant was their bank and issued the betting slips a thoughtful man he had realized that unpayable debts between his soldiers would increase tension among them he had ordered that all bets should be of not a pfennig more than a single german mark the only currency they valued and that no soldier could wager more than twice a day he set the odds collected the money and left enough in a plastic sack to pay out a winner using the profit margin to buy little luxuries in the market in the town cigarettes vegetables cooking utensils blankets long hot flyblown days followed one another while the soldiers slept ate smoked read magazines or wrote to their homes one man was always deputed as sentry but his real job was to watch rado there was a fullcanopied ash tree between the grazing fields and the arable fields it was ten minutes to two oclock the sentry in the bunker saw rado rise from the trees shade first by extending his rear legs then kneeling on his front legs before straightening them his tail flicked his back to clear the flies he looked around him and sniffed perhaps he needed water from the river or to eat rado went slowly the long grass was pushed aside by his lowered muscled belly and flattened by his hoofs each step he took pressing with such weight on the ground seemed deliberate and purposeful the sentry watched and the sound of the flies droned in his ears through the shimmer of the heat rados progress proud strong and tall was the only movement in the valley there was a flash of firelight then a puff of grey chemical smoke then the rush of the explosion the fire was gone the grass and earth fell b a c k the smoke started to d r i f t then quiet and stillness the great beast keeled over for a moment its four legs were upright visible above the tall grass then they were thrashing the cry of the castrated bull rang out across the valley the sentry was leaning against the hot metal of his machinegun his hands covering his eyes so that he could not see but he could not shut out rados call for help the tears flooded his face the others had heard the explosion had broken from their meal or their siesta the bunker filled with soldiers he was pulled aside from the earth floor of the bunker he saw the sergeant lock the butt of the machinegun against his shoulder in the sentrys mind was the desperate kicking of rados legs a single shot for aiming then the burst of fire and the bunker was filled with cordite stench and with the rattle of the ejected bullet cases the weapon was made safe the sentry dared to stand and look through the firing port there was nothing to see no movement in the grass near the river he did not know it none of them could have but the bullets that ended the pain of the animal would be the last fired in the war over the fields of the valley hello didnt expect to see you in here i went for a walk my rooms too h o t will you have a drink atkins had come in from the street had gone to the atrium bar bought a beer and had seen him it was still short of eleven oclock and mister was in his room the bar of the eightstorey hotel was deserted except for them and a bored waiter the eagle sat disconsolate as a reformed alcoholic with a halfconsumed orange juice in front of him he was lonely sad and had been thinking of home wrapped in the thoughts of the chiddingfold house and the stables of mo and the girls fine as i am thank you may i join you be my guest he knew little of atkins except that mister valued him it was the way of mister that life and business should be boxed kept apart a policeman over lunch had once told him that the irish terrorists used a cell system to cut off an information leak if one cell should be arrested it was the same principle he knew as little of atkins as he did of the mixer or the eels or the cards the only one he knew because he drew up the legal contracts for the deals was the cruncher who was dead atkins ripped off an anorak and a fleece then dumped them beside the chair low music played through loudspeakers atkins looked directly at him if you dont mind my saying so and i dont mean to be impertinent but you dont seem totally on board is it that obvious he was too tired for denials funny thing when i was here before twice at this time of year we lived like eskimos we were wrapped up in every coat we could fit on tuzla and sarajevo there wasnt the heatingoil your nose was half frozen when you woke up you could get frostbite or damn near it in bed doesnt seem right to be here and cooked ive turned the thermostat down and opened the window seems pretty obvious to me i do what im asked to do and when i have a role to play ill play it he said wearily atkins pressed whats wrong with the concept the eagle was careful thats a leading question i might rule it inadmissible im not a blagger i suppose thats the vernacular of your clients i hold my drink my water and my secrets youre an educated intelligent man a professional he interrupted sharply dont ever underestimate him because he hasnt a conventional career training he is a very clever man after a lifetime of living with it the eagle understood every facet of questioning and interrogation he could recognize when he was being pumped for opinions and those questions that came from personal confusion but youre not on board its there for anyone to see that you dont approve does anyone ever stand up to him its not that simple i give advice when its asked for i keep my mouth shut when its not asked for the question was asked again but does anyone stand up to him a few have theyre either dead maimed or living their lives behind locked doors do you need to know that was high risk today it was fun but it was taking a hell of a chance i wouldnt have done it but im not ashamed to say it i hadnt the balls to tell him he doesnt know this place has no idea about these people i told him that and my opinion wasnt asked a second time the grave took the only person who ive known to stand up to him his mother the eagle would not have said that in his office in his home wouldnt have said it anywhere that was familiar in the great cave of the atrium bar he felt in truth so goddam lonely he spoke quietly and atkins had to hunch forward to hear him were in this together you and me if we ever get out of this bloody place cruncher didnt and get home and i thought that youd repeated this conversation then id see to it that you needed crutches to walk on his mother she stood up to him incredulity splashed atkinss face he idolizes the memory of the woman he should have stopped and talked about the weather but he was drawn forward did not stop she was a good decent saltoftheearth workingclass woman i am not patronizing it all came out when she died the only time hes been maudlin i had to endure an hour of selfpitying shit it was the usual grubby little story was the year hed just started to buy heroin in green lanes off the turks and he was pushing into an existing dealers territory to sell it on there are few surprises in this life and that dealer was not a happy man he came looking for our lord and master he was shot in the stomach the only thing the dealer said to the detectives at his bedside was no comment said it again and again i was down at caledonian road with mister hes very good when being interrogated a legal adviser could not ask more of a client nine questions out of ten he would say nothing and stare at the ceiling but at the tenth he would speak on the advice of my solicitor i cannot answer your question at this stage it cant be used in court then that he refused to cooperate the blame for it shifts to me he doesnt answer questions because hed have to lie and lies are caught out the detectives hear a lie and move on then jump back to it twenty minutes later from a different line of questions lies dont work the police knew he was responsible for the shooting but they hadnt forensics hadnt a victims accusation and hadnt a lie it was two years before he was married and moved out of cripps house the police searched the flat it was my words at the time a vindictive and destructive search they wrecked the place anything that could be broken was broken it was an act of frustrated vandalism he came back from the police station cocky and free his father was at work but not his mother she turned on him laid into him thats what he told me and he hit her across the face with his fist blacked her eye and split her forehead she wouldnt go to the surgery for stitches she told his father that shed walked into a door she carried the scar on her eyebrow the hair never grew on it again for the rest of her life his father isnt a fool hed have known a door didnt make that sort of injury it was never referred to again he tried to buy his way out of the guilt but they didnt want a retirement home at peacehaven or brightlingsea they stayed in cripps house maybe as a reminder they could have lived like millionaires but they wouldnt have it theres a pretence in his life that his mother and father always supported him never criticized him that they took the line that the old bill just got lucky and it was the bad company that led him on and deep down hes a decent boy the usual old crap thats not true his mind is compartmentalized and hitting his mother is ringfenced and excised from memory it was only the shock of her death that brought it back for an hour on my bloody shoulder he pumps money into the hospice where she died and into the church where they had the funeral but thats as far as it goes no one else ever stood up to him why are you here try greed young man try that for a reason thats two of us i suppose atkins said softly he gathered up his anorak and fleece and wandered to the lift the eagle had a house in the country with horses all paid for atkins had a twobedroom flat in fulham that could go on the market for half a million the eagle had a series bmw coupe in the drive and a topofthepricelist range rover for mo to drag the horsebox atkins had a lotus sports soft top without mister the eagle would have been a struggling lawyer dependent on legal aid pickings without mister atkins would have been another failed exsoldier struggling on the consultancy circuit bullshitting for a living of course it was greed for them both if the gravy train hit the buffers it would be here because mister was off his territory did atkins know that or was atkins a fool too tired to make an answer the eagle went to his room he was guilty for having talked but atkins too was guilty for having listened god he wished he could drink but he dared not i just want to hear the statement not the story and then i want to get out joey said the story translated in full by frank no edit was of the daily life in sarajevo under siege its better you hear it you wont understand the truth unless you hear the story frank answered him from the side of his mouth a murmur on his lips i think you should let me handle it my way they were close to what frank called the jewish cemetery he said it was where there had been the worst fighting where the muslim infantry had sustained the worst casualties frank told him that the cemetery was still stuffed with mines ordnance unexploded grenades and bodies and hadnt yet been cleared but there wasnt too much of a hurry because all the jews had gone to the death camps sixty years earlier from the layout of the windows there would have been eight apartments in the building only two of the windows had lights on the rest of the building joey thought was too damaged to be lived in it was a bare room the largest feature in it more dominating than the bed the cooker the washbasin and the plastic garden table was a metal bookcase it could have held more than five hundred hardbacked books and it was empty a small thin man with cavernous cheeks and bad gapped teeth sat on the bed his hair was wispy thin and his hands were locked together as if to stop them shaking the fingers were gentle and thin it was a living death we had no electricity no water except from the river no sewage system no food no transport no work to look forward to we had only the escape of death we existed alongside death for month after month there were some in my block who for three years did not go outside their front door never went out there were some who put on a tie each day and a filthy shirt then walked into the city never running as if it were normal there were others who ran everywhere the ones who stayed in they could as easily have been killed by a tank shell the dogs did well if you were killed and not picked up if it was too dangerous to retrieve you the dogs had you would feast on you they ate better than us in the winter when there was snow and rain we had enough water we would boil it up and put in grass or nettles or leaves and that we would call a sarajevo soup to heat the water we burned books i had many books i could make many fires i am a musician to make a better fire one day to heat my soup more quickly i burned my violin the man unlocked his hands and reached for a glass of water which slopped to the floor on its journey from the table to his lips and back i was lucky a restaurant opened in a basement a safe building and i was taken on to play for the diners there were restaurants open for foreigners to eat in where the food had come through the tunnel under the runway at the airport i was lucky to be chosen as a musician there because the kitchen allowed me to eat what was left on the plates but that was in the last year of the war joey listened stonefaced he could remember nothing of the war if it was on television at home his father had broken off from whatever he was talking about and muttered his contempt for people of such savagery if his mother had the remote she flipped channels the war had not registered with him it had been far away and someone elses problem they were not interested in hearing me play a violin even if i could have found another one i played the electric guitar i did not complain i would have preferred to play mozart the violin concerto k allegro but i preferred more to eat so i was the backing to the chanteuse singing elton john and eric clapton it was survival in war sacrifices must be made joey asked of frank where did he play the question was put and answered frank said he says he played at the disconite and he still plays there ask him what he saw frank recited i have been shown a photograph of the face of the dead man he was drunk he was alone and staggering i saw him cross the obala kulina bana and then he went to the wall above the river he was leaning on it and swaying i had the impression he might have been vomiting over the wall the last thing i saw of him he was heading towards the bridge that is all i can tell you even across the barriers of language joey could recognize a rehearsed speech there was no attempt at disguise frank said ruefully it is the same verbatim as his statement who owns the disconite restaurant same man as the platinum city joey shrugged yes he knew but he had needed to hear it there was no banknote for the violinist who did not bother to hide a lie they went out closed the outer door after them joey said if i were to threaten to break his hands to smash his fingers so that he would not play again a violin or an electric guitar frank looked at him shook his head forget the illegality right they have been through the war they are hardened to any cruelty that you or i are capable of inflicting you wouldnt be able to do it nor me joey was a farm boy his father was the factor of a landowners estate he had seen rabbits dying in snares and enmeshed in nets when fleeing from ferrets he had seen huntsmen dig out vixens and their cubs from the dens and toss them to the hounds he had seen badgers choked in sealed setts he had seen when beating for the owners shoot the fluttering fall of winged pheasants before the dogs caught and shook them to death he had hated what he had seen i know you said last night when i find out how he was murdered and why he was murdered then the door begins to open for me you said that franks voice was hoarse as if he realized he walked on an unmapped road if its that important if and your hands and mine would stay sort of clean then their own people could do it chapter eight frank showed joey in the building was at the heart of a little empire of white prefabricated boxes the room was reached down a hushed corridor covered with lifeless green synthetic carpet that stifled the sound of shoes policemen and women in a polyglot of laundered uniforms their national flags sewn to their upper sleeves busily carried papers from office to office laid them beside colleagues who laboured at computer screens the corridor smelt of fresh ground coffee and fresh heated croissants there were no raised voices here speech was as muted as the murmur of the computers a quiet voice responded to franks knock joey was shown inside it was a tiny workspace shoehorned between walls that were little more than screens the walls were pincushions for leave charts maps duty rosters and photographs of children and the shield insignias of police forces from all over the world from the czech republic and south australia to mexico it represented a brotherhood he felt no part of youre mr cann customs and excise of the united kingdom franks told me about you how can i help joey had no insignia to offer the office coordinated the training of the bosnian police to deal with the threat of organized crime it was the start of their fourth day in sarajevo the third of mister the eagle and atkins and a routine had been established for both joey and maggie a routine was important they came from structured employment and an ordered division of responsibilities suited them maggie bolton was up early and had driven the blue van to the parking area close to the holiday inn hotel to tune the audio equipment monitoring room joey would follow later and join her after his visit to the headquarters of the international police task force when their target one left the hotel they would both follow as best they could and share the surveillance through the day and the evening when target one returned to the hotel maggie would resume her watch with the earphones and joey was free to roam i dont have much time thats not a sarajevo habit god a man in a hurry its almost worth a diary entry shoot frank didnt intervene leaving joey to explain what was wanted and to emphasize the requirement for security secrecy the man relentlessly chewing gum wore the badge of the royal canadian mounted police on his upper sleeve he listened without comment he had small darting eyes that stayed locked on joeys spectacles the smartness of the canadians uniform and the high polish of his boots unsettled joey in his faded jeans sweatshirt sweater and windcheater heheard joey out let me tell you mr cann about my day i am from a town in manitoba you wouldnt know its name with a population of around fifteen thousand who are mostly aboriginals right now there its late evening the temperature is around minus thirtyfive degrees and its my home i was shipped out of there six months ago and ill be shipped back in three months and i cant wait my day starts each morning at five and i leave my little room out in ilidza for which i pay five hundred german marks a month and i go to work out in a gymnasium thats equipped by the sfor military i shower and at seven i ring my wife then i get my breakfast in the american camp at butmir where its familiar food and cheap i am in my office by eight oclock and until five oclock in the afternoon i put papers from my intray into my outtray and when the outtray is full i put them back in the empty intray i break that up with a couple of meetings most of which are taken up by translation time and a sandwich for lunch after five oclock i go back to my room and cook myself a meal in the kitchen i share with two swedish doghandlers and i might gossip a little with them after my meal i watch a video or read a book and im in bed by nine oclock that way the nights go faster my regret is that i cannot make the days go quicker i am wasting my time here i know that and my government knows it as each rcmp officer goes home he will not be replaced its not about the cost but about the lack of achievement put brutally mr cann we are kicking soft excreta the place is a crossroads every form of criminal trafficking is coming through here women from the ukraine romania and russia either to work in brothels here or for transit into western europe asylum seekers from china afghanistan iran anywhere you want are stacked here before being moved on tobacco is shipped in from italy and resold in bulk a luxury car is stolen in the street in the morning in hamburg or stuttgart the next morning its here and in a workshop where the numbers are filed off and the morning after its on its way via slovakia to moscow the balkan trail of the drugs route has reopened after the war its not being moved in kilos but in tonnes i want to go home back to that ballsfreezing cold in manitoba because i cant do a damn thing here the country is held in a web of corruption i cannot fight it people like me are in place and people more important than me and were all just pissing in the wind everyones on the take at the moment we keep the corruption under the surface and nearly out of sight but the canadians are leaving and everyone else will be quitting and then a whole country in the heart of europe will be handed over to serious gangsters the turks russians albanians italians and the local men have you heard of serif you have ok there isnt a senior politician here or a senior official with any power who is fighting the culture of corruption we were supposed to do some good by coming here remember we were going to teach a society that had endured the rape of war how to put that experience behind them we came with a noble sentiment and generosity about the tenth time you get your shin lacked you start to get the message little people are too frightened to come to us the big people see us as being in the way and obstructing their snouts from going deeper into the swill troughs today im dealing with three million american dollars worth of tractors trailers balers plus a hundred tonnes of agricultural fertilizer plus eighty tonnes of seed potatoes donated by the un which is your taxpayers and mine found upcountry in a warehouse owned by a politician hed have sold part of the loot on and the rest hed have distributed as largesse that was a chance find by a bloodyminded patrol of finns who havent been here long enough to have given up on the place we are not even scratching the surface theres a bigger problem mr cann and it worries me a whole lot more who am i to stand in judgement where i come from in manitoba we are getting into a culture of criminality the aboriginal kids are on dope lsd and lighter fuel theyre drinking aftershave lotion and the adults are smashed out of their minds on class a stuff a city like winnipeg where your seniorcitizen tourists come to start their coach trips of the rockies has what we classify as a serious heroin problem in british columbia they now grow better marijuana than the mexicans on the us border were stopping perhaps one load out of twenty five per cent of hard drugs its not that were losing the war is already lost were in a sewer at home so who am i to tell these people that its wrong for them to be in a cesspit perhaps thinking never helped a lawenforcement officer you said you were a busy man mr cann thats good and i hope you can keep hold of your enthusiasm i am prepared to authorize frank williams to continue liaison with you i am also prepared to authorize the four officers named by frank to be available to be with you as a part of a training exercise you understand me mr cann a training exercise and i wish to know nothing more good luck thank you sir joey made a mental note to send him a pin or a tie when he was back when he had finished he ran from the stifling heat of the portakabin city and hoped he was not late to link with maggie mister said i want a warehouse full time and permanent what you want packer is protection they were around a circular glass table mister the eagle and himself on one side and facing them were ismet mujic and two men atkins thought the older one heavybuilt bigfisted squarefaced and crophaired might be an intelligence officer or senior in the police but he was not introduced and he had not spoken the other man younger without a name or a voice had lank black hair with gel in it and the air of privileged connection atkins presumed the conversation was recorded just as the eagle had their device built into the base of his attache case laid on a side table at the back of the room not hidden was a loaded kalashnikov assault rifle with two magazines taped together and at the side of the table and positioned like a favourite new toy was the launcher still holding the missile tube the rottweilers were beside the door stretched out and sleeping occasionally pawing each other then yawning to show their teeth sometimes through the door came the grating cough of one of the guards the ambience guns dogs guards was intended to intimidate mister had left his ppk walther in the toyota and said the luger given to atkins should be with it it was the first time atkins had been with mister for a major negotiation seen the style mister the eagle and he had countered the intention to intimidate by hooking their jackets on to the chair behind them showing they were not armed it is not packer it is mister i dont need protection i want cooperation can you be so sure after so few hours here mister packer that you will not need protection i have never needed protection in my life but always try to find cooperation before theyd left the toyota mister had said that it was all about body language the body must never show fear on the road into and out of tuzla when atkins had worn the blue beret and been on foodconvoy escort hed known that noise and determination and an absence of fear were the currency for getting through the roadblocks manned by drunk serb muslim or croat thugs at the roadblocks were papaks oafs and they were bullies he had learned it was a crime to show fear to the roadblock kids he thought the body language of mister was a master class in itself it was all about bluff and presence mr dubbs used that word many times he spoke of cooperation well talk of him when we have agreed on cooperation you bring a lawyer with you what is the value of a lawyer my colleague is here to draw up a document of cooperation i cooperate with you and you cooperate with me it is put down on paper and we sign it we both sign it the document is our bond you have a copy and i have a copy around the table from him at misters left shoulder the eagle had nodded decisively at the mention of his part in the matter atkins remembered the lonely outpouring of the previous evening in the atrium bar he thought the eagles dependence on mister outweighed a fear of the guns the dogs and the guards he thought also that misters quiet answers confused ismet mujic and there were moments when he hesitated and glanced to either side of him before throwing his next question and if mister packer you should break the bond its just mister then youve lost nothing and if i should break the bond mister im not making threats serif the launcher aimed at your lovely apartment was only my idea of a little joke if you were to break the bond go back on your word you would lose more money than you can dream of i pay well for cooperation misters voice was pitched low to hear him they all had to lean across the table which gave gravity to him the eagle had said that mister was a very clever man the agenda was his and ismet mujic followed mr dubbs did not say what you would pay for me to decide when we have discussed cooperation the problem mister there are no problems when two men of business both seek to do a deal then there isnt a need for problems if you do not have protection then it is possible that you have a difficulty with the police each point made by ismet mujic was countered immediately by mister sometimes with a small off hand gesture of his arm and diminished a part of the reward for your cooperation is that i dont have such a difficulty without protection a foreigner here you could face more difficulties with the political leadership you would see to it serif that i had no difficulties with the police or with politicians it is how you would cooperate would i be your partner it was slyly put atkins thought ismet mujic expected rejection which would give him cause to bluster and take the high ground misters smile was supreme as if he dealt with an old friend i think thats the direction were going i have other partners to consider a businessman such as yourself serif would have many partners there is a russian gentleman and an italian gentleman from sicily am told that is a most beautiful island i have partnerships with the turks they are very serious with business it would be most expensive to satisfy all of my partners lets deal with yourself first serif and others later atkins saw the eagles eyes flit to the ceiling it was a killer blow a new strain was introduced when he had been told on the aircraft what mister planned it had seemed easy reasonable the scale of the operation now being pursued by mister hit him slugged him as it had the eagle but misters reply was gentle as if nothing ambushed or surprised him cooperation or protection whatever you want to call it how much do you pay i pay for what i get misters voice was softly reasonable for no difficulties with the police no investigations by government for transport over the border without delays from customs for warehousing space rental for the service of vehicle mechanics who are reliable and guards to ride with the drivers because this is a country of many bandits how much do you pay i could pay a flat cash figure or i could pay for each vehicle movement or i could pay a percentage of profit a percentage of profit a smear of derision from ismet mujic mister never hesitated youd have my word on it serif we say in england my word is my bond youve never been to england to london if youd been there met the people i do business with then youd hear that my word is good enough for anybody in business im a good friend but if im ripped off then i make a bad enemy what is flat cash a million american dollars for the first year payable quarterly the first payment on signature of the document and i would suggest a cyprus bank would be the most convenient im not bargaining at this stage at the end of the first year we renegotiate but my guarantee is that the first years payments will be less than the second years thats my offer they broke mister the eagle and atkins were left in the room watched by the rottweilers atkins moved from the chair and stood casually near the low table on which the kalashnikov lay it was what he was paid to do the eagle wiped sweat from his forehead he didnt say anything because mister had closed his eyes tipped himself back and catnapped slept as if there were no problems and no difficulties only cooperation from the coffeehouse they could watch the buildings street door they had been there an hour and joey had started to fidget they were on the second cup of coffee every ten minutes one of the men in black with the tattoos the shaven head and the hanging belly would walk to the end of the block and back and each time would look into the shops bars and the cafe window they had to be beside the glass to have a clear view of the street door they were the only foreigners in there it was three years since joey had done regular surveillance duties on a good day in london the whole of sierra quebec golf twelve of them would have been used for such a stakeout and three cars on a bad day there would have been eight and still three cars now there were the two of them and the van was parked up the street the last two times when the man in black had examined them through the cafe window maggie had held his hand and looked labradorlike into his eyes as if they were lovers it was called jack and jill at home a male executive officer and a female executive officer attracted less attention than two men and sometimes it went from handholding to kissing and sometimes from kissing to groping and sometimes to bed at the end of the shift she had his hand again the shadow of the man passed the window it was not often that joey looked into jens eyes and searched her face the eyes and the face opposite him were lined older there was a coldness in them he thought he didnt matter to her they had no smalltalk and no confidences in the sierra quebec golf vans and cars and on the pavements when they did jack and jill and in the pubs in the office afterwards they all learned about and prodded into each others lives the shadow passed again and her hand slipped out of his the touch of her fingers on his hand meant nothing to her and they both watched the street door he stared fiercely out through the window and sensed her amusement joey snatched her hand back and gripped it he thought shed cry out but she did not in his life mister has won every time i am joey cann and i have never won not a bloody thing mister is a winner and joey cann is a loser at home it would be no contest we are not at home dont sell me short if hes off his own ground i think i might just be a winner i want to consider what you offer reasonable concern myself with details and then talk more accepted they should never have come the eagle had convinced himself he should have been hosting a longarranged meal choosing the wines from the cellar pottering in an apron behind mo in the kitchen pouring drinks for the president of the countys law society a recently retired home office civil servant a consultant surgeon a landrich farmer and their wives now there would be an empty place at the end of the table he was not there because without mister there would be no gardener no country house no complacent fat bastards as guests mister called and the eagle jumped for ten minutes there had been whispered voices in the hall then serif had led his people back in and mister had jerked awake and i suggest that we meet tonight for dinner to talk of the details serif im afraid i cant do that i am offering you dinner at my restaurant where the best food in sarajevo is served and the best wine i never mix eating with business the dogs were whining at the door theyd slept until the meeting had broken but had roused themselves the moment serif had left the room the eagle listened but his eyes never left the dogs and their jaws the rottweilers showed their teeth as they whined and the air in the room and the carpets stank of them serif turned to the door clapped his hands then shouted a name the young man who came in was not in the uniform of the guards the eagle thought the name shouted was enver he was pale smoothskinned and not tattooed his shirt was burgundy silk and blond hair rested on its collar his trousers were tight and white little escaped the eagle the young man enver sauntered into the room while the guards every movement was abrupt he carried two short woven leashes crooned softly to the dogs clipped the leashes to the studded collars and took the strain as they bounded ahead of him through the door down in the country at dinner with his friends the eagle would have used the word faggot but never in misters hearing ismet mujics heavy eyes were watching him and could not have failed to notice his relief that the brutes were gone from the room you dont like dogs do dogs make you nervous i tell you they are very gentle they are strong but they are soft i call them michael and rupert they were generals here from the british army leading the un forces like your generals they make a show of aggression but will not use their teeth they left us to do the fighting while they hid behind their sandbags it was celo caco and i who held the city without us it would have fallen the withering eyes turned back to face mister you do not wish to have dinner with me always best to do business with a clear head and an empty stomach tomorrow at the same time is that acceptable the same time tomorrow and after the business is finished i would be delighted to eat with you mister paused then said as if it were an afterthought what happened to my friend a study of concern slipped on to serifs face it was very sad i am still sad to this day i feel a responsibility why do you feel a responsibility he had been with mister since in twentynine years he had learned to read each inflection of misters voice the question was put so softly without malice what he knew of mister a question was never asked for the sake of him hearing his own voice his questions either searched for information or set a trap he was my guest i was his host we had eaten in my restaurant he was very happy he drank freely he left us i had offered him a driver to take him to the hotel he refused he said he would prefer to walk i think he wanted the air the cruncher never walked when he could ride hed take a taxi to go the length of a street the cruncher was a barrowboy at heart and his delight was to be driven in the back of a chauffeured limousine he was the kid from attlee house who had made it good the eagle thought for dinner with ismet mujic and the rest of the lowlife scrotes the cruncher would have spent a full halfhour dressing himself the best clothes for the best impression on a mission for mister the child of his own brain it was inconceivable that the cruncher would have taken to the sauce i have friends in the police there was a most thorough investigation and an autopsy was done you have friends in the police as a businessman it is necessary you understand i have copies of the autopsy report and the statements of the witnesses who saw him going towards the river if you would like them i think i would thats very thoughtful of you a chair was spun a cabinet of antique rosewood was opened to reveal a safe ismet mujics hips hid the combinations he turned to unlock it and hid them again as it was relocked the papers were passed to mister who handed them on to him he dropped the four sheets into his attache case but they are not translated not to worry serif ill pass them to his family and add your condolences i expect his family will find someone to translate for them tomorrow then at the same time and it will be my pleasure it was the time for smiles handshakes and slapped backs and then they were down and on to the street they walked three abreast on the narrow pavement towards the parked toyota with the smoked windows mister said to them that hed walk walk and think and he told the eagle that he should start to work on the draft of an agreement of cooperation he told atkins that by the evening he wanted a working translation of the papers ahead of them was a small square of grass where the rottweilers meandered and sniffed and beside it men in thin coats watched a chess game played on black and white pavings with kneehigh pieces as if it were the best show in town the young man enver followed the chess and let the dogs wander free mister said if its what i think then the rivers calling for fucking prettyboy hands in his pockets he walked away it was the moment at which the eagle knew for double damn certain that they should never have come what do i do its your shout joey you do whatever you think right the toyota had powered past mister and gone off up mula mustafe baseskija he walked and seemed to have no care do we split thats fairly obvious but you cant track one on one as we say at box eight fifty if it gets tough youll just have to pedal a bit harder try that for advice she climbed into the van and drove away joey strode past the chess game and the dogs hed seen them come out of the street door and knew they were ismet mujics dogs he twisted his head away so that the young man with the dogs wouldnt see his face he closed the gap mister had stopped so joey stopped mister was gazing into a shop window what they said on the surveillance training courses always to be remembered was that ninetyfive per cent of targets days were entirely innocent and legal mister was windowshopping he was gazing at jewellery in a window maybe mister was thinking of the princess he was walking back he was coming closer joey was frozen didnt know what to do on a training exercise or in green lanes for real the target would have been in a box and covered by eight ten or twelve personnel joey would have gone out of the cordon he could not back off not when he was one on one the pavement space closed between them he had been taught had it dinned into him that the worst crime was to show out mister was three paces from him joey could see how well hed shaved and that his tie was loose by a slight tug and the hairs on his head were caught by the wind mister had stopped in front of another window where there was a display of italian and french silk scarves brilliant big decision of the day a cartier bloody watch or a givenchy bloody scarf a highcarat gold bracelet or an yves st laurent shoulder wrap then mister turned and walked on like any other bloody tourist whod put off buying the presents until the last day what joey had learned lifted him mister wasnt doing figure eights and wasnt doing doorway cutouts and wasnt doing doublebacks he was the untouchable far from home and wasnt using the antisurveillance techniques that would have been his second nature to burn out a footman that was the bastards confidence why it wasnt no contest joey followed him and clung to the sight of the rolling shoulders of his target december spanish troops brought them the last leg of the journey back to vraca the young men of the unit that had been recruited from the andalucfa region easily lifted husein bekirs frail frame down from the back of the threetonne lorry he accepted their help but would not let them take the small case from him his clawed veined hands hung to it then they lifted down lila his wife and the grandchildren he stared out over the valley and soaked up the sight of what was familiar and remembered it was three years less two weeks since the day he had left he gazed at the river and the fields the ruined village above them and the mountains beyond and all the time he clutched his case because it contained everything he owned lila was beside him and held his arm the grandchildren stood around them it had been a long journey the television sets thirty days before in the tent camp at tuzla had shown the signing of the agreement at a military camp in faraway america at a place called dayton in the state of ohio it had taken place under the wing of a huge bomber in a museum hangar he did not know how difficult it had been for the american negotiators to win that agreement and could not comprehend the detail of the maps and computer graphics used to fix the new boundaries that would decide who should live where but the map on the television showed a line of red running through his valley and he had known he could go home going home had been all that concerned him the morning after the announcement from dayton husein had led his tiny tribe out of the tent camp in deep winter weather they had walked hitched ridden on carts pulled by slipping horses been taken by military lorries begged rides on buses when they had no money to buy tickets and they had crossed the ravaged country they had slept in snowcovered woods huddling together for warmth and in ruined homes and in the wrecked outbuildings of farms and among cattle and pigs and in the hall wells of apartment blocks in the towns they had eaten grass and rotting cabbages that were scraped from icelocked earth and they had begged for food a week before they had sold lilas ring given her on their marriage day the last thing they owned of value and had bought smoked ham and potato broth enough to fill a bucket eight kilometres short of vraca at the cafe where in the old days they had stopped for coffee and brandy on the way to the cattlemarket they had found a building without a roof and a platoon of spanish troops lila had said to him that last night it was only because of the grandchildren that the foreigners gave them shelter and blankets and promised to take them on in the morning every muscle in his body was stiffened from the journey he stood and gazed as the pain dribbled through him and she clung to his arm it was a bright sunny winter morning and long shadows thrown from the bare roof beams of the village houses caught his face and his wifes and the grandchildrens faces to accentuate the thin skin covering their bones and the sunken eyes if lila had not been holding his arm he would have stumbled forward and fallen through exhaustion and hunger it was all as he remembered it the officer with an interpreter hovered behind him the bakers the blacksmiths and the engineers houses were all as he had last seen them gutted by fire from the artillery open to the skies displaying the wallpaper and the carpets in the upper rooms where the outer walls had been holed the minaret was down felled by a direct hit from a tank shell just as it had been the weeds grew on the cobbled village street he tottered a few short steps forward past the end of the building that had been the village meetinghall and the school for the smallest children before they were old enough to go on the bus and he saw his own home a tree without a leaf to decorate its branches grew through the missing tiles of the roof there was a piteous crying his hearing was poorer now and he heard the sound faintly and with the crying was a cringing whine the cat came he heard lilas gasp then the excited screams of his grandchildren for three years he had not heard them scream in happiness the cat broke from shadow white black and brown markings and slunk in a belly scrape through the weeds towards them the grandchildren ran to it and it stopped its back arched nuzzled their legs before they swept it up in their arms held it close and passed it between them the tears ran in his face and through his stubble beard then he saw the dog he could not have taken it with him each morning or evening in the hellish heat of the tent or in the numbing cold he had thought about the dog and said silent words of apology he remembered the stones he had thrown at it to stop it following them out of the village the dog was so thin and it crawled near to him cowed he had thrown stones at the dog and shouted at it to be gone and he had heard it yelp when a stone had caught its stomach but to the last it had obeyed him and gone back to the deserted home he shook with weeping and bent down awkwardly rubbed his hand on its ribcage and saw the fleas scampering on his fingers through the interpreter the officer said it is what we are supposed to do to escort people back to their homes it will be difficult for you to live here it is against my judgement to let you stay i will not leave are you prepared to shoot me we will do what we can for you we will leave bread and milk and a little meat we will come again with more i say to your god that he should look after you my greatuncle fought in a civil war in my country i understand that people have to go home and start again and forget it will be hard to forget if you do not forget it is what my greatuncle told me and forgive then no sort of life is possible husein looked past his house and the well and down to the track to the ford and over the river he saw his flattened yellowed fields topped by black dead thistles and brown dead cow parsley and grey dead ragwort and he saw the toppled posts in the vineyard he looked for coils of new barbed wire it is my land they put mines in my land do you know where they put them are they marked they left two weeks ago the serbs told me the track was safe the commander said he did not have a record of where the mines were laid so they are not fenced even if they were fenced it would be difficult to know their position mines swim in the ground it is a strange word to use but it is what happens they can move many metres the commander would give me no information do i forget that do i forgive them for it if you do not then you have no life i can give you some heatingoil and some blankets and i will need matches to light fires i will need many boxes of matches you will have matches also i can give you candles when did it last rain we have had no rain for a month so the river is low use the river for water but boil it i do not know if those people came across and sabotaged the well the graveyard is desecrated it would be wise to assume the well cannot be used may your god watch over you husein stood at the top of the track with the pile of blankets and the cardboard box of food and milk and the plastic bag of match cartons with the candles and the jerrycan of heatingoil the wind on his face was from the west the ground under his feet was rock dry the dog licked his hand when he bent creaking joints and felt the grass and found no moisture there he went back to his land down the track and waded across the river at the ford the water flowed above his knees and the stones under his shoes were slippery as glass but his will helped him m a k e the crossing in his hands were the jerrycan of oil the bag of matches and the candles kept dry and h e l d high even when he stumbled on the far side of the ford he looked up at his friends house and wondered how he did and where he was whether he was dead and in an unmarked grave whether he was in a distant camp and still dreaming of the valley on the track near to the home of dragan kovac the water sloshing in his shoes he reached to snatch up handfuls of dry grass made little heaps of it then spilled heatingoil on them the wind came harder on his back and he welcomed it he could see ahead of him the ribcages of his animals and a hawk circled above him when he had made a dozen small mounds of dried grass buried halves of the candles in them and splashed them with the oil he lit the candles wicks the fires raged then guttered then took he had heard in the camp at tuzla that fire destroyed mines a crackling wall of flames slowly advanced across his grazing fields and moved towards the ground which in years gone he had ploughed to grow vegetables and maize a great smoke pall hung over his valley and was carried on the wind beyond the line of fire he believed what he had been told in the tent camp the proof was there in the explosions seven times the ground broke and was thrown upwards by detonations and the shrapnel sang over his head the wind lifted burning grass tufts and wafted them beyond the extent of the line spreading the fire to his right far out towards the line of the fire there was a grass island circled by black scorched ground the flames moved on and left the island behind husein bekir had heard in the camp that fire exploded mines he had not been told by experts that only the mines nearest the surface would be affected others would smoulder but would not explode some would have their stakes burned through and would fall over but would not explode some would have their nylon tripwires melted but would stay in place with their antennae still lethal and some had metal wire that the fire would not sever each time a mine detonated he felt a wild sense of excitement as if his youth returned to him a young boar broke in a panic run from the grass island it ran back over the ground that the fire had covered and headed for the track where husein stood its stampede had covered twentyfive metres when it was lifted high by the flash of light and the crest of smoke he saw the blood spurt while it was in the air and its right leg flying free as it fell husein bekir turned away he thought he had wasted half of the heatingoil half of the candles and two cartons of matches he went back across the ford joey had lost himself in the lateevening darkness had gone to his rendezvous when she was out on the street or in the van and trailing maggie dressed upmarket when she was parked in the van in the back of it with her earphones for company and her book she was dressed down neat skirts blouses cardigans and sensible shoes were left behind in the hotel wardrobe she was in black jeans and wore a loose black rollneck sweater and a black headscarf over her hair she had been a small darting shadow when she had gone to the toyota fourwheel drive had ducked down and levered herself underneath it on her back with a small penknife she had scraped mud sludge crusted salt and the paintwork off the bottom of the vehicle she had made a square of clean metal that was large enough to take the magnet of the device she called the device in her own jargon an otter it would send a beacon signal for two kilometres in a builtup area and up to three kilometres in countryside it was one timethrow away equipment not meant to be retrieved when the assignment was completed she would have to pick up the probe bug in room of the building towering above her but the beacon would be abandoned already she had learned from her earphones that target one did not use his hotel telephone nor did he hold meetings in the room she heard him shower dress whistle to himself and she heard him snore when he catnapped on his bed the only time she had heard his voice was when he thanked and tipped the maid for the return of his laundry she was wasting her time and wished she were at home with colleagues who mattered to her and with work that had a grain of importance she thought that joey cann slight intense his pebble spectacles hiding half of his face would not have moved past the firstinterview stage for recruitment into her world she heard target one cough to clear his throat then the rooms door closing then the silence first mister read the document prepared by the eagle and printed out on his laptop thatll do he said he passed it back and the waiter came to take their order he had again refused atkinss offer to go out and find a restaurant away from the hotel he gave his order let the others tell the waiter what theyd have then flicked his fingers impatiently at atkins ready for the papers to be passed him he scanned the trans lated witness statements and reflected that they were conveniently tidy you got your street map atkins unfolded his largescale map of the city and spread it over their laid places mister pointed to the third witness statement and the address of the discharged and disabled soldier atkins turned over the map and ran his finger down the street index he said that the street hamdije kaprazica was in the dobrinja district its about where i showed you from the plane when we came in thats the old front line could you find it for me mister asked yes what in the morning tonight according to his statement he was the last man to see cruncher alive the eagle spluttered on his bread roll you got a problem no problem mister if thats what you want id like to see him and hear how it was with cruncher just before he went into the river he was a good friend the waiter carried the tray to their table i lost my leg in the war it is taken off at the knee the amputation was not done well it was the circumstances of the operation i cannot have an artificial one the stump does not allow it we were fighting here to hold the tunnel entrance at the airport do you have money for me the room was a pit of filth there was no electricity no fire in the brutal light of franks torch beam he could have been thirty or fifty the face was sunken and pale the hair was thinned through and the hands shook perpetually he was propped up on a bed of sacking newspapers and pillows that had no covers and leaked feathers there was a stink of old faeces and urine when the torch beam had roved across the room searched for him it had skipped over three syringes joey watched him and frank translated i have to have money you want to know what i saw i say nothing without money he held a crutch across his chest as if to protect himself his eyes were dulled in their sockets his sleeves both arms were pulled up joey thought from what he knew of pincushion arms that the man would be finding it hard by now to get a fix on the veins joey pulled money from his pocket and handed it to frank the little wad of notes was tossed into the torchlight and onto the mans lap above the stump joey saw the money counted and there was a flash of what he thought was cunning in the lustreless eyes the notes were slipped under the bed of sacks and newspapers sometimes i go into town to buy if i buy here because i cannot defend myself because i have a stump sometimes i am attacked for my money i go to the old quarter it is more expensive there but i am not attacked also in the old quarter i can ask for money from foreigners there are many foreigners there and sometimes they are kind you want to know what i saw and more money when i have told you you are gentlemen i think you will be kind i told the police what i saw he was on the bridge he was leaning over the rail and sick i thought it was alcohol that made him sick he could hardly stand and when his grip on the rail failed he nearly fell over it the river was very high that night i looked away someone came and i went to them to ask for money i was refused i looked again for him i didnt see him he must have gone into the river someone else came and they gave me money i went to buy it was two days later when i was back at the bridge that the police stopped me and asked if i had seen anything and they showed me the photograph of the man the hands shook harder on the crutch joey said icily will you ask him please what unit he was with when he lost his leg the reply came through frank i was with the fighters led by ismet mujic we had to hold dobrinja we joey swung on his heel there had been a teacher at school who had tried to reintroduce latin into the curriculum joey had been in the small class little of it remained with him julius caesar had crossed the rubicon river and had said iacta alea est and they had translated suetonius who had quoted caesar let us go whither the omens of the gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us the die is now cast the step was taken and there was no drawing back from its consequences and in english classes they had read shakespeares richard iii i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die he went down the staircase there was light snow falling but not heavily enough to settle frank passed him and went to the back of the small truck its windows were painted over his hand was on the doors handle its what you want its what i want it breaks every rule in my life and mine joey said just get on with it frank opened the door four men scrambled out they wore drab blue overalls and their faces were masked by balaclavas frank talked to them briefly none seemed to look at joey as if he were unimportant they went towards the blocks entrance with purpose he had not been introduced to them dark silent smoking shapes in the back of the van when frank had collected him and they had driven into dobrinja frank had said they were on an unmarked frontier the blocks on the far side of the street were rebuilt holes plugged had new plastic windows and streetlights the lights didnt carry the width of the street but died in the central grassy reservation they stood in dank darkness frank told him that when they had drawn the map lines at dayton that ended the war and provided the new ethnic boundaries they had used a blunt pencil the pencils marking on the map was fifty metres wide the east side of hamdije kaprozice was left in a no mans land unclaimed by either the muslim authorities or by the serbs small gangs of men floated past them in britain joey never had as much as a truncheon when he was out on surveillance late in the night only a longhandled torch he thought the no mans land was the territory of dealers and pushers the only thing he had believed that the disabled soldier had said was that here in the darkness he might be attacked and stripped of the money he needed for heroin he wondered how long doing what he himself could not do the men would be he said they wont hang around will they god what a place your thugs not thugs joey i call them the sreb four if you dont know a mans story you dont call him a thug when youre not burdened with facts its best to keep the judgements short i met them in sanski most thats the extreme west of the country when people like me first arrive were sent somewhere for a months acclimatization before the permanent posting starts they were about as far from home as is possible because home was the east then i met up with them again in sarajevo they are cousins and they are all from the village of bibici which is south of the town it was an extended family all the houses in the village were lived in by the family they were all policemen when the war started srebrenica was besieged and they as policemen were at the front in the trenches the population in the town had gone from nine thousand prewar to fifty thousand during the siege then it f e l l thats a long story why it fell im telling you this because you will never see these people again and itll be good for you to think of them when youre snuggled up warm in your bed at home and your biggest problem is remembering whether youve done a new lot of fucking lottery numbers for the weekend the women and kids they reckoned would be shipped out under un supervision because srebrenica was designated as a safe haven nobody at that time least of all un generals and the politicians who directed them had enough of a sense of honour to guarantee the haven but the duplicity wasnt known then the women and children would be protected the men would fight their way out over the mountains through forests the nato planes it was thought would put down carpet bombing on the serbs so that the men had a chance in the breakout the fittest of the men the best fighters and the best armed were at the front of the column the sreb four were at the front of the front because they were the best what they didnt know was that behind them their fathers uncles nephews grandfathers had been either rounded up in srebrenica and butchered or were being killed trapped and ambushed they reckon they were betrayed and i couldnt argue with it not just by the un and nato but by their own people what they think the town was allowed to fall as a part of the endgame peace deal they werent given the guns and the reinforcements to hold it the men of the family all except the sreb four were killed some of their women hanged themselves so that they wouldnt be raped and some strangled their daughters so it didnt happen to them they got out and theyre inseparable they hate the serbs for what was done to their families and they hate the muslim leaders for betraying them they have been through hell have walked through it and come out the far side of it youll want to know what i did that makes them indebted to me not much in truth theres iptf in srebrenica and i arranged for myself to have a day there i took flowers and laid them in a warehouse where some of the women killed themselves and in the factory at potocari where the older men were shot and in the woods where the younger men were caught and had their throats slit i took photographs of where id put the flowers thats all i did what they are doing in there wont trouble them after what theyve seen not an iota so dont go fucking soft on me they came out joey thought that if he had been able to see their faces they would have been expressionless there was no tension in their bodies and no laughter in their voices they huddled round frank and told him quietly what they had learned then one of them wiped his hands on the seat of his overalls felt in his pocket and passed frank the clean banknotes he gave them back to joey joey had crossed a river turn him over mister said a little spear of light from the pencil torch followed atkinss boot as it tipped the man over from his stomach to his back the eagle behind mister gasped mister could see the eyes through swollen lids and the mouth through split lips but the rest of the facial features were lost in a sea of blood mister knew a great deal about beatings fists coshsticks boots it was what he had done in the past and he felt cheated because he would have done it again there that night is he gone atkins knelt beside the man and felt the pulse at his neck as he straightened he shook his head if hes not gone now then he will be soon mister said we should get out of here mister the eagle hissed its not a healthy place atkinss pistol had been in his hand from the moment they had left the toyota and it had been between his legs as soon as they had driven into dobrinja in our own time you never know when youre watched so you never run you never let anyone see you run gives us something to think about eh eagle whod have done a fancy job like that a druggies

him para four my observation target one is unaware of current surveillance opinion is shared by box message ends he minuted a little note for himself he would speak to goughin the morning past experience told him that danger beckoned when foot men were confident that their trailing presence was not observed chapter nine it was the spring day in sarajevo when nothing much happened there was a fast snow blizzard at dawn that hurried down the igman slopes to envelop the city then a bright cold morning then a bright warm afternoon then an overcast dusk and rain in the evening the longest queue in the city from dawn to dusk was outside the high guarded gates of the german embassy on mejtas buka every day on which it was open the queue was there in the hunt for visas and escape it stretched down the street and round the corner a few at a time were admitted to the hidden buildings behind the wall many of those who queued would fail to reach the front of the line before the offices closed few of those allowed inside would be given entry to a promised land down by the miljacka river a shorter queue of men jostled at the door of the slovenian embassy also looking for a route out of a doomed country there were no queues waiting for the shops to open on mula mustafe baseskije and saraci and bravadziluk halaci the windows displaying designer clothes brought in from outside were looked into but the tills did not ring and the fitting rooms stay id empty the boutiques gave an impression of vibrant wealth but it was bogus no one could afford the dresses blouses skirts and lingerie most items would have cost a civil servant a years salary the street markets were full from early morning when the stalls were set up to late afternoon when they were taken down and little pickup trucks drove away with what had not been sold the produce cabbage potatoes carrots beans onions peas came from across the southern frontiers because the country was still locked in winters frosts on other stalls there were clothes that had been smuggled in no duty paid they were cheap and thin would not have kept out the mornings cold or the evenings rain everything in the markets came from abroad because the small factories five years after the wars end had not been rebuilt on the steps of the buildings appropriated for the use of the international community foreign men and foreign women gathered to smoke their cigarettes most of which had been bought on the black market marlboro winston and camel cigarettes brought by highspeed launches from italy or driven in from serbia were smoked on the steps of the buildings used by the commission of property claims of displaced persons the european bank for reconstruction the international committee of the red cross

sewage disposal the design of banknotes television programme schedules the life of the city was in the hands of those foreigners this day and every day romany beggars haunted the streets and crouched on corners beside warmaimed veterans who let their amputated limbs be seen but their upturned caps and little cardboard boxes went unfilled the city had no time for charity government ministers swept between their homes and offices in bombproof cars the black mercedes of the gangsters raced on the narrow streets italian troops bored near to sleep patrolled as a show but had no power of arrest and had orders to avoid provocation in the street cafes young men made a thimble of espresso or a can of cocacola last an hour and swapped gossip on the best ways to gain admission to an austrian german or scandinavian university nothing much happened the eel drove mister along the zmaja od bosne past the holiday inn to tower a of the unis building complex on fra andela zvizdovica compartments again ruled his mind stacked at the back of his thoughts and ignored were the matters involving serif and the deal the death of his friend and the bloodlaced face of an addict as they came down what atkins had called snipers alley past ruins and shellholed blocks mister was pondering what lorries from bosnia with love could bring into the city and what they could take out he was rested and sleeping well but he had slept well in his cell in brixton he slept well because the shadow of failure did not exist in misters mind from the crunchers calls to london he had a name he dropped down from the lorry cab it had been the crunchers idea to paint the slogan bosnia with love on the trailers sides when the trade was up and running the lorry and others needed to be recognized known he saw three towers two were still firegutted and open to the weather tower a had lights burning in the bottom half of its floors and above he saw men working precariously he went into a cavernous hallway gave the name at a reception desk and was told which floor he should go to also that he should take the stairs as the lift wasnt operating before cruncher had reported on it mister had never heard of the united nations high commission for refugees after five flights of concrete steps he came to a landing he straightened his quiet tie and smoothed his hair he felt good he asked for her at the security desk and said what hed brought she came out through an inner door and her smile of welcome and relief hit him a bright light in darkness im monika holberg a field officer but based in sarajevo canton and you are my white knight your name is im packer mister packer i am so delighted to see you because you have the lorry you have what i need i have a lorry miss holberg and it is filled to overflowing with clothes toys everything that people at home thought would be wanted in bosnia by those less fortunate than themselves it was only a small untruth the lorry was not overflowing against the bulkhead at the back of the trailer was the empty space where the launchers and missiles the handguns and the communications sets had been she gripped his hand in business he dealt with few women only the princess in whom he confided everything he went to his sisters with the eagle when their signatures were needed for property contracts and bond purchases at an associates house he made it crystal plain that the women should be out of the room he was never sure about women except the princess never certain that they felt the same ties of loyalty as men and that in interview rooms late at night battered by the questions of detectives in relays they would stare at the ceiling and stay quiet she dropped his hand and her enthusiasm gushed i am so grateful so happy it is what your friend mr dubbs said you would bring just what he said would you like to come and look she bounded down the stairs her blond hair bounced on her anoraks collar he had to scramble to keep up with her she wore no makeup his sisters all past their fiftieth birthdays and the brat girls theyd produced all carried handbags full of powders and scent squeezers and mascara brushes they tripped along on heels she went down the stairs two steps at a time on muddied old walkingboots he struggled to keep up she was waiting for him at the bottom of the last flight grinning and arching her eyebrows and he was laughing he didnt laugh often but the droll grin and the eyebrows forced it from him they crossed the hall on the outside steps he whistled for the eels attention in the lorry cab and pointed to the rear doors of the trailer when the eel opened them for her she scrambled up athletically and began to rip the adhesive binding tape off the first cardboard box sweaters jackets knitted woollen socks coats trousers all were thrown up then stuffed back she looked into the depth of the trailer and her gaze hovered on the stacked boxes they are all like this one best as i know it they are but theres everything its not just clothes its toys too fantastic it is marvellous her eyes were alight mister lived in a world where enthusiasm was forbidden and gratitude made debts mister shrugged im glad its all going to help it is what i needed she dropped down from the trailer he didnt offer his hand to steady her she wouldnt have needed it mister said im pleased its wanted i honestly thought youd have more of this sort of stuff than you could handle she interrupted him seemed to think nothing of cutting him short once yes but not now it is donor fatigue people are tired abroad of giving to bosnia they see no benefit and hear nothing good they give to east timor and kosovo and a little to chechnya there was a window for bosnia and people looked in were sympathetic and gave but the window is now closed the refugees suffer as much now as when the window was open the need is as great but the goodwill does not exist im glad to be i used to have warehouses filled by the generosity of people in europe even in america but they are empty now there is a village near kiseljak we have brought dps displaced persons back to live in their old homes they are complaining they say they have nothing they say it is worse than the refugee camp im happy that in three days we are taking ambassadors administrators and generals to this village to see the achievement of bringing these people home we need money for them for all the dps many more than two million people fled their homes in the war we have to have money to get them home we need the international pledges and each month it is harder if the people seen by the vips are unhappy complaining the visitors will not write memoranda urging their governments to pledge more it is a very little village but it is very important the torrent of words subsided there was innocence and a wide grin of apology on her face i am sorry i interrupted you twice very few men and fewer women interrupted mister its nothing im glad to be of help happy to have done something worthwhile i need the lorry for this afternoon to deliver probably better you use your own driver someone who knows the roads of course where do you stay in sarajevo mister packer he evaded the question effortlessly id like you to know that i intend this should not be a oneoff theres plenty more where this load came from im looking to offer regular deliveries there must be a load of other people needing the same help as those in your village jason give the lady the keys i dont know how often ill be able to get over here myself but i promise you havent seen the last of bosnia with love its been my pleasure meeting you miss holberg just leave the keys at reception when youre back and jasonll collect them tonight youll have to excuse me ive a few things to attend to and good luck he sauntered away every week a lorry would arrive in sarajevo under cover of the brightpainted bosnia with love logo and filled with any kind of junk and chuckout that the mixer could lay his hands on and every week an apparently empty lorry would leave from sarajevo with a hidden class a load that would not be measured in grams and low kilos but high kilos to a tonne at ferry ports frontier crossings and at border customs posts bosnia with love doing good works would be a familiar sight no bastard in uniform would stop a charity vehicle going in or coming o u t the crunchers plan was in motion he hadnt given her the name of the hotel where he stayed she was on the fifth floor dialling on her telephone for the drivers pool ankie was bringing her coffee and she was gazing idly from the window when she saw him there were only a few generous people in monika holbergs experience who did good work and slipped away from the limelight who did not want medals official congratulations and invitations to international receptions who shunned flashbulbs she thought mr packer was one of them from her vantagepoint she watched as he went into the rear entrance of the holiday inn he cannot do the meeting this morning the young man enver said he is sorry if that makes an inconvenience for you the eagles response was curt mister packer is not only an important man he is a busy man the meeting will be in the afternoon at four oclock i think he has interesting news for mister packer i speak for him hell be there theyd been on a final cup in the coffee shop the young man had found them there bringing the dogs with him the eagle reckoned that in any other coffee shop in any other city the boy and his dogs would have been thrown out one of the dogs had lunged at the cake trolley it was disgusting unhygienic the eagle had left mister and atkins at their window table had gone to intercept enver hed had a bad feeling about it the previous night and the meetings postponement had ratcheted it up he never saw the enforcement side of misters business was insulated from it but the sight of the addicts pulped face had unsettled him between three and five years back mister had run a small sideshow of enforcement business a middlerank figure was in debt to another middleranker who did not have the muscle strength to get himself paid mister bought out the debt less twenty per cent and sent the cards round the debt was paid before or after the fists coshes or a shotgun was used and misters profit margin was one pound in five or ten thousand in fifty thousand the cruncher had liked to call it diversification but mister didnt do it any longer because ten thousand pounds was chickenshit the druggies bloodied face had been the eagles sleeping companion and his temper was on a short fuse theyve put you off again mister theyre giving you the runaround do we sit much longer in this hole thats what im asking myself personally mister asked softly are they suggesting another time four oclock in the afternoon thats not a problem then thats when it is fine so weve a day to kick our heels the eagle snorted and sat down confused he had expected been damned certain hed see misters snarled anger at the slight but everything was fine he did not understand earlier the eagle had been explaining cashflow and the notice required to move substantial money orders then the need for decisions on the conversion of a caymans account from dollars into euros and the further movement of funds into an israeli bank and hed given up because he hadnt had misters attention mister said to atkins you know this place weve half the morning and half the afternoon show me round well do the sights the eagle was left worse than confused he was bewildered you want me to drive im quite capable dont mind me saying it youre a right misery today is that so lighten up youre piss poor company about lasl night forget i t its not your business she ripped through the gears the transmission from the toyotas beacon was a continuous strong bleep a light flashed with constant reassurance on the screen shed bolted under the dash hed spelled it out last night after hed returned to the hotel and sent his signal hed come to her room and shed had to clear a chair of her underclothes so that he could sit down hed told it in a monologue of fifteen minutes all the time hed talked hed never looked at her or her underclothes as shed sat on the bed with her robe round her shoulders hed stared at the drawn curtain shed sent him to his own room after telling him that everything always seemed better in the morning there had been a man in ceauescu towers old guard whod clung with his fingernails to employment because there was nothing else in his life who had been a rookie youngster on the team running oleg penkovsky the best source ever out of moscow shed been with him in beirut and shed asked him how it was in the century house building home before the towers when they heard first that the russian had been arrested and then when theyd heard hed been executed hed said over king prawns and a bottle from the bekaa its like when youve a good dog as long as its able to retrieve for the guns its special when it cant pick up birds you tell the keeper to get on with it you hear the shot behind the stables and you dont even blink hard things happen and thats recognized by any man worth half a peck of salt shed heard that the old warrior had died six months after theyd finally burned him out of the building shed taken what he said as a mantra ever since he was whitefaced had been since theyd met all the time theyd watched and followed the lorry to lower a his fingers had been knotted tightly together i can see my room from here mister was crouched close to the firing position and atkins heard the tremor in his voice they used the fort for artillery spotting atkins said they couldnt have hit your room not at this range with a sniper rifle but they could have put a tank shell through it he had brought mister and the eagle to the strongpoint high and south of the city past a modern memorial of slatecoloured marble that was set into snowspattered flagstones then walked into the old fortress he didnt think the eagle cared a damn for it but misters fascination was obvious in front of a twostorey barracks building of offwhite hewn stone blocks was a small parade area closed in by the lower wall with the gun slits the slits each had two shutters that closed on rollers they were made of intimidating blackpainted metal and were bullet and shrapnelproof all the time atkins had been in sarajevo serving on the generals staff and wearing the blue beret he had cursed the strongpoint and its view down on to snipers alley the holiday inn and every damn building that mattered the city was laid out as a peaceful tableau and made benevolent by the snow he remembered ruefully what he had thought then that the spotters for the guns had the power of life and death could see the panicked groups at the water standpipes the groups round market stalls and the schoolchildren and could decide on which to call down the shells of the heavy guns you couldnt hide from it could you mister said only if youd done a deal mister atkins remembered how much the blue beret men had hated the warlords caco celo and serif some could because they did deals serif yes hed fight one day a week and six days a week hed be trading across the front line particularly before the tunnel was dug drugs ammunition jewellery if they could steal it food alcohol they all went back and forth across the front line that was the other side of the war am i hearing you right atkins ammunition the serb warlords sold the muslim warlords the likes of serif ordnance that was fired back on their own men they achieved power by holding the line and made themselves rich by trading mister had straightened up and he stared hard at atkins youre telling me not to trust him not as far as you can kick him mister here you trust nobody ink on paper worthless nobody atkins saw first time hed seen it a pensive scowl cutting misters face he had engineered the occasion they could have gone to monuments in the city to the ottoman time of greatness and seen mosques and galleries that were half a millennium old they could have gone to the imperial coffeehouse the interior unchanged since austrohungarian rule instead he had taken them to see the front line and had prepared the message he wanted to pass on mister was thinking they were walking back from the barracks paradeground away from the gun slits and the view of misters bedroom far below the eagle wandered ahead of them then veered off the flagstones his shoes sinking in the snow as he went to examine the marble of the memorial atkins had told them when theyd arrived that the memorial was for titos fighters killed in the world war atkins shouted a pressing ruthless yell stop right there now come back retrace your steps exactly for a moment the eagle stood statue still then he turned fear on his face put your feet precisely where you walked and move the eagle came back to them in the bright sunlight in the crisp wind the sweat dribbled on his forehead step by step through the snow until he reached the flagstones atkins said this was a military position it would have been mined you were walking on snow you didnt know what was under it could have been flags concrete or earth if it had been earth there could have been mines you never walk offroad here or off the hard core not if you want to keep your legs of course its been cleared but theres no such thing as guaranteed clearance and wont be for a hundred years just dont go walkabout they went in silence to the toyota he drove them along a winding road away from the memorial that cut down into a valley the traffic signs were now in cyrillic script he told them they were in serb territory they went past old women sitting on collapsible stools with big plastic bags by their knees he said it was where they sold smuggled cigarettes from italy at eighty british pence a packet they went left and climbed came to the crest of the hill the road hugged the rim below them again was another view of the city he drove on another hundred and fifty metres then pulled into what had once been a car park for a bungalow restaurant but the building was wrecked and bulletpocked and its roof timbers were charred he slipped out of his seat and walked away from the toyota mister and the eagle followed him he remembered watching with imageintensifier binoculars handed him by french troops a night attack up through the jewish cemetery towards the trenches that were now in front of his feet he stood on a narrow strip of cracked concrete he had willed on that night those muslim troops civilians in illfitting uniforms and with outdated weapons scrambling up the hill and advancing into the machinegun fire from these trenches he had shouted his support to them into the darkness and they wouldnt have heard even the whisper of what he screamed over the volume and intensity of the gunfire he thought of who he was now and what he did now and he spat the bile from his throat he had not planned that memory or that thought i can see the hotel but i cant see my room mister said the trenches were a metre wide and a metre and a half deep where the machineguns had been sited which had driven off that night attack with the grenades and the bayonets there were still heavy logs of pine laid flat to protect the serb soldiers the water in the pit of the trenches was frozen and caught in the ice were dulled rusty cartridge cases further along going east and in front of what had been the restaurants conservatory dining area the trench was reinforced by a twentymetre length of halfmoon concrete section he could have told them because it was what he had been told years back that the section came from the olympic winter games bobsleigh run but he didnt bother atkins said the gunfire would have broken up their little kitchen gardens both sides grew cannabis plants right in front of their forward positions the warlords thats serif and those on the serb side encouraged the planting of cannabis they reckoned that stoned guys wouldnt think too much about the war and they also reckoned theyd fight harder because they wouldnt want to abandon their crop can you think what it was like up here in winter if you werent drunk or stoned out of your mind the little men fought stoned pissed and half dead with cold and the big men like serif got fat on their backs and their bodies hes scum i do business anywhere i can find it if the price is right i thought it might help you mister to know where your new partner is coming from i thought it might help you to know what sort of man he is and whats his power base he danced on graves atkins let his words die he turned neither of them had listened to him they were already walking back to the toyota didnt he know it he was a fly in the spiders skein he trotted after them to the vehicle you all right atkins never been better mister you know what i reckon its the tourist trail theyre doing the battlefield tour its not utah or gold beach or the passchendaele ridge or that farmhouse at waterloo but hes getting the sarajevo scene dont you think how the hell do i know just making conversation sunshine youd be doing me a favour if you spat it maggie said they were a clear quarter of a mile from where the toyota was parked joey watched it through the binoculars he said a recitation without feeling i crossed a line i broke every rule im supposed to abide by i knew the illegality of what i asked for and had other men whod no scruples do what i was incapable of i wanted it to happen she shrugged so thats all right then stop moaning what i did and justified to myself meant i walked outside my team are you one of these enthusiasts we weed them out at our place even if theyve fooled the recruitment board we spot them and chuck them their feet dont touch the ground dont please tell me youre an enthusiast youve a good sneer no i dont think i am but its justified the nasty work right right youve a sister who died of drugs overdosed no i havent whats the other hackneyed drop of tripe oh yes my best friend got to be a pusher thats why im a crusader against drugs is that it i didnt have a best friend on sierra quebec golf joey said simply my best friend at school teaches maths in a comprehensive in birmingham so what justified last night are you listening joey breathed in hard his mind was a tangle of snipped string no knots its about him who he is and about me about who i am a winner and a loser is what you told me hes the highest mountain why climb a mountain because its there its there in front of you its in front of you indestructible and laughing at you because you are so small pygmy fucking small the whole team of sierra quebec golf spent three bloody years and they fell off the bloody mountain theyre history i want to climb the mountain beat the bastard sit with my arse on his nose because its there because he s there they say hes no fear i want to see him scared they say hes in control i want to hear him scream and beg i want little small me and its the only thing in my life that i want to bring down the mountain is that an answer maggie touched his hand i think its better than most could give she thought that the clerk in warsaw in the shadows when he kissed her would have said something like that about mountains if shed asked him and the libyan boy on the veranda in valettas moonlight shed wept for them both god was that her future growing old and sad because young men fell off the crags on bloody mountains they were climbing back into the toyota made huge by the binocular lenses and she eased the van forward there were others in her organization and in every one of the foreign communities camped in the city who didnt care she loathed their company with the lorry driver monika headed for the village beyond kiseljak she cared if she had not then she might as well as she often told herself have stayed at njusford sheltered by the mountains and overlooking a bay that was classified by unesco as a preservationworthy environment the bay was on flakstodoya island one of the lofoten archipelago it was the home she had rejected because she had needed to care she had left njusford turned her back on the little coralpainted house that had been her home she had seen in bosnia everything that brutality had to offer she was toughened to suffering she would not have acknowledged it of herself she despised introverted selfexamination but part of her character that was remarkable was the absence of cynicism and she did not know despair the reward she found was in the gratitude of simple people women who had nothing laughed with her and touched her arm or her clothes children without a future chirped as they chanted her name all the hours of sitting in officials rooms and hearing excuses for procrastination were forgotten when she witnessed the gratitude and heard the chanting bumping along in the lorry as it wove between sheets of ice on the road she was cheerful happy the man who had brought her the lorry had caused the lift in her mood most if they had come with a lorry across europe would have wanted a photocall and publicity for their generosity she thought him the best of men because he had wanted nothing of her she sang cheerily in the lorry cab not looking at the snowcapped peaks because they would have reminded her of home at njusford thinking of home would have destroyed her mood in that month on that day if the seas were not too fierce her father would have been out in his boat with her elder brother and her mother and sister would have been left to gut and behead the previous days cod catch and all of them when the boat came in would have gone in the afternoon darkness to the grave of her younger brother the black hours of winter the harshness of the seas the remoteness of the island and the agony of her brothers suicide had driven her away from njusford if she looked at mountains she remembered she sang with all of her ingrained enthusiasm they turned off the metalled road and lurched on a stone track towards the village with the charity load brought to her by a modest caring stranger they were back from the court for the midday recess to save money they avoided the canteen in the basement of the court building and went to his office to eat the sandwiches she always prepared at home while her father ate and concerned himself with the case papers jasmina threw her eyes cursorily over the overnight list of police reports she would not normally have interrupted his concentration on a difficult case which taxed both his humanity and his legal obligations the case was murder the defendant was a woman of twentytwo already the mother of four children the victim was a fellow gypsy the father of two of the children the weapon was an axe the defence was that the victim had beaten the defendant and she had acted to save her own life the accusation was that the defendant had bludgeoned the victim nine times because he had found a younger lover selfdefence or premeditated murder freedom or imprisonment in the old days before the war her father would have been assisted in room of the ministry of justice by a jury of professionals but there was no longer the money for that luxury he sat alone he must decide on guilt or innocence it was typical of the cases thrown at him without political overtones but laden with dilemma the fifth item on the police report of last nights incidents bounced back at her from the page she wheeled herself from her desk to the corner of the room lifted a file and slid the rubber band from it she riffled among the top papers selected one then moved to his desk he looked up irritably as she laid the report in front of him and pointed to the fifth item she waited until he had read it and when he looked up at her in annoyance she placed the page from the file on top of it a cloud seemed to shadow his face he read the two pages a second time a drug addict a disabled war veteran had been savagely attacked in the dobrinja district neighbours had seen nothing had heard nothing knew nothing except his name a man of the same name and from the same address in dobrinja had made a statement to the police on the death of the foreigner duncan dubbs in the miljacka river and the statement had been passed to the young british investigator with permission for intrusive surveillance and the iptf had made the link with ismet mujic who was the prime crime baron of sarajevo and ismet mujic was at the heart of his and his daughters history better if i had never been involved he said but i am and i cannot step back from involvement there is an english expression what do they say in english i think it is you reap what you sow frank and all of the team sat in on the briefing for the new man attached to the kula station he was introduced as a senior detective from dakar senegal the briefing was by the station commander an intelligence officer from the public security department of jordan who used a pointer and a blackboard to emphasize his message we are not colonialists we do not give out instructions and orders we are here to advise and help the local police forces above all else we must show them that we believe totally in the importance of the law frank heard the briefing with wavering attention distracted by a nagging shame he had tossed through the night failed to sleep and had felt his selfimposed reputation of dedication to policing slip through his fingers he had no friends in bosnia he went about his work struggled with it without the support of comrades the only men who greeted him with warmth on the rare times they saw him were the cousins who made up the sreb four salko ante fahro and muhsin he had welcomed the liaison opportunity and had hoped he would grow to like joey cann out from london but cann was now the source of his shame the jordanian droned on frank had come to bosnia for many reasons most to do with the split from megan but among them had been a heartfelt desire to help a warweary community he detested the crime that ravaged the city but like his international colleagues could see no way to fight it he had been dragged down with his fine ideals by joey cann he didnt want to see him hear from him again he began to dream the irish bar at the weekend at the top of patriotske lige fried breakfastlunch wearing the red shirt and the dragon the pint of guinness and the satellite relay of the international match from home and the shame gone but only if joey cann didnt ring him november headlights speared against the plastic that covered the windows and interrupted the feast and the celebration alija the soninlaw of husein and lila bekir had come to vraca for his weeks leave from army duties their daughter now lived with the old couple for ten months she had been with them and taken off them the weight of caring for their grandchildren but it was good that the little ones father was there he had come the night before dropped off by an army truck and he would be with them for a week the family reunited sat in the candlelight around the table in the one room of the house that was dry and sealed against the cold and they ate laughed sang and put aside the disasters of the past years in their own bed the night before cuddling each other against the chill husein and lila had heard the heave of the rusted springs in the next room through a wall weakened by old shell fire they had chuckled and predicted the arrival of another grandchild and they had each in their own way prayed that they would be there to see its birth there was little enough for them to look forward to and much for them to forget half of the population of vraca had now returned each day there was the beating of hammers the scrape of saws and the crack of chisels reshaping the old scorched stones for that year it was their aim that the returned families should have at least one room that was proof against the weather no electricity no water other than from the river but protection against the elements as patriarch of the community it was the role of husein bekir to decide who was next in the queue for help with the necessary repairs and to assign the labour it was slow work those who had come back were the elderly the young men would not return if the young did not come back he doubted their community could ever achieve vibrant life but that was for another days thoughts not for an evening of celebration with a feast before the family under the terms of what the foreigners called the quicksupport grant husein had been given a pregnant cow which would give birth in february of next year and through the incomegeneration grant they had been given tools nails and sacks of cement the foreigners brought them food heatingoil plastic sheeting for the roofing not yet repaired and packets of vegetable seed without the gifts they would have starved there was a little sour milk to be taken each day from the goats but in truth they had nothing they were dependent on the foreigners charity they had hoed strips of ground near the village to plant the vegetable seed but the crop had been minimal the good ground was across the ford over the river there was no sign left of the fire that husein had lit to clear the grass the weeds and the mines he could not look across the valley from inside his house he had no glass for the windows which were screened with heavy nailedon plastic sheeting each time he had stepped out of his house through the successive seasons of the last year he had thought that his fields beyond the river mocked him the ground on his side of the river made poor grazing for the few sheep and goats his dog had rounded up from the woods and the pregnant cow and he had no fertilizer for the ground where he had sown the seeds they had gone out that morning at first light pelted by rain husein in the old overcoat that he lived in tied with bale twine and his soninlaw had gone down to the riverbank husein had started to explain where he thought mines had been buried scratching in his memory but alija had gestured with his hand that husein should not speak but let him concentrate unless it had been pointed out to him husein would not have seen the small round greygreen plastic shape lying in a run of silt in the arable field a dozen paces from the far bank directly opposite the point where the pma mine had surfaced alija stripped off his boots and clothes shed everything except his undershirt and underpants then not seeming to feel the cold he unknotted the twine from huseins waist he unravelled it then tied the strands together to make a long thin length of more than thirty metres he said he knew about mines from his army training the strands that made a slender rope were all he took with him when he went down the bank and swam the width of the dark pool husein had stood very still and watched alija crawled up the far bank and slithered through old grass and dead nettles towards the mine husein had thought it bravado and madness he would be blamed by lila and his daughter by the tears of his grandchildren if the mine exploded because he had complained they had no food worthy of a feast and a celebration very carefully alija scraped away with his fingers the silt earth in which the mine lay then lifted it clear of the ground husein had gasped it was so small alija tied the end of the strand of twine to the mines narrow neck between its body and the little stubbed antenna and had called softly to husein to lie flat and put his hands over his ears he had been on the ground pressing down into wet grass when alija had tossed the mine casually into the river pool there had been a thunderous roar reaching deep into his covered ears then water had rained down on him they had returned to the house with two pike the largest more than five kilos in weight and three trout all heavier than a kilo poached in an old dish with rich flesh to be handpicked from the bones the trout and the pike made a feast for a celebration the headlights against the plastic were cut and the growling engine of the jeep died there was a rapped fist at the timber door they always welcomed the young spanish officer they stood around the table long enough to embarrass him he was introduced as their benefactor to alija and huseins daughter offered him a chair at the table but he refused it and sat on an upturned wooden box the officer apologized for his lateness but the supplies were now being unloaded at the building that had been a schoolhouse they had no alcohol to offer him but lila sluiced the plate in the bucket of river water wiped her hand on her apron picked the last of the trout and pike flesh from the carcasses and set it before the officer i congratulate you he said you are successful fishermen they had no lines in the village no hooks and no money to buy them he was told how it had been done the frown cut his forehead that is very dangerous i cannot encourage that until it is cleared i very much advise that you do not go across again husein squirmed he would have been responsible he challenged we are trapped here the valley was our life without going across the river how can we live what life do we have the officer said as if he believed none of it a committee has been set up in sarajevo a mineaction centre and they are now examining the places where it is known mines were laid they are drawing up a list for the priority of clearance where would i be in that priority husein persisted doggedly i would lie if i said you were high on it the cities come first sarajevo is at the top then gorazde then tuzla there is travnik and zenica and the whole of bihac province it is said there are a million mines laid in bosnia but you are on the list i promise you at the bottom of it not high on it how long before we are high on the list at an estimate there are thirty thousand places where mines were put i think it is a very long time before you are high on the list husein knew he had destroyed the pleasure of the evening but could not stop how many mines do you believe are in my fields i dont know you ask me questions that i cannot answer it could be ten it could be a hundred it could be the last one that went into the river to kill the fish i dont know husein clutched the straw it might have been the last one i cannot promise it it is a possibility not more you are blessed with the privilege of education you are an intelligent man if you were me what would you do how would you live it is my duty to urge you to be patient i have some interesting news for you the first from across the valley is coming back next week to the other side we have to escort him who is that an old man a retired policeman he has the house over the river that is nearest to your house he has been in germany but the germans are pushing out the refugees he will be the first of them husein thought it was said to cheer them the officer had eaten none of the fish laid in front of him the wooden box scraped back and he stood he was apologizing for his intrusion husein thought momentarily of the return of his friend of the chance again to argue bicker and dispute to play chess in the shade of his friends mulberry tree if he crossed the ford when the river was slow in the next summer and if the track to dragan kovacs house was clear clean safe the officer was at the door it is a possibility that was the last mine he said it so quietly that the officer did not hear his question and was gone out into the night how are you settling in mr gough not badly thats good news i dont suppose youre fond of london ill survive it in the late afternoon dougie gough and the chief investigation officer dennis cork slipped out of the custom house and on to the embankment path beside the river ostensibly they left the building so that gough could light his pipe unspoken was the desire of each man to be clear of the building away from the eyes and ears that might watch or listen to them gough face wreathed in pipesmoke wore his old raincoat and a thick knitted scarf over the tweed suit cork was wrapped in a dark camel coat with a spatter of dandruff showing on the collar the smalltalk conversational was for the corridor and the knot of smokers on the outside step yes gough was settling surviving it was what he had told his wife in a phone call to glasgow she hadnt commented seldom queried his work duties hed said the same thing to his son rory and to his daughterinlaw emma whose back bedroom in their southwest london terrace home he now occupied he hated london and yearned for escape to ardnamurchan but that was behind him they walked briskly i wouldnt want you to misconstrue mr gough but i dont see the signs of great progress im not complaining at your telephoning me in the dead of night canns last report but im not getting an impression of action can we liven it up a bit i was never one to rush things create a frisson of excitement put them off balance isnt that the road to mistakes its a twosided game hurry when you should be walking and its not just them that can make mistakes we can make mistakes i want packer and his crowd to feel pressured ive a minister sitting on me weve taken prime position in this investigation ive elbowed aside both the crime squad and criminal intelligence ive refused to share with them without a result and a quick one i may not survive thats the way of the game the young man we have there cann its interesting what hes turned up but it doesnt move us forward frankly id have thought hed have done better by now its all fat weve learned not meat i shouldnt but i lie awake at night and think of that man packer and he seems to turn to me in the street wherever and laugh at me i sleep well at night where i used to work we believed in the gospel of proaction leading and dominating not merely reacting cork remembered that he had minuted himself to refer to the dangers of overconfidence in surveillance but he erased the minute its your bad luck you dont still work there sir dammit gough mr gough if packer isnt nailed to a courtroom bench ill go down as a failure you tell me what cann has unearthed what has been in his communications that has been important learn to be patient you have to sit for hours days to see a fine dogotter off the rocks at kilchoan or on the beaches under ben hiant no patience no reward target one is unaware of current surveillance thats important the minute was forgotten id better be getting back gough leaned on the rail above the river smoked his pipe and pondered the camel coat was disappearing among the pedestrians dougie gough had plans of course he had for jarring and pressuring mister and misters clan but they would not be discussed and negotiated with a man who had dandruff on his shoulders and who worried about the future of his career it was about patience and crucial to the fruits of patience was joey cann a shadow unseen tracking mister on sarajevos streets hello dear just popped round have you thought id tidy up and make sure everythings all right the girlfriend jennifer was rather pretty violet robinson thought and a decent girl attentive and dutiful violet was fond of her as freehold owner of the house in tooting bee and the landlady she made it her business to know all of the comings and goings in the building she had two young women in the basement both city professionals and she rather hoped for their benefit theyd get themselves married off and find places of their own joey shed always had a soft spot for him had the topfloor room under the eaves when the girls in the basement moved out it was her idea that joey and his girlfriend could take it over shed be comfortable with them in her house she thought young jennifer was strained tense shed checked the room after joey had gone in that earlymorning rush for his plane and thought it puritanically tidy but perhaps there was ironing that was needed or somesuch excuse but more likely this little soul was lonely and had come over from wimbledon simply to be in his single room thats lovely dear have you heard from him he rang to say hed arrived didnt tell me much he hasnt rung since you know you can always use the phone here he didnt give me the number violet robinson had been a widow for eight years her late husband had been with the diplomatic corps and had been taken from her by a rare strain of fever with an unpronounceable name and beyond t h e skills of the american hospitals doctors in asuncion perry had been acting ambassador to paraguay h a d gone down overnight and been too ill to be f l o w n out to better facilities in buenos aires with the d e g r e e of independence expected from a seasoned foreign office wife she had set to and divided up t h e i r home in tooting bee the ground and first floor s h e had kept for herself but the basement and attic w e r e converted to rented accommodation joey had b e e n with her for five years until young jennifer came into his life shed thought that he would still be t h e r e when she was carried out by an ambulance crew or an undertaker had been almost at the point of d e s p a i r of him meeting the right sort of girl and then jennifer had arrived well ring his work ask them for it they wouldnt give it me its agaiiist the regulations of course they would in an emergency not to worry im sure hes all right there yes i keep expecting him to ring from the airport its only a few days it was her opinion a little of it from vanity that joey confided in her more than he did in his girlfriend jennifer at least once a week when he came back late at night from work she would invite him into her sitting room off the groundfloor hall and sit him down in perrys old chair shed make him strong coffee cook him welsh rarebit or an omelette pour him a stiff whisky and let him talk she was used to discretion she knew everything about the working days of what he called sierra quebec golf and everything about the life of albert william packer to pass long days and long evenings she watched the soap operas but there was nothing on television that was remotely as interesting as the work of sqg and the life of mister joey had told her that he only gave the barest skeleton of it all to jennifer it gave her pride and some little purpose to know the heart of the story and were missing him arent we fraid so anyway ill get on hes a sensible young man and what you should remember they wouldnt have sent him if he wouldnt be all right there of course youre right and thanks for saying it young jennifers back was to her going up the stairs and she wouldnt have seen violets shiver perry had told her often enough that when diplomats soldiers or intelligence officers were sent abroad were far from home they lost their sense of selfpreserving caution it had been a theme of his men and women on duty and overseas shed the ability to recognize the moment to step back it was about the isolation perry had said they felt invulnerable discarded the armour of carefulness and walked close to cliff edges he often talked about it she called up the stairs dont you worry yourself the answer came down to her and the surprise why do you say that mrs robinson im not worried of course youre not and youve no cause to be i wont be long just get it shipshape ive got to get back for the c a t when shed checked the room after hed gone violet had noted that the photograph was no longer on the wall as shed put her own rubbish sack in the outside bin for the refuse men shed found it ripped to small pieces it had been an ugly picture of an ugly man like an odour in her house she went back into her room she hoped joey spare slight with his big spectacles was not drawn close to a cliff edge high above her carried down the staircase she could hear the whine of a vacuum cleaner is that so to another man a lesser man what mister was told by serif would have been a pickaxe into the stomach beside him the eagle had gasped and he had heard a little whistle of shock hiss from between atkinss teeth serifs signature was on the document drawn up by the eagle after two hours of dispute and amendments there had been brittle politeness in the haggling and twice serif had gone out with his people into the corridor mister was satisfied the figure agreed to be paid quarterly was for a million and a half sterling converted to american dollars paid into nicosia under atkinss supervision serifs men had carried two more of the boxed mediumrange trigat launchers from the toyota into the apartment and the missiles the communications systems had been handed over and serif had leaned intently over atkinss shoulder as the workings were explained it should have been the moment for a popping cork but mister still smiling had asked with a lasers directness whether serif was responsible for the beating given to the eyewitness from dobrinja the last person to see the cruncher alive serif had denied it then serif had rolled the handgrenade across the table and it had fallen into misters lap and the eagle had gasped atkins had whistled but mister had not blinked you have my promise mister packer of the truth of it you are followed i hear you a young man foreign i assume from your country he is small with big spectacles and dressed without any style his coat is green he followed you yesterday enver saw him you stopped to look in a window and he stopped you walked back towards him and stood very close to him and he looked away from you you went away and he followed you are under surveillance it is not a situation that i welcome i know nothing of the beating of the addict in dobrinja look elsewhere for those responsible look to a man who follows you no panic flicked in misters eyes his calm dripped off him i am grateful to you i do not tolerate investigation of my business you bring good trade to me but also embarrassment misters fingers rapped the table ill deal with it but you will need help it is better we take responsibility thank you no help it is my city mister said decisively burgeoning his authority i help myself i need no assistance if i have a problem then i finish it thank you but i dont ask for help he detested providing the opportunity for a smirk to play at serifs mouth hands were shaken and then at the last he let serif take him in his broad arms and brushkiss his cheeks he himself dealt with every problem that faced him had ever challenged him and would do so until he dropped they were out in the street and heading for the toyota the eagle was a lawyer and good on contracts atkins was a soldier and understood war weapons atkins knew nothing of countersurveillance and the eagle knew less he told them to drive back to the hotel and wait for him he left them by the vehicle and started to walk slowly with his eyes on the shop fronts along mula mustafe baseskija he wandered at his own pace never looked behind him never doubled back and turned at the big junction on to kosevo and climbed the hill it was the day that nothing much happened and everything changed chapter ten joey cann trudged up the steep street for the life of him he could not understand why mister had walked out of the inner city and taken the street up the hill it was a lesson learned long ago by joey heard at the feet of experts that where a target went a footman followed the task of the footman was merely to stay in touch stay unseen but to hold the link at first going up the street past small guesthouses and smaller shops with barely filled shelves he thought of himself as a predator and mister as his prey as a child on the estate where his father was the factor he had been taught a stalkers arts by the gamekeeper the keeper had been young just out of agricultural college from the exmoor countryside and had been so his father said the best that the estate owner had ever employed joey a teenager and the keeper early twenties in late summer mornings had stalked fallow deer and hed watched the keeper shoot them with a rifle at different times of the year when killing was not the priority their game had been to creep close and joey had known that flushing excitement from being so near and unobserved then he had felt himself the predator and thought of the deer as his prey the man ahead of him took the preys role showed no awareness and no fear and strolled the keeper had gone when the new owner had taken the estate too expensive for the new money a syndicate from bristol had bought the shooting rights and employed a parttime man who had neither the time nor the inclination to take a youngster out with him joeys stalking talent had lain dormant until now he had said he was the loser and mister was the winner but the loser tracked the winner elation surged in him he felt the power of the predator his mind was focused on the roll of the shoulders in front of him and the bob of the curly uncombed hair he did not think of jen or of dougie gough who had given him the chance or of why mister wandered towards the outskirts of the city he had a bounce in his stride ahead of him the sunshine of the afternoon was slipping to dull dusk but low light snatched at the stunted little concrete posts of vivid white that rose from the dirt earth why would mister come to a place of the dead on the hill above patriotske lige and on the slope below were the densely packed white graveposts not in ordered lines not set with geometric precision but squeezed in forced together too close for decency where mister led him he followed above the railings and below them women and men and children moved with sad duty and carried little bunches of posies a gift to the graves joey had not comprehended the scale of the sarajevo slaughter he remembered fleetingly the stories of the radio and in newspapers of nighttime funerals so that mourners would not have inflicted on them the shell and mortar fire of their enemies snuggled against the lower side of the twin cemeteries was an earth and shale soccer pitch not blessed with a blade of grass and he remembered too hearing and reading that a sports field had been used as an overspill graveyard looking through the railings on the upper side of the cemetery flush to the pavement as if the corpses had been squashed short to fit the space given them were five white stones same family name and same date of death the pavement ahead of him was empty joey cursed for allowing a graveyard the war dead to break his concentration his eyes raked the desolation around him he saw mister and breathed hard the moments tension slipped from his muscles mister walked among the deads marker posts they reached to his hips some had freshcut flowers resting against them some had sealed glass bowls protecting artificial flowers some had flowers long dead some were abandoned he should have asked why and did not mister went slowly towards a great grey stone monument that sprouted above the posts dark against light and dominating he seemed to have time not to be worrying mister did not look at his watch as any man would have done if he had made a rendezvous there mister walked past the monument and out of joeys view ill deal with it hed said mister was wearing his best suit and good lightweight shoes mud and snow slush clung to the knees of his trousers was caked on his shoes he knelt he was behind haphazard rows of white posts and away to the right of the monument it was the first time hed seen him he would deal with it because that was his way at stake was respect to have been in debt and under obligation to ismet mujic was unthinkable to mister the young man was near the monument he had stopped and hesitated and looked around him the circling glance was supposed to be casual the tracker had lost his target the monument was a fallen lion or a sleeping one and the inscription that was hard to read was in german the tracker eyed the monument as if to display his innocence and kept his head movement minimal but his eyes traversed the posts and the graves mister watched he looked like a student mister had never travelled abroad on work before but he had been to spain often enough with the princess for sunshine breaks and hed have prided himself that he could spot the stereotypical characteristics of foreigners he thought the tracker was british the spectacles were the giveaway they werent a fashion accessory styled they were functional he could see the big lenses that flashed in the last light as the head was gently twisted a policeman wouldnt have passed hendon with eyesight needing such assistance low on the wet dirt earth and puddles of slush water around his knees his viewpoint gave him the narrowest of corridors between the posts all the way up the hill a route chosen at random he had never looked back he had not doubled on himself or used the reflection of shop doorways ahead of him had been the cemeteries the lockedup sports stadium and the hospital high on the furthest hill the upper sloping cemetery had seemed to give him the best opportunity he waited and watched he searched for more of them down the slope beyond the monument were the railings the pavement and the road he looked for men in raincoats or leather jackets for women who had no purpose in being there all he saw was old women old men and a few children walking slowly to graves or sitting on seats and reflecting or hurrying away because the evening closed on the city he did not identify a team the realization came quickly they had sent one man that was lack of respect he knew all the women and men from the police crime squad from the police intelligence from customs investigation service who were prominent in tracking trailing following him he knew their rank their addresses and their families names he knew about their kids their cars and their holidays with the eagle he had walked past them at the old bailey on his way to the side door had gone past their misery and their sourness he did not know this one young man who now stood confused close to the monument a heavy rain had begun to fall he saw only the whiteness of the stones the little clumps of flowers and the dark grey slabs of the monument the lion shrapnelpocked slept it was a memorial to the german soldiers killed in a longago war joey felt the chill of the place and the rain that was carried in the growing wind beat on his back and against his trousers in some of the stones set in shallow recesses nested photographs of the dead young men from the carved dates of their lives he did not know whether they were soldiers or civilians whether they had died in combat or been killed by shell splinters or by snipers some would now have been his age or younger dreaming and the wrong place to dream joey cann was the loser while he had stood near to the monument around him the cemetery had emptied joey the footman had lost the eyeball he turned away the rain ran on his spectacles and he dragged them off and wiped them hard without them the white posts were jagged blurs he did not know whether he had shown out or whether he had fouled up he could not say that he had been seen or whether the bulk of the monument the sleeping artilleryshredded lion had masked mister as hed walked out of the cemeterys far side and disappeared into the network of small streets above it there was a story written into the history of the church of the day when twenty executive officers and higher executive officers had been deployed to follow a colombian from a bank meeting in the city of london five lost the target in the first underground station more had been scattered as the target had changed trains on his journey three out of twenty had reached heathrow with him no one in authority could blame him for being dropped by his target but he blamed himself he left the cemetery the rain was sprayed in headlights spattered off the glistening road and soaked his trousers going down the hill first on patriotske liga and then on kosevo he walked fast then abruptly he crossed a small park that separated kosevo from alipasino he went past the fortress of the guarded american embassy could see only the roofs of the buildings behind the high walls the flag above them was limp and the floodlights burned brightly guards eyed him a camera swivelled to train on him joey was trained in footman surveillance not in the counterculture he had passed the tests flying colours and praise from the instructors in following not in being followed the sense of failure overwhelmed him the failure an itch in his mind shut out a cooler response tears smarting in his eyes he did not wave down taxis didnt jump on buses his nightly report would list misters movements the tourist trail around old trenches above sarajevo and lunch in a fish restaurant above pale and his drive to the meeting with ismet mujic and the unloading of more boxes that had been taken into the apartment it would not speak of failure he remembered how it had been in the room occupied by the new men and women recruited to sierra quebec golf goughs harsh staccato introduction the hostile suspicion of the eyes that had glared at him the interloper with the rainwater dripping off him he stamped into the hall of his hotel didnt respond to the friendly inquiry from the reception clerk as to whether hed had a good day and hurried for the stairs his room and dry clothes he never looked back never saw the reaction of the snubbed clerk a hand palmed a banknote across the table to the value of one hundred german marks it represented a quarter of the monthly wage paid to a hotel reception clerk and won an answer joey cann room from london another banknote another hundred marks slipped into the clerks hip pocket and the name was fed into the hotel computer abill was printed out then passed over the desk it was scanned a name a passport number no address beyond london sw no occupation given itemized food and coffee one call made on the rooms telephone a final question and another banknote was mr cann alone he was travelling with a woman separate rooms a very smart woman a lady hands were shaken smiles were exchanged mister walked out into the rain and the falling darkness the number of the mobile telephone was known only to its owner and its owners paymaster three calls were made from it that evening the trigger for the calls was a simple request for information as soon as the bleep and vibration heralding the call had cut into the conversation in the crowded italian restaurant in victoria its owner had left the table and gone to the toilets he was never without that phone payasyougo he had listened to the brief message left against a rumble of background traffic his first call was to the night duty officer at the national investigation service of customs amp excise he identified himself as the father of joey cann and asked to speak to him he was patched through to an extension number and repeated himself he was told curtly that cann was abroad and apologized with humility buried in the workings of the mobile was an attachment that scrambled its number preventing it being traced placed there by a threeman electronics company from the east of london his second call was to a british telecom engineers home the engineer worked in a building in central bristol considered sufficiently sensitive to be unpublicized from the building telephone taps and the inquiries of covert lawenforcement organizations were handled among its many prized facilities was the ability to feed a number into a computerized system and receive back the name and address of the subscriber he waited in the toilet left his wife and three colleagues and their wives at the table he was a detective chief inspector on attachment to the national crime squad a recent paper that he had read police corruption vulnerability profiling had offered a solid description of him but he went unidentified and trusted because it was not the nature of the squad actively to search for culprits he had known mister since when he had been a probationer beat constable out of caledonian road and had taken the first small donation now he was three years from retirement and had a record with commendations of distinguished service and a high detection rate he was well regarded by colleagues and had successfully served in drugs serious crime and robbery teams he seemed to have a nose for guilt he was regarded by those alongside him as arrogant and brash with justification the woman at the table waiting for his return represented his third venture into marriage his income from the crime squad paid monthly was divided between what he kept and what he paid to the two women from the failed relationships he was secretive about his policing methods seldom shared rejoiced in the title of a coppers copper it was whispered of him that he bent regulations but that had never been proven he should have been made detective superintendent but promotion had been denied him for no articulated reason it was likely that it had been blocked because he seldom hid an overweening contempt of his superiors and their dogma of political sexual ethnic and legal correctness he was a thieftaker and what the bosses wanted was a socialist pedagogue who was black and had a law degree in criminal sociology this was his familiar refrain when he bought the big drinks rounds for the juniors without the money mister paid him he would have been as impoverished as a stray dog he had no fear of being unmasked his seasoned experience meant that he knew the system of internal investigation and covered his tracks with care most recently for mister he had identified the location of a prisons protected witness unit and the pwu number given to a prisoner and had named a technician at a home office forensic laboratory to which incriminating fingerprints had been sent for a quarter of a century his arrangement with mister had been mutually beneficial he had received information on misters rivals and lifted them always with evidence to convict he had earned the right to promotion by his successes its denial had added a hatred of the system he served he had no qualms about what he did and the money kept coming his telephone bleeped tickling the palm of his hand he listened and wrote down what he was told for the sake of accuracy he made his third call he heard the distant traffic joey cann works at nis the church hes abroad right now the subscriber on that number is jennifer martin address is ground floor flat a lavenham road london sw got it the connection cut in his ear the piece of paper torn into many pieces was flushed down the pan he returned to the table to resume as its life and soul he looked around saw nobody who he thought watched him and lightly rapped the door at the back of the van me joey said he was let in he scrambled into her territory there was a dull light inside like a photographers dark room maggie was squatting on her stool in front of her console he avoided the bucket saw that it was a quarter full beside it were her sandwich wrappings two apple cores and an empty pepsi tin he looked at the screen the camera trained on the hotel main door was bolted on to the dashboard top and was covered in yesterdays newspapers she grimaced god you smell nice going somewhere i dont know about got soaked had a shower changed bloody marvellous id give an arm right now for a shower and clean tights the log written in her neat copperplate hand recorded that target two and target three had returned one hundred and eightyfive minutes earlier that seventy minutes earlier target three had exited and driven away in the toyota that sixtysix minutes earlier the beacon signal had been lost that fourteen minutes earlier target three had been dropped back at the hotel by a taxi is he back i thought you were supposed to know what im asking is he back steady down yes hes back didnt i log it his door was unlocked eightyfour minutes ago do i have to ask twice every time make something complicated where it should be bloody simple is he back yes hes back thank you now weve established hes back please tell me what hes doing who bit you this evening second time whats he doing dont know so you dont have to ask twice i dont know what hes doing god what do you think hes doing im never a pessimist if you were to ask me to tell you not on oath id say hes moving the furniture round before that he was tapping the walls and the ceiling shit joey mouthed it take a listen for yourself she passed him the earphones it might have been a chair dragged across the carpet or drawers pulled out from the chest and dropped or wood being torn from its holding glue maggie wrenched the earphones off his head you lost him didnt you he said tried to summon defiance contact was broken yes you bloody showed out didnt you after a little more than an hour and a half of searching mister found the bug he had gently tapped his way round the walls of the room and stood on a chair to tap the ceiling it had been a methodical close search he had taken all the pictures off the wall and had unscrewed the ventilation grilles and the power points he had satisfied himself that the walls ceilings grilles and electric fittings were clear then he had taken the back off the tv set stripped down the bedside radio prised the cover off the telephone and had unplugged it at the wall socket to break the link of an infinity transmitter using the receivers microphone he had turfed the sheets blankets pillows and coverlet off the bed then heaved off the mattress and minutely examined the legs headboard and base he had taken the drawers out of the desk supports stripped his clothes from them he had gone through the bathroom with the same precision looked under the bath looked at the shaving and hairdryer plug points had removed the baths side cover stretched his hand into the space and lit it with his pencil torch he had turned his attention to the wardrobe his suits and best shirts were on the floor and his shoes he worked from the bottom of the wardrobe to the top in the east of london at romford was a threeman business with whom mister had an association thoughtfully and with an eye for the future he had provided startup funds for their business but misters connection with them was well buried and did not appear on their company paperwork his small initial investment had paid handsomely but he had never called in the debt the business run from a shabby and unprepossessing industrial park supplied stateoftheart bugs cameras homing beacons scanners and recording equipment to a smartly appointed shop in the west ends bond street it sold its goods mainly on the middle eastern gulf market the best moneyspinner was the lightweight beacons attached by princes sheikhs and emirs to the ankles of their hunting falcons the shop gathered in the money and the three men in the industrial park each worked seventyhour weeks to satisfy demand mister had never asked to be repaid his investment what he demanded was to be kept up to date on the latest most sophisticated devices that could be used against him from his continuing contact he knew of most of the equipment available to the secret intelligence service the security service gchq the national crime squad the national criminal intelligence service and the church what was on offer and where it could be hidden because he stood on the chair and was close to the woodwork at the top of the wardrobe because his torch beam played on the joins at the angles of the wood screen he saw the faint scrape where the join had been loosened the wood creaked and small splinters fell from it as mister dragged it apart it was smaller than anything the men in the industrial park at romford had shown him he grinned to himself the bug he thought was the most recently developed and most miniaturized and it had been used against him the grin was because he felt that respect was being shown him his anger slackened he looked at the box the wires and the listening probe slotted into the wood and he considered there were options open to him he could leave it where it was and feed false information into it get the eagle in and talk riddles discuss bogus travel movements but no message would then be sent he could go down the thirdfloor corridor take atkinss radio put the volume to full hold the radio beside the probes microphone throw the on switch and blast the ears that would be listening under headphones but that would not send the message he wanted he could swear down the link blasphemies and obscenities and laugh raucously but that would lessen the message he left it in place he put his room back together undid the chaos of his search he stripped out of the suit with the mud wet on his knees scraped the caked clay off his shoes then took a long shower and dressed for dinner standing on the chair he took down the box the wires and the probe then used the flat of his hand to hammer the joins on the wood screen back into place he took the bug out of his room and walked briskly down the corridor down three flights of stairs across the atrium hall through the swing doors and out into the spitting night he hurried because he did not want his clean suit and clean shoes to get wet from the rain they watched the screen the bright lights of the hotels porch roof flared the picture and burned out the face of target one but as he came forward the picture compensated he was whistling to himself amplified and tinny over the vans speaker maggie tilted the joystick control and the camera tracked with him joey breathed hard he was against her back could feel the warmth of her peered over her shoulder he went into the centre of the car park a taxi flashed him with its headlights but he smiled and gestured that he didnt need it mister looked around him and saw what he wanted the camera followed him towards a rubbish bin at the edge of the car park he never looked around or hunted for them as if they werent important as if he knew they were there he was beside the bin his arm moved and the box the wires and the fine probe dropped at his feet the carried its clatter the box had bounced on the gravel but was still now and the twisted wires lay on of a polished shoe was raised mister stamped twice on the box the speaker reverberated once then the silence was around them mister bent picked up the pieces of the box and the wires that had detached from he snapped the probe in half and dropped it into the rubbish bin he wiped his hands rubbed the rain off his hair turned for the hotels door and disappeared inside well go on she said joey looked blankly at her didnt your mother ever tell you waste not want not i can rebuild it so go and get it he thought she enjoyed the moment you were the one who showed out remember so just get it joey said feebly i dont know where or when i just dont understand at what moment i showed out winners and losers as i recall its quite simple you werent good enough you overvalued your capability please just go and get it joey slipped out of the back of the van and went towards the rubbish bin he had never felt so miserable so worthless not when the letter had dropped into the box of his parents tied cottage to tell him his exam results had been inadequate for a college place not when the sierra quebec golf team had drifted in from the old bailey always before he could have blamed others this time only he carried the blame he retrieved the pieces from the rubbish bin and carried them back in the van she examined them he had not brought everything he had missed the snappedoff head of the probe he was told what he had missed he went a second time to the rubbish bin groped in it and couldnt find the length of the broken probe he pulled the wire frame out of the bin shook it out and crawled among the debris until he found it he brought the piece back to her and left the rubbish scattered she smiled winked at him and put it into a bag with the box and the wires she closed down the camera switched off the audio console and climbed into the vans driving seat she offered no explanation as they drove along zmaje od bosne then on to the bulevar mese selimovica they sat in silence and he nursed the hurt the rain had lifted a shallow mist off the road the warehouses and darkened factories at first the beacon was faint the light on the screen and the bleep drew them they reached the junction for the turning to the airport the building on the corner had had a massive tower that was collapsed now in huge concrete shapes the beacon was stronger the vans headlights found an encampment of caravans lorries and belltents they drove off the road and onto a mud track the wheels spun but she had control and edged past the camp the light on the screen and the bleep intensified he saw the fire engine men with hoses and a crowd of dancing leaping urchin kids the smoke from the burnedout skeleton of the toyota sagged in the wind she gazed at the scene not bad eh still working he tried to summon the pith of sarcasm i suppose you want me to go and retrieve it its otter didnt i tell you thats one time throw away what a star still going after that sort of fire are we on a testtodestruction exercise we are merely confirming that you showed out that the targets know of our surveillance cheer up look on the bright side does it get worse doubt it you showing out should make it all the more challenging it could be at last interesting february he already wore his heavy calflength underpants under his pyjamas a vest and thick woollen socks he crawled from his bed onto the floor the bed legs had been unscrewed and burned for warmth he reached the solid old table that he would never chop up for the fire heaved himself upright went to the door and lifted down his heavy coat dragan kovac would never be parted from that coat which was twentyfive years old and a symbol of his past most of its front buttons were still in place they were dulled but still if he squinted at them he could see the rampant eagle head embossed on them the coat reminded him of the days when he had been a man of importance the police sergeant just as the table reminded him of the blessed days before his wife had been taken from him there had been an explosion in the night without the help of the spanish soldiers it would not have been possible for him to move back into his house they had strung a great canvas sheet over the roof tiles that kept out the rain but not the damp they had sealed the windows with planks had replaced the broken chimney stack with a tube of silvery metal but it smoked if the winter gales came from the east or the south they brought him the basics of food and paraffin oil for his lamp and nagged that it was not a fit place for an elderly man to live on his own but he was back and he would not shift before his maker took him then he would be buried in the graveyard above ljut beside his wife below a roughchiselled stone cross the family with whom he had been forcelodged in griefswald had packed his bags for him a full fortyeight hours before the minibus had come to collect him the crisp sun lit the valley from the door looking down he saw husein bekir with his fundamentalist soninlaw dragan kovac spat a gob of mucus onto the concrete path that led from his front door if they wore that uniform camouflage markings and forage cap they were fundamentalists and war criminals he had no doubt of it it was his surprise that a decent man like husein bekir avaricious for land and money but decent allowed the man his daughter had married to flaunt that killers uniform he would speak to husein about it when the fundamentalist criminal had returned to his unit the uniforms he had been told in the transit camp before he had returned to ljut were the castoff clothes of the american army and the weapons with which they were issued were american their instructors were american and they would have american advisers when finally they attacked the defenceless serb people and drove them from their homes it was what he had been told and he believed it he believed also that this criminal soldier would have killed serb babies and serb women without mercy he had been told it husein and his soninlaw were at the far riverbank away from the ford since he had come back dragan kovac had spoken twice to his neighbour the spanish soldiers had told him repeated it drilled it into him as though he were an idiot that he should not step off the track that went down to the ford or up to the village they had asked him where the mines were laid but his memory was hazy and he could not remember what type had been sown in what quantities or where dragan had walked twice down to the ford on the hard track and they had shouted across the river to each other how was husein he was fine how was lila she was fine how was the house it was fine that was the first time the second time they had shouted over the water about the weather about the volume of the rainfall and that it was worse than any year since and about small things and about his friends hope of being given a new tractor no politics and nothing about the mines when the water level fell when it was possible for husein bekir to cross the ford he would come and they would play chess and dragan had promised to cook for husein and fill him with brandy while they played the previous day the soninlaw had slung a rope with a grapplehook tied to its end over the river and dragged it tight till the claws caught fast in a withy clump then knotted his own end to an alders roots perhaps huseins memory was better than his own or perhaps the soninlaw was merely lucky and had the arrogance of youth hanging from the rope the young man had hauled himself over the river even at that long distance dragan had observed the fretted anxiety of husein as the soninlaw searched for the mines they were the ones on stakes that were fired with tripwires much of the grass was still thin from the fire husein had lit before dragans return the soninlaw found four of what the spanish soldiers called the pmr fragmentation mines which they said were the most dangerous the fire would have burned the nylon wires but the mines had survived the fire dragan had thought it crass stupidity but the soninlaw with the four mines had gone along the bank of the river and hed lost sight of him where the wood came down to the water an hour later he had come back without the mines he watched the young man cross the river on the rope then walk along the riverbank towards the treeline there had been the detonation in the night then silence he put on his boots tied them loosely and stamped off down the track he shouted for husein to join him and wove towards the ford he kept to the centre of the track he felt good now but he thought husein walked less steadily than he remembered and husein was a year and seven months younger than him he waited until husein reached the ford and felt satisfaction that he walked less well than himself and husein also had poorer hearing so dragan had to shout above the tumble of the water to be heard whats h e dragan spat into the river and saw his phlegm bobble before being carried away whats he doing yesterday he picked up four of the mines and moved them thats the job of a fool he said we should eat meat that we eat too much of the soya and pasta shit that the military brings i heard a mine in the night dragan replied sourly the soya and pasta is good enough for me but not for my soninlaw he took four mines from the field to the trees and looked for the tracks of deer he moved the mines to kill a deer has he killed a deer hes gone to see what he has killed if its a young deer its good it is gods gift if it is a fox then the risk he took was wasted he says we should eat meat dragan with the pomposity given him by his police overcoat said it is better to have a life and limbs than to have meat he says he knows about mines then hes a fool you should eat pasta and soya only once have we had fish since we came back we need more than pasta and soya the children must have meat if they are to grow it is because of your people that we have the mines in my fields the mines were put in the ground to protect us from barbarian criminals like your soninlaw our officer called them defensive mines husein bekir had spread his arms waved them as if to call on god as a witness and raged you shelled us you fired on our homes you came and slit our throats in the night you would have killed me the veins bulged in dragan kovacs throat as he bellowed his riposte you fired shells on us on our women and our children enough husein bekir enough can you not recognize that it is over the war is finished how is the war over when your mines are still in my fields dragan laughed i know the war is over when you are at my house and we play chess and the brandy is on the table and i will beat you on the table and i will still be sitting when you are on the ground drunk you have no skill at chess you cannot hold liquor never had never could never will the laughter cackled across the water and over the laughter was the crack of the explosion his friend husein with the poorer hearing did not hear the blast he still laughed dragan kovac the powerful man who had been in authority cringed the only time in his life he had ever run from the responsibilities of his position in ljut was during the attack and he had suffered his god knew he had suffered been imprisoned in the tower block in griefswald as punishment for running he had vowed then many times he would never flee his obligation again he pointed to the wood he stabbed at the wood with his finger husein bekirs eyes followed the jabbing hand laughter gone a narrow column of dark chemical smoke rose from the heart of the trees and above the smoke crows circled and screamed dragan saw husein crumple he said hoarsely you cannot go there friend you have the children to look after and lila you must not go he had to strain to hear the voice what if he is not dead you said yourself believe he is dead it was the nearest spoken with gruffness that dragan could get to kindness believe it was quick he watched as husein turned and started up the track for his home in the far distance he could see huseins wife daughter and grandchildren at the dour of their ruined house and others in the village were running to them the minefield was active spawning and its reach had spread because four mines had been moved by his friends soninlaw and two had exploded but two more were now placed in new ground where none had been before he thought the valley cut by the river between the villages of vraca and ljut was damned the wind caught the trees in lavenham road jen heard the catflap go snapping in the kitchen door she couldnt sleep she missed him that was gods honest truth she hadnt needed the landlady violet to tell her that she missed him if she hadnt needed to get back to her tworoom flat to feed the cat she would have slept in his bed it would have been better to have been alone in his bed than alone in her own her cat walter was a big black longhaired neutered male he was a tie demanding and precious little affection from him repaid what she spent on his food the cat never slept on her bed hed have been welcome enough but with the independence of his species he never took up the invitation jens flat was the whole of the ground floor of a narrow terraced house she shared the front door with a couple with a baby who rented the floor above but they were away and there wasnt the crying of the child to disturb her jen would have liked the reassurance of the cat on her bed and the crying from upstairs it was the quiet of the house that disturbed her the wind was in the trees and it sang highpitched in the telephone wire from the pole to the house and it scudded a carton down lavenham road that bounced erratically noisily cleaning joeys room had been a waste of her time but being there had been a comfort of course hed be all right she heard the creak of the fence at the back of the house loud enough to carry through the length of the building and then there was a sharp shrill cry but very brief as if walter fought with a rival she hadnt thought the wind fierce enough to shift the back fence she snuggled further down in the bed she had responsibility for the fence she used the garden a fencepost or a section of paling would cost a fortune she started the big debate that usually ended in sleep would he ask her to marry him would she accept if he asked if he didnt ask by next christmas or in a years time would she ask him to marry her her mother sniped about it talked about her neighbours joy in their grandchildren said shed soon be too old said it was wrong for babies to be born out of wedlock the wind had come on harder she heard the singing creaking the front bell rang persistent and loud the hands of her watch told her it was half past midnight the finger stayed on the bell button she staggered from the bed could it be joey could he be back silly beggar and not carrying his mobile could he have gone to tooting bec then come on here for her she was out of bed and into her dressinggown the bell was a siren it couldnt be joey hed have rung her from tooting bec from the telephone in the downstairs hall she was into the hall switched on the ceiling light through the frosted glass on the upper half of the door was the outline of a figure the bell yelled for her then the silence and the figure was gone from the far side of the door the door was on the chain she opened it she heard didnt see it a car driving away there was a cardboard box on the mat jen took the chain off opened the door and lifted the top flap of the box then she screamed howled at the wind dougie gough wondered whether he had expected too much of a young man without the necessary bedrock of experience another couple of days and he might probably would pitch cann home he read the report a second time from sqgsarajevo bh to sqglondon timed message starts para one observed with box target one two three on drive round former city battlefields presumably timekilling para two observed with box target onetwothree visit apartment of im boxes were carried into the apartment but cannot say what they contained para three target one visited lion cemetery then returned to hotel message ends he thought it pretty damn thin he rocked with tiredness he had stayed on alone in the sierra quebec golf room for two full hours after the last of the rest of the team had gone home stayed for nothing he started for his bed in southwest london he did not know because he hadnt been told that a call had come through that evening for cann and that canns father had been informed that his son was abroad he marched with a good stride for the bus stop on the allnight route nor did he know had no reason to that jennifer martin lived a dozen streets across two main roads from where he would sleep at the busstop dougie gough lit his pipe and waited and wondered what in sarajevos day had been kept from him the guests at the city liveryhall dinner black tie and stag finished the last of their brandy and their port and hurried for their chauffeurs and taxis cork had lost count of the times the minister had tried to catch his eye from the top table hed thought himself safe as the dinner broke up because the minister was surrounded by wellwishers on the step looking for a taxi he was trapped a lift anywhere can i drop you out of your way im afraid a taxill be along the ministers car waited the door open i dont wish to press but the secretary of states taken an interest billy wanted to know where we were with packer we never use names on the pavement minister so i told him you had assured me this creature was getting maximum effort billys own constituency two days ago came out two from the top of the countrys worst heroinaddiction areas of course hes concerned he has voters complaints littering his surgeries with maximum resources about spot on i think i also warned you against high hopes of quick fixes if i didnt i should have i may call him this creature yes billy sees him as an affront to the governments whole lawandorder policy is he still in sarajevo not locations on the pavement please billy said it was intolerable that a man like er this creature could beat the justice system im to be called in next week to say where we are to give assurances dont get me wrong im sure you understand the priority of this of course sorry must go he saw the taxis light a full hundred yards up the street he ran he bounced off guests who were nearer to it and waving for it he was in the taxi through the window as it pulled away he heard the curses of those hed queuejumped hed do it in the morning beat the ear of gough the privilege of rank had he been right to force the issue to have the youngster cann sent to sarajevo the clock ticked perhaps hed drunk a little too much perhaps he was too casual with the prescribed tablets for his blood pressure but he sweated as the taxi speeded him home gough talked of patience but that was a damned luxury do you know what hes done whats deal with it myself well weve all changed rooms weve lost our vehicle or you have and he has thrown a sophisticated listening device into a rubbish bin thats what i know atkins needed to talk he felt isolated dinner had been strained as mister had talked a rambling monologue he had also felt frightened the eagle had eaten his food sipped his perrier and with the regularity of a metronome every minute or so had nodded his agreement to what was said going into the hotel restaurant mister had asked casually if the new rooms were satisfactory and had not referred to the surveillance again hed found the eagle sitting in a corner of the atrium bar half hidden by pot plants alone in its latenight emptiness is that all of it i wouldnt have thought so it seemed a bit tame whats happened at this end theres nothing tame about mister or havent you learned that at the royal military academy atkins had enjoyed the classes on military history he remembered on the wall of one classroom was a reproduction print of the retreat from moscow hed listened to the monologue and seen the gloom and defiance of napoleon it had been a campaign too far he should never have travelled the worm ate at him sarajevo was misters moscow von goethe had written and the lecturer had repeated it of napoleon his life was the stride of a demigod from battle to battle and from victory to victory at dinner mister had talked easily about the state of the aid programme going into bosnia and the volume of charitable boxes needed the numbers of lorries required to ferry them the opportunities provided it was grand talk he gave them a vision of a future where the lorries of bosnia with love crisscrossed the country brought in dross and took out product goldwin scott had written of napoleon if utter selfishness if the reckless sacrifice of humanity to your own interest and passions be vileness history has no viler name he seemed to have no care hes under surveillance hes targeted with an audio device thats heavy i didnt expect that not here anyway youre close to him much closer than me surely you need to know what action hes taking i wouldnt ask and i wouldnt listen if i were told its called accessory before the fact or its accessory after the fact depending i dont need that as a legal professional my advice to you is to maintain a similar indifference its not going well is it what do you think good night mister had switched from the lorries and their trade to the wider horizons he was above the small confined world of london he was going to an international stage electronically moved monies went too fast to be tracked commodities were needed on the global scale and would be paid for without the petty restrictions of value added tax and levied customs duties the vision was of a centre controlling a network of assets the centre was untouchable napoleon had said the bullet that is to kill me has not yet been moulded atkins had remembered the quotation and been frightened mister talked of power talked with arrogance and neither he nor the eagle dared contradict him it wasnt going well and mister didnt recognize it he was a messiah but had only the eagle and atkins with him to play his disciples atkins ordered another beer swallowed it and ordered another joey said she was hysterical she couldnt put a sentence together she was gone maggie was wiping sleep dust from her eyes start it again start it all over again when she opened the box there was a plastic bag in it on top of the box was a piece of paper written on it was my name the room number and the hotels phone even the international dialling code for sarajevo maggie pushed herself up in her bed she was hunched with her knees against her chest he had been banging frantic at her door in the plastic bag her cat oh god tell me come on the cats called walter fuck its name what had they done to it they must have caught it in the garden it had only just gone out its a hunter it goes out and spare me the soundbites she loves the cat the cat is we all love cats everyone loves cats except dogs what had they done to the cat he sat on the end of the bed she had draped a blanket over her shoulders she noted at that moment a calm came to him the choke in his throat was gone there was no longer any emotion in his voice she took the plastic bag out of the box and opened it her cat was in the bag i dont know which they had done first they had cut its head off and also sliced its stomach so its bowels were hanging out she opened the bag and its entrails and blood went over her hall floor the blood was still warm and so was the cats body they knew who she was shes a teacher shes just my girlfriend for fucks sake if theyd killed jen then id just have felt blind bloody anger and theyd have known he would have known that id have gone to the end of the earth to follow him he enjoys inflicting pain this is all about pain not about elimination she will never forget her cat was killed because of me what i do hell have broken us she was yelling for me to come back first flight she said that packer wasnt worth it its how he destroys people jens never been to the custom house she doesnt do the socials there with me nobodys ever heard of her how did he know about jen have you rung her from here on the first evening when wed just checked in i on the room phone joey nodded it hurt too much to admit the responsibility out loud his head dropped she didnt sneer at him didnt hit him with sarcasm where is she now he said i told her to go to a friends house ring school in the morning and stay away sick has she spoken to the police cant she get protection i told her not to speak to the police and not to ring the church how did you explain that gave her some crap about informers touts about leaking sieves shit about not knowing who you can trust she wasnt thinking straight enough to argue she took his hand why did you do that joey why did you tell her not to ring the police or your people at the custom house theyd call me home joey said simply he let her hold his hand if they knew id showed out and that i was identified by name theyd call me home youd better sleep in here with me but youre on the floor she threw him a blanket and watched him settle on the carpet she switched the light out chapter eleven they were getting out of the car off the main road in front of steelshuttered gates when the klaxon sounded behind them the lorry had slowed but kept going mister turned saw bosnia with love on the side and the eel in the cab waving to him before the lorry accelerated away down bulevar mese selimovica going away from the city he waved back it was the last time that the lorry would return to london empty the next time the lorry rolled for the frontier it would be carrying product this time it carried in a pouch fastened to the base of the drivers seat a short affectionate letter to the princess and instructions to young sol for the transfer of monies from a cayman account to a cypriot bank in nicosia for a moment deep inside himself and hidden from the eagle and from serif he felt a small sensation of loneliness for that moment he almost wished himself into the cab beside the eel and going home to what was familiar they walked to the gate and one of serifs men produced the keys that unfastened a rusting padlock the heavy chain was freed and the gates scraped open it would be his sarajevo base the site from which he would launch his new career it was the heart of misters grand design he was told that it had once been the transport headquarters of the nationalized electricity company he stepped through the gate after serif followed by the eagle then looked around him the compound was enclosed by high walls that were concrete rendered except where shell fire had hit them the holes were filled with crudely placed cement blocks or sheets of old corrugated iron the walls were topped with weathered coils of barbed wire they were high enough and the surrounding buildings low enough to prevent the compound being overlooked there were three steelsided warehouses at the far end and a small brick shed the warehouses had been burned out and were charred black but the shed had survived without a direct hit rough repairs had been made enough to proof the roofing against the weather and seal the sides to the right side of the compound there was a mountain of wrecked vehicles as if they had been bulldozed together after the artillery and the fires had destroyed them rubble debris glass shards were scattered through the compound and misters feet crunched as he walked towards the shed it would be his place there was a louder abrasive crushing behind him and he turned to see atkins drive into the yard he was at the wheel of the replacement fourwheel drive a white mitsubishi it was more thousands of marks of outlay a minor investment against what he would accrue when the lorries rolled home with the product on board glass slivers and little showers of concrete spat from under the wheels atkins hurried to catch him he was led to the first warehouse when the hatch door was pulled open he stared inside and blinked as far as he could see were stacked boxes every japanese manufacturers televisions stereos and videos the second warehouse was filled half with wheat barley and flour sacks and half with plastic racks of womens clothes the third was empty he noted the ramp for vehicle repair it would have been the electricity companys maintenance workshop one of the men came to serif and whispered in his ear pointed to the gate and was dismissed the location was right the facilities were right but it was not misters way to show enthusiasm serif eyed him as if waiting for the opportunity to state something of importance but holding back for a better moment fuck him he thought they went to the shed coffee was made a radio played local music an electric fire made a fuggy heat he took off his jacket and so did atkins neither carried a firearm but he noted that serif kept his jacket on he spoke of the arrangements he had made for the transfer of monies because the deal was signed and the contract agreed the statement of importance from serif when it came was a question that surprised him you were followed in sarajevo you were tracked who i said id deal with it i have dealt with it who followed you from what agency one man from customs in uk its not a problem i dealt with it what does dealt with it mean theyll pull back ship out you can forget it my question that concerns me can the customs in uk send a man to sarajevo and track you without notifying the authorities here is permission not required mister turned to the eagle whats the position when they operate abroad the eagle said its quite clearly laid down couldnt just come in here like tourists and operate clandestinely that would be cowboy they would require written authorization in sarajevo from a government minister or a senior official or a judge mister thought it was the answer serif expected there was a silence round them words moved soundlessly on serifs lips as if names flicked on to and off his tongue as if his mind turned over a list his head went up and he stared at the ceiling as he pondered he must believe he owns mister thought all the ministers in the city all the officials with influence and all the judges of importance except one abruptly serif cracked his fingers as if by elimination he had decided which of them he did not own then he threw the bomb you said you would deal with it had dealt but you are still tracked followed mister merely rolled his eyes raised an eyebrow queried it serif put down his coffee cup went to the shed door and beckoned mister followed him the eagle and atkins scraped back their chairs and made to go with him but he waved them back they walked across the compound the red mist played in his mind but he smiled as if the matter was of no consequence he felt rare raw anger they reached the closed gate in the steel plate at a mans eye height was a hole the size of a large screws head serif had to strain up on his toes to peer through it then backed away he stood aside mister bent his head slightly looked through the hole and up the rutted street leading from the compound to the main road he saw the traffic buses lorries vans cars jeeps on the bulevar mese selimovicas eight lanes he saw the pedestrians on both pavements going slowly against the wind he saw tower blocks beyond the road he saw him he saw joey cann cann was sitting on a concrete rubbish bin where the street joined the road and seemed to shiver as the wind that funnelled down the road snatched at his anorak and his hair mister watched him take off his spectacles wipe them hard on a handkerchief then replace them there should have been telephone calls from brightlit rooms in the custom house in the small hours of the night from the high men of the church to the hotel calls should have been pumped through the switchboard of the hotel by the clerk who had eased money into his hip pocket the high men should have ordered joey cann to pull out quit run there should have been packed bags empty rooms and a stampede for the airport but cann sat on the rubbish bin and did not even make a pretence of concealment mister backed away from the spyhole he smiled again but his nails dug into his soft palms and his knuckles were white bloodless with the effort of it he went back towards the shed among those who knew him the few who were close enough to watch it was unthinkable for mister to act when his temper was shredded rules he lived by were seldom broken at the shed door serif took his arm what will you do i will deal with it myself it is what you said before myself i dont want need help ourselves mister pulled open the shed door he waved a short chopped gesture for the eagle and atkins he led them away into the yard as he said what they would do his finger jabbed in emphasis the spittle from his fury bounced on atkinss face and the eagles it was personal an insult he would not turn the cheek to an insult never had sounds to me as if thats not in your bloody precious manual maggie had said she was parked up off the road except when highsided lorries went by she could see him he was so small he sat on the rubbish bin and his legs were too short for his feet to rest on the pavement he seemed to blanch in the wind that carried sheets of newspaper and empty packets up the pavement and the road around him he had stepped over an undrawn line and shed told him that he hadnt listened but had slipped away from the van when shed parked and walked back to the junction of the road and the street leading down to a warehouse complex and hed jerked himself up onto the rubbish bin she had the camera on him at that range a tiny blurred figu re and she had the tape running on a loop she saw joey ease himself off his perch he walked away from it carelessly back towards her when he looked behind him every dozen strides the wind lifted his hair pulled it up to the roots which made him look younger and without protection shed seen the mitsubishi turn into the street driven by the former soldier as joey would have done hed been loitering then but almost immediately afterwards he had taken to the perch on the rubbish bin hed have moved because the gates were opening and started his walk away up the pavement towards her but it wasnt the mitsubishi that appeared from the street and waited to join the traffic it was target one to her he seemed a small insignificant figure hunched in his overcoat he came out of the street on to the pavement turned and walked towards sarajevos centre why walk why go alone why not ride joey was following a hundred yards behind and matched the quick stride of target one she did not know the manner of it but she recognized that a mantrap was set atkins thought he tramped a treadmill and did not know how to get off this isnt a discussion mister had said and stabbed his finger into atkinss chest im not asking for advice i am telling you how it is its not for talking round its for doing doing the way i say it by driving the new mitsubishi he walked the treadmill hed bought the toyota outright but the mitsubishi was cash up front for rental the vehicle had been stolen four days before from the parking area outside the apartments occupied by the international committee of the red cross and the icrc logo had been spraypainted off the doors new number plates fitted and an additional set with different numbers lay on the floor behind him it handled easily and well he took it out into the traffic flow mister was a full three hundred yards ahead of him and the tail as the man had been described to him was a hundred yards behind mister he idled the engine and scanned the road ahead the eagle had said nothing hadnt protested hadnt joined in when atkins had queried his instructions and been slapped down ahead of him were the fruits of an effort to brighten the route into the city new trees had been planted in the grass between the road and the pavement supported to give them stability by tripods of wooden stakes and interspersed between them were high streetlamps he eased the vehicle forward the eagles eyes were closed and he was breathing hard atkins held the slow lane he should have had notice of this should have planned and rehearsed it but it was on the hoof and he hadnt dared dispute it further with mister from the slow lane he would accelerate towards the tail and mister then pick the moment swing at increased speed between the new trees and the streetlamps hit the pavement straighten take the target square on the radiator grille pull back between the obstacles bump over the kerb and swerve into the fast lane the way mister had said it it had seemed so easy it was beyond anything atkins had ever done in his life and the sweat ran on his back and across the pit of his gut each gap between the new trees and the streetlamps was as good as the last as good as the next do it in your own time mister had said just do it when youre ready he recognized that mister kept the pace steady so that the tails pace and position could be estimated and the timing of the surge through the gap could be more exact it couldnt fail if he had the w i l l it was murder in the army he had never killed never fired a weapon in anger bosnia with the blue beret force the source of his casually told war stories had seen him in the ditches and crouched behind the sandbags trembling and close to wetting himself just like all the other guys mister would have done it wouldnt have hesitated but mister played the decoy wasnt there to stiffen him and the eagle shook uncontrolled beside him he was alone atkins edged up through the gears speed surging and picked out a gap between the new trees and the streetlamps his eyes tunnelfocusing on the head and shoulders back hips and striding legs of the tail no need to be scared just imagine im holding your hand mister had said it seemed to unfold so slowly in front of maggie she started to shout into the microphone clipped to her blouse incoherent shed said to him that if he insisted on going through with this ludicrous unprofessional surveillance procedure shed only be a part of it if he listened and bloody close all the time to his earpiece she yelled and the white mitsubishi was going faster and closing on him but his stride speed never altered a young woman with a pram and her shopping in plastic bags balanced on it had passed mister and walked towards joey maggie could see through which gap the mitsubishi would go it was going too fast for it to be a shooting hit the distance between her van and joey for the earpiece to pick up her screamed warnings was too great he should back off take cover dive he should she hit the van horn smashed her clenched fist down on it again and again beat a tattoo with it the woman with the pram and the shopping was near him the mitsubishi lurched as the nearside wheels bounced on the kerb skidded on the grass found grip then aimed for the gap the cacophony of the horn dinned in her cab and joey stopped turned beside him frozen petrified was the woman with the pram maggie saw joey throw himself at the woman and she fell away from him the pram toppling over her shopping scattering the edge of the mitsubishis fender caught him no pain but he felt himself tossed upwards and he thought he floated no sound as the flank of the vehicle swept past him he fell the breath was driven out of his body and everything around him was blurred joey lay on the wet grass the damp from it seeping into his clothes and he gasped the woman picked herself up righted her pram and scooped up the shopping strewn around him she never looked at him when he squinted screwed his eyes together he thought he could make out the shock on her face she said not a word merely scurried away pushing the pram along the pavement he thought he had saved her life and her babys life and her shopping but she had nothing to say to him then the pain spilled in him a man came past him going towards the city and didnt look down at him two youths smoking went by him going away from the city and seemed not to see him was he invisible to them as they hurried on their different ways fuck you he mouthed he groped on the grass for his spectacles found them bent arms but the lenses intact he put them on wedged them at a clowns angle on his nose the pain ran through his leg and hip far down the road the mitsubishi slowed to a stop and mister disappeared into it then it was gone lost in the speed of the traffic only tyremarks on the grass showed what had happened he crawled to a tripod of stakes holding erect a young tree and tried to pull himself up but couldnt the van swept over the kerb and onto the grass from the windows of two black mercedes faces peered at him shallow outlines against the smoked glass of the windows and ducked away when he caught their gaze maggie ran from the van came to him and knelt he thought irrationally that she didnt have to get her knees wet and her tights dirty on the mud in the grass are you all right i think i am my leg hurts you tried to climb up i saw you against the tree i couldnt if youd really hurt yourself you wouldnt have been able to get halfway up the tree not if youd done a bone youve a great bedside way he tried to kill me but he didnt thats the point she reached over him and put her hand into the tear rip of his jeans that ran from the faded knee to the hip her fingers gripped at his bone and the flesh covering it shed the sensitivity he thought of one of those old seenitall veterinary surgeons who had come to the estate and were taken by his father to see a lame heifer or a limping ewe she straightened i dont think anythings broken you were lucky i expect itll bruise up quite prettily joey flared you were supposed to be watching my bloody back i wouldnt have had to be lucky if youd been awake what about the goddam radio he saw a small blood smear on her hand as she wiped it with her handkerchief didnt you hear me he shook his head she looked around a frown settled on the delicacy of her forehead her gaze fastened on the ptt building back up the road and the antenna forest on the roof the tilted mushroom dishes joey said oh thats good radio interference too many spikes and bowls useful for you to know that when you get back be able to do something about that in the lab wont you its very pleasing to know ive contributed to pushing along the frontiers of science so when did you cut your hand a discovery fourwheel drive pulled on to the kerb and the grass behind her a man peered at her as if seeking confirmation she said quietly must have done it on the wheel when i was hitting the horn the man was angular sallow and his suit hung loosely off him isnt that maggie isnt that the lovely maggie bolton pride of the probe terror of the bug technicians you got a problem darling pardon my french mr cann but people like you are just a fucking nuisance here and interfere he introduced himself as benjamin curwin she called him benjie joey recognized him as one of the group of optimists around her at the ambassadors commonwealth day drinks session when shed worn the little black dress benjie had invited them in insisted on it he worked from the united nations mission for bosniaherzegovina building two hundred yards up the road from where it had happened black coffee and a whisky generously poured into a crystal tumbler for joey and a seat on a sofa where he could examine the rent in his trousers and feel the start of an aching stiffness and an opportunity for them first to flirttalk then slide to nostalgia it was goodolddays time ignored and with bitterness rising joey thought that he was in the heartland of the men drafted in to run a country and it was all so bloody smug theyd gone through an outer office where secretaries had swooned with respect for a fatcat hero benjie benjamin wiped the mud off maggies knees his hand hovering over her thigh and they gossiped about times when the secret intelligence service was run by officers not bloody accountants the brilliant days when the enemy was behind a curtain of minefields and fences armed guards and dogs hed said and shed agreed that present managements idea of a good day was lopping fifteen per cent off the lisbon desk heads entertainment budget what a bloody scandal joey had finished his coffee swilled down his scotch and coughed hard like he had work on his plate maggie had told benjie benjamin what had happened on the road and why im sure its useful for me to have your opinion joey said you can

this city you understand nothing the eagle says you bottled out mister said calmly hed had an hour to prepare his response atkins had taken mister and the eagle back to the holiday inn had dropped them there then followed the new procedure hed driven the mitsubishi with the slight dent on the front nearside fender to the warehouse compound had been let inside and left it there then walked up to the road and waved down a taxi to return him to the hotel hed thought his job was to escort the missile launchers and the communications equipment into the city demonstrate their capabilities and act as the trusted interpreter killing had not been in the brief at the hotel he joined mister and the eagle in the coffeeshop the eagle gazed ahead of him past atkinss shoulder atkins blurted i dont know how he can give an opinion he was crapping himself and had his eyes closed he was only telling me what he thought i pay him to tell me what he thinks i did not bottle out very pleased to hear that atkins atkins couldnt read the man there was no menace in the voice no inflection that would create fear mister spoke as if in gentle conversation he thought of himself as being in an interview room alone with two detectives and a taperecorders spools turning the detective who led would have said it was an attempt at murder an attempt to kill a member of her majestys customs and excise if you didnt like the idea werent on board why didnt you refuse the detective at the back would have slapped a fist into a hand for emphasis and said dont give us bullshit about coercion maybe those detectives maybe everybody else had never heard mister speak quietly misters eyes were mesmeric he could not escape them he said feebly i did the best i could wasnt a very good best was it he blustered i had him all lined up i was going for him then beside him was this woman with a pram he dived towards her the cowardly shit used her to cover himself i dont kill women or babies if id gone after him id have hit the woman and the pram with the baby did she come out of a manhole push the cover up and lift the pram through it was there a manhole in the pavement she popped up i didnt see her coming i was just looking for him i didnt have any help from eagle if his eyes had been open and he hadnt been busy wetting himself he could have called the woman and the pram for me i hit the target just a glance but a hit if it had been a full hit head on then i would have taken out the woman and the pram im not having killing women and babies on my conscience ill look after your conscience atkins i look after a lot of peoples consciences its the way it was atkinss voice was a shrill whine do i criticize you calm down have a biscuit he didnt want a biscuit but he took one held it in his hand and trembled it cracked in his grip he didnt want to look into misters eyes but he couldnt look away there was no light in the eyes they had the quality of death he knew that one day he would stumble through an explanation to two detectives in an interview room and they would not believe him and they would ask again and again why he had not walked away he was misters toy and toys could be thrown away he was expendable napoleon had said to metternich in you cant stop me i spend thirty thousand men a month im sorry atkins said and despised himself you sent that two things and youd better remember them joey i dont work for your crowd and its not my intention to go home in a box you said it would be interesting do i quote correctly maggie bridled and i was wrong im not so arrogant that i cant admit when im wrong she switched off the small screen he felt betrayed she wound back the tape the picture on the screen shed marched him from his room to the van and made him squat in the back beside the bucket and watch it was good quality it was now he believed her in london it would be watched each second of it the white mitsubishi reduced to monochrome veering out of the slow lane heaving onto the grass cutting a line towards joey a woman and a pram him throwing himself at her and she said you shouldnt worry theyll all say youre a proper little hero she asked him for frank williamss number and he gave it to her didnt question why she wanted it im going to find a bar that is being utterly pathetic maggie accused he slammed the van door shut on her a biker couriered the tape across the thames and along the embankment from ceausescu towers to the custom house the package was delivered into the hands of the pa to the chief investigation officer the instruction was given that there should be no interruptions and the cassette was fed into corks vcr he settled in a comfortable chair and watched the screen gough had been called from the sierra quebec golf room the meeting into which the summons had broken had reached the detailed stage where personnel were allocated to the raids he planned search warrants had been drafted in preparation for submission to a magistrate for approval largescale ordnance survey maps fastened with tacks to the walls reproduced the streets of the fulham district of west london an area of the surrey countryside and a section of roads immediately to the south of the capitals north circular but the call had come from on high and the meeting was suspended hed stood behind the comfortable chair cork said he had already seen the relevant part of the tape twice but had not told him what it showed gough had his pipe unlit in his mouth watching the picture gave him a curious sensation of noninvolvement of distance it was a feeling dougie gough always experienced when he viewed surveillance tapes he was not a footman never had been he was an organizer an administrator a decisiontaker and a strategist his skills were considered by his superiors too great for him to pound pavements or idle in cars he sent men and women out and he listened to and read through their reports when they came back from the field and he felt would never have shown it envy he peered hard at the screen the tape was mute far from the camera joey cann sat on a rubbish bin and his heels kicked its concrete sides he remembered the young man hesitant yet defiant but committed the cameras eye pitched gough halfway across the mass of europe to a wide road that ran between tower buildings and walled warehouses he had no concept of sarajevo but he was carried there by the lens and it seemed to him that he stood now within hailing distance of cann men women and children passed the camera front on and back on and dougie gough could have reached out and tapped their shoulders he was transported there no attempt at concealment cann sat in full view then dropped off the rubbish bin and walked towards the camera eye the lens zoomed on him dougie gough saw tight lips the muscles clenched hard in his cheeks the jutting chin and recognized the tension in him twice cann glanced behind him but kept walking the third time he turned cann spun his body and retraced his walk the camera panned wide dougie gough had watched surveillance tapes of albert william packer and seen enough telephoto stills of his target one the two men walked away separated by a distance of around a hundred yards he never saw the face of target one dougie gough felt a little winnow of excitement everything he had read been told was that his target one employed cunning and great care to avoid surveillance the camera jerked the picture wavered as the vehicle in which it was mounted edged forward basic precautions had been discarded on both sides but gough did not understand why cann kept to the same stride the same pace as the man ahead a vehicle came by the camera a white fourwheel drive he saw it and forgot it he had lost the two men packer and cann behind three lorries in convoy he started to look at the tower blocks and was matching them to those on the outskirts of glasgow beside the m motorway as the lorries cleared the view of target one and sqg he realized that the platform for the camera had sped forward gone frantic he felt his teeth tighten on the pipes stem he wanted to shout out yell a warning the white fourwheel drive came off the road cann turned dougie gough saw the woman and the pram cann was the target it happened quickly the camera lost focus the vehicle masked cann the woman and the pram before it was wrenched away he saw the woman on the ground cann close to her and the pram overturned he said a little prayer a begging plea he could have shouted in relief as he saw cann roll over and the woman was pushing herself up then righting the pram the focus on the camera was regained as maggie bolton ran into picture and knelt beside cann dougie gough had never lost an executive officer killed or injured in three decades with the church he had never thought it remotely likely he would lose a man it had been so fast cork cut the picture and the screen went to snowstorm gough took out his matches and lit his pipe the smoke cloud hid the screen cork passed him a single sheet of paper he read to endicott room vbx from bolton technical support sarajevo subject organized crimeawp timed local security classification secret message starts see enclosed tape my c ampe comrade survived unhurt a murder attempt organized this am by target one vehicle used driven by target three yesterday unreported to c ampe my comrade showed out on surveillance of target one and a subsequent telephone call from his girlfriend jennifer martin address not known reported her cat killed disembowelled and dumped on her doorstep comrades concern is that he will be called home following the show out my bug in target ones hotel room was removed and the vehicle fitted with my beacon was destroyed i am exposed and without basic security i request immediate pull out luv maggie message ends gough handed back the sheet of paper i cant say im pleased at this development cork intoned theyre going to bring her home its not a matter for discussion its their decision and theyve taken it havent you anything to say dougie gough acid in his voice said beyond reminding you it was your order that he travelled not a lot he should come home shouldnt he before its you know too late if thats what you w a n t i want your advice cork railed at him whats the alternative put in a team of half a dozen drop a special forces section alongside them for close protection hack into a budget i dont have god ive a minister on my back what do i do mr gough you do not offer kneejerk interference cork ignored the impertinence wouldnt have if it had been offered by any other man or woman in the building the buck stops on my desk you leave running the operation to me if anything happens to him ill be crucified if my maker will excuse a vile blasphemy mr cork ill expect to be on the cross next to you id like to think about it he already had gough left the room and his feet stamped hard down the corridor down the stairs and down another corridor he lit his pipe sucked hard on it and the smoke clouds billowed behind him there was that look on dougie goughs face that warned off any of the senior higher or executive officers who passed him in the corridors or on the stairs from telling him that the custom house was a protected nosmoking zone he made his way back to the room used by the sierra quebec golf team had there been mirrors on those corridors had he looked at them he would have seen a reflected image older of course of the face on the tape canns lips cheek muscles chin tension and commitment he tapped the numbers into the pad and went into the room they all looked at him ten of them and awaited the explanation as to why he had been called away right gentlemen ladies where were we december the rain fell hard had done so each day that week he did not know it but again the mines moved carried in the rivulets that ran from the slopes above his fields some were buried deeper in the silt brought down but others had been washed out of the ground and were exposed husein bekir would not have known that he was responsible for the shifting life of the mines by setting fire to the fields two years back he had killed the grass roots that held the soil he had released the ground from the binding roots and facilitated the movement his fatherless grandchildren walked with him down the track towards the swollen ford with the englishman who had come from mostar they he reflected between shouts towards the house across the bunica river were the strong ones it was nine months since their fathers death but they had seemed to mourn him for only a day not for weeks as he and lila had not for months as his daughter had he called for his friend dragan kovac and the children echoed his shouts as if it were a game skipped and ran ahead of him and the englishman the foreigner said his name was barnaby and he spoke huseins language but nothing of what he said was welcome the children were strong and did not act out roles as victims husein bekir hoped that one day his grandchildren would know nothing of a war and would farm his fields in the valley the englishman had arrived unannounced had come to vraca with his driver his grandchildren were like all those in the village of their age they were thin weedy skinny they had no muscle on them and no sinew in their arms the strength was not in their bodies but in their minds they could dismiss the memory of their father but they could not lift a hay bale when husein had been the age of his grandson he could work outside all day and every day of the school holidays and during termtime before school and after it finished in the afternoons the sight of them steeled the determination of husein bekir that he must fight in whatever time was left to him to have the valley cleared so that good meat was produced and good vegetables to build the bodies of his grandchildren if their bodies were not built then they could never farm the land if they did not farm the land it would be sold off what generations of the family had achieved put together with sweat would be sold in an hour to a stranger perhaps to a serb there had been a meeting that week in sarajevo it was more than twenty years since husein bekir had been in sarajevo then it had been a long journey by bus for him to travel to the distant city for the wedding of the son of a blood cousin of lila he had not enjoyed it and hed thanked his god when the bus had pulled clear of the city and the day before and in the evening at the wedding feast he had been treated by lilas cousins as a peasant none of them owned land they worked in the states factories he had thirty hectares paid for on his own side of the bunica river and nineteen hectares of the finest fields on the far side and two hectares of vineyard also paid for he had no debts they had regarded him as a person without value when it had left sarajevo the bus had gone past the marshal tito barracks and he could recall them barnaby said that the meeting had taken place at the mineaction centre in the barracks he called to dragan kovac as a last resort in the hope that his friends argument might change the message brought from sarajevo the rain spat down on him and plastered the hair of his grandchildren to their scalps he saw dragan kovac at his door sheltering under his porch and he heard a muffled answering shout he waved for him to come to the ford they had played chess in the summer five times dragan kovac would never come down the track cross the ford and walk to husein bekirs home always husein had to go to his house to wade through the ford and back again in the dark with the brandy swilling in his belly and five times the fool or the cheat had beaten husein bekir he saw dragan kovac emerge from the porch and he was wearing his old coat the cetniks coat and he had on his old cap with the eagle over the peak the fool the old fool stomped down the track towards them the country had been ruined by war the valley was filled with mines and he wore his uniform as if it still gave him importance they waited dragan kovac came slowly stopped twice and leaned on his stick before starting again husein bekir did not need a stick to help him walk this is barnaby he is an englishman from sarajevo he is from the mineaction centre he wants to know about the mines you put in my ground put because we were attacked is your memory slipping old man we did not put in any mines because you put mines down i cannot farm my fields to keep criminals away i told him that dragan kovac was senile and would remember nothing they both spat at the ground in front of their boots it was their ritual the grandchildren were throwing stones into the river the englishman was laughing he was a big man dwarfed husein bekir and he had a fine bearing a good stature and the appearance of a military man heavy binoculars hung from his neck he saw the old fool stiffen to attention and heard him bark a greeting i am dragan kovac sir i am retired police sergeant kovac may i be of help maybe maybe not mr kovac i was explaining to mr bekir that we had a meeting yesterday at the mineaction centre at which a number of mineclearance proposals were considered right from the start i do not wish to raise false hopes we have a list of thirteen thousand six hundred minefields in the country of which onetenth are in neretva canton here but we try to look most closely at locations where direct hardship is caused by polluted ground where a farmer cannot work or where there have been casualties because you had a death here you are on that list today i was in mostar and it wasnt a long journey to come up here just to see the ground i was hoping you might remember where the mines were laid and dont bluster husein interjected give the gentleman facts i laid no mines dragan kovac jutted his jaw the war is over were not talking about blame barnaby said i work with muslims serbs and croats as the consultant to both governments i dont recognize flags but neither do mines recognize the difference between soldiers and children i have to know how many mines were laid and over how wide an area if i have that information i can estimate only roughly how many deminers will be needed how long it will take and how much it will cost do you remember dragan kovac shook his head looked up at the rainclouds scratched his ear it is very hard i was not here all the time after they attacked and tried to kill us husein bekir said you see i told you the old fool remembers nothing the englishman had his binoculars up and gazed over the fields i can see the bones of cattle out there extraordinary how long bones survive before they rot down and theyre in the middle of the fields its not surprising but its a bad indication the middle of the fields is not where the mines would have been buried it means theyve moved rain like this shifts them people shift them foxes its hard to believe will pick up a small antipersonnel device thats exposed carry it off and put it down a hundred metres away then theres more rain and its covered over even where there were correctly made maps they cannot be relied upon the minefield is an organism it breathes it has a pulse there could be ten there could be a hundred its a big area it would take many men and much money and the difficulties of one farmer are not a priority i dont know i want to help b u t dragan kovac shrugged when will you come husein bekir tugged the englishmans sleeve not soon i apologize for dragging you out on a filthy day it certainly will not be next year husein bekir stood at his full height and gazed at the englishmans face if i and my wife my daughter and my grandchildren all my neighbours my animals and my dog make a line walk across my fields if we all step on a mine and we are all killed would you come then more quickly would that make you come we will come i promise it to both of you when we can we can only do so much joey pushed himself up from behind the wall of beer bottles that stretched across his table his legs were rubber soft and gave as he lurched from the table he grabbed the leatherjacket shoulder of a youth was cursed and shoved away he set his sights on the door to the street and swayed as he moved towards his target the last time he had been drunk incapable and it was hard with a fuddled mind to remember it had been on his fifteenth birthday which had clashed on the estate with the final afternoon of the harvest the tractor men and the baling men had seen the fun of it and had poured rough cider down his throat which they could handle but he could not theyd brought him home to his mother then driven away abandoning him to her piercing anger and shed not let him in the house before hed thrown up into the silage pit hed wrecked what should have been a special dinner hed been alone spinning in his bed while his mother and father had eaten the dinner with his empty chair for company he stood in the doorway propped against the jamb and saw a shrunken bowed man go past the glass front disappear beyond it the man pushed a wheelchair a young woman was in the wheelchair it wasnt the night cold that sobered him a man had said you havent have you compromised him joey ran after judge delic and jasmina ran until he caught them chapter twelve he heard the knock on the door over the noise of the shower it was the time the laundry usually came back he shouted from the bathroom that he would be a moment he was towelling himself dry he could have asked the maid to leave the laundry outside the door but hed also given her his shoes for cleaning and he wanted to thank her and tip her when she returned them mister fastened one towel around his waist and looped a second over his shoulders picked up loose change from the desk and went to the door i le opened it and reached out his hand with the fist of coins i surprise you she rolled her eyes i apologize miss holberg i thought you were the maid he blushed forgive me he saw the sparkle in her face its cleanness and the fun in her im not in a state to receive a distinguished visitor it is wrong of me not to have telephoned from reception i did not because i am devious and i thought it would provide you with an opportunity to refuse me she said that the next morning the vip visitors would go to the village of visnjica it was a onehour drive from the city she would be honoured if he would agree to accompany her she understood that he was shy of personal publicity and that she both respected and admired this his name would not be given to the visitors or to the villagers but he would have the opportunity to see for himself the value of his generosity in bringing the bosnia with love lorry to sarajevo it was to be an important day for her and it would be further fulfilled if he would accompany her assuming of course that he did not have more important business in the city she hoped very much that he could accept id like that mister said im flattered im delighted to accept she said she would pick him up in the morning told him what he should wear not towels her laughter gently mocking him and wished him a good evening a minute after shed gone the maid brought his laundry and his dried polished shoes he whistled as he dressed it was all compartments he forgot the princess his wife and in a compartment further recessed in his mind was the man who should have been killed on the grass beside the pavement you no longer have the mentality of a customs officer i wonder if i ever had it you have become a competitor the judge said drily i am joey cann the competitor who loses they had brought him to their home he had helped to push the chair across the bridge and up the steep hill between lines of apartment buddings wrecked by artillery firegutted and covered by a rash of bullet holes the narrow width of the road would have been the front line there were no lights above them or in the open windows they made their way by torch beam shining it down in front of the chairs wheels so that they did not hit debris and jolt her and hed wondered how the judge pushed his daughter up that hill each evening they had turned into a narrower street and he had seen a heavy concrete mass what had been the front of the third floor of a block hanging threateningly over them but she hadnt looked up at it and neither had the judge the beam had been aimed at a house it was half a building one storey and half a ruin a door and a window were intact the left side of the house had fallen away joey saw the snippedoff rafters and wallpaper was exposed still showing a pattern of pink flowers the beam flickered on to three old pallets covered by a length of sheet metal to make a ramp for the chair when the door was opened he had stayed outside and emptied the beer from his bladder he had gone inside he had to talk and purge himself the room was lit with an oil lamp the walls were dark with damp stains and cracks ran in the plaster there was a cooker attached by a pipe to a liquidgas barrel and a sink with clean plates on a drainingboard they had no refrigerator and no electric fire there were worn rugs on bare boards it was a place of penury they gave him wine from an opened bottle and he sipped it sparingly because it tasted foul because he did not need to drink more because he thought it all they had to offer a guest she never interrupted her father but wheeled herself round the table to a cupboard and back and filled a sandwich for him he had been given a place on a sofa that was covered by a blanket and propped up by old books he thought the judges need to speak was greater than his own the judge sat on a low bed we live mr cann in an olympic city citius altius fortius but there was another motto of the games we read about it as we prepared ourselves to welcome the world in london was the host there was a service at your great cathedral st pauls and the bishop of pennsylvania was invited to preach to the congregation sitting there listening to the bishop was the founder of the modern olympics pierre de coubertin we are told that what de coubertin heard thrilled him the important thing in the olympic games is not so much to have been victorious as to have taken part not every man can win i have been a loser enough times joey said he felt the cold around him but it would have been rude for him the guest to shiver or pity himself till the summer he thought they would live in the house in their coats i call him i told you target one he has been too many times a winner am i a loser joey said simply believed it you are a man of dignity you are not a loser and jasmina with a broken back she has no mother she has no carer but me it is uncertain what is her future when i am dead is she a loser she has selfrespect she is not a loser may i tell you a story about what obsesses you mr cann a story of a winner and a loser i am in your home you may tell me what you want jasmina gave him the sandwich he did not know whether she wanted the story told or not her pale cheeks sunken set eyes and her mouth no lipstick were without expression the story has many characters but at the end of it there was one winner and one loser is it the story that is not to be told to a stranger about blood that story mr cann i broke my rule on involvement and you have told me that because of you my involvement may be known and i should take precautions very frankly few are possible you should know why i became involved helped you please he strained to listen and to hold concentration against the waves of nausea my wife maria jasminas mother was dead she had a backroom administration post at the bosnia hotel but when she was killed she was another mother and wife out in the streets and parks scavenging it had rained in the morning and she had come to the jewish cemetery near to here to add to the snails she had collected if you can find enough snails and take them out of their shells and you can boil water you can make soup she was killed by a snipers bullet we had been married for twentyone years jasmina was nineteen my wife maria was buried in the football pitch of the stadium i could have left the city but to turn your back on your wifes grave is i promise you difficult i went on with my work as a teacher in law at the university jasmina the only jewel left in my life was my student we managed she had a boyfriend mirko another of my students a serb what we muslims call a cetnik in the war at first it was possible for serb men to remain in sarajevo but later it became hard and soon it was impossible there was hysteria they were thought to be spies for the enemy jasmina and mirko were in love as i and her mother had been they had pledged to spend their lives together as we had i blessed them i said they should go escape the madness there was a telephone engineer who before the war i defended on a charge of killing while driving my defence was successful he went free he was a rogue he should have gone to prison he said that if he could ever repay me he would the telephone link from the main ptt building was cut when the fighting started but the engineer kept one line open to grbavica it was possible if you waited and if you paid to use the line first you called and asked the serb operator to pass a message for the person you would speak with to come to the subexchange in grbavica at a certain time on a certain day the day came the time you spoke to them the engineer is now a wealthy man he does not have to work mirko with my money made the calls and asked relatives on that side to help him if he came over to leave the country the guarantee was given but how to go over there was the tunnel at the airport it was impossible to use it the military had it the government and they rented it to the gangsters to caco celo and serif they paid two thousand dms an hour to use it they brought in sugar coffee cigarettes alcohol everything for the black market but between the military and the gangsters there was a stranglehold on the use of the tunnel i heard there was one other way i went to see serif it was an agony to me to go to see such a man i have to say it was because i loved my child and she loved her boy he named the price of course we did not have such money the price was five thousand american dollars for him and three thousand american dollars for the gangsters on the other side i sold everything i had that was of material and sentimental value my wifes jewellery the ring i had given her and the ring she had given me even the watch on my wrist that had been my fathers and a loan from relatives and i mortgaged my pension everything went to pay the thug for jasminas and mirkos freedom i remember the evening i will never forget it she took a small sports bag and mirko had a little rucksack it was all they owned they had such confidence in a new world their new life away from the killing when we came near to the bridge i was told to stay back i kissed them both i saw serif she had the money all we could raise and she gave it him and he seemed to sneer because it was so little to him and so much to us i heard him say to her that all the arrangements were made they went away into the darkness they were to cross the miljacka river at the vrbanja bridge it was the no mans land between the front lines they were desperate as i was so we took on trust what we were told i imagined every stride they took towards the bridge i heard the shots there were two long bursts of automatic gunfire as if one for each of them first it was serifs men who held me back then the police came and they prevented me from going to the bridge french troops came to the ends of the bridge but they would not go forward because i heard it a week later they considered it too dangerous they were on the bridge jasmina and mirko through the night at dawn a ukrainian army corporal drove by and saw them he walked onto the bridge the french told him to stop but he refused the serbs on the other side told him to go back but he would not he brought them back carried them one under each of his arms i never learned his name was never able to thank him their lives were saved in the kosevo hospital mirko had stomach wounds his shoulder was damaged and he cannot run my jasmina my jewel was paralysed a year afterwards there was another shooting on the vrbanja bridge what the foreign pressmen called the romeo and juliet shooting when two similar lovers paid to cross and they both died were betrayed but their bodies were on the bridge for many days exposed to the elements and to the foreign tv everybody knows about them but jasmina and mirko were only another statistic of the injured you will want to know what happened to their romance mirko is now in vienna and has studied to be an architect we have no jewellery and my pension belongs to the bank i took part as the bishop said in london that i should i lost and jasmina lost yes mr cann while she was in the hospital while i did not know whether she would live or die i went to visit ismet mujic serif he refused to return the money and refused to take responsibility for the betrayal he said that if i came near him again or made trouble for him he would set his dogs on me and that he would see to it i never worked again he had that power it is the symptom of the loser you might find it hard to believe it of me but for nine years i have cultivated a wish to be avenged there is something in our faith that tells us one day however long in the future the chance of vengeance comes you walked in your innocence through my door i told you that the man found in the r i v e r he was murdered joey said through the last mouthful of the sandwich he was hit then thrown over the bridge was linked to ismet mujic serif it was when i thought for the first time in long years that i could be the winner citius altius fortius could run faster than him jump higher be stronger could crush him i discarded the mentality of a judge threw off the uniform joey drained the last of the wine in his glass became the competitor demanded to win it is very human it is the way we are to gain respect for myself at the expense of charity it is not a time for mercy it is a passion to me joey said we learned about it at school shylock the jewish moneylender in the merchant of venice said the villainy you teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction promise nothing but my best that at the end it is we who are standing joey cann left them stumbled away down the street he thought that a father would be helping a crippled daughter to prepare for bed he fell twice but picked himself up and went on into the night he was humbled he crossed the bridge where she had been shot and the dream had been lost and headed towards the hotel he heard his own words and wondered if they were just the beers brave talk he wore no uniform the id in his wallet he thought was worthless if he was the loser he would not be left standing for their sakes they ate off bone china mister was their honoured guest his reputation had travelled with him from green lanes to sarajevo the villa was on a hillside and faced west over the city the introductions had been made in front of a blazing log fire serif and the men who had sat with him at the negotiations were there the older man with his superior announced as a brigadier in the intelligence agency the younger man showing deference to his uncle the politician the villa was the politicians if it had been damaged by war repairs had been made there was no sign of the war only of the affluence and the influence mister was not interested in the display of wealth but while the talk eddied around him he glanced at the photographs on one wall showing the politician always wearing a quiet suit meeting visitors to the city on the outside steps of buildings cocooned in flak jackets and with military helmets on their heads serif did not speak but lounged in a carver chair at the end of a long oak table on which bounced reflections from the candles flames the politician and the brigadier spoke rarely and conversation was maintained by the nephew and the junior officer there was no smalltalk mister listened which was his talent and he watched and learned which was his skill while he listened he looked to understand the relationship between serif and the politician if serif were the subordinate he would have spoken mister thought he assumed everything around him the luxury of the furniture the drapes the paintings the glasses on the table the food served came to the politician from serif he was told of a meeting that would take place in four or five days where he would meet partners and that invitations to them had been sent he replied with a shrug that if the business were important he had the time to give and he was told of a problem and his help was asked and he said that he was always anxious to help a friend in difficulty he drank nothing they would all have known of the death of the cruncher and he wondered which of them had sanctioned it and which of them would suffer when they talked of the meeting he smiled at them and smiled again when they told him of their problem he thought he was at the top table a player in the league where he wanted to be he was alert on guard but he felt himself wallowing in selfinduced satisfaction he had arrived where he wanted to be the eagle would be with him for the meeting and atkins could solve their problem he was treated with due respect and that was precious to him atkins came into the restaurant which was empty but for the table where the eagle sat i thought i was late but ive beaten him in not joining us where is he been whisked away to dine with the great and the good the eagle grimaced i thankfully was not included in the invitation i thought i was late do you fancy something slightly better there are decent restaurants in sarajevo ive already ordered you go off if you want to but atkins sat down and a waiter sprinted forward to offer him the menu the same as the previous night and the night before that and he chose soup and the schnitzel as he had the previous night and the night before he had been lying on his bed without the light on the curtains undrawn in the gloom and had been thinking pondering about the two or three inches by which he had missed the responsibility for the murder of a customs officer a good choice what im having the eagle said w e l l well what whos going to tell him i dont follow you who is going to tell him that its time we quit a liltle smile flickered on the eagles face quite a big speech atkins felt a reckless calm will you tell him i hadnt planned to me do you leave it to me the new boy on the block we were guilty of attempted murder the eagles open hands were up as if to display the purity of innocence i wasnt you were i dont recall driving the vehicle whats going to be asked of us next how long are we stuck here i didnt reckon on kicking my heels in and out thats what i thought christ knows whats next on his list for us then you should tell him youve had enough would you back me atkins hissed across the table that is a very difficult question are you with me or against me the eagles lips pursed the answer was whispered in principle with you damn you not fucking principle for me or against i would have to say that im beginning to feel we have overstayed the very limited welcome shown to us do i have work in london that would better employ me yes would i prefer to be at home and eating my dinner quietly yes would i pick a fight with mister rubbish his ideas at the moment he believes he stands on the threshold of triumph that poses a difficult question i know how difficult are you always this fucking spineless the eagle smiled the same sad tired smile i doubt youve seen him crossed it is not a pleasant sight i am told that grown men confronted with a view of it are prone to lose control of their bladders its fatuous to refer to spine i walk out on him or you do or we both do and where do we go home to our loved ones back to living our lives without him and without his money he has a long arm do we live in the company of a battalion of paratroops youd be in a gutter id be down on a pavement in blood in pain he always hurts first its the message he likes to send atkins not playacting said simply im frightened arent we all im being sucked down so are you will you back me support me a clear answer there is rarely a right moment to gainsay mister if such a moment arises yes that moment is not now do you think we can try to enjoy our meal the waiter brought the soup the vegetables floating in it carrot and celery leek and parsnip had all been sliced into small pieces atkins gazed at them and wondered at the sharpness of the knife that had cut them the computers had the power to dig into the registrations of births property sales electoral rolls incometax returns counciltax lists and telephone numbers the trace was done by sqg and handed to dougie gough you can go home now gough said i appreciate you staying on home for sqg was a single room in a guesthouse behind kings cross terminus far from her husband and kids in the manchester suburbs he dismissed her because he did not wish his call to be overheard he trusted nobody not even those he had picked with his own hand he never quoted it to a second person but dougie gough lived as a senior investigation officer on the maxim of an irish judge who had said in the condition upon which god hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance john philpot curran had spoken for him he thought it a reasonable assumption that a young woman in terror would not have run to a work friend or a college colleague but to her mother the track through the computers records by sqg gave him the telephone number of the parents of jennifer martin he waited until the room was empty then dialled the message sifting in his mind should not be shared could i speak to miss jennifer martin please i do apologize for disturbing you at this late hour is she reluctant to take my call could you tell her that it is douglas gough and that i run the team sierra quebec golf for which joey cann works thank you so much he waited he had had little doubt that cann would have told his girl something of the back ground to his work on the packer investigation all the men and women senior and junior on the class a teams used wives husbands and partners as crutches to lean on a small voice answered the telephone his reply purred was reassuring so good of you to come to the phone may i call you jennifer i may thank you i heard about your pet and i want you to know that i am deeply shocked and sincerely sympathetic both joey and i work in a dark corner of our society most of that society ignores the darkness doesnt feel its their business to illuminate it or to get involved go to any multiscreen complex in any city and you can guarantee there will be a flashy gangster apology to be seen those films portray a glamorous fraudulent image of the men we target the films do our society a disservice the men they depict are not jack the lad they are leeches they are evil foul bastards forgive me if i sound emotional but joey will have told you that ive sent him on a mission that i regard as of critical importance the measure of his success so far and the mission is not yet completed is that packer has struck back at what he thinks is joeys weak point you i am taking a great liberty in asking it of you you are not a lawenforcement officer although you are a citizen but i want you to stay where you are its shropshire isnt it i want you to stay there not break cover not use the telephone not contact joey im asking you to be brave i think youre up to i t im going to give you a telephone number to call it you have any suspicions that you are watched call it night or day youre important to me jennifer and i need your cooperation can i rely on you she sounded what his wife would call a decent girl he gave the number of his own mobile phone he wished her well he switched off the rooms lights and the door locked after him those who worked with him would not have expected a flicker of sentiment from dougie gough he hadnt wanted a frightened girlfriends calls to sarajevo to distract joey cann from work in hand he had not spoken of a murder attempt or of the withdrawal by the secret intelligence service of one half of canns partnership he walked along the empty corridor and remembered the picture of cann from the video kicking his heels in an act of bloodyminded defiance against the concrete of the rubbish bin it was cann who had said that the weakest link was mister albert william packer and hed liked what hed heard he recognized obsession and thought it valuable if channelled but dangerous if not he believed with cann alongside him that he stood at the threshold of success was the obsession compulsive enough to hold fast he must check its strength he felt no shame for sweettalking the young woman and he would lie again before the night was over he lay on his back on his bed and he thought of jasminas face he had gone past maggies room and the dark strip under the door had told him her light was off hed paused and heard her tossing in her bed and hed gone to his room the note had been on the pillow joey my crowd are pulling me out they and me say its not worth the candle sorry you should be with me its the early bird for zagreb there are seats on it where were you tonight i waited up we should have talked about it pride never won anything im leaving at on the dot be there luv maggie he thought of her strength and what she went through each day to keep that strength he was humbled by her what he would do was for her he wanted to push her in her wheelchair in a park among flowers where birds sang and share her strength he would go for her wherever the road went wherever it led may the sun shone on the valley the scene in front of dragan kovac was a picture of beauty it was impossible for him looking from the porch of his home to recall the war the village of ljut was behind him and he could not see the wreckage of the houses across the fields and over the river small columns of smoke rose from vraca but his eyesight was too weak for him to distinguish which buildings were repaired and which were abandoned as derelict he saw the carpet blanket of the flowers that were the sign of the coming summer specks pockets and expanses of blue pink yellow the sun fell on him and warmed his bones he was a meticulous man as the police sergeant the core of his life had been based on careful planning and thorough preparation he had risen early he had made his bed and swept through the room that doubled for living and sleeping cleaned it and then he had carried out the small table from inside and placed it on the stone flags under the porch roof it would be hot later he put the table where the porch shade would cover it and then he brought out two strong wooden chairs and manoeuvred them on the uneven stone so that they were firmly set he went back in for the chess set and the board brought them out he spread the board and laid out the pieces he always felt a little shimmer of pleasure when he handled them they had been carved by his father from oak the legacy passed to him from his fathers deathbed given to him seven months after his father had come home from the partizans with the festering leg wound from a german machinegun bullet he had been twelve years old and he had promised his father that he would value the set king queen bishops pawns all were freshly painted each year with linseed and had been for fiftyfive years the largest pieces those of greatest importance were twenty centimetres high those of least worth were ten centimetres it was a fine set and it was a worry to him that the future of their ownership was not yet determined the grandson of his friend had a good childs face intelligent serious dragan kovac had no son of his own no nephew no child that he could be certain would respect the chess set he set out the pieces then brought an old glass ashtray to the table it had been on his desk in the police station for more than twenty years and it had disappeared from there on the evening of his retirement he had his last two remain ing unbroken glasses for the brandy it was all done with exactness and pride he looked at the river and already the shimmer of the heat was on it each day of the previous week it had dropped and he could finally see the silver speckle of the ford the old fool would make an easy crossing and they would play their first game of the summer hed had a pain in his chest that morning more an ache than a pain and it had worried him he thought he would take the opportunity that day to speak with the old fool his friend about the grandchild and about the chess set he had no spectacles it would have been hard for him to read but he had no books his eyesight was sufficient for his needs he did not recognize it but perversely his failing vision helped him he saw that morning only the beauty of the valley as if the war had passed it by the track to the ford and beyond it was empty was the old fool going to be late his preparations were dictated by a schedule he sniffed smelt the stewing rabbit he hurried inside he stoked more wood into the stove the stove like him was a survivor of the war when the spanish soldiers had brought him back to his house before theyd left him theyd cleared bucketfuls of plaster rubble from its top and cleaned the hob he went twice a week into the almost deserted village of ljut with his bow saw and took his time to cut wood from fallen rafters and wheeled it back in a barrow last week a soldier had brought an axe and had cut enough logs to supply his cooking needs for a month the cats ran wild in the village they moved in packs among the driedout ruins he had studied their hunting habits as if it were a minor paramilitary police operation had learned where the vats look the rabbits they killed they were creatures of routine the eating place a charnel house of bones was the tool shed at the back of the church a cat caught a fine buck rabbit held it screaming in its jaws and proudly strutted with it to the shed hed waited the previous day in the sheds shadows heard its death scream and the cats proud yowl hed thrown a stone at the cat had missed but the rabbit had been dropped he had taken it home skinned and gutted it and had hung it from a beam above his bed the rabbit was now in the pot and the fire burned well in the stove he had only the potatoes that the spanish troops brought him and peas from packets to stew with it it would not be a meal for an emperor but a meal fit for a true friend an old fool he looked at his watch husein bekir was twentyseven minutes late he heard the movement outside and the bark of the dog he stood up gained the stature of a retired police sergeant and went to the door ready to chide his guest it was the daughter the widow of the criminal the mother of the child she had come she said to tell him that her father had a chill she thought he had been out too long too late two nights before with a goat and a sickly kid it was not serious but her father had taken to his bed he saw the way she scented in envy the stewing rabbit she was wancoloured worried dragan kovac prided himself on understanding the mentality of men most certainly the mind of husein bekir he thought it was more about the fields and the mines that lay in them there was perhaps a chill but there would also be a reluctance to walk to the ford and wade across it then to walk up the track past the grazing ground where there were no cattle and the arable ground that had not been ploughed and sown and past the vineyard where the weeds overwhelmed the vines he gave her the steaming pot he said and hoped that the message would be carried back that husein bekir should come as soon as he was fit enough and that he should bring her son and that together he and his friend should teach the child the mysteries of their game she nodded dragan kovac put away the chess pieces folded the board and carried the table inside the sun rose and shimmered on the valley and the flowers did i wake you joey very sorry its gough where am i i am crossing kingston bridge then its hampton wick then its teddington and my bed ive spoken to jennifer shes fine very supportive i have arranged roundtheclock protection for her but discreet she wont see it dont worry on her behalf im sure you were worried but youve no cause to be i need you there joey i want you on his back i want him squeezed what im looking for joey is mistakes big ones the ones that nail him the black mercedes dropped mister at the door of the holiday inn they were on the settee seats of the atrium bar close to each other he saw that they had waited up for his return he had drunk nothing during the evening was cold sober there were beer bottles in front of atkins and softdrink cans on the table in front of the eagle he walked towards them they stood he recognized the signs of crisis he didnt hurry as he approached them because that would have shown doubt or weakness when he was close to them he smiled the eagle didnt meet his eye but atkins was flushed and his fingers tugged and pinched at the hem of his trouser pocket mister knew that the difficulty wherever it lay was with atkins divide the opposition then control it it was what he had learned from childhood he grinned at the eagle all right then you didnt have to sit up for me through a sickly smile yes all right mister you had a good evening an acceptable evening making bridges we can walk over whats up atkins we were talking the eagle shrugged message clear atkins had been talking and the eagle had been listening they were already divided he knew it what were you talking about atkins it came in a torrent about being here how long are we here what were doing here that was what we were talking about how long and what and about attempted murder im listening atkins but youre not making much sense to me wheres all this leading quit its time we quit do you agree eagle that its time we quit no lost your voice come on eagle i always listen to you anything legal and im all ears dont i listen to you eagle nothing to say he used sharp staccato harsh questions to beat on the eagle always worked always made him cringe he could bully the eagle like kicking a dog and knowing it always came back to whimper at his heel hed his beaded gaze on the eagle unwavering he turned in sweetness to atkins things are bothering you my friend i dont like that i like things in the open take your time mister hadnt heard it before a croak in atkinss voice theyd have talked it over at dinner wouldnt they he twisted on the settee gave atkins his full attention and the eagle was ignored as if he was of no importance i came to do a job but you didnt say the job was murder and those people killed dubbs you dont trust that sort not an inch the points made atkins i think i know that and i dont do job descriptions you know that we see an opportunity and we move we see an obstacle and we dismantle it i didnt come for this i want out fairs fair i hear you its not my game he reached out the expression set on his face was of concern the appearance was of sympathy genuine it was a little gesture not the thing grown men did but he reached out his hand look atkinss in his and held it gently right its out of the system you wont mind if i say something my minds made up im quitting yes yes you see atkins you wont find a man in london whod call himself bigger than me im top of the heap im the one they look to whys that its because i have ambition no backwaters for me im at the top in the fast lane how am i there because i choose men of quality plenty of people want to work for me silly to think about it but if i advertised a position working for me then the queue would stretch round the corner plenty of people who could organize hardware for me im only interested in the best got me the best only quality interests me looking for the best for quality i asked you to accept my offer of employment does everything always go to plan course it doesnt it screws up falls on its face the reason most times it works out is that i have the best men alongside me quality men not gorillas but men of intelligence im not afraid to hold my hands up when im wrong i think i owe you an apology atkins why ive taken you for granted i havent kept you in the picture thats remiss of me you want out because you dont think youre valued you are sincerely you are who was the last person to tell you that you were quality the best your father he held atkinss hand and his thumb massaged the knuckle his voice was pitched low and atkins had to lean forward to hear him he knew about all the people he employed and their families there was a brigadier retired down in wiltshire who had received from the queen in his soldiering days a distinguished service order and a military cross from what mister had learned the brigadier thought worthless the son who had been bumped out of the army in disgrace he knew atkins hadnt been home last christmas if he skipped going home at christmas then it was to save himself from supercilious insult he held the hand and saw the head shaken glumly its what im telling you youre quality and the best i want you beside me i value you atkins everythings going to be all right i promise just a few hiccups but itll all work out anything you want to say no mister nothing no more talk of quitting none well said said by a man i can lean on a man id depend on you want to go and get some sleep that hand mister loosed it id put my life in that hand and know its safe he watched atkins shamble away to the lift he leaned further across the table without warning with a shortrange jab he punched the eagles upper arm aimed at the flab where it would hurt he laughed as if that were his idea of amusement snivelling little rat tell me it wasnt your idea eagle didnt prime him to it no no you did well mister the eagle said but then you always do he told the eagle about his dinner what hed learned and what hed agreed to he said where he would be early in the morning and where he would be for the day and what he wanted from the eagle and atkins while he was away seems good to me mister they ambled towards the lift and his arm draped over the eagles shoulder i reckon were rolling chapter thirteen for mister the day started well there was a clear sky over him with a dipping quartermoon the sun wasnt yet up over the rooftops of the city but a sheen of its coming light slipped into the sidestreet where he stood his position half in the doorway of a steelshuttered boutique gave him a useful view of the square and its shrub bushes draped with windblown litter the hotels steps the interior foyer and the reception desk he had the timetable of the flights he had risen early and expected to be rewarded for it he saw them come into the foyer together and go to the desk he understood the way they worked operated at the church they backed off it was the difference between him and them there would have been a meeting and fed into the meeting would have been options to stay and reinforce or to back off he felt supreme she carried a lightweight case out of the foyer and down the hotels steps the young man cann followed her loaded with a heavy silvery metal case and a smaller overnight sports bag she didnt look like anyone from the church hed seen before too petite too smart and not police either she would have been the bug e x p e r t but hed seen her off she turned on the pavement and walked towards the far end of the hotel building cann trailing behind her under a streetlamp mister saw their faces hers was tight his was depressed and lowered they disappeared from his view went round the corner of the hotels block mister waited he had seen enough but his innate care and sense of caution ruled him an old blue van came fast from the side of the hotel and accelerated past the steps to the foyer then braked noisily at the traffic lights she was driving a lesser man than himself would have whistled and waved to them or given them the finger they were gone he looked down at his watch to make the quick calculation they were on schedule for the flight out there was a bounce in his stride when he left the sidestreet it would be a good day for him shed held her silence all the way down the old snipers alley past the destroyed newspaper building past the ruins of what had been the front line protecting the airport corridor and past the camp of the french soldiers shed said nothing and joey hadnt broken into her mood she parked switched off the engine then tossed him the keys good luck she said ill see you in you dont have to im capable of catching on my own an airline flight ill carry your case she pouted the gentleman to the last not that joey had seen many but he thought it was like any earlymorning airport anywhere she took her place in the checkin queue in front and behind them were the personnel of the international community there was a buzz and a rippling of jokes in a mess of languages they were getting out they were getting shot of the place for ever or had the lesser escape of a weeks leave policemen soldiers red cross workers united nations officials they all let the staff on the checkin know how they felt about a reservation on the silver freedom bird maggie bolton wasnt a part of them she was severe cold as if that were her protection the laughter rang around her over her when she was one place short of the front of the queue she turned to joey she didnt speak but pointed to her ticket her eyes asking the question was he coming he shook his head she knew nothing of the clamour of his bedside telephone what im looking for joey is mistakes big ones the ones that nail him it had been a long time many clocks chimes disturbing the night quiet before he had slept again maggie gazed at him as if he were far away then jabbed her elbow into his ribcage right thats it thats me on board both of her bags would go with her in the cabin she left the checkin and started to walk towards the departure doors let him carry the heavier bug case what happens when you get back joey asked is that supposed to be bloody sarcastic its merely a simple question meant to be polite she paused at the doors and stood against the flow into heathrow about eleven thirty if the zagreb connection works a car to meet me and take me into london not because im important but because of the bag a debrief if they ask me why you didnt travel ill say you were waiting for the drycleaning to come back dont worry i wont shop you joey said softly my instructions are to stay carry on without you as best i can her composure broke what that is worse than bloody stupid and when youve had your debrief check the bug into the workshop see if its past help go home look at the post ring my mother the usual then put my feet up then we all fail you know we dont brood about it learn to accept failure have a good flight she swivelled away from him joined the flow and went through the doors its a tip atkins said the right road the right number cant be r i g h t its what mister said the eagle muttered are you going to whinge or are you going to do what he told you to do you bastard eating from his hand a couple of little compliments god you come cheap atkins flushed they walked towards the halfintact halfdestroyed house where his parents were down in wiltshire a dry cow or a useless lame gelding wouldnt have been kept in such a place this building was lived in where the stumped rafters were lowest from the angle of the roof what was left of it a washingline was suspended and it reached to the bottom branch of a bare tree on the line drying in the sunshine were a young womans flimsy pieces of underwear and mixed with them was a ragged assortment of long baggy pants thick vests heavy check shirts and the darned socks of an old man there had once been a garden over the rubble of the house end lay the tangle of sprouting rose suckers trying to crawl towards the open wallpapered interior what had been an inner door was barricaded with nailed planks atkins thought it a pitiful place not a judges home not five years after the war had ended he saw the nearly buried roof of a car if he hadnt been examining the building turning it over with his trained eye he would not have seen it it would have been parked beside the building when the artillery shell had struck home part of the roof and all of the outer wall had fallen on it along with the last of the dirtied snow of the winter there were narrow wheelmarks making tramlines to and from a ramp leading to the main door it was the right address the wheelmarks confirmed it the door with the paint weathered off it was firmly shut there were no lights behind the two remaining windows which were covered with double layers of cellophane he could not see inside he was the best quality mister had said it he turned his back on judge delics home over breakfast and before leaving for a vaguely explained destination mister had described the departure of cann and a woman scuttling with their bags from a central hotel without crowing and then atkins had been told of a little problem that mister wanted sorting out he looked above the house he searched the hillside for a place of elevation where the tripod could be set up that could be reached on tarmac he thought the place would be near the jewish cemetery atkins set off to find it and the eagle puffed after him miss bolton im ruthin eddie ruthin i came down from vienna she thought him a vacuouslooking younger man with a quiff of hair falling on his forehead below a trilby thin under an oversized burberry mackintosh what for she had come into the airside concourse at zagreb she felt wretched it was not the turbulence that had hit the flight but the glowering thoughts in her head that affected her she was out cann was still in she had found justification for it and had walked away abandoned him she hadnt even pecked him on the cheek but had given him instead a homily on failure they thought in london after what youve been through that a friendly face might help did they well your life was in danger wasnt it so how can i help how long do i have here fraid theres three hours to kill before the london flight i suppose also they didnt want you lugging all your gear round on your own may i take the case im perfectly capable well lets find a chair somewhere to sit you down what about a coffee maggie sat in a chair and faced the plateglass windows she manoeuvred the heavy case under her thighs and behind her shins stared out over the runways and saw a distant line of hills to the west beyond the hill was the border and beyond the border was joey cann the case holding the equipment that might have helped him was cold against her shins and thighs id like please if you can get them to make it a pink gin gough listened so you came down to see old finch to see how the old beggars surviving and to pick the old brains surviving not too bad actually with a bit of help from ten yearold malt you know the bestkept secret in the custom house theres a life outside fancy that my life now is the garden and the newspapers and i do the housework because emilys still working and ive a bit of time to think youll be wondering if im bitter and twisted can answer that easily enough i am what makes me bitterest twists me tightest is that cann still works in sierra quebec golf i used to pity him almost feel sorry for him now i just detest him i go to the wall at dawn blindfold over my face and the rest of my people get the churchs version of siberia but cann survives you want to know what i think hes one of those empty people fuckall in him no life and therefore no balanced view searching for a cause the cause might have been god might have been chelsea bloody football club might have been fuchsias in a greenhouse but it was packer that sort of empty person needs a bloody cause something to fill the hole bastard didnt have one iota of the ethic of law enforcement not like i had and the rest of my people and look where its got us it was more like that pitiful sort of dedication those sick creatures have who stalk celebrities photograph them stand outside their homes and go through their rubbish all wrapped up in some shitty justification that he was the only one who cared about the job i ran a good team we worked for each other he didnt to the other guys girls he was a pain he wanted to be alone wasnt a part of us he had his mission his mission made him a big boy gave him a reason for living people with a mission they come unstuck dont know when to stop you shouldnt have sent him there not to bosnia wouldnt that be the sort of place where youd need to know when to stop and back off gough left brian finch in his conservatory with the first glass of the day in his hand he had heard what he wanted to hear its a neck of the world i dont know misters confession of ignorance felt like an apology i promise you there is no place more beautiful more pure mr packer or more sad perhaps one day you will go there yes maybe the way you tell it maybe i should but not to see the sad part monika holberg was like no woman he had ever known but then the lofoten islands north of the arctic circle was a place he had never heard of as shed told him about her home and a life of farming small fields and of dragging cod out of the sea hed thought grimly that they didnt grow poppies in their fields or coca bushes didnt have laboratories that manufactured e tablets or amphetamines had nothing for him to buy nothing for him to sell not good fertile territory for trading she was like no woman hed known because she talked from the time shed picked him up with her driver sitting in the back of the unhcr jeep she had barely drawn breath he knew about her home village njusford on the island ol hakstodoya he knew about her parents henrik and helge about her brother and sister johan and hulde he knew the names of their cows that lived eight months of the year in a heated barn and the annual weight of the cod they caught in the nets he knew about the brother knut who had hanged himself aged sixteen twelve years before as an escape from the demon depression of the winters darkness she told him everything and asked him nothing her life cascaded over him it was so rare for him to be treated to such trusting personal confidences then when she had finished with the lofoten islands and the hanging of her brother she switched effortlessly to her career working with refugees in somalia and east timor mozambique and kosovo he knew where kosovo was had a vague idea of where somalia and mozambique were positioned on the african continent but had never heard of east timor he didnt like to display his ignorance thought it lessened him he didnt want to be small in her eyes they turned off the main road and the jeep began to bump up a rough track you are all right mr packer im fine im really enjoying myself i am not talking too much not at all you fascinate me you make me think that ive led a very sheltered life everyone calls me mister id like you to please she pulled a face then she giggled it is a very strange name but it that is what you w a n t we are nearly there the village is called visnjica you will remember that visnjica in opstina kiseljak mister said didnt think about it they all sound the same to me these names but you must remember the name and the district mister surely when you go home you will tell the charities who have made the gift where their generosity has gone it is important surely yes mister said it is important on the yellowed grass between the track and a small river in spate were the heavy tyremarks of the military vehicles parked up he saw armoured personnel carriers flying the german flag an ambulance and jeeps beyond them over the river above the trees where snow was scattered two heavy helicopters hovered then descended typical of the germans to strike completely the wrong note we are trying to tell frightened people that it is safe to come back to their homes the people have been the victims of war perhaps the most savage europe has seen and we are telling them that the danger is over but this is the area of responsibility of the german military and they have vips coming by the helicopters and it is necessary for them to make a show they are so clumsy so bovine in norway we do not have a good experience of the germans she left the driver with the jeep they walked into the village a long ribbon of scattered buildings that stretched up the hill on both sides of the track behind them the helicopters disgorged generals men in suits and women in smart dresses some houses showed no war damage cattle bellowed from the barns behind them and smoke puffed from the chimneys but most were destroyed their roofs sunk between the four upstanding walls the undergrowth high around and inside them a few had bright new tiled roofs and new walls of red brick or concrete blocks new windows and doors and washing draped in front of them men women and children walked from them towards the track and formed a thin line of welcome the village before the war was home to croats and muslims it is easy mister to believe the war was only made by serbs the croats were as bad as the serbs they waited until the muslims were defenceless then attacked them before the war there were three hundred muslim families here and sixty croat families then there was the ethnic cleansing the muslims were expelled their houses were destroyed not m lighting but by explosives after they had gone most went togermany but they have been expelled again so they try to return to their old homes and to live beside their old neighbours who became their enemies of three hundred we now have the first twenty families back they find their homes have been looted everything of value has been taken and is now inside the houses that are not damagedtvs stoves baths bulbs even the electric wires and the cattle sheep and goats it is not easy but my job is to help to rebuild the relations between neighbours women with small children and babies and old men with dulled laces stood in a knot outside a square set building that had no roof no glass in the tall windows and a wide hole where the door should have been they had their backs to the ruin as if it did not exist the women wore old coats against the chill and the wind snatched at their headscarves the men wore berets and thick sweaters had weathered faces that were expressionless and the children stared back at mister and held limply to toys in the field beside the building were short freshly painted white pegs it could have been worse mister if it had not been for your generosity i do not think they would have come out of their houses to see the vips the coats scarves sweaters and toys came from bosnia with love at least they are warm and the little ones have something to amuse them it is too much i am sorry to expect them to smile but at least they have come the building is their mosque it was not a military target it was destroyed by their neighbours as an act of vandalism and the graveyard all the stones were smashed with sledgehammers and pickaxes in such circumstances it takes great courage and determination to come home if i ask the croats who live here who today hide who destroyed the mosque they will tell me it was outsiders who came criminal scum under the control of warlords perhaps in sarajevo you have heard of the muslim scum caco celo serif the croats had tuta and sela the serbs had many criminals arkan and selsjek i am not supposed to hate it does not fit with the principles of the unhcr but i loathe those scum theyve sucked the blood from good decent simple people there was a desultory clapping behind them she held his arm did it naturally and without premeditation and turned him round the uniforms suits and smartstyled women were gladhanding their way up the track and through the village women were nodded to mens shoulders were slapped the babies cheeks were tweaked in the show of solidarity he watched the cameras it was an event earnest conversations started up and lasted long enough to be recorded and witnessed on film a little scrum had developed at the front of the vips and a sergeant of the german army redfaced attempted to push back the cameras and microphones succeeded then was outflanked to the right drove the right back and was outflanked to the left twice when he thought a lens was aimed towards him that he would figure in the background of a picture mister did what was reflex to him and presented his back to them we have to have them here because we need the publicity id go round the world the need for money for these people has to be reinforced with the pictures and the interviews but it is degrading they take the dignity from people how can people talk with honesty about their situation when they have a camera in one nostril and a microphone in the other the media has no discipline they are like frogs slimy frogs and you collect them in a bucket but as you put one in another slips out they were both laughing it was their own moment and private she took his hand she was holding his hand as they laughed and their faces were close and he saw the while cleanness of her teeth and the tan of her skin she led him further up the hill mister let her hold his hand the shutter clattered on automatic through the viewfinder using the mm lens joey watched them laughing and holding hands eight frames or nine and then his view of them was obscured by the old mill building above the stream he lay on his stomach crushing down last autumns fall of leaves and huddled behind the camera what other charities mister do you help well bits and pieces you can tell me i admire your modesty too many people boast tell me i do things for a hospice you know what a hospice is yes i help them i put a roof on a church is that your life mister helping in bosnia helping in a hospice helping a church well not entirely she squeezed his hand he felt the warmth of her smile come on in the distance he heard the helicopter rotors start to turn theyd barely been on the ground half an hour the vips in a slithering column retraced their way through the village and the media were boarding buses the villagers drifted from the track and meandered in little groups towards the few rebuilt homes he was surprised the visit had been so short and she must have read his thoughts she told him that it was important the visitors were not bored were enthusiastic went back to their offices and wrote the reports that would bring in more donations from their governments children now surrounded the two of them as they walked along a mudpacked path with one hand she held misters with the other a childs he saw the way they touched her pinched at her coat sleeve gripped the hem of her anorak and he saw the love in her face for them they went towards a narrow plank bridge spanning the stream he felt the little tickle in his trailing hand and looked down sharply a small boy had reached to take the trailing hand mister was about to reject him snatch his own hand away hed never allowed his sisters children to get close to him his sisters always scolded their children if they came close to him and told them not to bother their uncle he knew nothing of the trust of children he let the small boy take his trailing hand as they went across the loosefastened planks of the bridge a little girl came behind the boy and took his free hand for the bridge crossing and mister saw the upturned tag of her anorak marks amp spencer a castoff as he came off the bridge still holding the little boys hand monika looked at him and winked she approved he could not remember the last time that pleasure and pride had coursed through him at such a small thing she took him to a house they have no electricity only heatingoil for the fire and a gas can for the stove a little paraffin is given them each month for light if we get more people back have more homes for them to move into we can pressure the authorities to spend money and restore the electricity supply there are three families living here nineteen people work has been done on the ground floor but not yet upstairs because they are waiting for more building materials to be brought it is not possible for them to buy the materials themselves because they have no work no money but at least they are again in their homes how many bedrooms do you have in your house mister five how many people my wife and myself they went inside he hovered behind her and she was greeted like a true friend he saw in the gloom two of the boxes unpacked on which were scrawled bosnia with love leading to the one table were mud smears across the bare concrete floor an old man sat in a chair near to the table and smoked his pullover bore the woven insignia of the edinburgh woollen mill and crossed golf clubs under the stitched writing and he smoked as if that were the luxury left to him there was a line of institution beds with metal frames dull blankets the little girl careered away and bounced onto a bed but the small boy kept hold of misters hand the women were of all ages but only old men were crowding into the room the child wanted mister thought to hold the hand of his father there were four bedrooms always empty at his home by the north circular road his father visited occasionally but would not stay over his mother had never slept in his house he and the princess had no friends they would have invited nor her father and mother they never entertained in the dining room with the big mahogany table and the matching set of eight chairs if it was necessary to entertain for business he went to a restaurant the mixer arranged a private room at the back a card sat in the kitchen and another stood at the private rooms door he had so many bedrooms he had hotel bedrooms and service accommodation bedrooms and timeshare bedrooms he had more bedrooms in cyprus the south of france on the spanish coast and in the caribbean and he had the money to rebuild the village and bring every man woman and child back to it and to dress all of them in armani or yves st laurent to give them electricity plumb in the sewage put boards and carpets under their feet and curtains at their windows to build a factory for them and to bring them pedigree cattle if he had done that he would not have noticed the loss he was served coffee to mister it was bitter and the sludge at the bottom of the tiny cup caught between his teeth it was the coffee of green lanes that he drank in the spieler cafes with the turks and he was practised in hiding his disgust as he drank a dogeared set of cards was cut the stakes for the game were used matches plucked from a filled ashtray and mown on to remove the tobacco dust it wasnt easy lor him to play and twice he grimaced at monika the small boy held his hand would not let go of it he played and the time slipped away he made certain he was never the winner at home in london he would never be a loser and not a loser in the old city of sarajevo when he played the highstakes game with serif whom she called criminal scum he lost the matches he had been given she was at the far end of the room with the women and she glanced al him lapped the face of her watch they went out into the dusk it was only when they left that mister realized a crowd had gathered in the room and outside the door to watch him fail at cards and lo he close to her she kissed many cheeks he shook the many hands pressed on him on the slippery path he took her fingers so that she would not fall it was an excuse she wore good walking boots he had smooth leathersoled shoes they went across the bridge clung to a handrail that was a slack strand of rope and walked on the track down through the village the shells of the burnedout houses remained in darkness brighter lights shone out from the undamaged homes where the generator engines thudded and where uncovered windows showed the flicker of television pictures he heard the patter of the feet that followed him why dont they go back and get them the tvs because they are beaten people mister they have no more any spirit to fight then theyve no future the other future is to start the war again mister of course you are angry i am angry but violence criminal violence solves nothing it is the way of the barbarian the place for the criminals is not at the head of armies of thugs and thieves it is in gaol where there are bars and where there is no key they reached her jeep the engine was on and her driver slept in the sealed warmth he heard a low guttered hacking cough behind him he turned for a moment the small boy cringed away was a retreating shadow figure on the empty track he reached out his arms and the child came to him he lifted the little boy and hugged the thin frame to his chest monika was with him together they held the child he kissed the childs face and monika kissed his he put the small boy down and watched him go into the darkness if the visitors had done what you have they would have learned ten times a hundred times more i thank you for nothing they climbed into the jeep were driven away from the village on the seat between them her hand rested on his june three times husein bekir had conceded defeat in the past five hours three times the patronizing victors satisfaction had been on dragan kovacs face each time he lost while the retired police sergeant poured more brandy burped on his lunch and called him an old fool and a man without intelligence husein immediately set the carved wooden pieces back on the board and they played again he had played the last game and the next would be the same with a desperate intensity that furrowed his forehead that made his hand tremble as he lifted a piece and slapped it down in its new position his concentration was on his own moves and what he anticipated would be dragen kovacs moves but above all he searched for a sign of his opponents cheating as yet he could not find such a sign and that confused him hugely if his opponent did not cheat the implication was clear to husein he himself was inferior of course dragan kovac cheated he heard a distant voice calling his name but ignored it the grandchild and the dog were also ignored and had slipped out of the door to search for entertainment when the bottles mouth hovered over his glass husein put his hand clumsily over it and succeeded only in tipping over the glass his head was bent over the board and he saw nothing of the fields below the porch and he did not look up to find the voice calling his name and he did not glance at the mulberry tree beyond the sagging fence of barbed wire and he did not see the dog chasing alter the ball his grandson had thrown for it he tried his concentration fading to plot the defence of his bishop and he thought it was with unnecessary ostentation that dragan kovac wiped the spilled brandy off the table until she reached him he had not been aware of lilas approach up the track as he peered down at the board and looked for answers he saw at the edge of his vision her riverwashed rubber boots which came to the top of her muscled shins when was he coming home she asked he was coming home when the game was finished who was going to milk the goats she asked he would milk the goats when he had finished the game what was more important milking the goats or drinking and playing games where was his grandchild he did not know she snorted at him in derision and he heard dragan kovacs chuckle there was the cackling of her voice and he lost the threads of his defence he looked up he was palpitating with anger he looked around the child was high in the mulberry tree beyond the fence the dog sat under the spread of the tree with the ball in its mouth and the saliva dripped from its jaws did he consider it responsible to allow the child to climb a tree from which he might fall and not even know where he was did he consider it responsible to be drunk when in charge of the child his grandson under his breath holding his head in his hands he swore if he wanted to get back his chill she said that was his business but she was not permitting him to abandon her grandson up a dangerous tree if he got his chill back through his own stupidity when he should have been milking the goats then it would not be she who nursed him he wriggled in annoyance and dragan kovac reached grinning for the bottle husein bekir saw his wife lila stamp away from him in her shining rubber boots she was stout strong for her age heavybuilt she seemed to plough through the long uncut grass below the porch towards the drooping fence in front of the mulberry tree she straddled the fence caught her skirt on the wire extricated herself leaving a thread on the barbs when she swung over her back leg then went into the shade under the trees leaves he saw the deepening lines in his friends forehead and his eyes were screwed to narrow slits his mouth gaped open as if he tried to clarify a little moment of memory from far back and could not then his friends tongue flapped idly but no words came she was calling the child down husein did not know what memory seeped back into the mind of dragan kovac nor what his friend tried to say the child was pale thin like the scrawny dog gliding on the baked earth under the tree had no meat on him and was lightweight his woman lila was solid and heavy she moved under the tree so that she could better steady the child when he dropped down to her and her voice was harsh with her command as if she had no patience dragan kovac hissed its where they did it put them i remember its where put what the mine exploded under her foot for joey it had been the journey from hell the nightmare had begun after he had seen mister and the woman leave the village in the unhcrjeep it had been hard to track them at the end in the failed light he had kept a distance back from them but had seen mister pick up a child and hug it and then the small boy had run up the track past him joey had walked another mile through the long strip of the village to where the blue van was hidden in trees beside the river as hed approached stumbling over fallen branches hed heard the charge of their escape they would have run when theyd heard his approach the vans doors were open hed sworn hed reached inside felt the dash and found the loose wires from the radio his foot as hed stood by the door had brushed against bricks hed sworn aloud hed gone round to the passenger side found the pocket open and the torch hadnt been there moribricks against his hand on the passenger side bricks to hold up the van because there were no bloody wheels no tyres hed sworn again in fury of course he had seen the poverty of the village abject poverty but hed never thought that a little of the poverty might be removed by the acquisition of his tyres his goddam wheels hed started to walk he dragged himself up the stairs of the hotel a man had been sitting smoking an empty coffee cup in front of him close to the reception desk and hed been given his key by a scowling night porter whose eyes were never off the man he went up to his landing a man lounged in a chair at the top of the stairs seemed to strip joey with his gaze he too wore the uniform of the man in the foyer jeans a cigarette closecut hair a black leather jacket a shortbarrelled machine pistol two magazines taped together lay on his lap joey knew the face but couldnt put a place to it it confused him but in his exhaustion he didnt stop he went past the door of the room that had been maggies there was a light under it and low voices the scented fumes of cigarettes he let himself into his room dumped his bag on the bed and took out the camera opening up his laptop he wrote his report his fingers hammering on the keys hed walked to the main road then gone west along it hed hitched every car and lorry that had passed him but none had stopped and some had nearly clipped him hed reached a village and seen a cafes lights hed gone into it was there a taxi in the village shrugged responses there was no taxi was there a telephone to call a taxi from kiseljak the telephone was broken hed headed off continued walking the report was typed out he was tired so bloody tired he was cold he was damp he was hungry he snatched the wire cables from his bag his fingers shivered it was slow going and his temper was fuelled should have taken him thirty seconds but it took him minutes and he linked the cables to his laptop and his mobile and hit the transmissioncode keys the first time with his clumsiness it didnt go through second time it did he had walked for an hour and a half to reach kiseljak no taxis no buses in the police station he had gone halfway down on his knees and flagged them with his id a police car had taken him to rakovica halfway to sarajevo and the driver had gestured that he could go no further that he was not allowed beyond his area again he had walked a lorry with a drunk driver had lifted him as far as blasuj then dropped him hed walked in the dark another hour almost crying in his frustration towards the always distant lights of the city his goal joey wired the digital camera to his mobile and dialled and the cameras pictures were downloaded to london the mobiles screen message told him they were received hed walked into ilidza no taxis in kiseljak rakovica or blasuj and half a hundred bloody taxis in the ilidja suburb hed been driven to the hotel hed staggered in through the door into the bright light mud on his boots his trousers and his coat he remembered the recognition seeped into his mind where hed seen the men they had been in the back of the truck when he had been picked up in the truck and the door had been opened for him the interior light had come on they had been in the back ante and muhsin he had seen their faces salko and fahro before he had nestled down in the front seat and slammed the truck door and the light had gone out when they had come from the truck and had gone into the druggies block they had worn balaclavas and he hadnt seen their faces hed seen their faces when theyd come out of the block work done before theyd pulled their hoods back down an excellent meal mister said and pushed his chair back from the table it had been the same meal the eagle reflected that theyd eaten every night but it was the first time mister had praised the food hed talked rambling about his day about war and poverty about hatred and the eagle and atkins had been his audience if it had been hot stinking hot he would have diagnosed mister as a sunstroke case but there hadnt been any fierce sun she wasnt mentioned the eagle began to think the unthinkable almost as an afterthought mister turned to atkins you did all right today went well mister you got the place we did a reconnaissance on the house and weve found a position where theres a clear field of vision on to it a clear field of fire and tarmac tarmac and frozen ground the grounds smooth thats great well done the eagle thought atkins was a bloody puppy lapping praise thats what we do tomorrow should be a bit special i mean seeing it actually fired thatll be sort of exciting good night guys mister walked away from the table left them and his whistling echoed out ol the restaurant it was of course unthinkable and he had known mister for twentyeight years and the princess for eighteen of them unthinkable the pictures were passed by gough round the central table to be subjected to the teams scrutiny choice id fancy a bit of il myself said sqg not what id have expected from him dipping his wick not from what boy brilliant left us on him out of the character cann drew said sqg silly old beggar getting the flushes at his age and his princess wont like it will not be a happy girl if she gets to see them said sqg shell get to see them in good time gough growled what id like at both ends from tomorrow we start to build the pressure from pressure comes mistakes only a little diversion and can we now please concentrate he gathered up the pictures of his target one and an unidentified young woman locked them in his drawer and they applied themselves again to the first of the rummages that would be launched in the morning that would build the pressure force the mistakes the name of cann and what he did dis not deserve another mention they were too busy inside their own agenda to think of him he closed his door behind him and went down the corridor he waved his id at the man on the landing thought it was salko and saw that both the hands were on the machine pistol he had left behind his coat and he swivelled to show that there was no weapon in his belt outside her room the one he thought was muhsin acknowledged him sourly and joey thought he was allowed with reluctance to go to the door he knocked and heard a scrabble of movement behind it he said his name the door opened on the chain then closed again then was fully opened come on in she said join the party she was on the bed dressed a filled glass in her hand shared with a cigarette frank williams the policeman in uniform was in the chair by the window the last two of what he had called the sreb four were hunched on the carpet jeans leather jackets and cigarettes machine pistols against their knees within fast reach one against the foot of the bed and one against the wardrobe joey reckoned they were fahro and ante he saw the metal case on the floor under the window by the chair its the advantage of a transit lounge the dutyfree ive chivas regal and courvoisier youre drunk have to be drunk or mental to come back here why did you turn round a nice young man met me at zagreb he thought i was in mortal danger he bought me three pink gins so i got to

have apologized for sending me out with a kid an amateur the knives would have been in your back joey and the sneers down the phone to where you work id have gone home alone i didnt ask you to stay she spat god you make it hard i dont want you dont need you a speech we will have a speech you will not please interrupt my speech do you have something to eat damn you she wiggled her bottom the hem of her skirt climbed her thighs she pulled two packets of peanuts from under her and hurled them at him was about to say ill have the whisky youre an obstinate arrogant sod i am trying to help you she reached for the bottle and threw it at him he caught it then the plastic beaker that followed frank had his hand over his mouth as if he was stifling laughter the men with the guns were expressionless we are all trying to help you i tracked frank down from the airport he drove me here then he called in the cavalry we are all trying to bloody help you i dont want you any of you im doing all right ive stepped over the same line as you have i i doubt it isnt there anything more than peanuts shut up hear me for gods sake do me that courtesy the crackle slipped from her voice and the wasps sting

puny bastards who believed in us who they tortured and shot were dying youre alive youre bloody lucky to have an enemy so i came back he downed the whisky he poured what was left of the first peanut packet into his mouth and pocketed the second ill see you in the morning chapter fourteen the neighbour knew bruce james was away he had been gone nearly a week shed seen him go with his bags she had heard the footsteps tramping on the stairs then the landing off which she lived then going on up the last flight very few people called to visit him at any hour of the day or night but she could not remember when anyone had come at a quarter to six in the morning she thought there were four or five of them and all men from the weight of their tread she went to her door and listened as they walked up the final steps her nose wrinkled she could smell pipe tobacco she liked bruce james she thought him courteous and well mannered her own grandson was in the navy an engineer on board a frigate serving in the gulf sometimes he brought up her post and then theyd talk and hed tell her of his own days in the army she kept an eye on his small flat at the top of the stairs under the buildings eaves she heard a jangle of keys then metal scrapes and low spoken obscenities at the moment she realized that four or five men were attempting to unlock the door to mr jamess rooms she heard the thud then the splintering of breaking wood she hurried to her telephone programmed into the set were the numbers she considered most important and among them was that of hammersmith police station she used the phrase shed heard on television intruders on the premises she heard the dragging of furniture above her ceiling and the movement of feet it was a thin ceiling mr james was exceptionally considerate and never had his music loud she waited she heard the siren of the approaching police car she met them on her landing a young police constable and an older policewoman she pointed up the last stairs at the door off the hinges the noise seeped through the doorway and the voices they told her to close her door and lock it and she saw them take their truncheons off the belts and the little gas canisters she knew about the gas from the television programmes she thought them very brave she locked her own door bolted and chained it joey slept in when he woke his body ached but his head was worse there were the few seconds when he could not place where he was and he lay in the gloom of his room but the pain in his head his body and his feet lurched him alert the curtains were drawn but carelessly a strip of gold light came between them and made a shaft on to his bed he saw the time on his watch swore and rolled out of the bed he doused himself in the shower let tepid water run over him he was half wet half dry as he dressed he pulled on the same trousers hed worn the day before with the same mud on the knees and the same shirt he couldnt find clean socks in his bag only used pairs and he had to go down on the floor to find those hed worn yesterday and which hed scattered when he had undressed with the whisky in him he didnt shave didnt look in the mirror he went out of his room and stopped at her door he knocked there was no reply from maggie bolton just the stale stink of the cigarettes and no man on the landing he took the stairs two al a time they were in the far corner of the breakfast room it was a quarter past nine good of you to show up she said why didnt you wake me wild horses wouldnt have she grinned you young things have no stamina he slouched into a chair all of the sreb four were smoking the cigarettes were as much part of their uniform as the jeans boots and cheap leather jackets to get to the chair he had had to step over two sports bags he couldnt see their guns and assumed that the machine pistols were in the bags frank williams was beside her and seemed to smile at joey without mercy he poured himself coffee from the jug into her cup and turned it so that he didnt drink from the side marked with her burgundy lipstick the coffee dispersed the ache in his head he snatched a bread roll off a plate and broke it crumbs scattering on the cloth as he wolled it she passed him a sheet of flimsy paper from endicott room vbx to bolton technical support sarajevo subject organized crimeawp timed gmt security classification secret message

failed can we please sort out the priorities of the day and then ill do my laundry she asked innocently what he meant by priorities he was too tired and too flustered to recognize the trap she laid for him he said well we need wheels we need to assess the targets and recce them decide whether we can return to intrusive surveillance then how were going to divide up areas of responsibility her small hand hovered in front of her mouth as if to mask a yawn williams the bastard straightfaced whispered a translation into the ear of the sreb four man on his right side and the message was passed between them they were impassive and told him nothing of the trap well isnt that the professional approach to take joey flared have yon a better idea i was once called an obstinate arrogant sod but i dont compete youre light years ahead she turned in her chair and reached to the venetian blind covering the window she depressed one bar and lifted another made a slit the window faced on to the hotels rear car park he leaned forward over the cups and the plates he saw the blue van the sun reflected from the new hub caps and glanced on the new tyres he settled back in his chair and wrapped his arms around his chest she said waste not want not thats what my mum always told me still tells me i rather liked it the van sort of felt like home im sorry you lost my bucket frank and two of the boys muhsin and salko went to retrieve it this morning and borrowed the new wheels while they were doing that i went with the other boys to track down that mitsubishi they tried to run you down with

body language isnt it im good on locks so we checked out the warehouse then went back the way wed come over the wall had the time of my life big strong hands holding me where they shouldnt have lifting me up and helping me down anyway then we popped down to the old quarter they took me up over the rooftops to a place they knew bloody damn slippery the tiles were and bloody great rough fingers on my waist steadying me quite a compensation from there i had a line of sight into ismet mujics apartment and i unpacked one of my choicest little boxes of tricks its the infinity transmitter across the street from my box is his window and behind his window is his phone my box does the leap it uses the phones microphone to transmit the rooms conversations we have another ralay in the box

shaved thanks very bloody much please excuse me ive work to be getting on with put your feet up joey come on boys she smiled sweetly at joey as he crumpled they followed her out of the breakfast room carrying their bags and formed a phalanx around her the big mens boots padded around the clatter of her heels frank williams was last up from the table joey caught his arm pulled him close i didnt think youd be part of it part of what humiliating me her showing off at my expense in front of her boys take the day off the way you are youre useless he prised joeys hand off his sleeve and leaned closer you know what she said to me she said youd lost the sense of fear and without fear youd get hurt so she turned round shes gone on a limb for you and i have and the boys youve earned it take the day off frank williams ran to catch her gough had taken the underground to tooting bec he sipped a good strong cup of tea sat in the old chair and listened i wondered if someone would come to see me but i hoped they wouldnt i knew that if someone came and asked that question it would be to assess how well or how badly he would stand against the pressures ol extreme stress because he was in danger i know him better than anyone you see better even than young jenifer he used to come in here in the evenings late and sit where youre sitting in perrys chair and tell me about his day dont think me conceited please but i believe im as well briefed as anyone on that awful man packer perry was in the diplomatic corps and before that i was an army wife ive seen what stress can do to young people it started as dedication there seemed to be a sense of may i use a word thats out of vogue in these times duly i thought it was keenness id seen plenty of that in young officers and young second secretaries to me keenness duty dedication are all admirable you were hunting for evidence against packer and joey was working all hours and he seemed utterly happy hed a girlfriend a sweet soul and he was making an adult life for himself and was proud of what he did then it all changed i didnt recognize it at the time but i can see it now he was in that chair where you are it was near to midnight and he told me that a surveillance operalion had identified packer in a car with those ghastly drugs and it was enough to warrant his arrest it wasnt dedication any longer it was more obsession give a child a toy a favourite toy then tell the child that at the weekend it will be taken from him after packer was arrested the light seemed to go from his life he was brooding i used to hear him in his room reading aloud the surveillance and evidence statements and late at night hed be playing the tapes of telephone intercepts and id hear him striding around his room and asking the questions of the people interrogating packer packer had become the reason for his existence packer had the power even in his prison cell the authority joey started to feel worthless and that was when the dedication went and the obsession came i dont want to speak ill of him but i began to think of joey as a hollow shell as if he couldnt live without packer it is rather frightening isnt it obsession it changes people it brutalized joey it bred a sort of cruelty in his character and id never seen it before a quite unpleasant cruelty he became savage with jennifer and shed done nothing to deserve it it is like a dark cloud on the sun you dont often see it but when its there it chills you is he still in bosnia still trailing packer hell fight foul to win to achieve whatever it is that drives him hell fight very dirty i had a distressing thought the other night it quite upset me when he comes back if hes won if hes destroyed packer then he wont be the sort of young man i want to know will he stand up to the stress he will very well the cruelty will sustain him gough laid down the cup and saucer and made his excuses it had been more of what he had hoped to hear the detective chief inspector wandered out of the entrance within sight of the frontdesk security people he lit up a cigarette half of the building home of the national crime squad slipped outside during a working day for a drag cough gasp round the corner in the small length of pavement where the high cameras were blind he reached in his pocket for the payasyougo mobile there was a clipped answer and he heard traffic in the background he reported what he knew he suggested what he would do next and it was sanctioned when the camera picked him up again the mobile was back in his pocket and his cigarette was nearly smoked he returned through the security check and took a lift to the fourth floor he stood in front of a greysuited commander his life was lived at the edge walking a tightrope that was razor fine and precarious his bank accounts held in customer confidentiality in the channel islands proved it he had known the commander for twenty years of police service he was trusted and a friend but was always correct i thought you should know something sir cut the sir crap what is it hammersmith had a call intruders on premises from a member of the public they went to this address and found it stuffed with the church doing the place over warrant and all the property is the home of bruce james a security consultant and exmilitary he is also which makes him interesting listed as an associate of packer we are as i understand it supposed to be fully appraised of any customs operation mounted against packer wasnt that laid down agreed nothings come across my desk its not a situation im happy with sir if were sharing with them but theyre not sharing with us put frankly it makes life bloody impossible and its a slur were not to be trusted i cant see you sir taking that lying down just thought you should know he pushed the wheelchair he had changed into cleaner clothes filled in the laundry list and dumped the bag outside his room then he had shaved and walked to the ministry of justice where he had searched out her fathers courtroom he had gone inside tiptoed between the publics benches and the lawyers desks moved past a stenographer and the accused he had gone to the raised desk where her father sat walked under his nose to the side of the dais he had slipped off the chairs wheel locks and pushed her out of the courtroom nobody had spoken the case arguments had continued nobody had intervened he had wheeled her out into the sunshine on the pavement joey had said its my day off thats what im told im a stranger in need of a guide jasmina had said rules of engagement forbid discussion of the past the war of the present the criminals to see the sights hed said which way do we go it was an hour since they had set off he protected the wheels from the broken pavements as best he could and steered her across streets where the lights were with them but the traffic screamed to a threatening halt close to them she showed him the locked doors of the old orthodox church and took him inside the twintowered cathedral they looked across the miljacka river to the synagogue and she told him that all the jews were gone from the city she waved for him to stop propelling her when shed picked a view of the alipasina dzamija and she said that that mosque was the finest example of islamic sacred architecture in europe there were libraries public buildings olympic sites and the bridge where an assassin had killed an archduke they did not speak of the war or of the present there was nothing she showed him and no story she told him that could make them laugh what was unsaid was all around them the broken buildings and the grinding squeal of the wheelchair were allies in his despair he bought her flowers she sat in the chair and her hands gripped the stems that made the posy they were in a park she pointed to old gravestones from medieval times and said they were called stecaks and recited to him as if she were his tour guide it is taught us that the stecaks are the monuments of a period of our history not penetrated by understanding by light they are secretkeepers to us if you do not know the stones then you do not know us an epitaph is carved on one i stood praying to god meaning no evil yet was struck to death by lightning we can be a sad people and we live in darkness fortune does not shine on us joey we have little to offer strangers only our misery you want to laugh i want to laugh what can we find to laugh at the sun beat on them he looked at the old stones why did you come to get me joey today to be with you he said simply because i wanted to be with you im not meaning to patronize you its not that i feel sorry for you i just wanted to be here close to you he saw her fingers tighten on the flower stems do you have a girlfriend joey at home i did did she stop loving you or did you stop loving her i came here what i did here has hurt her because of me she has been through pain after what i have inflicted on her i doubt shell love me again dont pity me joey because that would be worse for me than anything you brought to your girlfriend would you take me back to my father they were the opposites jen and jasmina he pushed the chair and contrasted them in his mind with each other one was fit healthy the other was crippled pale whatever the physical comparisons one had a future the other had a past he felt an awful shaming gnawing consuming guilt he had bought a girl flowers he had killed his time with her given her the charity of his company he would climb on his plane he would go up the steps where a wheelchair could not follow she would be an ever fainter memory until she was brushed from his mind they reached the ministry of justice joey said i dont know how far we have gone but without your fathers help and yours i would not have been able to start on that road at last she smiled it was a thin fleeting wan smile and he thought it lovely she wheeled herself away from him and up the ramp into the building before the gloom of the ministrys interior engulfed her he saw the final brightness of the flowers on her lap hello commander were you trying to get a moment with me the minister basked in the memory of the applause he had been the last speaker before the lunch break the audience had been police editors socialservices executives and education experts it had been his drugs speech a velvet hand of sympathy offered to the abusing victims of the trade a mailed fist to the architects of the misery he had told his audience that he spoke for a government committed to helping the exploited and crushing the exploiters and they hed said would face the resources of the lawenforcement agencies united and dedicated he had clasped his hands together at that moment of his speech to represent the unity of purpose of the agencies he had quoted a favourite line when talking about interagency unity from ezekiel i will make them one people and hed said that had been his promise to the prime minister when he was honoured privileged to be given the appointment evil men he had said would find they could run but not hide when hunted by agencies that were in purpose and deed united he was informed of the search that morning of the apartment belonging to bruce james and his temper surged its because they dont trust us minister that they blunder in without sharing its divisive bloody insulting and worst of all it runs in utter contradiction to the theme of your excellent speech and government policy if you want results then theyve to be reined in can i leave it with you damn right you can july it was a pma thats the most common mine that was laid its antipersonnel and designed to wound not kill it has one hundred grams of explosive detonated by five kilos of pressure but you miss the point herr barnaby in his portakabin room in the mineaction centre in the marshal tito barracks in sarajevo the englishman thought it was against the german womans nature to allow him to complete a sentence of explanation barnaby he never made it clear whether that was a given name or a family name was experienced in deflecting the bullying tactics employed by the executives of international charities just as he never hurried when cleaning a minefield so he never raised his voice or lost his temper what point do i miss frau bierhof you miss the point that the woman the bekir woman was the last to be hurt that is thirteen months ago the point continues to evade me nothing has been done in thirteen months frau bierhof do you have any idea of the scale of the problem he asked the question without pointscoring rhetoric frau anneliese bierhof barnaby thought was a woman unused to detailed rebuttal as the director field operations of world in crisis from hamburg with millions of dms to spend she was a powerful hitter he imagined her bludgeoning her will through endless committee meetings dictating policy over the hesitations of those unfortunates who feared the jab of her pen at them or her gimlet glance she was a large woman with shoulders accentuated by the padding of her jacket allow me please as they appear in this office to tell you the facts of life that must be taken into consideration i know the fact of life herr barnaby you will hear the fact that i acknowledge in germany today we have twentythree families from the muslim village of vraca and we have eighteen families from the serb village of ljut the stabilization force of nato reports to berlin that the bunica valley is peaceful and does not suffer interethnic tension our government wants these people returned to their domicile they refuse to return while there are still mines in the locality the mines must be cleared a start must be made it is thirteen months since frau bekir was disabled and that start has not been made world in crisis has the money in place waiting to be spent for the repair of their homes and the infrastructure of their villages such as the electricity but we must know that the mines have been removed when will it happen why has thirteen months been allowed to elapse he said quietly against the rising crescendo of her voice because there are other places that have a higher priority that is not an answer that is satisfactory she paused sipped at the bottled water she had brought with her well satisfactory or not it was the answer she would have to accept from his portakabin he coordinated the work of fifteen hundred deminers but the computer database held the locations of many thousands of minefields barnaby had worked a lonely life in minefields for most of the last twenty years the only easy work in those twenty years had been the clearup in kuwait a decade before nice straight lines of antitank mines tmms tmas and tmrps laid with the exactness of potatoes in a flat field find the end of a line and keep going until dusk kuwait was the only place it had been easy and in kuwait there had been no shortage of money if frau bierhof had been less confrontational less antagonistic he might have sympathized with her predicament he knew because the evidence of it littered his desk each day that the pressure was on to expel the refugees from the european havens and send them whence they came it was thirteen months since a mine what he classified as the nuisance variety a pma had been detonated under the right foot of lila bekir in her seventythird year and it was eleven months since he had been to the valley and seen her she had been home from hospital a week and she had been lucky if a woman of that bulk of that weight had come from anywhere in great britain and had lived the soft life she would have died she had hobbled to meet him on her crutch had insisted on making coffee for him and had served him a sweet cake filled with grated almond she had told him disparaging the men who had been there that she had shouted at them that they should not come forward to help her should not put their own lives at risk after the blast she had put the child on her back and had crawled to the safety of the fence she had told him that she had reckoned her body would protect the child if she had detonated a second mine she was as tough as an old boot it was a miracle from his experience that gas gangrene had not set in the calcaneus the heel bone was destroyed at the talus where the tibia and fibula meet and she would never walk unaided on that foot the doctors treating her had decided against amputation at the mid calf they had not believed a woman of that age would cope with a prosthetic leg there had been a wheelchair in the corner of her kitchen but from the shiny newness of the frame and the clean tyres he had realized it had not been used and he didnt think it ever would be there had been no compelling reason for him to go and see the family but his memory of the beauty of that valley had drawn him back she was one of a few more than eleven hundred killed or wounded by mines since the guns had gone silent have you actually been there frau bierhof i am familiar with the situation there im sorry have you stood on the safety of the track that links ljut and vraca and viewed the valley i dont have the time to stand in each ruined village every minute of my day is spoken for he did not tell frau bierhof that the budget for demining which he coordinated for the government of bosniaherzegovina was above twentyfive million american dollars nor did he tell her of the numbers of accidents to the men who worked at his direction who were careless who would have no worthwhile pension nor did he tell her of the men killed or maimed in incidents the pleasantry used to describe suicidal attempts to end the stress of the work he went to his filing cabinet and pulled out a sheaf of photographs like a carddealer he flicked them blownup and in monochrome or colour across his desk he told her about the bunica valley each time she interrupted him he made a little gesture with his finger tapped his lips then went on he talked until she no longer interjected brought the valley into the steaming heat of the portakabin and his voice was quiet against the murmur of the arching fan on the window shelf beside his desk he talked until she reached into the pocket of her shoulderpadded jacket took out a handkerchief and dabbed her eyes he said there are a thousand such valleys i play god i preside over committees that decide the order in which they should be cleared some are disgustingly ugly and ruined with factory complexes some are as beautiful as this one what they have in common is that they are all destroying lives when i can justify it the valley will be cleared testicles were pinched mr gough and it hurt im sure it did mr cork one to one with the minister whatever thoughts we have of the relevance of our political masters is not a happy experience it was like being in the middle of an incendiary bomb attack he was powerfully angry unity is his text for the day what does the minister want mr cork does he want togetherness or does he want packer behind bars he wants a report we searched the property of course and didnt find anything of importance but then we didnt expect to tell him mr cork in your report that its about flushing foxes from cover driving them on to the guns the only fox hell ever have seen will have been on wandsworth common what you dont tell him is what im asking you to do i want a total trawl to identify any call on a mobile this morning from the pimlico district of london to sarajevo shouldnt be that difficult but i need the help of your old crowd and gchq and the national security agency are we moving from foxes to rotten apples jarring them up mr cork creating mistakes ill do that and what do i tell because i dont have time on my side my esteemed minister give him your word that there will be in the future total cooperation between the sierra quebec golf team and the national crime squad starting when i have to tell him when before christmas dammit todays the nineteenth of march he heard dougie goughs fulsome chuckle from the door and then the chief investigation officer was alone in his room for a full minute he paced the carpet images raced in his mind dennis cork had never been to the ardnamurchan peninsula but he knew mull morvern and moidart he saw dark hills set with granite escarpments and rough slopes the guns waited old farmers and postmen estate labourers crab fishermen and dougie gough with his pipe lit made a picket line they were out on the hillside to kill the vermin that took the lambs down the hill came the beaters with their dogs running free with the beaters was the young man with the heavylensed spectacles struggling to keep up cann the big dog fox sprang from a peat ditch and tried to double back through the beaters but the spaniels labradors and lurchers turned it the mistake of the dog fox was to run towards the guns it was a fine animal strong and healthy a lambtaker now cann was first among the beaters chasing it the dog fox was a bright colour on the dark slope of crushed bracken dougie gough had the shotgun up to his shoulder aimed fired and packer fell the beaters and the guns did not bother to retrieve the carcass they left it as carrion for the crows the images were gone dennis cork dialled the number of room at vauxhall bridge cross he played the old boys network and asked for the trawl to be tasked through gchq and on through the americans national security agency listening post at menwith hill on the yorkshire moors where the great dishes sucked in the pulses of mobilecall transmissions he pleaded priority for the precious resources of the computers he walked an uncertain line he was exposed he made a second call to the ministers principal private secretary powerful enemies faced him he promised that full cooperation with the national crime squad would begin soon he relied for the survival of his career on the dour gough and the young man cann and events in a faraway place over which he had no control is it all right the eagle sought reassurance its fine is he all right hes grand did you tell him that mister i told him not in these days of course but a long time ago when the eagle had been at boarding school and showing an interest in law classics masters preached the value of the study of latin and greek talked about expansion of the mind and intellectual discipline the eagle then sixteen years old had embarked on a twoyear study of which now little was remembered the fighting had been the most interesting part to a teenager the description of warfare and the generals who directed it a greek general and historian writing four centuries before the birth of christ had identified the surest way to win loyalty xenophon had written the sweetest of all sounds is praise the old greek warlord and writer had been ahead in man management and mister had learned the same art i told him he was indispensable i gave him all the smarm he needed you should watch him mister he doesnt fart without me knowing it yes im watching him hes not one of us leave it eagle i hear you youre one of us arent you you know i am you it was misters way the eagle recognized it to win from the disciples the acolytes blustered spluttered declarations of loyalty it demeaned them it gave him power over them he looked into misters dull eyes as he made his protestation his voice died the eagle had been left at the street corner above the house while mister and atkins had driven on up the hill to the open ground where theyd found the line of sight the day before now mister had walked back leaving atkins the mitsubishi and the launcher there the dusk was settling on the city mister said casually his place was turned over this morning atkinss place was done by the church he told you he doesnt know is he going to know not sure who told you crime squad theres white heat between crime squad and the church the church isnt sharing i dont want to know about friends in crime squad but when did they tell you a lot of questions eagle i heard this morning shouldnt you have told me i am your legal adviser mister what you going to do about it youre here theyre there itll keep mister i am telling you as your trusted adviser we have been away too long be careful you worry too much i pay you to worry but not to overdose on it the lights sprinkled below them were cut by the dark line of the river which in its turn was bisected by the shafts of headlights crisscrossing the bridges with the evening came the cold but it was not the cold that made the eagle shiver the dark line was the abyss into which the cruncher had fallen never could the eagle have said or thought that he was fond of the cruncher sometimes hed said to himself that the cruncher was a barrowboy sometimes a lowlife little shit the cruncher had always competed with him had intervened in matters that were not his a contract was drawn up but cruncher wanted to check out each paragraph and each subsection days of damn work and mister would tear it up because of the poison fed into his ear by the cruncher the eagle had never had misters ear the way the cruncher had but that had not stopped the cruncher from disappearing into the dark line that was the river cutting through the lights of the city below he heard a distant squealing of wheels the scrape of unoiled metal pieces he shivered hard he remembered the cruncher the last time hed seen him in the clerkenwell office over the launderette and his feet as always on the eagles desk his heels resting carelessly on files his body tipped back in a chair the monogrammed cigarette in his hand and the scent the conceit as hed talked about his plan for misters future in sarajevo his vision youre a businessman mister any businessman whos top of the tree in the uk expands his interests goes abroad doesnt sit on his hands goes looking for wider horizons the cruncher had been in the river for half a night and a day and another whole night like a drowned mongrel before hed been pulled out it had been a dogs death when are you going to do it mister do something about the cruncher you think id forgotten about the cruncher i didnt say youd forgot you think im scared to do something about the cruncher i didnt say you were scared you ever known me forget anything about disrespect you ever seen fear in me i only asked when itll happen eagle when im ready what i said eagle you worry too much a man with your brain your brilliance you dont have a call to worry the wheels squeal came closer was beyond the pool of light thrown down by the only high lamp on the street the sweetest of all sounds is praise he was not a man of violence his own weapon was in his supreme understanding of the law and yet he had made the devils bargain he had never hit a man in his life he had reduced a grown man an experienced surveillance executive officer through the ammu nition given to the qc to a muttering shambling wreck destroyed him more effectively than if hed been hit with a pickaxe handle broken him with his forensic intellect it was the eagle who had sprung mister from the trial but but but for all his scruples the violence inherent in mister was strangely mesmerizing to the eagle he had a place there beside the bully he was sheltered by the bully and it fascinated him when he thought of the violence he sweated hot excitement he wanted to see the launcher fired because that was misters response to a judge who had dared to stand against them and he had the brain knew it because mister had told him so and the brilliance they came up the hill into the pool of light and the city was below them mister had seen them the squeal of the wheels came with them the eagle doubted it was a labour of love thought it a labour of duty he didnt think he with his weight his stomach and his heart could have pushed the wheelchair up the incline they stopped on the nearer edge of the pool and the man leaned on the handles while the woman hung on to the wheels as if she feared she would slip back down the slope there was a wheeze in the mans chest if he didnt have a car it was because he was a fool the eagle didnt know a judge at the bailey or at snaresbrook belmarsh or at uxbridge crown court who treasured principles more than a black car and a driver he saw the wheels hit a stone and the chair rocked but it came on came closer to them and he didnt know a judge who would have lived in a hovel as the price of guarding his principles certainly not his own bloody father for whom the status the robes the bloody protocol were all that mattered when they were level with their house what there was of it and half lit by the one streetlamp the eagle felt the punch of a fist in the small of his back and mister stepped from the shadows the eagle did not have to follow him he was the voyeur a mere observer judge delic mister asked affably i understand you speak english thats what my friends say and youre miss jasmina delic id like a word please the judge stiffened his daughter cringed then straightened herself and her jaw jutted the eagle couldnt see misters face but he would have been smiling he always smiled when he pitchforked his way into peoples lives what about who are you the words were almost obscured by the panting from his exertion there was pride there and spirit but no strength one question at a time judge about the past and the present i am albert packer mr packer mister i am the subject authorized by you of an intrusivesurveillance order issued to joey cann of the customs and excise in london and it has caused me serious inconvenience thats what its about and thats who i am always the voice was quiet and they would have had to strain to hear him as the eagle did and in spite of the smile theyd have thought themselves locked in a ferrets gaze there were no cars on the street no other workers hurrying home and theyd have known it mister walked to them not hurrying measured stride what do you want with us the eagle thought the judge tried to marshal his courage mister in his overcoat would have seemed huge to them and theyd have seen the size of his hands and cann would have told them the case history they would know all about this man the importance of the churchs target one mister reached out to them the eagle saw his hands drop to the chairs armrest and grip it the chair shook rocked gently by mister it would be so easy for him to tip it over to spreadeagle her onto the street and he would have been smiling id like you judge and miss jasmina to come for a short walk with me nothing too far only take a few minutes do we have the choice she asked i wouldnt want you to feel threatened thats not my intention sincerely come on eagle come and lend a hand with mister he pushed the chair on up the hill and into the blanket of darkness the street went parallel to the side wall of the jewish cemetery above them was a black treeline topped by clear evening skies and a scattering of stars there were no lights in the ruined buildings they went past no ears to hear him if he screamed for help the judge could not protect his daughter nor would he leave her they went meekly together mister and the eagle propelled the chair but the judge walked close behind it had reached his hand forward and she held it he wondered at their dignity that neither shouted or struggled however hopeless it was to shout to struggle if mo knew what he did she would leave him be gone in the hour as would the girls he smelt the sweat of the longworn clothes on the judges body and the urine in his daughters bag they reached the small patch of level ground where a shed had stood where the mitsubishi was parked the sheds wooden walls were gone blown away when the house was holed but its concrete base remained the sidelights of the vehicle were switched on and threw enough light for them to see atkins standing beside the launcher slung low on the tripod mister and the eagle bumped her onto the concrete wheeled the chair to the launcher everything ready mister asked all in place mister atkins replied atkinss coat was neatly folded behind the launcher it was what made mister special everything was thought through with care was planned down to a kneeling mat mister didnt have to say anything more but tapped the judges shoulder and pointed to the folded coat atkins steadied him as he dropped on to it the viewfinder was infrared image intensifies the judge would be looking at a monochrome image of the roof of his home the detail of the viewfinder would be sufficient for him to see each tile the bricks of the chimney the sagging guttering the judge was whimpering rattling words in his own tongue to her it was a snapshot of all they owned the halfhouse and each other she was trying to push herself up from the chair and couldnt achieve it mister caught at the judges coat pulled him back marched him to the chair and turned him so that he faced his house get on with it atkins atkins crouched behind the launcher one hand rested on the tripod the other threw switches there was a slight but piercing whistle the eagle covered his ears they were lit in the moment of the firing then the fire flash was gone a bright line with a thunderclap of sound burst from the fire the line travelled down the hill cleared two broken buildings then impacted the roof fragmented below them as if he were on duty showing his paces and playing at a war game atkins dismantled the launcher the spent tube and the tripod and heaved them into the back of the vehicle youll be all right from here with miss jasmina wont you judge delic mister asked quietly its all downhill from here the air around them stank from the cordite firing charge atkins drove mister beside him and the eagle sat in the back clinging to the holding strap the wheels crackled over the broken tiles that were debris on the street at the bottom where it joined the main road two black mercedes passed them and sped on up the hill well done atkins mister said expert and professional she read the message back dear mister i have to go to gorazde tomorrow morning i am driving myself my driver is sick the other drivers are already allocated if your business work allows it would you consider accompanying me it would be interesting and perhaps fulfilling i apologize for the short notice i will call by the holiday inn tomorrow at am and i will look for you in the lobby it is not possible please do not have concern for me with good wishes monika holberg ps i very much enjoyed my day at visnjica she threaded her way from the table in the atrium through the mass of people to the overwhelmed clerks on reception a woman broke away from attending to the queue waiting to register took her message thrust it into the rooms pigeonhole gave her a harrassed smile and returned to filling in the cards skirling the xray machine and the metal detector arch she walked out through the swing doors monika had heard the explosion but there were often explosions in a sarajevo night it had taken more than forty minutes for the sfor troops italians to find the source of the explosion some of those they asked said it came from inside the jewish cemetary some said it was in the treeline above some said they had heard nothing and had slammed doors in the troops faces the local police knew of no explosion it had not been reported to the local fire brigade no local ambulance had been called eventually their jeep found a ruined house at the halfway point up steeply canted street they saw two mercedes limousines parked and found an old man and a young woman who was in a wheelchair and a group of men one of those men shavenheaded blackdressed a gold chain heavy on his throat explained courteously to the mareschallo that the street had been the front line in the war that munitions were habitually stored in the roofs of such building but were then sadly forgotten it was possible that the roof beams had shifted and in doing so had detonated a mortar bomb the old man and the young disabled woman had not spoken the mareschallo was thanked for his attention to the matter but was told with polite firmness that his presence was not required the jeep drove away joey had heard it the windows to his room were doubleglazed but the force of the explosion from up the hill across the miljacka river was insufficient to rattle the glass panes the sound was muffled more of a stuttering clap than a crisp detonation he drifted back to sleep maggie had forbidden him to go to the holiday inn sit in the van and watch it was as if he thought for a day he had stepped back over the line retrieved the die worn the uniform forgotten mister who was his target one he thought of jasmina she was the dream in his mind as he drifted and the faint words carved in the stecak stone five centuries before i stood praying to god meaning no evil yet i was struck to death by lightning his fingers had flickered over the lichened grooves of the writing the words on the stone were as a talisman to him whatever a man or a woman did however well they lived their lives the lightning could strike burn them there was a light rap on his door his name was called coming maggie he opened the door youre still a sight joey but its an improvement i feel better what sort of day have you had ive heard the welsh heros life story i think he wants to get his hand up my skirt hes rather sweet his wife chucked him out his kids are pining for him both sets of parents are on megans side of the fence yes sweet and sad but i think his hands are getting itchy most of what im hearing is that young man talking with the dogs or down on the floor playing with them and cuddling them there was some sort of rendezvous tonight that took ismet mujii and his gorillas out but there wasnt an explanation then going to be a meeting the day after tomorrow i dont know where sounds like the big meeting where the territorys cut an italians coming all the talks in a code diry talk she raised her eyebrows talking dirty in the church vernacular was conversation with criminal involvement talking social was about going to the supermarket or the corner shop for fags or about telling the wife that the new hairpiece suited her code talk is criminal talk right i think an italians coming and there are others i think its the meeting that matters shed kept the meat to the last had teased him if the meeting was the day alter tomorrow somewhere then she was inside the time limit set by her own people she thought that she was out on a parapet over a precipice as much as he was if she fell it would be his joey canns bloody fault thanks sleep well joey ohshe dropped it as if it was an afterthought do you know much about the italians he grinned ruefully no not a hell of a lot she thought she was safe thought it because a belief in her survival made life easier but it was now two years since she had rejected the vita blindata and dismissed her police bodyguards she had rejected the protective screen and had said to her husband when the mafia is intent on revenge it will always find a way she always made a joke with her husband who would want to pay for sex with a woman of fortynine who was fat had heavy dropping breasts and gross ankles but last night the word prostituta had been daubed in paint on the white exterior wall of their house she was giovanna she was in her second term as the sindaca of the mountain village of san giuseppe jato on the western side of the island of sicily it was the womens vote that had elected her again to the mayors office when her deputy luciano had found a bomb lodged under the front wheel hub of his car he had resigned and she had not been able to find a man to replace him her ticket for reelection had been the rejection of the cosa nostra path of violence and death she did not give herself sufficient importance if she were murdered to be listed as an illustrious corpse but she believed had to that she irritated the family who controlled the village she irritated them enough for a polio squartato to have been left on her doorstep four months before she had found the disembowelled chicken picked it up and walked with it down the main street women had shouted to her from their windows brava giovanna and she had placed the bleeding bird carefully on the step of the fine house near the church that was the principal residence of the family that gesture more than anything else she might have done ensured that women came to her talked to her of the secrets of the family she was told that evening in a whispered telephone call that the familys most trusted nephew marco was entrusted with a mission of importance by his uncle had gone with a packed case to the airport at messina was travelling to a meeting of significance giovanna thought marco a handsome boy and imporlant to the familys future a boy of intelligence but trapped by the poison in the f amilys bloodstream a boy with a life wasted a boy who might one day kill her mislter had gone a dozen paces past the end of the line ol black station wagons all with smokedglass windows past the knot of gossiping drivers when he jerked to a stop he was facing the swing doors of the hotel the noise of a hundred voices nasal and loud billowing and american buffeted him his eyes narrowed he peered through the doors he turned in one swinging movement and faced atkins he reached in his belt took the pistol from it and palmed it to atkins leave it in the vehicle he said and yours and get the vehicle down the warehouse now he waited until atkins had driven away right eagle lets see what the partys for they went through the door shrugged out of their coats and laid them on the conveyor belt feeding the xray machine they went through the metal detector and were bleeped because of the coins in misters pocket and the metallined case for the eagles spectacles by the machine and the arch stood men with cropped haircuts and long shapeless coats with fleshcoloured wires coiled between their shirt collars and their ears they were passed through every seat in the atrium bar was taken every table was littered with ashtrays beer glasses coffee cups and pepsi cans at the far end of the bar a woman addressed the little forest of microphones cameramen climbed on the softcushioned seats to see better there was bedlam at the desk they collected their keys and mister was given a note from his pigeonhole eagle asked the receptionist who are all these people whats going on she told the eagle that the american secretary of state was due at the hotel in two hours on a leg from paris and vienna last stop before returning to washington this was only the advance party mister heard what she said but hardly listened he read the note again and felt a small sensation of excitement better than when the launcher had fired the eagle repeated what the receptionist had told him yes yes i heard it the first time he laughed quietly would have been choice if id gone through without thinking but you always think mister dont you mister was smiling tomorrows not busy not till the evening and its the day after tomorrow that matters anyway ill be out of town on a little trip you and atkins can lose yourselves cant you till the evening buckets to do here the eagle said buckets of fun to be had he thought there was a brittle snap in the eagles voice if it hadnt been for the message he might have kicked the eagles shin but hed read it they walked to the lift the eagle as always pushed the outside button for him and stood aside to let him enter first then pushed the inside button for their floor mister was slow to recognize sarcasm it was too far back in his life for him to remember the last man who had been sarcastic to his face chapter fifteen henry hadnt left a contact address hed been vague infuriatingly obtuse about where he could be reached when he was abroad may be in and out of several hotels ill be on the move it wouldnt really be a good idea for you to call me or me to call you its only for a few days it had never been mo arbuthnots habit to quiz her husband on his work and shed let it go hed kissed her cheek and said hed ring from heathrow when he was back in the country three hours before while she and the girls had slept the cars had crunched onto the peppercoloured gravel of the drive the dogs in the kitchen had woken first had disturbed mo and shed seen in a halfawake haze the headlights against her bedroom curtains shed heard the dogs barking and the chorus of birdsong in the gardens trees the slamming of doors the scrape of feet across the gravel and the peal of the bell shed gone down the stairs shrugging into her dressinggown and peered through the front doors spyhole theyd activated the security lights they were well lit a cluster of men and one woman on the step one face was masked by a plume of pipesmoke shed called out that they should identify themselves and small cards were held up to the spyhole shed opened the door four of the men and the woman had pushed past her no word said but the one with the pipe the eldest biting on its stem puffing like a damned chimney had intoned the text of the authorized warrant to search her home then handed her the sheet of paper as if she might want to check that an error had not been made she hadnt bothered to read it but she had claimed had insisted that there had to be an error i doubt it the older man had growled we make very few errors maam a police car was parked behind their cars but the two uniformed men stayed in it as if this was not their business she had demanded the names of the intruders and had been ignored when the older man had stepped sideways in the hall to go by her she had proclaimed with all the haughtiness she could muster that she did not permit smoking in her home hed smiled a chilling crack at the side of his mouth then strolled back on to the outer doorstep where he had whacked his pipe against the raised heel of his polished shoe and the embers had fallen onto the grouted bricks hed left them glowing there and gone by her without proper points of contact mo arbuthnot had no one to call no one to cry to for help she thought her home was violated two of them were in her husbands study his inner sanctum off the far end of the lounge one was in the dining room and had the drawers and books out of the antique rosewood desk where she recorded the household accounts another had chosen the oak chest jacobean in the sitting room it had been like a wound to her but the worst of the wounds had not been the rape of her privacy or the silent shock on the faces of her daughters who clung to each other at the top of the stairs it was the woman and the family dogs the woman had gone into the kitchen and left the door open the dogs should have been leaping at her or getting behind her legs and snarling at her ankles she was down on the kitchens heavyweave carpet scratching bellies crooning to them she had bought their affection then she had started to search every cupboard every shelf to open every cookery book kept on top of the dresser the older man his warm pipe pocketed tramped up the stairs she saw the politeness with which he requested the girls to move aside and make way for him he went into her bedroom out of her sight he would have been sifting in the drawers of her dressingtable and that hurt too but nothing hurt as cruelly as the betrayal of her dogs mo arbuthnot knew little of her husbands work he was a criminal lawyer he worked through the week in london and brought little of the work home at weekends he did not discuss his caseload with her not what i come down here for hed say down here is for getting away from it sometimes on a sunday evening hed shut himself away in his study for an hour and she and the girls would be in the sitting room with the television then hed bring out his briefcase and leave it by the front door for the early mondaymorning departure it was always locked at dinner parties or drinks sessions at home or at their friends if henry was asked about work he would answer in generalities and effortlessly steer away the talk legal stuff anything that comes along enough to make a c r u s t hows the cricket team doing this summer the crust she was not stupid she could do the arithmetic was in excess of two hundred thousand pounds in income a year and there was a stocks portfolio and a pension scheme she was looked after as were the girls schools and the horses few of the women she knew in the village of her status had a finger on the pulse of their husbands finances she understood so little of his life and never pressed to be told not often occasionally not more than once a calendar month the phone would ring and henry would he in the garden or at the stables and shed answer it and a very softspoken voice would say mrs arbuthnot so sorry to trouble you hope its not inconvenient can i speak to him please its mister shed go to the front door or the kitchen door or the french windows off the dining room and shout that he was wanted and who wanted him and henry would always come running mister was henry said just another client they left they look nothing with them went empty handed to their cars she hated them but most of all their chief you seeshe said with venom you made a mistake as a piece of rudeness this is beyond belief you bullock into my home you disturb me you terrify my girls and al the end of otl the exercise was without the slightest justification the older man said as he lit his pipe what you should remember maam and tell your husband upon his return is that as a more unpleasant creature than myself once remarked we only have to be lucky once you have to be lucky every time good day maam she went to the phone rather than to her daughters it was the sixth time shed called their office number she was too stressed to consider or ponder on it that the previous five times shed dialled out none of the men nor the woman had objected they had not tried to prevent her spreading the word of their search and she was rewarded josh thank god ive got you its mo arbuthnot i am in the middle of a nightmare no no i mean it our house home us weve been invaded by people from the customs they had a warrant theyve been through every nook and cranny of course im trying to be calm i dont know where henry is i dont know what its all about they never told me they were here three hours theyve just gone where is he i want him found find him and tell him that his home and his family have been subjected to a nightmarish intrusion i dont care what he told you weve been treated like criminals and i dont know why was that all right mr gough the woman sqg asked him that was dandy we didnt find anything they were out of the lanes and had reached the bypass skirting guildford it was more than satisfactory far from home and a panic call down the phone sobs and screams thatll make eagles day i thought it went well and yesterday do you know my dear you or i would have to work for thirty years without deductions of tax pension scheme and national insurance and not touch our salary only bank it to afford that house perhaps itll be on the market soon do you mind if i take a nap i doubt therell be much opportunity for sleep later the note had come by hand delivery it was dropped through the letterbox and the bell was rung to alert her to its presence on the mat the princess nee primrose hinds took the envelope back to her bed she settled against her feather pillows and slit open the envelope my dearest princess i miss you its going well but slowly i hope to leave on the nd rd at the latest hope all is good with you with love mister xxxx a letter from mister was a rare treasure she understood why he never used the telephone and why she must never call him even when hed been on remand in brixton and shed been forbidden to visit him he had never written verbal messages had passed between them via the eagle it would have been five years or six since he had last written from amsterdam she would have been with him in amsterdam but for the influenza she kissed the letter then lay back on the bed for a few moments held a pillow and thought of him then she went to the ensuite bathroom tore the page into small pieces and flushed them down the pan as he would have wanted her to through the hotels big groundfloor windows joey saw the arclights that burned down on the secretary of state the wire services and the satellite news programmes would carry his words society here has to rid itself of corrosive corruption citizens of bosnia herzegovina you must resist the extremists and the criminals you have to turn your backs on the past an american officer would interrupt the great man cut him short in midstride and would say into the microphone im afraid ladies and gentlemen weve run out of time if were to make our flight window joey watched the stampede of the circus around the great man as they went out with him through the swing doors the secretary of state was hemmed in by bodyguards military liaison officers advisers stenographers and his own travelling media and all were hurrying to the long line of stationwagons governed by their pecking order of importance they couldnt get shot of the place fast enough couldnt race to the airport and climb onto the too soon troops waved them away sirens escorted them down zmaja od bosne which had been snipers alley a stillness seemed to settle on the yellow and chocolate hotel building as if all inside it now caught their breath sighed sagged joey saw the white unhcr truck pull up in the space where the stationwagon convoy had been she slipped out of the vehicle he recognized her she was only halfway to the swing doors when mister came through them they were like kids meeting in a park no kisses but their handshake was more about touching and holding than formal greeting he couldnt hear their laughter but watched the mute pleasure on their faces when they drove away joey followed in the van she had the wheel mister was beside her they went past the new american headquarters camp on the far side of the airport and along the road were stretched little wooden shacks closed and locked she said its a little part ol the black market later in the day they will be opened they sell every cd and video you ever heard of all illegally recorded theyve paid no duty on them no copyright other than the market of servicing foreigners the only industry is black it is worse on the tuzla road there are not cds and videos in the huts on the way to tuzla it is women young women some from bosnia but most from outside romania bulgaria ukraine when they have been trained here they are sent on to brothels in western europe it is a disgusting exploitative trade always mister it is the criminals who win here i am sorry it is gloomy but that is the reality they climbed on hairpin bends and came to the village of tvorno there was lustreless snow beside the road but the ice on it glistened prettily in the early sunshine rows of houses on the approach were gutted roofless and burned sandwiched between the road and a tumbling river beyond the river were rolling forested hills then mountains that were snowswept formidable and magnificent he was looking at the wreckage she said we call them cabriolet houses do you understand it is houses without roofs i am sorry perhaps you do not think that funny i promise you mister it is sometimes necessary to have a dark humour if you work here if you are too serious then you would weep it is very beautiful yes the road came down from the high ground into a wide agricultural valley leaving the snow and ice behind them she pulled off the road produced battered wellused thermos and poured coffee for them they stood beside her vehicle and looked down at the valley and the big river running through it and at a town beyond the river where there were closeset houses and the chimneys of industrial plants he looked for damage all he saw was the collapsed bridge that had spanned the river and had linked the town to the main road the water now flowed over the bridge she said it is foca i dont go there it is a place of evil i should go there i could go with troops from the sfor but i do not wish to there is suffering there the same as everywhere but i am not perfect do you think it wrong to care less for the suffering of some than i do for others i could not argue if you thought that mister do you see men fishing they have no work and they fish for food to eat the factories have stopped the chemicals leak into the river it is the drina river i would not eat the fish but they are desperate i do not go to foca because it is a place where war criminals walk everyone knows their names who the beasts are you could meet them on the street in foca just as in sarajevo you could meet ismet mujic in six years only once have the sfor dared to try to capture one of them janko janjic the mass rapist and mass cleanser he had an eagle tattooed on his stomach and the words slaughter me on his neck every minute of every day he had a handgrenade hanging from his throat and he pulled the pin when german troops came to take him the rapist and the murderer in foca was a hero many thousands went to his funeral myself and a good man like you mister we do not know how to speak with such creatures he kissed her at that moment first her cheeks then her forehead then her eyes then her lips how long will you he here just a couple more days but you will come back i will bring more lorries but that wont be as important as coming back to see you mister held her close hugged her it was not the way he embraced his princess he clung to her as if he had been infected by the misery she spoke of i will come back not send people who could do it instead of me ill come back because youre herei dont talk a lot monika you are the best human being ive ever met he saw the openness of her face and the trust he had thought of her at first as a contact a tool to be used an opportunity lo be exploited they were alone beside the road and his arms were tight round her she was looking down the way he held her she could see his left hand she was looking at his hand and the heavy gold ring on his third finger the ring the princess had given him come on mister charity man lets hit gorazde she disentangled herself her face was flushed it was eighteen years since he had married his princess and in that time he had not touched another woman they drove alongside the drina river passed the wreckage ol the front line and went on through the flattened emptiness of no mans land goraz de was a finger town pressed down between the hills mister never reached across her and looked into the mirror never saw that he was tracked he would sleep with her after the meeting he would sleep whole night with her before going to the airport and taking the plane home because he would sleep with her afterwards he knew was certain of it he would be supreme at the meeting a methodical man with a long training of counterintelligence operations behind him sandor dizo was a survivor eighteen years of his professional life had been in the service of the state protection directorate but in he had effortlessly changed allegiance not desk chair or working hours and had become an executive of the office of national security he had the same view of the roofs of budapest from the same room as hed had before the collapse of socialism then he had worked to stifle internal dissent now he turned the same standards of intellect to combating the rise in newly democratic hungary of the influence of organized crime he had unlearned the practices taught him by the kgb instructors and had learned those of the drug enforcement administration of the united states and the security service of the united kingdom he was todays man the work of that day and many others past and many to come was his surveillance of the movements of russians who were active in the vory vzakone crime group if sandor dizo had had available to him today the powers of coercion he had enjoyed prior to the opportunities of the old days there would have been no russian criminals on hungarian territory but those powers had been withdrawn he was now a creature of government by computer provided by the americans and fieldcraft taught by the british instead of broken noses and broken necks he followed the new rules and provided the printouts listing the coming and going of the russians and filled the files with their photographs it was not a surprise to sandor dizo that the russians now flourished in budapest they ran prostitution controlled the clubs moved and sold narcotics laundered money through the recently opened hanks directed the countrys oildistribution mafia they were behind every ripoff fraud of public and private enterprises they trafficked weapons and they killed being an exact man sandor dizo could list each of the one hundred and sixty killings and attempted murders and bomb explosions on his capital citys streets since he had joined the office of national security on the fingers of one of his plump hands he could count the minimal number of arrests and convictions of those responsible without interfering with their operations he had gained a comprehensive knowledge of the russian groups nikki gornikov had left budapest that morning he had been photographed leaving his apartment on prater street and photographed again on line of the metro he had then been seen to take the classic antisurveillance procedure of diving for a taxi had been spotted at the airport and watched on to the vienna flight by the time those strands of information had been sifted on sandor dizos desk nikki gornikov could have driven a hundred miles from vienna or could have boarded any of a dozen flights he called him ironically when he thought of him baby nikki because he was a fortynineyearold bear bull of a man with a face made ugly by smallpox and knife fights on baby nikki there was a fifteenpage computer printout and a fourcentimetrethick file was laid down by the american and british tutors of a democratic intelligence service he noted the departure of baby nikki gornikov of the vory vzakone group from budapest put another page in the file and hoped the man wherever he had gone might slip stumble fall under a convenient tram or trolley bus the place for such a man so sadistic cruel and vicious a man as nikki gornikov was the prison yard at dawn his tasks of the morning done sandor dizo called to his secretary in the outer office for coffee and some biscuits if there were any it was their graveyard but when the muslims were put out of their homes the serb boys used it as a football pitch after her death at st matthews hospice after the funeral service in church his mothers body had been cremated her ashes now lay in an oakwood casket in the crematoriums garden of remembrance it was a lovely garden cleanraked and dignified in winter bright with flowers in summer if kids had come into that garden just across the north circular from where he lived to play football over her casket mister would have taken a shotgun to them or a pickaxe handle or an industrial strimmer or a chainsaw none of the little tossers would have been in a state to kick a football again none of the little bastards would have had the knees to walk again let alone run but that wasnt monikas answer i dont blame the serb children she said they know nothing else they have never been shown another way isnt there a proper pitch in the village where all the kids can play there was but it was a park for tanks it was destroyed there is no pitch he stood beside her and looked across the graveyard that was a soccer field she had gone into the unhcr field office in gorazde left him lor less than five minutes which had seemed an age lo him then theyd driven on through the town and out of it beyond the old no mans land theyd reached a village where the majority ol the homes were intact pretty perched on hillsides and had fields where cattle browsed on the first of the springs fresh grass the village was called kopaci shed said he saw the gravestones low old and poorly carved that had been used as goalposts the other stones which had been near the penalty spots at either side of the penalty boxes and across the halfway line had been uprooted and thrown aside they marked the sidelines ol the pitch she had changed him he knew it a few kids stood with their parents and grandparents by two houses the families had returned from exile lor their former homes to find their graveyard was a football pitch well worn and often played on it had no grass but had been smoothed by boots and trainers into flattened wet mud im going to meet them are you coming with me he shook his head more coffee with a spoonful of grit more losing at cards no thank you a quarter of an hour they have to be reassured if they give up go back into gorazde then five years is wasted it is important to spend time with them if only a few minutes ill be here mister said wont be going far he started to walk down the hillside track the warmth was on his face and his back he was humming his elvis he reached the end of the track where it joined the road he was strolling and had not a care he could not remember when he had last walked on a country track if he ever had because of the warmth he slipped out of his coat and carried it on his arm he was at peace he looked up the road wondering how far he should walk and what he might see and he saw the blue van it was parked a hundred yards up the road and faced the junction the sun reflected off the vans windscreen dazzled him for a moment but when he edged forward and twisted his body further he could see through the windscreen he saw the small pale face the tousled hair and the big spectacle lenses mister thought the head would turn away duck try to hide itself but it did not there was the howl of a klaxon horn the lorry missed him by a foot could have been less mister felt the sweat coming on his body he saw the finger on the arm jutting from the window and the gesture of contempt from the lorry driver he shouted back emptily uselessly at the lorrys tail he had seen them leave the hotel cann trailing the woman carrying the bag and the case seen them going in time to catch the morning flight out he looked both ways up the road and down it and there were no other vehicles parked only the blue van he turned his back on it and walked off down the road was mister frightened he was never frightened whod ever seen him frightened no one had he went at a good pace he had no destination he strode on the road and knew he was followed he gained a target had to have one he was walking faster ahead of him sheep and goats grazed by the road watched by a shepherd and children above the animals up the slope was the graveyard he stopped near the shepherd who leaned on a long stick a scarecrow figure in his loose clothing the children had ceased their game stood in a little knot and stared at him he turned looked back up the road he began to run towards the van but it reversed when he ran faster it backed faster away from him when he slowed it slowed he stopped the van stopped the distance was a hundred yards he knew he showed his anger christ and it was beneath his dignity to show his anger he ret raced his steps over which hed run and then walked and the blue van followed him he nodded curtly to the shepherd then tried to smile at the children through his anger he sat down on the grass the shepherd and the children watched him and the animals grazed around him as long as he could he tried not to turn but the compulsion beat him cann sat on a rock near to the blue van crosslegged like a pygmy bloody pixie if hed started to run towards him he wouldnt have covered ten of the paces before cann was back in the van not twenty before the van was backing away and he would have lost his selfrespect from what he knew of the church and the crime squad the greatest crime of surveillance was to show o u t b u t cann sat where he could be seen mister did not understand why wasnt the little bastard frightened of him she was standing at the top of the slope at the edge of the graveyard and waved to him round her were the few kids from the two families cann was on the rock a statue he walked to her scrambled up the slope twice he slipped and mud smeared his trouser legs she was laughing and said he was crazy she held his hand we have to leave mister she said we need to be past tvorno before night we should not be on the ice in the darkness theres nothing to keep us here mister had his arm round her hip as they walked to her vehicle she waved to the kids and to the older people at the graveyard to the shepherd and the children with him she was behind the wheel she kissed his cheek they drove away towards gorazde the light had begun to fail as they cleared the finger town and began to climb and her hand rested on his except when she changed gears his face was turned away from her so that she would not see the fury that winnowed through him no man stood against mister then walked away august it was their fourth morning and that morning it rained it was incredible to husein bekir hed had to scratch in his memory to recall when it had last rained in that summer month the clouds had gathered the previous evening and at dusk the storm had started the thunder had echoed into the valley from the west the lightning had lit the valley as if it was the middle of the day and the wind had gathered through all of the night the gales had howled by the morning the fourth the storm had passed and left only a steady drizzle in its wake when the mineclearers had come on the first morning husein had immediately left his home abandoned his breakfast grunted at his wife as shed hobbled after him down the track that he would not be long and gone over the ford he had bearded them where they had made their day camp a battered caravan a stinking portable lavatory and a parking space for their three pickup trucks and the two ambulances up the track from dragan kovacs house hed asked the same question of the foreman on every morning since he asked it again when are you going to start to clear my fields and he had the same answer on the four consecutive mornings first we do the pylons your fields come after the pylons and the restoration of the electricity my fields are more important than electricity your fields are next year if theres the money on the first three mornings husein had then shuffled down the track to dragan kovacs home had beaten on the door and demanded fresh coffee and a substitute breakfast then hed launched into a criticism of the foreman and the six deminers and hed denounced the priority of the electricity pylons but he had won no sympathy his friend the idle fool dragan had as little interest in the fields as they showed that fourth morning he was not going to visit dragan kovac the morning before when he had launched into the complaint that his fields were not given enough priority his friend the old fool had remarked that husein was now too aged too feeble to work the fields dragan had said it was a dream no more than a fantasy that husein with his withered muscles would ever be able to plant the new apple orchard that would eventually be harvested by his grandson dragan had said that the fields were his history that his present should be a game of chess a seat in the sunshine and a glass of homebrewed brandy or two glasses the morning before blinking tears and shouting curses he had left dragans house and waded back over the ford the foreman stood in the caravans door behind him the men read newspapers smoked and drank coffee in the ambulances the medics had their feet up on the dashboards and their radios played loud music all his life husein bekir had worked his fields in storms hail showers and in the heat that blistered his skin to husein bekir the foreman his men and the medics seemed lazy and complacent showed no understanding of his need to go back to his fields on the other side of the track from the junction where the caravan and the trucks were parked was the bunker that had protected the right flank of ljut village leaning against its stone wall beside its cave entrance was a new sign on a redpainted background was a white skull with crossed bones behind it and one word mina all the way down the track on both sides little posts had been put into the ground and yellow tape slung between them there was no tape on his fields only a slim corridor to the nearest of the pylons from which power cables dangled he would not speak to dragan kovac until he had received abject apologies for the insult that he was too old too feeble and the frustration fed his anger do you not work if it rains it will clear soon we will work when the rain stops do you have no sense of urgency what i have is five toes on each foot four fingers and a thumb on each hand eyes in my head and two balls i have them old man because i dont hurry if you used those machines i have seen them on television you could clear my fields why dont you bring the machines the foreman said patiently as if talking to an idiot we have flails fastened to the fron of a vehicle that is reinforced with armour plate they dont clear ground to the standard necessary for a certificate of clearance we only use them to cut back scrub what about those things you carry the things that find metal you could go faster if you had them we have metal detectors but theyre about useless in this situation for two reasons first there is minimal metal in the pma and prom mines they are made from plastic second there are minerals in the ground in the rock strata which contaminate the signal also there are the pylon cables which confuse the machine husein bekir snorted he was being backed and he knew it into a culdesac from which there was no retreat his voice rose in strident attack how then will you one day when it is convenient to you clear my fields perhaps we will bring dogs but the greater part of the work will be on hands and knees manually with the probe we can push the probe four inches into the ground that is how we do it the foremans quiet rebuttals seemed as insulting as dragan kovacs sneer that he was too old and too feeble i dont know how you can clear the land if you cannot even put in posts stakes that will survive one nights storm weather husein said what do you mean down past kovacs house your posts are already blown over by the wind because you did not sink them deep enough the ground is very hard oh the ground is hard it is too hard in the summer too wet in the winter i am sorry you do not find perfect ground not hard not wet i work in my fields when it is hot when it is cold ill look at the posts do me a favour go home when i have shown you the posts that you cannot put in the ground because it is too hard i will walk with you to rid himself of husein bekir the foreman as if making a great sacrifice in the interests of peace threw away the dregs of his coffee and went to the nearest of the pickup trucks when he reappeared he was carrying a small sledgehammer they walked in silence down the track the clouds were breaking over the high ground in the west and at the limit of huseins eyesight were small patches of blue sky he thought that within an hour there would be a rainbow and then the day would clear they would have no excuse any longer to shelter in their caravan in spite of the drizzle the birds were calling sharply a thrush flew with the trophy of a wriggling worm to an elder bush a sparrow was chased by finches and there were little showers of redwings wheeling in formation the storm in the night had greened his fields if he had had cattle he would have blessed the rain that gave life to the fields that had been burned by the sun but he did not have cattle and there was now a yellow tape strip to separate the fields from the track if he had had crops maize or wheat or vegetables the storm rain would have brought them to a peak before the september harvest but the fields were not ploughed and he had no crops with his rolling gait his hip and knee both aching husein hurried towards the lord and the foremans boots thudded behind him there were two posts down not more than twentyfive centimetres from the chipped stones of the track the tape lay on the thick grass verge of course husein bekir could have taken the one step onto the grass picked up the two posts worked them back into their two holes and tautened the yellow tape he could have done it when he had walked up the track half an hour earlier to beard the men in their caravan but he had made his point how could they talk about clearing his land more than two hundred and fifty thousand square metres of it if they could not make two posts secure he stood triumphant the foreman barked you brought me down here because of that husein walked on he heard the thump ol the sledgehammer behind him he stopped looked behind him and grinned slyly to himself one post was in the foreman stepped back onto the track moved along it half a dozen strides and paused by the second fallen post i do not like to have my time wasted the foreman shouted after him husein was about to turn from the corner of his field of vision he saw the foremans left boot on the track but as the man leaned forward to retrieve the second post he settled his right boot half a metre beyond the track as he bent and reached his weight transferred to his right leg the clap of the sound dinned into husein bekirs ears the brightness of the flash seemed to blind him the wind caught him and he heard the foreman shriek when the eagle came out of the hotels lift atkins saw his face it was pale wiped with a deathly pallor and shock was written on it his eyes were dulled and his mouth slack they had killed the day on another tourist drive but the eagle hadnt been interested they had driven again out towards pale and back again after lunch at reception there had been six message slips in the eagles pigeonhole and hed taken them upstairs whats the problem seen a ghost were late they were late for the appointment to meet ismet mujic they drove towards the old quarter the eagles head was bowed do you want to talk about it atkins asked talk about what talk about whatever your problem is it is a problem the eagle said quietly a unique problem in my experience my clerks been on the phone for me under pain of death by garrotting my clerk is not supposed to contact me unless the worlds falling in has it fallen in my home was raided it dawn this morning the church came mobhanded with a warrant all legal and turned it over had my wife out of bed woke the kids stripped the place what did they find they found nothing they look away nothing atkins trieid to smile to reassure then theres no problem you know very little atkins you jump when you should stand still the church god give them credit for a modicum ol intelligence know theres nothing in my home and nothing in my grubby little office im not that bloody stupid what matters is in safety deposits and in my head they wouldnt have expected to find anything so whats the big deal posting a letter to me felling me where i stand a man said lo my wife we have to be lucky once you have to be lucky every time that was the text of the message atkins wife traumatized girls in shock neighbours wondering what the hells going on at dawn at good old henrys pad turning the bloody screw squeezing till it hurts going for the weak spot tightening the wire to breaking point thats my problem can you cope a wintry little grin played at the eagles mouth probably not much better but better than you what does that mean atkins turned confused gazed at the eagle hadnt seen the pedestrian who screamed waved a stick angrily at them please watch the road the church did your address yesterday atkins hissed why wasnt i told christ you didnt tell me misters decision because youre only on probation that is so bloody insulting the eagle pointed to a gap in the cars parked in the narrow street overhung with narrow balconies theres a space there you can get into it you were on the treadmill you could have got off you didnt so dont whine ive been on the treadmill twentysomething years it goes faster get off and you fall on your bloody face they left the mitsubishi both sombre they rang the bell were let in and escorted up the stairs they heard the dogs pawing the inner door they saw the big teeth and the snarl in the set of the jaws they were shown into the bedroom the bed atkins thought was big enough for a family enver was on his stomach and the sheet had ridden down to expose his bronzed back and his buttocks serif wore a tshirt and the sheet covered his groin serif said they were late and they both apologized he took a sheet of paper rested it on a magazine drew a map for them said where they should be the next day and at what time and they both thanked him serifs question where was mister the eagles answer engaged in ugandan practices what were ugandan practices oh sorry just slipped out beg pardon ugandan practices are an expression we have in london for pursuing business contacts they were dismissed on the pavement atkins asked if i was to jump off the treadmill what would i get mud on your face if i were representing you id urge you to plead seven years to ten years but i wouldnt be representing you id be beside you and looking at twelve to fifteen thats why we dont jump the talk was in the bedroom when the visitors came not the living room and after theyd gone maggies frustration grew because the talk stayed in the bedroom the giggles gasps and the whine of the springs were enough to activate the microphone in the living rooms telephone but the talk was too muffled too dominated by the sounds of the loving and the beds heaving for her to comprehend what was said shed given the earphones to frank and his expression had screwed into a sneer hed passed the earphones to each of the sreb four frank was closest to her in the rented room and sometimes his hand rested on her hip she knew now the names of each of the survivors of the srebienica massacre salko and ante muhsin and fahro theyd have seen franks hand on her hip but they showed no sign of it being with them feeling the pressure of his hand softened the frustration then the telephone bell then the padding of bare feet her pencil was poised she scribbled da serif da russian language it is nikki i come tomorrow the agreed schedule russian language ok nikki i meet you i take you russian language it is all ok russian language all ok the call was cut she heard the feet pad away then the springs sang and there was distant laughter maggie bolton was fluent in russian she had an italian coming to a meeting and a russian but she did not yet know the location of the meeting quite deliberately she took franks hand from her hip and laid it on her thigh the lights had been in the mirror through ustikolina and when theyd gone by the nowhere turning to the bombed bridge of foca on the open roads before and after milievina and when they climbed on the ice surface for the gorge that led to tvorno always the lights were with them holding their intensity because the distance between them did not grow and did not close each time mister looked in the mirror he saw the lights of the blue van she did not speak the road and its ice held her attention she did not hold his hand any longer she had the wheel and the gearstick and she searched ahead for the longer thicker stretches of ice water ran down the rock faces beside the road and spilled onto the tarmac always the lights were with him and with the mirror would you stop please what sorry monika could you stop please what for i am just asking you to stop please ah i understand you want aa pee stop you can say so please stop very gently not using the foot brake but going down through her gears she stopped he stepped out his feet slipped and he steadied himself against the vehicle the headlights shone hard at him and mister walked towards the lights if the secretary of state had not been at the hotel if there had not been a metal detector arch in the hotel lobby if his pistol had not been left in the mitsubishi he would have had the weapon in his hand the lights had stopped moving and the interior lit as the door was opened cann came forward and stood in black silhouette in front of the lights the little bastard faced him mister blinked as he came closer to the lights if he had had the weapon in his hand he would have used it there was hate in his heart men he had not hated were entombed in concrete foundations were buried in epping were weighted on the sea bed or walked on sticks cann stood ahead of the lights his body diminished by their size got a problem mister he couldnt see the mouth but light caught the rims of the big spectacles whats a nice girl like that doing with a piece of shit like you he walked through the question mister faced his persecutor he towered over the shadowy shape in front of him the lights blazed in his face made tears in his eyes not going to have a weep on me are you mister mister lashed out right fist low short arm punch the fist buried itself in the slight stomach the body jackknifed would have fallen if the fist hadnt caugt the coat collar he dragged cann round the side of the blue van to the back of it he threw cann against the doors then punched him again first the solar plexus and as the head dropped the uppercut to the jaw cann went down mister kicked him kept kicking him nearly fell on the ice should have had heavier shoes should have had the boots the cards wore when they went out for a kicking with lead or iron caps he reached down found the coat pulled the body up no resistance arms trying to protect the upper body hands over the face he punched until his hands hurt put cann down then kicked until his toes hurt in his handmade shoes it was hard for mister to see the small figure on the road behind the van he walked away the voice was small behind him that was a mistake mister a mistake mister went back to the van she said laughing that it was a long pee stop his knuckles bled and he hid them from her joey reached his room he knew she was back ante was in the lobby and muhsin lounged on the landing near her door hed been off the road twice but hed been lucky a tractor had pushed him back from the drift once and a pickup had towed him clear the second time hed gone twice into the snow because his spectacles arms were broken and when the frame had fallen from his nose hed swerved there wasnt a part of his body that wasnt in pain he went into the bathroom he held the spectacles and his hand shook the mirror showed him his face blood scratches rising wels he managed his coat shirt and vest but the pain in his stomach wouldnt allow him to bend and unfasten the laces of his trainers he pushed his trousers down and his underpants to his ankles he stood in the shower clinging lo the chrome support without it he would have collapsed the water ran over him and drenched his trousers pants socks and puddled in his trainers he heard the room door open youre back yes a good day a useful day joey croaked i needed a new pair of knickers and clean tights good there must have been a sob in his voice he held tight to the support she was in the bathroom doorway the curtain wasnt drawn she was looking at him the water ran in rivers across his spectacles what happened to you through the lenses her face was blurred he didnt know whether she cared or not he grimaced but that hurt his mouth his jawbone his cheeks and his brain i walked into a door did the door have boots and fists or just boots if the door had had a gun i think it might have been rather more serious she came into the bathroom and knelt beside the shower the waler splashed from his body onto her packer he nodded she untied his trainer laces and pulled them off his feet then the sodden socks then his underpants and his trousers and threw each of them into the bath the water had plastered her careful hair and had made streams of her more careful makeup she sat on the bath edge pulled a towel off the rack and rubbed her hair and face youre not the worlds most beautiful sight is there blood in your urine dont know are you going to live i hope so theres a russian coming coming where coming for a meeting for tomorrows meeting wheres it to be i dont have the location clean tights dont matter not like knickers ive got to get back do you want a doctor tomorrow then i follow where he leads my bloody bumper

deeds for unfortunates out of unhcr youll find her in novo sarajevo third floor apartment h fojnicka be a shame wouldnt it joey if she didnt know what mister was what he did wouldnt be a shame if when shes learned it she kept her legs together and mister didnt get his over you up for that could be you want me lo dry you ill manage she closed the door after her joey staggered to the bed he was dripping wet he collapsed onto it he might have passed out but for the pain and the memory he was back on the ground squirming on the ice the tarmac to make himself smaller as the lists and boots rained in on him that was a mistake misler a mistake the hammering in his body and his head was on the door he shouted yes are you cann customs and excise he crawled off the bed leaned on the wall and then the wardrobe to steady himself held the towel across his privates and opened the door the man wore a grey suit was five or so years older than cann had a good shirt and a nice tie he looked at cann with contempt a replica of the sons of the landowner his father managed for superiority buried under a caked veneer of politeness sorry to disturb you mr cann by god youve been in the wars dont tell me let me guess tripped down some steps did you im hearn from the embassy ive been asked to pass to you a message that came to us via the ministry of justice i do apologize for the inconvenience of calling on you so late but we thought it the sort of matter that should not have been passed for fear of misunderstandings by telephone you had written authorization from judge zenjil delic for intrusive surveillance of the uk national albert william packer during that gentlemans visit to sarajevo you can go home now mr cann which might save you another accident judge delic informs us through the ministry of justice that he has with drawn such authorization hes cancelled it theres no mistake i have it in writing couriered to the embassy over his signature joey gaggedbut thats impossible fraid n o t he paused we do have a list of doctors should you wish for medical attention if youd gone through us in the first place then things might have been different but you chose not to the authorization for you to operate here is withdrawn good night the xray machine had gone and the metal detector arch they walked flanking mister across the empty atrium bar mister said again i dont want to talk about it atkins persisted his place has been turned over searched sos mine im not talking about it dont you listen he gestured with his hand into atkinss face made a cutting motion across atkinss throat they went out through the doors and the night frosts blast carried in the wind caught them they went along the side of the hotel heading for the city and the old quarter he was my friend mister said we dont ever forget that he was my friend the cruncher hadnt been the eagles friend and atkins hadnt known him small matter the eagle thought it was enough that the cruncher had been the friend of mister atkins wouldnt have understood was frightened wouldnt have known when to close his mouth and keep it tight shut they were walking briskly filling the pavement of an empty street atkins would have seen the cuts on the knuckles when mister had his fist near to his throat what have you done to your hand mister ive done nothing to my hand the skins all broken its mister stopped he turned to the eagle he held his hands under the eagles nose the scars were angry weeping where the skin was split do you see anything wrong with my hands eagle the eagle said quietly i doni see anything wrong with your hands mister he was misters man he did not then and had not ever dared to be anything else they walked past the shops with the steel shutters down and the benches where couples cuddled hopelessly in the cold past the cafes where the waiters sluiced the floors and lifted the chairs onto the tables they came to the small park round the grass were thick bushes bare of leaves but heavy enough to loss shadows on to the grass they saw the boy he had the earphones on his pretty head and was gyrating with the music he listened to the dogs smiled the grass meandered between the shadows their leashes were hooked to their collars and trailed on the ground after them he was watched and he did not know it atkins veered away to the right the eagle followed mister to the left to be behind the boy as he had been told he always did what mister told him it was about the cruncher whom the eagle had detested and about the crunchers honour which there had never been any they closed on the boy enver who was lost in his music c h a p t e r s i x t e e n he walked each step laboured in agony he could have taken the blue van the excuse joey gave himself for walking was that exercise would loosen the joints at his hips knees ankles would dull the bruising on his ribcage the wheeze in his lungs and soften the ache behind his eyes the excuse was merely a delaying tactic he walked because he was in no hurry to reach his destination he had gone first to the third floor apartment h of foinicka a young woman had answered draped in a long tailed mans shirt and hed asked lor miss holberg shed come to the door wrapped in a heavy dressing gown and shed used her fingers to squeeze the sleep from her eyes joey had betrayed her dreams had told his story when hed finished had demolished her shed stuttered questions at him who are you how do you know this why do you come to tell me it without answering hed slipped away down the stairs and back to the night the darkness and the chill of it were close to him from novo sarajevo he had tracked alongside the miljacka river going past the black towers of apartments the snipers homes then had crossed the river at the vrbanja bridge it was where she had been shot where jasmina and her boy had been in their turn betrayed cars crossed where she had lain oil grease was smeared where she had bled he was drawn towards the hill the steep climb a place he had no wish to be he had said but thats impossible he knew their stories what they had suffered and their strength it was not possible there were no more cars now no people scurrying for home up the unlit road the faster he went up the hill the sooner he would know the truth of it without the moon full and bright he would have seen nothing after the last lit pool from the streetlamp an owl shrieked from the cemetery he went on on his watch the hands were past midnight it was already the day of the meeting without authorization for intrusive surveillance signed by a recognized judge any evidence accrued from the telephoto camera lens or the directional microphone carried in maggie boltons steelsided box was inadmissible in court he could see the old worn condescending faces of the new men and the new woman who made the sierra quebec golf team and he could hear the criticizing merciless rasp of goughs voice he did not think it could be true it was not possible joey realized what was different light spewed out at the end of the rutted holed road from the windows of a house around which was set a skeleton of scaffolding poles the light reflected on the sleek paintwork of a black mercedes saloon and danced back from the radiator screen at the side of what had been only hall a house captured by the light were stacked piles ol concrete building blocks and there were two cement mixers the light splaying from the window fell on the slabs of a newly laid patio space between the scaffolding and the parked car and was reflected up to show joey the clean new roof timbers that peeped from under a spread tarpaulin joey walked towards the light he saw through the window the naked bulb hanging from new flex before there had been a grimy unpolished inadequate smelly oil lamp in the room humble but it had given out a glow ol pride he went past the mercedes and banged on the door with his clenched fist hit it until the pain ran in rivers through his body the eagle hung back he was of course too experienced in the matters of criminal law to believe that staying back not actually taking part would in any way mitigate his guilt the books to prove the guilt lined the shelves ol the office over the launderette principal among litem was archbold three inches thick of thin india paper and close print with a leather cover selling him back each january three hundred and twentyfive pounds he would be accused even if he pleaded hed stayed back of acting in common with mister and atkins if he snivelled that he had not known what was to happen he would still be guilty as an accessory to murder for acting in common or for being an accessory to murder the sentence was the same life imprisonment but that was semantics god alone knew the penalty in sarajevo most likely bollocks defenestration then filleting it was his squeamishness which mister despised that caused him to stay deep in the shadows they didnt need him gods truth they hadnt needed him at a l l atkins had done the dogs all show all piss and wind the dogs had been his dogs at home with mo could make a pretence of ferocity but embarrassed themselves with it atkins had slipped into the bushes by the grass had sat down had cooed at them and the brutes had shown that their teeth and menace were a sham atkins had held the dogs and mister had chopped the back of his hand on to the pretty boys neck felled him stuffed the gagging handkerchief into his mouth and wrenched his arms behind his back atkins had hooked the dogs leashes to a parkbench stanchion which would hold them for a few minutes before they broke free then had run after them past the trailing eagle to help mister drag enver down the side alley that led to the river from the park there was a dribble of moisture on the pavement and the smell the bladder had gone first then the sphincter the last few paces from the alleyway to the bridge the boy had known what was coming to him and had struggled for his life atkins in that final stampede had hissed dont you bloody bite me you bastard the struggling and the way his arms were held up behind his back would have meant they were half dislocated out of the shoulder joints the eagle winced at the end he couldnt help himself but watch mister raised his arm and chopped again full force on the back of the boys neck they were in the middle of the bridge a car was turning on to it but the lights hadnt yet come far enough round to light the rail the boy slumped under the force of the blow maybe he was unconscious maybe just dazed it was all one movement mister and atkins had him up like he was dead weight and over like he was dumped trash there was the splash the cars lights illuminated the the of them as they walked back to where the tagle waited the boy would have been incapable of survival when he went into the water that flowed last dark deep under the bridges rail they came towards him the boy would drown the drowning wouldnt help the cruncher nor the crunchers rent boys nor the crunchers parents in their torbay bungalow it was about misters sell respect and misters dignity as they reached him atkins was pulling off his glove and looking at his hand the eagle heard mister say youre all right didnt break the skinnothing like a good pair ol gloves you did well atkins brilliant at worst it was acting in common at best it was accessory lo murder they didnt wait for him the eagle bent over until his head was down at his knees and vomited up his hotel dinner i am not falcone joey shook his head i dont know who is nor am i borsellino the judge said softly i dont know who youre talking about she interrupted spoke sharply giovanni falcone was a magistrate in sicily he arrested many of the mafia and prosecuted them imprisoned them he was killed by a culvert bomb with his wife and his bodyguards he was followed by paulo borsellino who pursued the mafia with the same dedication borsellino was killed by a car bomb with his bodyguards they stood against the tide the room was a building site they were itinerants travellers squatting in their own home across the table were layered sheets of newspaper across the newspaper was a sandy shore of dust two of the four walls had been stripped of the plaster rendering to expose old stone it had been a room as he remembered it of dirty uncomfortable peace when it had been lit by the oillamps but the new electricity threw down a glaring brightness there were shining new plastic windowframes in place of the rotten splintered wood that was now propped against the wall joey was perched on the end of the table and faced her father who sat on the bed in his shirtsleeves close to a threebar electric fire she rounded on them with the restlessness of a zoocaged animal circled them in her chair i am not a hero they were martyrs to the reputation of jurisprudence i am not them they looked into the abyss as i have done they jumped i stepped back she said with scorn as if to support her father there were great demonstrations in palermo after the killings many thousands were on the streets to denounce the mafia the mafia is still alive but falcone and borsellino are dead you said you helped me so that you might regain your self respect when the oillamps lit the room the judge had had a face of old dignity under the new glare the face was haunted by defeat joey had no business to be there he was a criticism of them the judge said wearily it was a dream do you know who has had the biggest funeral in sarajevo during the war and since musan topalovic to the people on the streets of sarajevo he was a hero and a martyr he called himself caco who killed the hero he was shot by muslim government troops during a few days of crackdown on criminality in the last year of the war to show a skim of respectability to the foreign powers in the first days of the siege he held a line with what he named the tenth mountain brigade a formation ot rats from the sewers he was a butcher before he was a hero and a martyr he slit the throats of serbs who had stayed in the city after he had robbed them and he burned their bodies he was a man of evil four years ago his body was dug up and carried shoulder high through the streets to a new and more respectable grave shops emptied and the cafe and the bars i see it in my mind the worship of those who watched i awoke joey from the dream the people ol sarajevo did not want me they wanted as their hero and their martyr the man who was a butcher caco they would not want me who was an insignificant imitation of falcone and borsellino everything i said to you it was only a dream the judges words faded a week before joey cann would have nodded sympathetically and would have understood but a long week had gone by so what happened joey persisted what turned you the judge looked up at him and his dulled eyes blinked under the force of the ceiling light there were two offers put on the table the offer to be killed eighteen men came to the house this morning at first light with lorries cement mixers blocks timber they worked all day until it was dark and they will be here again in a few hours at lunchtime the mercedes came in the afternoon the catalogues were delivered to us we will have the bathroom of our choice with a special shower for jasmina the kitchen that will suit her and a refrigerator freezer and the decoration for the rooms what do you say joey the weekold veteran of sarajevo said with spite i say that the whole city will know you had a price it is sarajevo joey the city will applaud me a fool has become sensible in the evening a functionary came from the pensions department of the ministry of finance he gave me back the document i had given nine years before to ismet mujic as part payment for jasmina going to the vrbanja bridge with the document was an account statement the scheme was paid up they own me they have bought me and the world can know it dont you have a price joey the question hurt cut deep and he hesitated she was behind him circling them the wheels crunched on the fallen plaster and squealed he could not see her face he had bought her flowers anyone whod cared to look from the pavements or from their cars on the streets of this shit city would have seen that a girl in a wheelchair carried his flowers the question was under his guard i dont know if it was about someone i loved i did not think i had a price i urge you pray to your god that you never have to drink from the devils cup the judge looked into joeys eyes and asked simply who would have looked after her papa enough of talking she snapped he has no sympathy for what you say look at him he involved us papa you should not justify yourself she came round the table braked the chair between her father and joey if it had been about someone i loved i might have had a price i dont stand in judgement i hope i dont have that conceit will you leave you upset my father he saw the anger blaze in her eyes and the colour flush her cheeks the withdrawal of the authorization for intrusive surveillance joey does that make it hard for you the judges thin voice seeped from behind her back if i wore the uniform had the mentality of the uniform it would be impossible for me to continue without the uniform what is the action of a driven man what do you do oey because he had come into their lives the dignity was gone from them he wondered if when he was gone they would curse him the love that gave flowers was finished he stood tall over them and they waited on his answer he did not know himself and nobody who knew him would have recognized joey cann he said with savagery i go to the end of the road follow where i am led i think it finishes tomorrow tomorrow you will know whether you were bought too cheaply whether you surrendered your pride too quickly look and listen he went out of the room and into the night they might curse him they might weep in each others arms or forget he had ever come into their lives in a few hours it would be finished he walked down the hill left the building site and the mercedes behind him with his decency she passed the earphones to salko who began to scribble on a sheet of paper when the call was finished he gave the sheet to frank frank wrote the translation and palmed it to maggie sorry about that boys a little bit of panic there for a moment she chimed turkish isnt one of my talents if i was clever which im certainly not at this time of a godforsaken night id rather fancy a limerick coming on its getting quite multinational dont you think line one there once was a russkie an eyetie and a turk then weve perk kirk dirk and l u r k im too bloody tired you know anything about turks frank she eased back in her chair against him liked the touch of him mainstream heroin trafficking she grinned you know what i think unveil yourself to me miss bolton frank smirked at her she pushed him away but she liked his sauce it was cold as death in the room there was a single small light the bulb heavily shaded in the room on the floor she clamped the earphones back on her head mister thinks this is going to be his meeting i think hes in serious danger of diving into the pond and finding hes out of his depth why would he do that ivor jowett asked into the phone his wife her face frozen in fury tossed beside him he listened thanked the caller and rang off he switched off the bedside light and lay on his back in the darkness ivor jowett was the drugs liaison officer on a posting from the custom house to the british embassy in ankara the turkey secondment was a good one at the embassy sehit ersan cad a cankaya he was the earlywarning siren for the premier cases of heroin importation into the united kingdom as an ambitious investigation beaver with the information fed him by the polisi in the cities and the jandarmas in the countryside he would be noticed and fasttracked to promotion the stuff poured through the refineries and flowed out over the bosphorus and across europe to the british channel and north sea ports without the contacts the phone calls at dead of night ivor jowetl would have wallowed uselessly the pity of it was that the calls came a good half of them into his apartment in the night hours not to his office in the working day newspaper clippings were sent him each week hy the public affairs section of the custom house most times the credit for a seizure at harwich docks or felixstowe or dover or at the port of southampton was given to the dedication and persistence and thoroughness of the uniformed staff the figures soared a million pounds worth street value of intercepted heroin was commonplace ten million pounds was not rare ivor jowett late of the sierra quebec juliet team was a s t a r his wife rolled over and cradled hcrself in his arm she was gloria formerly ol sierra quebec roger it was said at the custom house that internal marriages were the only ones that had a chance do you want a coffee wouldnt mind the principal strain on the marriages was the refusal of officers to confide in wives who were not in the family he could tell gloria she did the secretarial in the embassy office but still grumbled and complained of underemployment what would he tell her when she brought back the mugs of coffee he was fuat selcuk believed to be forty eight years old he was from a village on the aras river near to erzurum his territory stretched along the old soviet border now georgia and armenia from artvin and kars in the north to mount ararat and mount tendurek in the south it was where he had his refineries where he employed the best young chemists from the universities the product in which he dealt raw opium originated in the poppyfields of afghanistan in sacks lashed to the backs of mules the cargo was brought north from the collection point at taloqan then was ferried across the pjandz river where the escort of machineguns was changed then taken overland across tajikistan and shipped over the width of the caspian sea unloaded at the azerbaijani harbour of sumqayit then moved on to the border posts close to igdir and ardahan there fuat selcuk waited for the cargos arrival and paid for it with cash dollars the money cut and cut and cut as the cargo would be returned on the trail and paid off the lorry drivers the middlemen the ferry crews the border guards the machinegunners the taliban leaders in afghanistan and the farmers who grew the crops of poppies in their fields he was never cheated the cargo was never stolen en route sacks never fell from the backs of the lorries or the mules hiss arm reached from western turkey all the way back to the hill fields of afghanistan to cheat him would have been the same as tying a heavy stone around the neck and wading out into the pjandz river neither was he cheated in the refineries by his chemists nor as the lorries rolled off the bosphorus ferries for the long drive north across europe and the ultimate destinations in holland germany france or green lanes in north london in his younger days when his reputation as a businessman of honour was not yet confirmed fuat selcuks speciality was to slice off a mans testicles and stifle the screaming by placing them in the victims mouth then stapling his lips together so that they could not be spat out he was also a man of charity he had built hospitals and schools and he paid for the repair of mosques the call in the night that had woken ivor jowett had been a whispered communication the men he dealt with always dropped their voices when they spoke of fuat selcuk because they knew the reach of his arm t hat morning fuat selcuk had left erzurum by light aircraft and had flown to ankara at the airport a bright brave young spark on surveillance duty had chanced his luck and moved close enough for an overheard the sparks target had met an ankarabased associate and had said itll be a dog fuck of a day all the way there to meet a bastard from england who thinks he is the top fuck ill eat him and the associate had said or hell eat his fucking balls and theyd gone beyond the hearing of the listener fuat selcuk had caught an afternoon flight to damascus then an evening connection to zurich his caller had told him why would he do that she brought the tea and ivor jowett told his wife about the call her eyebrows arched taking a hell of a risk isnt he the brit dealing with a man like that maggie was hunched over the recorder listening hard pressing the phones against her ears a tight little frown dented her forehead frank watched her salko and ante pushed themselves up from the far wall and sauntered towards her table her eyes were screwed tight she concentrated then she shrugged i cant make it out she passed the earphones to frank he listened scratched under his chin theres a problem something about the peachbottom boy frank gave the earphones to the men they were slipped to each in turn salko said serif has lost the boy enver he took the dogs out they have come back but not the boy ante said hes talking about an accident they are going to telephone the kosevo hospital such a thing has not happened before fahro said you can hear the worry of him frank translated and maggie scribbled down what theyd said moments like these always brought a slight joy to her she pried into her targets lives she heard their happiness and she was with them in crisis at the other end of the tap she sensed the panic the first search party had gone out she imagined them in their black jeans black tshirts and black jackets the gold chains garlanding their necks coming back and reporting failure they were sent out again she was the witness to the growing chaos all the days in the basement workshop at ceausescu towers and the evenings whiled away with the foremen technicians at imperial college the nights curled in her chair with her dog and the electronics magazines had a value when she played the voyeur she had no interest in the whereabouts of the boy it did not matter to her if he was prone on a hospital bed or had gone walkabout or was drinking himself stupid in a bar or was in a morgue on a slab it was her position as an intruder that thrilled her did now and had in the past it was her power to insert herself under her targets skin those who controlled her walked blind without her skills she had neat copperplate handwriting my dear mister tonight a man came to see me he told me who you were he described your career as a criminal of importance i asked his name and how did he know such things and why he told me them but he did not give me answers i hate criminality and its exploitation of the weak and its very selfishness therefore mister i should hate you i see no reason why the man who visited me should have lied but but i think it is impossible for me to hate you the man said that you had sought me out as a recipient of charitable goods in order to create an authentic alibi of good works you used me you wished to create respectability for your bosnia with love lorries which would return to the uk loaded with the class a narcotic heroin that is cause for me to hate you b u t but i am a good judge i hope of a genuine man i see many who come here with insincerity whatever were your first motives for bringing the lorry to the unis building tower a i wish to believe they were replaced by a spirit of true friendship and true affection i was not with a criminal in the village of visnjica a criminal would not have played cards in the village with the old men and given them dignity and would not have held the hand of a child without a father and given him kindness a criminal would not have come with me to gorazde and shown such sympathy for the plight of unfortunates i was with a man who cared who had a love for fellow human beings that is my judgement and it is precious to me perhaps mister when you came here you did not bring sympathy and love perhaps you learned them here in my company if i am wrong then i am a simple and stupid woman but i think you gained a softness here that you did not travel with i think you are a good man wherever i go whatever is my future i will remember you and your kindness i had hoped until this man came and told me of you to see you each time that you visited sarajevo to spend time with you and to grow close to you you would have made a light where there is darkness summer to winter brought hope where there is despair you should be proud of what you did with your decency we will not meet again with love and may god watch over you monika holberg she sealed the letter into its envelope march youll meet him in a minute the foreman fived the englishman barnaby walked down the hill towards the bunker and the junction where the turning led to ljut village his guest an attentive young man hurried at his side the lights shone boldly in the repaired houses of the nearer village and were bright pinpricks across the valley beyond the river in vraca within a quarter of an hour the suns strength would wipe out the electricitys glow from the new windows of the houses of the twin villages just before the autumn weather had closed in on the valley the previous year five and a half months back the certificate of clearance had been issued for the corridor of land under the line of power pylons and the engineering teams had moved on to the site for a further month into november the teams had worked inside the narrow corridor of yellow tape had lifted the pylons and raised the cables and had restored the power there had been no further accidents the power had been switched on light had blazed glowed shone from each home in the two communities that had been reoccupied the bulbs were never switched off the german charity world in crisis paid the bills on the two occasions barnaby had been to the valley to plan the main clearance operation he had gained the impression very distinctly that the muslims in vraca and the serbs in ljut kept their lights on through the day whether the sun shone or didnt and through the night whether they were awake or asleep it was not for him to tell the villagers that the german aid and generosity were running out because all of the donors were now scrambling to turn their backs on the country and the funding for the demining gangs was drying up barnaby had brought the journalist to the valley fenton from a london broadsheet with a daily circulation of less than four hundred thousand readers was the best recipient barnaby could find the work had barely begun the funding for mine clearance was required for another two decades minimum he needed journalists from masscirculation newspapers and he needed politicians to tramp down that lane and a thousand others but they were beyond reach instead he had wilf fenton he always tried to be cheerful when he brought a guest to a minefield why do you call him fived the way barnaby told it there were fiveds on a hundred sites it was a regular part of his introductory patter he knew from his dogged persistence in seeking out funding that anecdotes played better in journalists copy than statistics all the ds he was a deminer and was blown up and damn lucky he became a driver ferried others around but didnt go into the field he was bored and went back to demining was blown up again was even luckier didnt lose his leg started again at being a driver couldnt beat the boredom so hes at it again demining thats the five ds got it fenton shuddered as he walked and was eyeing the yellow tape suspiciously staying on an imaginary line that ran down the exact centre of the track once would have been enough for me theres so much shrapnel in him it was another line from barnabys regular patter all the foremen supported his story that we always test a new metal detector by holding it up against his backside the lights flash and the buzzer goes full blast god and thats the extent of what youve got to cover is it yes thats the valley thats the bunica river valley it was laid out in front of them a hawk hovered over the flattened dead weeds of the old arable fields fluttered on to hunt across the dull weatherstamped grass of the old grazing fields then soared in the light wind and flew towards the fallen posts and dropped wires of the old vineyard there was no beauty to it the green growth of new grass shoots would come in the next month and the flowers would make their carpet in the month after it was as though the place had lost its soul barnaby thought there was a long seemingly endless line of yellow tape that marked the extent of the fields running along the edge of the wooded slopes how long will it take you to clear it seven months eight thats twenty men working five days a week how many mines are there we dont know the records dont exist would you walk there barnaby shook his head resolutely i wouldnt step an inch over the tape i am fiftysix years old and i have been working with mines for twentyfour of them ive learned to respect them he told the stories of the foreman the grandmother and the son in law and fenton scribbled busily they had reached the bunker the yellow tape was all round the squat construction of stone and damp tree trunks the paint was cracked on the red surround and had peeled from the skull shape and the crossed bones barnaby took fenton inside and the journalist flashed his marlboro lighter turned it up to full there were scribbled numbers chalked on the walls the remnants of an old occupation did barnaby know what they signified he didnt fenton said they looked like the bookies lists youd find pinned up on a wall of a betting shop the last date where the chalk line erased the list of odds was for a summer day seven years earlier and above the dale was the word rado t cant help you barnaby said i dont know what it means a pity sort of interesting isnt it about ghosts they went out into the sunlight and blinked the lights in the ljut windows and the pinpricks across the river were now burned out a column of deminers tramped down the track in front of them the weight of their boots thudding on the stones what are the boots they look pretty solid theyre supposed to be proof against an antipersonnel mine or what we call a nuisance mine thats comforting not really they have rigid soles theyre all right on the flat but theyre a liability on a stone slope you fall over in them reach out to break your fall then your whole pressure is on your hand and your weight it takes five kilos of pressure to detonate a pma if theyre working on a gradient like the vineyard theyll kick the overboots off c h r i s t why do they do it for money so that they eat and their families eat how do you hold up morale after an accident hunger does the job usually when a deminers been hurt or killed at least two of them jack it in they dont eat and their families dont youre showing me a bloody excuse me brutal world feel free to quote me they followed the deminers down to the ford the water was in spate across it barnaby pointed to a distant farmhouse and spoke of some recent familyhistory an old woman who moved on crutches and a young man whose skeleton body would not be recovered until the end of the summer because of where it lay and of an old farmer who survived senility in the belief that he would reclaim and work his fields he was not yet out of his bed and that was a greater mercy they stood at the side of the track close to the river parallel lines of yellow tape strips ran from the track out into the fields each wide enough for two men to walk alongside each other between these stunted corridors were wide expanses of grass and weed but the two men in each corridor did not walk they knelt their visors down they probed with thin sharpened steel prods fenton said that it was like watching paint dry barnaby said drily that the chance of losing a leg when home decorating was slight fenton saw the dog and his face lit a heavy german shepherd shaggycoated was in the longest grass in a corridor between the yellow tape and twentyfive yards from the track a long thin cord linked the dog to the handler thats what i need fenton raised his pocket camera aimed at the dog tell me about him hes boy nine years old hes the best a prime asset he was trained first by an american demining company they worked him in angola then rwanda and croatia they sold him to us hes going to work out his time here he scents the explosive not everybody trusts a dog if he misses a mine he wont detonate it but the handler following him will many prefer to put their trust in the prodder we argue about it but boy is special when a dogs done its useful work its shot boy wont be his handlerll take him home thats wonderful can i go closer sorry no mr fenton you have to understand that were in the first week of the season the men are rusty they havent been in the field for four or five months its a time of maximum danger for them ive an angle now im going to write something positive fenton said enthusiastically something about brave men and boy working to bring a proper life back to two communities in the valley i like it ive got the buzz the valley where the peace will never again be broken would you all like a cup of tea it was what the princesss mother had always done each time the old bill had come visiting at dawn in their ilford house when shed been a child its no trouble to me easy enough to put the kettle on except when her father was locked up the old bill had been regular earlymorning visitors her mother clarrie hinds always brewed up a big pot and cleared the cupboard of mugs for the tray if there was a senior man among them shed usually have sliced up a lemon just in case shed always put a plate of biscuits on the tray opened a fresh packet for them like mother like daughter her mother said it helped to make a bad experience more pleasant and also said that tea and biscuits and talk about the weather would it rain or wouldnt it was distracting for the searchers this was a sour lot tea declined biscuits refused smalltalk ignored it was now nine months since the last time the princesss home had been visited theyd been polite enough then no sledgehammers no shouting no blue lights flashing and no sirens when theyd driven mister away hed been given at least ten minutes to get himself dressed and theyd been discreet when theyd taken him out through the front door it had only been afterwards that shed heard from rosie carthew carol penberthy and leonora govan that the house had been surrounded by armed police crouching in their gardens the princess hadnt even seen them the last time mister had gone off as if a few golf friends were shipping him to a faraway course but mister didnt play golf this lot were cold correct silent they knew the house theyd have been working from the pictures taken when the house was burgled a year back theyd each been assigned a room the oldest man among them had an unlit pipe stapled in his mouth shed seen him look around from the moment hed come in through the front door there were no ashtrays in the princesss home she thought he yearned to produce his matches and scratch a flame but he didnt ask her the old bill always asked if they could smoke and her mother had always produced an ashtray for them this man wandered between the rooms took on the role of a supervisor and the princess followed him they went into the kitchen the sitting room the living room her snug where she did her post the dining room that was never used and up the stairs to the bedrooms and the bathrooms she tracked him like a suspicious dog when the woman who had searched the dining room taking everything from the sideboard then replacing each plate and each glass just where theyd been had met the heavybearded man whod gone through the sitting room with finetooth comb care the princess had been at the top of the stairs the woman and the bearded man were in the hall below you know whats funny about this place sort of creepy its not livedin its like a show house at the ideal home theres nothing out of place and theres not a book did you find one book here i didnt it gives you the shivers or its like a hotel room cleaned for the next guest then theyd seen her at the top of the stairs and the princess hadnt heard another word spoken among them until they left they filed out years ago clarrie hinds had said that you never showed anger to them never flipped never screamed because theyd talk about that in the canteen at their late breakfast and the word would have been passed to the scum the informers they paid to have shouted at them to have wept in a corner would have demeaned her dignity would have diminished misters selfrespect they took nothing with them thank you for your cooperation mrs packer the older mans match flashed in the dull light she didnt answer the cars were starting up in the road usually at her mothers home or at her own since shed married mister when the police or the church came with a warrant searched and left emptyhanded without evidence in a bag there would be tightlipped annoyance at the senior mans mouth she didnt see anger but there was a slow smile which might have been contempt or satisfaction it was no big deal shed tell mister about it when he was back tomorrow or the day after their house rule which shed never broken was that she did not call him when he was away it would keep until his return they were a partnership in his strange unshown way her mister loved his princess he didnt crawl all over her didnt touch her when they were out didnt smarm her with compliments in front of strangers but he loved her it was returned the trust was between them when he came back she would tell mister where theyd been how theyd searched what theyd looked like hed listen to her never interrupting and every detail of it would be stored away in his mind his memory when shed finished hed say well done or thats good or if he was expansive youd have thought theyd have better things to do and life would go on she never looked to the future didnt think about it a long time ago when they were first married and mister was on the up shed feared hed be found in a gutter or in a firedestroyed car and that the uniformed bill would come to escort her to a mortuary to look at his body she no longer harboured such a fear he was untouchable now as she joked with him god wouldnt dare she didnt ask him what the future was and didnt care as the cars drove off she saw across the road that leonora was hy her gate in her bathrobe and miming at her a charade game of filling a kettle and drinking a cup but she shook her head smiled because it was no big deal and closed her door behind her one point confused her there had been no warning the night before his arrest mister had known they coming for him in the morning shed tell mister that his network hadnt warned her she went into the kitchen she made hersell a collee and put bread in the toaster she took the toast and the mug into the sitting room and switched on the television her eyes roved from the set from the mug and the plate over the room there was no sign that the church had come mobhanded into the house it was all strangely tidy and undisturbed she was almost at the end of the traverse of her gaze over the watercolour paintings the ornaments the decanter and the glasses the fireplace when she saw the envelope it was propped up on a low table beside the chest where she kept her tapestry she had not put a brown largesize envelope on that table she wondered what theyd left behind she laid her cup and the plate on the footstool beside her chair went to the table and picked up the envelope the flap was not sealed was folded inside there was no logo on it nor any handwriting she opened it and took out a wad of platesize photographs attached to the back of the top photograph was a stickon message note room holiday inn sarajevo phone she turned the photographs over she looked her eyes closed she lashed out with her foot the fluffy pink slipper kicked against the stool beside her chair the toast went margarineandmarmalade side down onto the carpet and the cup of coffee flew the princess ripped off the stickon message note marched into the kitchen and snatched up the telephone he had been dressing his best suit best shirt and best shoes and the phone had pealed beside the bed mister held it away from his ear and heard the rant theyre not my problem they can come any time they want once a week if they want by appointment or without youre my problem mister who is she you are my problem who is she dont play dumb eith me mister and dont bloody tell me oh shes just nobody oh shes just a friend someone i met oh shes just a quick shag out in the bloody open like youre some sort of kid out in the park who is she lost your bloody voice mister did you lose your trousers mister have to be called mister dont you because thats about your bloody selfrespect what sort of selfrespect is it to be out in the middle of the bloody day cuddling and cow eyes in front of the churchs camera and dont tell me i didnt see the camera i didnt know they were there you wouldnt have seen luck all except for her tits you wouldnt have seen a camera if theyd poked you with it bloody good laugh for the church i have sweated for you mister ive been here when youve wanted me ive covered your back ive lived a bloody halflife and what do i get out of it its a bloody crown copyright surveillance picture of you with a horn on hanging on to a bit of stuff young enough to be your bloody daughter if you were capable of making a daughter ive trusted you mister and now youve he put the phone down on the cradle he finished dressing chose a good tie and checked himself in the mirror they were waiting for him in the lobby how was he he was fine he was looking forward to a good day he was top of the game chapter seventeen was it falling apart he sat beside atkins who drove with the eagle behind him they thought it was cracking splintering and were both silent had been all the way from the city to jablanica and the start of the gorge that held in the neretva river nothing in misters life had ever fallen apart he was tired he said wearily softly all right eagle all right atkins let me tell you how i see it because youre asking and youve the right to is it falling apart fair question deserves a fair answer weve positive and negative asset and debit ill go first on the negative the debit we are going to meet marco tardi of the brusca family and nikki gornikov from the vory vzakone group and fuat selcuk who owns half of the west of turkey they are topoftheieague people theyre travellers they reach across europe and the near east into asia and as far as the states i havent met people like that before i meet guys in london and if the suns shining and its a good day i get as far as manchester birmingham or newcastle and if its special i get as far as glasgow i deal with yardies and chinese and guys who call me mister because theyre scared shitless of me im the biggest fish in a small puddle i dont know how im going to be when i meet these people today i dont know whether im going to fall on my face if theyre going to think im not worth bothering with its new ground for me am i up to it thats a negative they had left the jablanicko jezero lake behind them where there were wooden restaurants and fishermen as still as hermits who held their rods and stared at the bluegreen depth of the water now they were in the gorge the sun speared down into it the road was fast and dry the snowcapped hills were left far back they went past fields where tractors ploughed they were three smartly dressed men on their way to a business meeting his voice was gentle without passion since weve been here we have been under continuing surveillance by the church its not a big team it may just be a oneman token show ive done what id normally do ive done the warning and the frighteners and now ive beaten the crap out of him i dont know whether hes still there or isnt there theyll have learned about the warehouse we chose and about the charity lorry truth be told every piece of detail we have put in place this week has been time wasted thats debit they all wore their best misters suit was light grey the eagle wore formal charcoal what hed have taken from the wardrobe for a law society dinner in guildford when he sought to impress his tie discreet foreign and silk and hed have spent time in his room cleaning his shoes before theyd left atkins had chosen tan slacks a sports jacket and the regiments tie mister talked mused as if the important audience was himself and its not just at this end that the church is working the pressure atkinss address is done over the eagles home is trashed and mine im searched the princess called me this morning she knows better than that and she unstitched the most basic rule weve got i didnt have word of it before they came in and i didnt have word they were doing yours atkins and yours eagle its like theyre stepping over a trip wire because they know its there and it can get worse there was a picture taken of me when i went to a crappy little village where the bosnia with love stuff had been dumped its left with the princess by the church its that sort of moment a pretty girl and me and were close christ i dont get to meet girls like that nothings bloody happened not yet but the picture makes it look like im kissing her ive had my ears thrashed by the princess she cant handle it shes bawling and their recorders are turning on it thais the negatives thats why the questions fair is it tailing apart he couldnt see the eagle but heard him squirm in the seat behind atkinss eyes never left the road do i turn cut my losses and run they were both silent neither had spoken since the journey had started he thought they were both pathetic but didnt show what he thought its a fair question youre entitled to ask it his voice held ils quiet ive never run havent ever when i was a kid at school i didnt run i used to get hell kicked out of me when i was making my patch bigger kids stronger older kicked and punched me and i went home with blood on my face and teeth loose and i went back each next morning until the day when i could hand back the kicks and the fists i ruled in that school i ruled had control i would have been nothing if i had shown fear just another tearaway and been smacked down when they put me out of school when i was starting up my own patch shopkeepers businesses fourteen years old and protecting them people wanted me to cut my losses and run there was fist fights and knife fights there was a petrol bomb thrown at me i went after them i was a kid but i went after them in their pubs and in their pads went after them until they backed off i had to clear the competition out from stoke newington first then from islington and holloway then from dalston and hackney there was good pickings and the competition didnt want me it was shotguns and shooters i went inside i got two things out of pentonville i got respect but i had to fight for it and with the respect came the contacts the mixer came from pentonville and the cards and the cruncher and the link to you eagle if i hadnt stood the ground hadnt fought at the age i was id just have ended up as another kid who was playtime for the old perverts i came out i went up to green lanes and i started buying started dealing started selling on more territory to move into and bigger fights i could have turned then it was about will about determination about belief if hadnt had the will if the determination had been short then id have gone under there was heavy money to be made and too many snouts in the trough and only room in the trough for one mine i put men in hospital but they didnt talk to the cid because they hadnt the guts to and none of them came back for more what im saying is that respect doesnt come easy its earned i earned it i sat in the top of the tree because i didnt turn or run or q u i t and the years go by i am sitting in the top of that tree and i am thinking where do i go if i dont turn and run and quit only one place to go find a bigger tree climb it and get higher did anyone say it was easy it wasnt easy in the school not easy getting the shopkeepers to shell out in stoke newington or to clear the territory in north london wasnt easy in pentonville wasnt easy going up to green lanes but i had the will so now i have problems he eased back against the comfort of the seat he despised them whats a problem for its for solving problems are for lowlife theyll not for mister i go on i never backed from anything i wanted i want this either of you do you want to get out do you want to walk you going to stand at the side of the road and wait for a bus going to the airport i dont hear you eagle youre not speaking alkins he heard the shuffle of papers behind him and thought the eagle hid in them and atkinss eyes only left the road when he checked the mirror they came out of the neretva gorge well thats that then maybe because i think were ahead of schedule we can stop and get something to eat might be a long day mister closed his eyes and felt the sun beat on his face he thought only of the meeting monika and the princess were forgotten and the eagle and atkins who were rubbish and cann who was a fleas bite he was untouchable and supreme and the meeting would prove it they came onto the flat plain and the signs pointed for mostar joey drove the blue van he had failed he had washed up like driftwood on a beach maggie was beside him her legs straddling the gearstick her skirt riding up and beyond her on the front bench seat was frank williams his arm was behind her neck her hair against his cheek they both slept had the right to they had been up all through the night to monitor the increasing panic shouting and belted orders relayed to them by the infinity transmitter the boy enver had not been found the sarajevo police were out searching for him the hospitals had not admitted him only when ismet mujic had abandoned his watch for the boy and had left the apartment to go to the airport to meet the first flight of the morning in from zagreb had they come back to the hotel with time to shower and change and head off for the holiday inn with the van joey was the one who had slept who would drive he had watched the mitsubishi pull out from the hotel and once it was on the open road he had dropped back and allowed visual contact to be lost he was guided by the small blinking light of the beacon sometimes intense and sometimes faint on the screen in front of her splayedout knees he had failed because he had no authorization for intrusive surveillance he could gather no evidence because the authorization had been withdrawn he could place the moment when the professionalism he prided had drifted to obsession and the church culture had been shed it was when mister had walked to the cemetery when he had seen his rolling confident gait and he had been outwitted out thought it was failure everything since had been the feeble secondrate attempt to claw back from the failure joey cann and it battered in his mind was the loser always the beacon guided him and he let her sleep and frank two pickups followed him the sreb four had split into pairs on the back of the second pickup was a wire cage in the cage was nasir not that joey gave a damn for the life history of the brute but it was called nasir muhsin had told him the name and the history as if it were information of importance before they left sarajevo information to be nurtured nasir oric had been the commander holding the perimeter line at srebrenica who had been withdrawn on government orders who was not there when the enclave fell when the throats had been slit when the beacon light dulled he stamped down on the accelerator pedal to coax the maximum speed from the van joey fell deserted alone with only the obsession for company the beacon led him to swing right at the main junction towards mostar ahead of him before he turned a low line of hills shimmered in the haze he did not know their name or that of the valley they hid and he lost sight of the ground that rose to meet an unforgiving sundrenched sky husein bekir had come down to the ford but the water was too deep for him to cross he wore the same protection from the sun as he did against the winter cold his coat which reached to his knees was tightly fastened with twine over his stomach and he had on his heavy rubber boots his beret cap shielded his scalp from the sun the deminers sat on the track where an ash tree threw shade and their dog was stretched out against its trunk they ate bread and drank from coketins husein had come down to the ford to see how far their yellow tape corridors had progressed in that mornings work one he estimated was five metres further forward one was seven metres not one of them was more than ten his fields were more than a thousand metres in length and a few paces more than two hundred and fifty metres wide he shouted across at them why did they need to stop to eat and to drink should they not work faster how much were they paid to sit in the shade and not work they ignored him not a head turned towards him he turned the quiet settled again on the valley it had been gods place and it was poisoned in the heats haze the fields drifted away from him were cloaked in silence the location chosen by ismet mujic was in deference to the italian marco tardi had flown from messina to bari on the italian mainland then by light aircraft to split on croatian territory on collection he had been driven to mostar it was all complications it was in deference to the italian because he was the biggest player in ismet mujics business life the russian had said they should meet at brcko near to the arizona market where he had associates the turk had wanted sarajevo the base of his allies fuat selcuk had reached sarajevos airport first and had complained for the entire thirtyfive minutes he had waited for nikki gornikovs plane to arrive the turk and the russian would not travel in the same car each insisted that their bodyguards must be with them at all times the convoy from the airport to mostar was three cars and a fourth joined there it was all shit he had been on his mobile eleven times and the boy enver had not been found he made the rendezvous he watched the russian and the turk not leaving their cars peer with distaste at the italian in his car small scorpions could be found in the dry hills in summer between mostar and the coast and it was the habit of local men to catch them not wearing gloves for fear of damaging them then to build a little prison for them of concrete blocks let them fight and wager big money on the outcome ismet mujic would not have bet on the englishman his car led and enveloped in the dust trail their cars followed mister walked and atkins stayed at a distance behind him back at the mitsubishi was the eagle who had said his feet hurt in his shoes theyd left him with his shoes off massaging his feet atkins seeing the eagles spindly white ankles had wondered how the man managed at rough shooting over the fields which he claimed he did the vehicle was parked outside a big modern hotel spotlessly clean money lavished about the only building atkins had seen in mostar that wasnt wardamaged hed never reached moslar when hed served his twin un tours mister had led and atkins had gone after him mister had gone off into the muslim quarter on the east side of the city down cobbled shaded streets beneath overhanging balconies and hed paused lor a long time at the great gap where the stari most bridge had been atkins could remember when it had been brought down by explosives on his second tour the croats had blamed the muslims for an act of international vandalism the muslims had blamed the croats for a war crime on a world heritage site there were two workmen there and a sign said the bridge was being rebuilt with italian craftsmen and unesco funding mister gazed down into the tumbling water below the gap the old bridge had spanned atkins thought his face was serene calm had been ever since theyd arrived in the city misters eyes never left the water of the neretva atkins said you know mister kids used to jump off here for the tourists dive off the old bridge then crawl back up and get paid for it mister interrupted his voice still and quiet can i tell you whats valuable atkins its time time to focus concentrate and think understand me atkins i dont give a shit about whether kids jumped off here i dont give a shit about this place anything of it anything of their war you ever interrupt me again and itll be the last time because ill have sliced your yapping tongue out of your mouth you with me atkins atkins reeled misters face never changed the serenity stayed mister leaned on the rail and stared another minute at the water he turned the affable smile on his face right atkins i reckon well be late there and thats just right let the bastards wait i always say let them s w e a t you all right atkins of course mister the beacon led them from mostar they had been through a village marked on the map as hodbina a place of scattered homes small tended fields and grazing livestock and women worked with hoes and spades on vegetable patches it was off the main road south to the coast smoke came from the chimneys but diffused into the clean skies a road part tarmacadam and part steamrollered stones took them on until the beacons pulse led them to a track veering right off the road and they saw the fresh tyremarks it was wild country the cultivated fields were behind them old rock was scattered over the ground and clumps of thorny scrub had found shallow rooting the sun beat down on it joey had slowed the two pickups went by him they stopped ahead then turned and reversed into a small wood of dense birch using a rutted path he followed and parked beside them maggie bolton went to the back of the van opened its door winked at frank then dropped her skirt to her ankles she reached inside and rummaged lifted out her pair of old jeans and slipped them on the dog nasir was freed from his cage and allowed to wander in the trees lift his leg then was leashed they went into the depths of the trees the guns were cocked salko ante and fahro carried kalashnikovs and antes had a night sight screwed onto the top of the barrel muhsin had a pistol at his belt alongside a big water bottle and the leash in his hand the dog had a dried weatherdesiccated bone in its mouth they were in front frank lugged maggies box of magic tricks she walked with joey they went towards the brightness where the sun hit against the last line of the trees at the edge of the wood they looked down and saw the house the track with the tyremarks ran down the hill in front of them and reached an oasis of green there was a rich garden around the house clawed back from the stone and the scrub sprinklers played over it and made small rainbows four mercedes cars were parked on swept gravel in front of the building along with the white mitsubishi it was spanish hacienda style with walls of white stucco and closed shutters covering the windows a carrion crow soared above it and cried gratingly two men dressed in black worked on the cars but not the mitsubishi polishing away the roads dust frank was beside him and murmured now were here can i ask something ask away what are we here for joey thought before he spoke as if an immediate answer eluded him then said to force mistakes yes yes ok very funny man ill say it slowly what do we hope to achieve by being here joey shook his head slowly i dont know wait a minute steady down frank said evenly if you want to play this out dont mini me there are six of us here and you you must have an idea where this is going regardless of whether youd come any of you id have been here frank stared at him brow furrowed and the scratch was in his voice tell me if youd be so kind what is there that i should know all you need to know right now is that judge delic has withdrawn the authorization for intrusive surveillance on target one the hiss so its not legal any of it jesus you picked a fine time joey looked away back to the house and the men cleaning the vehicles are you stupid an idiot what are you no legality cant gather evidence cant put anything before a court no time for handcuffs why are we here because i gave my promise to follow this man wherever he led joey said as if that answer was adequate they scrambled down the slope towards the fence that hugged the green of the oasis joey saw that the dog never lost hold of the bone the sun was at its zenith and threw their shadows down under their bodies they closed on the fence when one of their bodies or the dogs paws caused small stones to cascade down they all froze then went on when they saw that the two men had not broken from the work of cleaning the cars a dozen paces from the fence there was a gully and they sagged into it muhsin poured waler sparingly into the dogs throat masking them from the house was a flat stone stormsmoothed down on the earth pressed close to him frank murmured you know what obsession is dangerous for health yours and ours i gave my promise joey said openfaced it was the eagle recognized it misters finest hour he did not apologize for his lateness that they had waited for him was obvious from the used plates and dirty knives and forks on the table the colter cups and glasses beside the empty water bottles there had been no hint of apology effortlessly he had created an atmosphere of an equal among partners they would have fidgeted cursed they would have queried the arrangements of ismet mujic they would have listened for the crunch on gravel of the late arrivals vehicle dont bend the knee to them mister had said as the front door was opened for them let them know its their privilege to be meeting us it was high risk the eagle had thought but mister always won because he always risked theyd gone inside into the dim cool of a wide living room and mister had perfunctorily but with charm shaken their hands im mister and this is my legal adviser eagle and i have also brought with me my associate atkins theyre fine men both of them and as committed as i am to the principles of honest business dealing he had been asked by ismet mujic if he wished to eat and had brusquely declined he had then belittled ismet mujic now serif has this room been scanned it hadnt misters eyebrows had been raised fractionally in surprise and the others had gazed at him in a marginal moment of suspicion mister had nodded to atkins atkins had left the room radios had started to blare through the ground floor of the building and upstairs mister had said nothing until atkins had returned then mister had pointed to the stereo system in the room that had been turned on volume up now can we get to work then he had snapped his fingers at the eagle and atkins and had pointed to the table theyd started to clear it the italian began to help then the russian and last the turk and ismet mujic was shouting towards the kitchen for his people but by the time they came the plates were stacked and the cutlery gathered together and ismet mujic was further belittled we need my friend a cloth to clean the table when the table was cleared and wiped mister sat down with the eagle and atkins he took one side of the table made the living room into a board room with him playing the part of chief executive officer mister had said the last thing before theyd hit the gravel in front of the house we find a room with a table we sit down one side of it we do not take off our jackets or loosen our ties we are not slumped in easy chairs we are in control they are bloody lucky to have us they sat opposite they were casual in dress and posture and their jewellery dripped from them the contrast was powerful as mister had wanted it was the nearest he would come to an apology in that finest hour i regret that i do not speak italian russian or turkish neither do my colleagues i hope we can manage in the english language they gazed at him impassively thats taken then two things i want to say first i am grateful to you serif for making this meeting possible i appreciate that it has not been easy for you to bring together three gentlemen with differing schedules all important you have serif my sincere thanks the eagle wondered whether they had carried guns into the house atkins had left their own weapons in the mitsubishi as mister had instructed and each of them during the introductions had offhand flapped back their jackets to show they were not armed as mister had ordered i work on one strong principle that is not negotiable my word is my bond i make a deal and i guarantee that to i he best of my ability the deal is carried through and the best of my ability is good serif will tell you that i have done a deal with him and that the promised monies are now lodged in his account in nicosia as i said they would be you will all have associates in london you will have checked with them you will have asked about me you will have been told that i am a serious player so gentlemen do i have your attention for my proposals the eagle could not decide which of them had the cruellest eyes you will allow me to give you my evaluation of the common factor affecting all three of you in london you do not fulfil your business potential you fall far short of what could be achieved thats where i can help where i can make a difference in your profitability the italian had the youngest eyes but there was no sparkle in them to match his smile you bring in marco product from venezuela and colombia but your difficulty is getting it into the european marketplace i suggest you ship direct to the ports of montenegro then take a series of options you can handle the product yourself and use the adriatic bridge to italy or you can avail yourself of the lorry network i will be setting up in bosnia it can be used to move your product either east or north if you wish it and your product goes to the uk i will make available to you the dealer and distributor infrastructure that i already have in place you will meet with no competition you will not have to fight a turf war because i will be your ally and no man in london will fight against me the market will be cleared for your use thats what im offering you marco and i would like you to consider it carefully the russian had narrow slitted eyes and the bags under them were puffed as i understand it nikki you and your colleagues make a great deal of money but thats where your difficulty starts what to do with the money i anticipate that you will find it increasingly hard to use the facilities of russian banks in new york cyprus or hungary those banks are going to come under intensive lawenforcement scrutiny to maximize the return on your hardearned profits you need access to legitimate banking thats the city of london i can provide you for a most reasonable fee the opportunities to rinse through the city through introductions no more grey hairs stressfree banking in addition you are engaged in peopletrafficking but its chaotic and amateurish and too many of your people consignments go down because you do not have the expertise of british partner i can be of help a n d i can help with your automobile trade and your weapons trade london is not merely a major streetmarket it is also a name london is respectability the name of london opens doors as you will find if you take up my offer worldwide the turk had small eyes set close together and they squinted thank you for your patience fuat youre a big man where you operate you are king except in one area i handle your product im at the end of the line but in green lanes i am buying the product you have purchased refined then shipped on for importation into the uk the importation is where you are not king far from it i read my newspapers just as i am sure you read yours not a month goes by without the interception of a consignment of product at the british ports naturally you rely on turkish transportation turkish lorries and turkish shipping the cargo on such lorries and ship containers attracts the greatest attention payment is on delivery so if the importation is busted you dont get the money i am suggesting that you deliver into sarajevo that sarajevo is the transit point for both of us a blind donkey can bring the product into sarajevo any lorry with any plates can get through and thats where youd be paid its less for you of course than for importation direct to the uk but its less risk i can use britishregistered lorries with british passportholders driving them and theyre waved through when your transport is stopped searched with due respect to you nothing gets a customs mans nose sniffing faster than a product of turkey stamp on a cargo consignment of ceramic tiles or oranges or whatever you want what you gain is money what you lose is the headache and the hassle thats my proposal to you the smoke of their cigarettes made a wall along the middle length of the table and watered their eyes but they stared at mister unblinking ive done my deal with serif and im very happy with the terms agreed i can predict with confidence that he is going to be a good friend to me like a brother each of you three gentlemen had influence in the running of this country and i believe that influence will grow as the foreign powers withdraw i intend to operate here and i am asking for your cooperation your partnership in our mutual selfinterest id like to take a break now in the break you marco nikki and fuat have a chance to think over what ive said and to decide whether to take it further if any of you decide not to then please feel free to back off and leave if you feel you wish to move ahead into those new areas of product profitability that i have outlined then i will talk detail and percentages would a fifteenminute break be satisfactory i want to settle it at this session i want to wrap it up he stood smiled briefly then went to the door atkins and the eagle in his wake it had been misters finest hour a masterclass hed heard it all before of course but there had been no mere parrots recitation of the crunchers vision it had been softly spoken persuasion and never an interrupt ion never a yawn they were the crunchers words but only mister could have spoken them into the cruelty of those eyes how did i do they were the courtiers atkins told him hed done well they knew their lines and meant them the eagle said he had been magnificent christ i fancy some fresh air away from that bloody cigarette smoke the dog nasir played up was whining and muhsin tried to soothe it joey didnt know why theyd brought it he sat crosslegged on the flat stone in front of the gully he had the camera slung round his neck with the big lens attached and beside him was the dish with the antenna probe but maggie had said all she could hear was music at least four sound sources and the radios cluttered up any chance of voices shed said that if shed been in her workshop she might have been able to clear the music off the track and get to hear the voices and hed said that she wasnt in her bloody workshop but on a bloody hill in bosnia and shed chucked the earphones off her head the sun was down over the hills in the west when the darkness had come joey had gone onto the flat stone as if that was escape from them and from the dog he didnt know when frank had told her hadnt heard him whisper the name of judge delic the dog wriggled on its back behind him and muhsin whispered to it and joey heard his fingers scratching at the dogs belly joey knew everything about the dog and the dogs name muhsin had thought hed be interested when they were in the gully to know the history of the animal and its name and frank had tediously translated he was the best fighter that came out of muslim bosnia better than any of those who were generals or brigadiers better than serif nasir oric held srebrenica for three years if he had not been there it would have fallen months before the end perhaps years before he was a natural leader only twentysix years old when he took command of us he had been a bodyguard to milosovic in belgrade but he came back to us when war was inevitable he called his men the manoeuvre unit and his own weapon he carried it himself was a fiftycalibre machinegun the serbs were terrified of him he went out from our perimeter lines into their villages maggie had interrupted fuck the shaggydog story what you did was inexcusable to carry on not telling us like nothing had happened when authorization was withdrawn to tell frank now that is a fucking disgrace its betrayal we are illegal what is this bullshit about promises he ignored her didnt rise to her carping and asked frank to go on with the story as told by muhsin when the word spread in the enclave that nasir oric was going out that night at the head of the manoeuvre unit with the fiftycalibre the people in that part of the front line where he would go out would leave the aphrodisiac of watered honey mixed with crushed walnuts in jars outside their homes and he would drink and then he would go to kill serbs it was not so that he could fuck better that they left out the aphrodisiac but so he could kill better and i called the dog nasir maggie had said shit my people would scalp me if they knew after all ive done for you since the dark had come and the cool it had been harder to keep the dog quiet and the big brute had lost interest in the bone and light flooded out of the door ahead of him joey from the rock waved for quiet down in the gully he saw the three of them mister the eagle and atkins standing tall they left dragan kovacs home it was becoming a ritual and welcome at the end of the day when the dusk made it impossible for them to work in their taped corridors a few of them and the foreman came to his home sat on his porch with him and drank his plum brandy he thought they needed the alcohol because of the work they did the sun was long gone over the hill to the west of the valley when they lurched off up the track to the junction where their pickups were parked by the caravans the foreman shouted back as he disappeared into the evening darkness thank you dragan and have a quiet night he laughed loudly i have enough of them to know them too well they are all quiet nights they think its going according to his plan maggie murmured sounds as if theres been a preamble and now its a break the details going to follow if the others decide to come in eagle says that misters done well but he says the others are hostile suspicious and wary but they like the money on offer the moneys good but this is eagle theyre still cautious mister says itll depend on the percentages god cant one of you throttle that damn animal she was on the flat stone beside joey the earphones on her head and she tilted the dish with the antenna spike so that it was aimed at the three men who stood on the gravel between the house door and the parked vehicles frank was with her and ante and fahro behind the stone in the gully muhsin and salko lay on the squirming dog scratched its stomach and tousled its neck the italian thats marco is going to be asked to pay fifteen per cent of the value of cocaine handled by misters network in the uk no thats the negotiating point theyll come down to twelve and a half per cent its eagle he says thats the bottom line nikki the russian city banking city of london laundering ten per cent is the minimum but starting at eleven and a half per cent of all monies washed through misters placemen theyve gone on to more percentages still with nikki but its peopletrafficking god they are talking big money corporation stuff jesus throttle it or gag it but shut it up the weapons trade mister i suggest not too hard to start with the eagle said in deference londons the conduit for the trade mister best place he could work out of access into africa and the middle east it was atkinss first contribution he felt shut out sidelined he was ignored start at six and threeeighths on the first million and go down to five and seveneighths mister said with confidence nine per cent on the second million ten on whats on top of that if he goes through our contacts sounds about right the eagle muttered now the turk that is some evil bastard mister grinned balefully i expect his mother loves him the turk we pay thirtyfive thousand pounds sterling delivery in sarajevo for refined product per kilo as against the fortyfive youre paying now so id he getting maximum thirtysix per kilo somewhere in the darkness above them a dog barked it was it sharp baying deepthroated bark three point six million for one hundred kilos i think i can live with that if its not lorries i was starting to think of all those regattas over the north sea there was a second bark but it was stifled abruptly then a low whine then nothing regattas in norway sweden holland belgium france all those clubs going over to compete can you sail atkins cant try learning im going to have a pee fifteen minutes must be nearly up you want a pee eagle ill call you when i need you atkins it was masterful of mister atkins had heard the bark and knew it was that of a guard or attack dog it was the bark of the sort of dog used by the royal military police for perimeter protection or for hunting a man down he heard the door close behind them alongside that sort of dog would be a handler and guns and his mind raced a listening probe the dog had barked beyond the fall of the lights around the door misters mastery had been in finishing his sentence about a regatta route then suggesting a pee like he was too dumb to have been alerted if they were listened to he shivered he heard the door behind him open again a light was switched on behind him from the hall its beam maybe two hundred times candlepower was thrown past him over the green wellcut and watered lawns over the shrub bushes and the manheight fence that was topped with a barbedwire strand into the scrub on to a greywhite flat stone fifty yards from him atkins saw the man he had tried to kill to run down the light caught the big spectacles too large for the face and the thin shoulders and the jutting knees as he sal crosslegged unmoving a woman with a dish was beside him and an older man in uniform thenthe flashlight caught two men in dark overalls and their rifle barrels blinked back at the beam another man with another rifle an imageintensifier sight on it scrambled to join them he couldnt see the dog but the barking was frantic and the noise billowed over him the light went out there was pandemonium in the doorway of the house he thought that all the bloody security had been in the house complacent and sitting in the bloody kitchen none of the idle bastards had been out on the propertys fence atkins started to walk he had come to the end there was a shake in his stride his knees were weak and he wanted to piss but he went briskly on to the lawns and through the shrubs he heard his name called but he didnt turn the engines were starting behind him and there was the flash of headlights the slamming of doors and tyres grinding the gravel the cry of his name felt like a knife into his back then leave the bastard fucking yellow bastard he heard the bark of the dog and the engines scream he raised the flag white flag abject surrender atkins shouted im coming over please dont shoot please dont he jumped at the high fence it bucked rocked held under his weight he did not feel the pain as the wire slashed his hands he rolled over it as he had been trained to do he blundered through the thorn bushes towards the dog he was thrown down hands forced their way over his body prised between his legs and into his armpits he was rolled over and his arms were forced into his back and the handcuffs clicked tight on his wrists he was dragged rocks caught his shins he thought of the steely loyalty of his mother if she came to visit him and the way the boy had struggled as hed been lifted on to the bridge rail and the contempt that would be on the face of his father they were into a wood of thickgrowing trees twice he hit the tree trunks and he felt the blood dribble from his nose they didnt allow him to slow them he was thrown onto the back of a pickup a cage door grated shut the vehicle jerked forward beside him kept from him by the cage mesh was the hot breath of the snarling dog he thought he was free he was no longer atkins which one are we following frank asked mister target one what about the others irrelevant to me joey said and the guy in the back hes yours not mine i can call up help cavalry i dont want help not from anyone where do you think joey cann we are going wherever he leads us to hell turn queens wont he hell sing testify ill fix him eagle you worry too much right now im worrying overtime just drive youre the better driver mister if im driving i cant shoot think eagle switch on the eagle knew mister when in structured situations he knew him in conference and in meetings and when there was an agenda on the table in front of him in the office over the launderette this though was new he did not know mister in crisis he was not a part of the other meetings where the maps were studied and the guns loaded he had been safe from them the two guns were now out of the glove box one rested between misters thighs the other was in his right hand both were cocked from what he could see of misters face and from his voice there was no panic it was as if he had found a welcome fulfilment the window was down the cold air of the evening whipping their faces mister checked often in the mirror but the lights stayed behind them in the chaos of the departure they had both of them tried to get into the russians car and been bounced out a pistol had pointed at their stomachs the turks car had already pulled away the eagle had never driven a getaway vehicle the lights behind were constant but the lights he followed diminished the eagle followed the taillights as best he could but the mitsubishi did not have the acceleration power of the mercedes fleet ahead always the lights were strong behind him he wanted to piss and wouldnt have cared if he had messed his trousers it was all right for mister hed find another bloody lawyer suddenly the lights ahead disappeared theyre trying to lose us bastards keep looking you reckon mister there are roadblocks up front i dont know just look for their lights theyll know the way out serifll know the bloody way whats that the eagle would have sworn far up the road just past the first sign into godbina village there was a flash of a brakelight and no headlights in front of it he thought the mercedes column had killed their lights so that the mitsubishi would not be able to follow of course there would be roadblocks and bloody machineguns his skill was in the reading of the pages of archbold not in evading roadblocks and bloody machineguns and if they evaded the roadblocks what then where to then he was slowing hed have sworn on his bible on archbold put his hand on the smooth leather of the volume and given his oath that the brakelights had flashed again off the road to mostar climbing and going right he took the decision he saw the turnoff there was a high moon rising he swung the wheel and snapped off the headlights what are you doing you said to follow them you sure it was them sure mister positive sure they turned off because therell be roadblocks they know the form the track they were on was good for the first halfmile the eagle started to relax he had made the decision and stood his corner and his decision was accepted his decision not misters he was starting to lose the sweat in the pit of his back he had to go slower change down through the gears as the track surface deteriorated every minute or so he saw the wink of the brakelights in front of him higher and climbing his eyes were now accustomed to driving by moonlight he leaned forward over the wheel and by concentrating to his limits he could see most of the ruts enough to avoid most of them then came the sinking despair it came in his gut his heart and in his mind at first he did not dare to look up to the mirror it had been his decision mister was quiet beside him as if hed parcelled off responsibility the low chassis of the mercedes saloons would have snagged on the rutted track he looked up into the mirror and the twin headlights merging there dazzled him the brakelights shone brightly then were extinguished as they drew level the eagle saw a tractor and two men unloading bales as they lurched on the rutted track past the tractor in the moons grey glow the eagle saw that its front lights were smashed he had made a decision and it had been wrong the humiliation and the fear settled on him he turned to mister what are we going to do an icy calm in the reply go overland walk out of here what are you eagle what the fuck are you not very clever mister ill get you out whatll you be then grateful mister the lights behind in the mirror glowed more fiercely and the distance narrowed as they came ever closer there was the eagle thought an inevitability to this conflict hed known it since hed seen the guns and heard the dog and when the flashlight had found the young man sitting crosslegged on the flat stone peering at them through heavy spectacles mister had said the young man had been dealt with he recalled what he had said in the road outside misters home a month before a bleat in his voice you know what i worry about i mean it lose sleep about one day you overreach know what i mean take a step too far i worry and he could remember misters punch just below his heart and the pain he pulled over and the mitsubishi lurched into a shallow ditch you wont leave me mister did i ever they were at the crest of a hill the track ever rougher fell away from them down to the left were lights and the outlines of closeset buildings there were more lights in the far distance and a murmur of water between the two groupings of lights was a black hole into which the eagle gazed and saw nothing he scrambled out he subsided into the ditch water covered his shoes and the cold gripped his feet he came round the front of the mitsubishi mister was silhouetted against the moon he heard the drone of the vehicles down the track behind them and in moments their lights would trap him are you coming or not coming mister ante had the rifle to his shoulder his bodyweight was against the bonnet of the blue van he aimed he had the whole of the upper chest of target one in his scope he dragged back the cocking lever scraped it till it locked home he settled frank swung his arm up his wrist would have hit the underside of the barrel immediately below the end of the sights lens and the aim darted towards the moon frank lectured ante joey realized the anger of salko and fahro muhsin had the dog down from the cage and it peed against the wheel of the van you did right joey said thank you but its not for you he was going to blow him away i am an authorized firearms officer sometimes im a team leader that man is under my control i am responsible for his actions and his target is a british citizen id have been before disciplinary a full inquiry i know the regulations no ones life was in danger it would have been murder and if hadnt intervened i would have been an accessory i support what you did im grateful for that joey i support what you did because mister is mine joey marshalled them muhsin would lead with the dog and ante would be alongside them joey would be a dozen paces behind with salko and fahro joey said to frank you should watch the prisoner please feel free to read him his rights and you can offer him a solicitor you can assure him hell have legalaid funding for an appeal to the european court should that be necessary and make sure hes warm fed and comfortable and but joey didnt finish he hurried away into the dark and there was the thud of the boots around him and the baying of the dog mister ran the eagle shambled after him every thorn hush seemed to catch at the eagles suit jacket and trousers and he seemed to stumble on every stone sometimes they would blunder onto a path and then they could go faster but each path petered away into denser thorn thickets on a drop deeper than half the height of his body he was thrown forward winded and he cried out for misters help but help didnt come and he pushed himself up and followed the crashing ripping sounds of misters flight driving him on was the noise of the dogs pursuit he didnt know how they would lose the dog there were people in the village his friends and mos friends who paid seven hundred and fifty pounds for a dog that was little more than a pup and they talked about their dogs talked about damn all else but their dogs spoke about ground scent and air scent the ground scent was from his shoes and the air scent was from the sweat as he panted to follow mister they said his friends and mos that the hardest thing in this good life is to evade a welltrained dog the heel of his right shoe had come off are you there mister youre doing well eagle keep at it he saw the shadow of mister and then it was gone there were thicker trees mister had gone into them then a path he was on the path and off it when he heard misters feet break dry wood mister hadnt told him of the path hadnt warned him of it hadnt guided him down it he tried to run but was capable only of a slow waddling trot his breath came in great heaves and his stomach bulk bounced on his belt he tripped moonlight didnt penetrate the canopy of the trees above him he fell flat the fall burst the air from his lungs his fingers scrabbled for a grip to push himself up the dog was closer and the staccato voices urging it on his fingers found the smooth shapes long thin shapes then wider but still smooth then the shapes of locking joints then narrower crossshapes then the teeth and his fingers slipped into the eye sockets and on to the rounded plate of the skull the eagle whimpered the skeleton was across the track he could not see it but could feel it and touch it and understand it as clearly as a braille reader would have he pushed himself up the dogs barking drove him on he had gone twenty more short strides when he realized that his left shoe was off thorns small stones bramble stems broken branch wood slashed his foot he hobbled after mister and sobbed from the pain mister was at the edge of the wood there was thin greywhite light from the moon and an emptiness in front of them that was cut by a dark line where water ran loud then more emptiness then the lights the lights were a grail mister had his foot down on a tape of dull yellow i lost my shoe and the others broken chist youre my burden the eagle stepped over the tape mister passed him the eagles feet sank into thick grass maggie had her torch on the map i think ive found where we are the village the hear one thats ljut and over there the far one thats vraca if you look in my bag frank in the back theres a flask wont be hot but better than nothing she switched on her mobile and banged out the numbers muhsin and the dog and ante had stopped at the treeline joey reached them with fahro and salko the dog strained at the leash but muhsin held it joey could see the shadowy shapes separated slipping away towards the dark cut he stepped forward he would follow where he was led arms caught him hands gripped his coat he struggled to free himself wherever the road led he would follow ante lifted the tape and salko pressed joeys head down till his eyes were inches from it fahro said the word and muhsin echoed it mina mina chapter eighteen the watch on the eagles left wrist stopped at one minute past ten oclock at ten oclock mister glanced down saw the hands of his own watch shine luminously at him sucked in breath and looked back he reckoned he had reached a halfway point in the open ground between the treeline that he had come through and the black strip that was his target where there was the rumble of fastflowing water he turned his back on the distant lights he had the ppk walther in the belt at his waist and the luger was hanging in his suitjacket pocket there would be wheels in the village where the lights were and with the ppk and the luger to persuade he would take a car if the dog came close he would shoot it with the ppk or the luger he didnt know why the dog the following men and cann had not broken clear of the treeline then he remembered the rifles he realized the target he made and crouched down the dew on the grass soaking into the lower legs of his trousers mister saw the blundering gasping approach of the eagle maybe forty yards away the eagle meandered towards him like a drunks walk how long would he wait for him half a minute the eagle had stopped he teetered on one leg in the light from the moon mister could see that the eagle had his arms out wide like he was a trapeze man walking the wire he seemed not to dare to put down the other foot from which the shoe was lost and swayed he would not go back for him but mister thought himself a good kind man a loyal man and he made a little pledge to himself when they reached the river and from the sound of it there would be a wicked current to fight against he would carry the eagle over it he would have the eagle clinging on his back or under his arm and he would take him over the river he could walk the rest to the lights where there would be a car of course there would be a car he thought hed waited the halfminute come on eagle shift it he felt no fear the river did not frighten him or the thought of the rifles that might be aimed at him neither did he feel fear of the young man with the big spectacles who had dogged and followed him the sensation was pure excitement he was challenged tested the excitement ran in him as a strain that was not that mister knew the word virulent from any challenge thrown at him any test put to him he was always had been the winner and when they were over the river had reached the lights and taken a car the eagle would be the witness come on or do you want the dog to have you one minute past ten oclock coming mister and thanks for waiting mister was about to turn to hurry on towards the dark strip and the river but he watched the eagle hopped on his shoe danced like he was a circus clown rocked then reached out the foot that had no shoe sank on it the flash was golden in its intensity the eagle was caught in the flame then lifted up as if a fine wire jerked him after the flame was billowing smoke and the thunder caught in misters ears he felt the winds rush against him and for a moment he thought he would be driven over but he rocked at his knees and the wind passed him the flash had wiped his vision there was only black darkness around him a silence came mister stood statue still he had no eyes and his ears rang tinny from the blast it was like nothing he had ever seen or ever heard then the voice came you are in a minefield mister the voice boomed into his consciousness you have walked into a minefield mister the voice was nasal like it was synthetic and amplified there will be mines in front of you beside you and behind you all around you in fact mister the voice came from the treeline and he thought it was shouted through cupped hands you went into the minefield when you stepped over the yellow tape mister the voice was flattoned and without pleasure or triumph and it cleared the ringing from misters ears he sank down he put his buttocks weight onto the wet grass where his shoes had been and then he tucked his feet as close to his buttocks as he was able it started as a whimper he had only once before heard the voice but he recognized it there had been seven words spoken by the voice then small not nasal and amplified the words dinned at him that was a mistake mister a mistake from the whimper came a low sob he had his arms tight around his body a light breeze rustled in the grass close to him waved it because he was low down on the ground the lights seemed further distant than before where a car would have been beyond the river he would have swum where he thought the eagle lay the sobbing turned to a highpitched scream that pierced misters skull cann hadnt screamed when mister had beaten him he sat hunched in the grass and he could not escape the eagles scream the scream was a knife that sliced into him the sound of a dying animal he took his hands from his chest and slapped them over his ears and pressed the palms against his skull but he could not lose the sound of it the scream eddied in the grass around him burrowed in the ground under him it was around him as the mines were mister did not know what a mine looked like he must have seen them on television but if he had he did not remember it there had been no mines at the fair he had gone to with atkins he did not know whether they were square or round black green or white god would the screaming not stop finally it did it died to a sob and then to a whimper he eased his hands from his ears mister are you there tell me youre there im here eagle can you come near were in a minefield eagle the voice choked i cant feel my leg mister theres nothing can do i want you close to me mister theres the pain everywhere except in my foot c h r i s t i cant move i cant come close sos you hold me im so fucking scared mister and the pain dont you listen eagle its a minefield he said it like he was speaking to an idiot his voice was quiet it was always quiet when the anger surged in him when he was angry men had to lean forward to hear him if i come to you i could be blown up myself yes m i s t e r bloody h e l l of course mister im your burden isnt that right mister mister knew what was said of him at the church and the crime squad and at the criminal intelligence service they said that he was careful it was grudging but it was said of him careful with sour praise he did not gamble everything was planned before he moved only fools gambled he owned clubs that had rich takings from roulette wheels but he never played he never backed horses or dogs unless the names of the winners were guaranteed to him the last time he had not been careful had taken an action that had not been weighed he had walked from monika holbergs vehicle to the blue van and had taken cann to its rear doors and had kicked punched the little weakling creature until his feet had hurt and his hands had bled and the small voice down on the ground had called it his mistake to move on the field in the darkness would be to gamble what are you going to do mister i dont know mister i need you please i cant help you no mister you mustnt risk yourself in the moonlight above the waving grass he could see just the shape of the eagles hip and his shoulder twenty yards away or maybe thirty the eagle was on his side had his back to mister the pain must have come as a spasm there was a low moan and the upper arm thrashed the eagles leg in the pain spasm was lifted at the hip there was no foot mister blinked the raised legs trouser was shredded to nothing at the knee mister did not know what a mine looked like but he knew what it did he needed to think he was beyond anything of his experience and he had no instinct to guide him he checked his watch the time was fifteen minutes past ten oclock there was at least eight hours of darkness to cover him by midnight he hoped that he would know what he should do and how far he should gamble frank had come through the trees theyd heard his approach and salko had flashed the torch to guide him and the dog had growled hed found them what happened joey pointed down in front of him at the level of his knees was the yellow tape frank whistled sucked in his breath we heard the explosion which one is it then the screaming god joey reached across and tapped antes arm he gestured for the rifle to be given him he let the butt rest against his shoulder levelled the aim and had his eye to the moulded endpiece of the night sight he had never been a marksman the gamekeepers on the estate were expert but joey hadnt been it was a dozen years when he was a teenager since joey had last had a firearm against his shoulder there was a clinical weight to the kalashnikov and it was made heavier by the sight the crosshairs wavered if hed fired he would have missed because he could not hold the aim steady but he could see the image was a greywhite wash and he tried to hold the crosshairs on the nearer spreadeagled shape target two was total white face body clothes and was prone he shifted the aim and the image in the sight blurred it went over the trees at the bank of the river jerked up caught the lights of the far village and it burned out he moved the aim down raked across the ground and then saw his target one mister sat and his arms were around his knees his head was down and rested on them but joey couldnt hold the aim he passed the weapon to frank he saw franks hands move expertly over it in the near darkness to check it then it was at his shoulder locked there as if it were a part of him dont bother to ask frank said and there was a grimness about him that joey hadnt heard before yes ive handled one and ive fired one have you seen your target two hes short of a leg i couldnt hold it that well i didnt know he hadnt a leg its off just below the knee full weight must have gone on it frank stared into the rifle sight and joey thought him mesmerized by what he saw what happens frank said nothing happens nothing can happen its dark if you hadnt noticed any man who goes walkabout in a marked minefield in darkness is certifiable we could call the people out but theyd only be losing their beauty sleep if they deigned to come they wont move before daylight looks like hes fainted or something best thing for him the solicitor right joey took the rifle he peered into it a last time then handed it back to ante the moon was at its highest point and its brightest but it was difficult for him to see either of the men in the field in front of him will he survive what do you want the best bedside manner or the truth i dont give a damn whether he survives you have joey a bucketful of humanity ive been with deminers some of the foreign ones they go to the irish bar up by the kosevo hospital at weekends they get pissed up and they talk try stopping them you have to move a casualty fast right now in the wound are the chemicals from the explosion half a tonne of earth and the shrapnel thats been in the ground for five seven years and old cow shit sheep shit fox shit rabbit shit thats all in the wound he should be in hospital in two hours but he wont be its not light for eight hours when its light theyve got to make a path to him what is it eighty metres could be a hundred theyve got to go on hands and knees with probes thatll take the whole of tomorrow may i tell you a story its not first hand but i was told it by the guys al the station when i arrived theyd been there eleven months ago there was a minefield on the edge of sarajevo thats not in the backwoods thats the capital city of this godforsaken country and it was marked with signs but not fenced ema alic i was told the name and havent forgotten it wont ever was a little girl aged eleven she was with two boys both twelve years and theyd gone out to play one of them detonated a mine the boys were killed straight out she lived she lived for two hours she was waving for help and screaming for help a crowd watched her and listened to her but they were too frightened to take the risk of going where the kid had sarajevo right and its the middle of the day they can get deminers there double fast by the time they reached her had made the corridor she had stopped waving and had stopped screaming not even for a child do they hurry you asked if he would survive flatvoiced joey asked what does mister do my question what is his spirit at home frank he has support now he is alone joey thought of the hours weeks months years of living with misters life never close never able to touch until now there was no one in his life to whom he could have described his feeling of driven elation not to jen not to his mother or his father not to dougie gough the elation was his own and he guarded it joey said dully at home he has the cardmen to enforce he has an accountant and a solicitor he has the mixer as his chief of staff he has the eels for his transport he has the princess he has a legal system that he holds in contempt because of its corruption and incompetence he sits on the throne of an empire alone joey thats why its different will he break and run in the darkness joey thought that frank williams armed policeman squirmed seemed to shiver would you would i i would not if he stood up and walked away i dont know the ground and i can at best guess he would have a nine out of ten chance of getting to the river perhaps it is a ninetynine out of a hundred chance but that leaves one in ten or one in a hundred does he run or walk or crawl does he close his eyes and just go or does he test each step he will have been deafened by the explosion he has no experience of this situation he is traumatized because he knows that his companion has lost a leg he is trying now lo think clearly but that is very difficult for him he has not gone to the help of his companion and that is a good decision because an amateur who tries to rescue is almost always the second casualty the wind was in the trees above them zephyrs moving the bared branches the same wind that tugged at mister who was alone i like what you say joey said what do you want from him i want him broken its the worst place a man can be a quaver stammered in franks voice he is trapped in a minefield i wanl lo hear him scream in fear there is a legal process he said i want him destroyed are you sick i think youre sick frank williams blundered away joey sat with the dog he leaned against a tree and his feet were under the yellow tape he scratched the dogs stomach and his face was licked and he laughed he shouted into the night for all of the valley to hear heh mister look over your shoulder and im there and joey cann laughed louder midnight as he helped her to undress and prepared her for bed in the shambles that was their home judge delic asked his daughter do you think of him is he ever out of your mind jasmina delic said i try not to i try to think of the car and the new kitchen we will have and our new life he thought she lied but he had not the heart to tell her that he recognized the lie ismet mujic reached his apartment in the citys old quarter he had left the turk the russian a nd the italian at the airport with a private pilot who would fly them out he was disgraced humiliated and he shouted in fury up the stairs have you found him he was told by a craven man that his friend had not been found and his world fell further into ruin a body that had been snagged among sunken tree branches in the miljacka river broke free and came to the surface was carried on by the current past hrasno and the apartment blocks of cengic vila under bridges and tumbled over the weirs her day and evening in the unis building tower a finished on her way home to novo sarajevo monika holberg pushed open the glass swing doors of the holiday inn she went to the reception desk she saw her letter in the pigeonhole untouched unread tightened her lips and went back out into the citys quiet in the room occupied by the sierra quebec golf team in the custom house a secure facsimile message was received from endicott room vauxhall bridge cross it was given to gough they were all there and they watched him gough said packer was at his big meeting it aborted when cann showed out there was no electronic evidence target three bruce james is in iptf custody packer and arbuthnot have gone across country and cann is in pursuit it doesnt matter though local authorization for intrusive surveillance has been withdrawn i think hes beaten us packer has i asked too much of cann i thought and i took a chance with him that cann would bring him down it was too much to ask they began to clear their desks and unhook their endicott in his room at vbx rang the home of a commander from the national crime squad dont interrupt me please and dont ask who tasked me you have an information leak from your building to albert packer a call to sarajevo was made the day before yesterday in the morning from the pavement outside your pimlico office we can be that specific the call was made at ten nineteen and was terminated at ten twentyone if you were to check your exterior video cameras you will see who made the call who went out of the building either side of that window act on it please endicott rang off traitors turncoats betrayers were a part of the history of his organization he understood the cancerous contamination of their presence the minister came into his wifes bedroom at their grace and favour home to switch off her light and kiss her cheek he sat beside her you remember when we were in opposition what you used to do your good works you tramped east yorkshire to raise money for refugee relief in bosnia you were fearsome to the stitchpockets you bullied till you had your cheques im late because ive been reading about the place you neednt have bothered the dreams gone its a corrupt haven for criminality and sinking and itll be worse the end of a dream is always sad the light going out and leaving a dark grubby corner he held her hand and hoped she slept and had not heard him are you there mister im here eagle what time is it if it matters its a minute past midnight i know where i am good on you eagle yes he knew where he was and he knew what had happened there had been a moment bliss a happy moment when he hadnt known where he was or what had happened to him it couldnt have been sleep but he might have fainted there hadnt been delirium or anything that was a dream only blank insensible darkness in his mind he had come through that darkness and he remembered opening his eyes and hed tried to swing his body but the pain had stopped him he felt weak and wanted to vomit he hadnt the strength his hands groped over his body as best he could lying on his side each place he touched made the pain hurt worse and there was sticky warmth on his fingers the liquid smeared them when he touched his stomach and his thighs only when he lay quite still was the pain numbed he had his back to mister couldnt see him and wouldnt risk the pain of trying to twist and look at him where his head lay on his lower arm there were no lights for him to look at but the moons glow showed the stretch of the field and then the black line of the trees does anyone know were here cann knows hes in the trees hes close he knows has he sent for help its dark eagle and were in a minefield no ones going to come and help i dont have much time mister if im not helped cant you come close to me mister dont you listen what i told you its a minefield wont you come nearer to me mister there are mines its what cann said all around me i cant move im thinking the eagle thought he was free it was as if a chain had snapped he could not see misters eyes which cut into men and made them shiver his back was to mister he had no fear now of mister and he had no need any more of the rewards with which mister bought him the freedom was the cool breeze that played across his face that stilled the pain he was safe from the fear mister are you listening to me mister ive been with you more than twentyfive years i know you mister like i know my hand i want to tell you what i have learned about you it was a struggle to raise his voice spit bubbled in his throat the pain was worse when he tried to speak the eagle did not have the strength to shout and he did not think he had much time he wished he could have turned so that he could see into misters eyes he gloried in his freedom and knew it could not be taken from him he hoped that mister heard him you are evil albert william packer you are the most evil man i have met as gods my witness i am ashamed to have been a part of you i hope as those i love say prayers over my body that i am purged of the sins of my association with you he could not lift his head which lay on his fallen arm he spoke into a wall of grass stems and he smelt the freshturned earth and the tang acrid of the chemicals you are the bully you inflict pain misery after you are dead whenever wherever you will be hated despised dont think a great column of people will follow your coffin they wont the coffin will go by and people will slam shut their doors and draw their curtains because you are vile a mutation of a human being but i thank you i thank you from the bottom of my heart for bringing me to this place here ive learned freedom from you thank you mister he wished that mister could have seen his face and seen the truth the honesty he felt his voice fell and he didnt know whether he was heard he cared no longer about the pain but tried to throw his voice and thank you for giving me a last sight of you youre scared arent you mister i dont have any fear not any longer youre scared i smell it how do i know you are scared because you havent run you cant buy a mine mister can you cant corrupt it a mine doesnt get defused because a bent bastard like me preaches on your behalf in some bloody crown court its not a jury you cant intimidate it its a mine he heard behind him a slight very small shifting movement can you see my leg is that why youre scared to run the movement was a metal scrape an oiled lever under a thumbs pressure show me youre not scared run run twenty yards or fifty then tell me youre not scared for a last time he hurled his voice high did cann bring you down the first three shots missed him they were a thunder around the eagle and the ground spat over him the fourth shot hit his raised shoulder and flattened him pinned him down to the grass as if a hammer drove a nail into him he gulped did cann he pulled the trigger again and again and again pulled it until the clicking replaced the blast and the magazine was emptied the voice was away across the fields from the treeline the eagle was your last best man that was another mistake whos going to protect you now mister are you going to run he let the luger slip from his fingers and tightened his arms closer around him to make smaller the space of wet grass on which his weight was set there were six more hours of darkness he had six more hours in which to make his decision are you going to run mister if he turned his body he could see the dark line of the river a hundred yards away could hear it beyond the river were the village lights and there would be a car it would take a hundred running strides to get to the river a hundred times his feet would stamp down on the grass and the earth one hundred chances of risk he closed his eyes against the night the explosion had roused him but it was the screaming that had pulled husein bekir from his bed he sat on the big ash log outside his home he was wrapped in his overcoat but that was little proof against the frost chill the explosion had woken him and then he had nearly slipped back to sleep against his wifes warm back then the screaming had started liven with his damaged hearing the sound of it had gouged into him he could not ignore it it had dragged him up tugged him out through the door he knew the sounds that animals made when in great pain the screaming was not an animals it was a noise that went to his heart and then it had died had faded a long time after the screaming had finished and the quiet had returned to the valley there had been gunfire the shots had been faint to his ears but he had heard them others came they came in coats such as his or with wool blankets over their shoulders and they stood beside him and behind him because of his position as patriarch of vraca none stood in front of him his view of the black emptiness of the fields over the river was not obstructed but he could not make out any movement and though he strained his ears he picked up nothing some of the men who gathered around him carried doublebarrelled hunting guns but if he had brought his own it would not have protected him against the screaming it was past three in the morning when lila brought coffee he cradled the cup in his hands and felt its heat on his skin he held a vigil and waited for the dawn when the screaming had started dragan kovac had tossed himself out of his bed had taken down from the hook the greatcoat from his days as a police sergeant and his cap he had gone outside to the shed at the side of the house where wood for the stove was stored and had groped until he found his axe he had leaned against the doorpost listened to the screams and held tight to the axe handle they were the most fearsome screams he had ever heard he thought he was a hard man conditioned to the suffering of pain long after silence had replaced the screams he had stayed on his porch with the axe readied in his hands there were the lights across the valley and the lights of his own village behind him and vehicle lights were at the top of the hill where the track crested the brow before falling down to ljut but he had not been able to see into the darkness then dragan kovac had heard the shots he had counted the number of discharges and had known that the full magazine was used the shots had driven him back inside his home he bolted the door then turned the heavy key in the lock and wedged a chair of stout wood under the handle he sat on the bed did not take off his boots and his greatcoat and his cap could not shake from his mind the sounds of the screaming he held the axe and waited for first light they offered him the flask but he refused it he could not speak to them nor they to him but when ante held the flask in front of him he shook his head he could smell the brandy he wondered if brandy had kept them on their feet and fighting when they had come out of srebrenica or faith or desperation and he wondered how it went with mister and if he had faith to fall back on or if the desperation grew he did not know how it would finish but he thought he had come near to the end of the road as hed pledged when they had finished with the flask he reached back tapped on antes arm pointed to the rifle and it was given him he looked through the scope sight he saw mister hunched still and then at the extreme edge of the tunnelled vision was a gliding movement that came closer to mister it was a greydark shadow on the greywhite field the shadow flitted in the moonlight it came from behind mister and skirted him warily not for two years perhaps more had there been a fox scavenging in the garden of his home near the north circular road by tripping the beams the fox set off the security lights and bleeped the consoles in the hall and in the bedroom several times mister and the princess had been alerted by the bleeps and had stood at the window to watch the mature vixen a cautious creature which mister liked and without fear which mister liked more alec penberthy had said she had a breeding den just inside the fence of the schools playingfields at night in the garden she had looked magnificent he recognized the shadow it came by him in a wide halfcircle it gave him space but did not seem intimidated past three o c l o c k the fox was an escape for him he had told himself that at three oclock when his wristwatch gave him that time he would make the decision commit himself move of course he would move he was mister he did not know fear he would splay out his hands sink them down into the grass use them to push himself up and then he would walk with firm strides towards the river he had set himself the deadline three oclock and now the minutes ticked past and the watch hands sidled further from the hour he watched the fox and that was his excuse not to move it watched him having come past him so lightfooted and so safe against the danger it settled in front of him sat he could see the silhouette of its shadow when it moved on he would push himself up that was misters promise to himself when he made a promise it was always kept his word was his bond when the fox shifted he would go he told himself repeated it in his mind that a few minutes did not matter the fox seemed to study him as if he intruded into its space then it ignored him and scratched it lashed with the claws of its back foot against its neck then under its front leg abruptly it shook itself then its neck rose and its nostrils pointed up it sniffed to have reached where the fox sat on its haunches he would have had to push himself up offer his weight to the ground then take ten strides he heard its coarse snorting then it was up it trotted away he thought the ground and the grass under its feet would barely have been pressured it stopped sniffed again and then its back sank low and it went forward the fox had located the eagle carrion it started to circle him the shadow glided over the grass and each circle was smaller he had shot the eagle silenced him and the voice had boomed at him in the night from the treeline and he had squirmed if it had not been for the voice taunting him arc you going to run mister he would already have gone started out on the hundred stride paces to the river it was what cann wanted that he should run cann wanted his feet shoes his weight pounding down on the earth and grass of the field cann wanted the flash and the thunderclap wanted to hear the scream cann was in the trees waiting on him a reminder of the consequences of moving a footfall landing on the antenna of a mine the fox was close to the eagles body he could not drag away his eyes the eagles body was barely visible to mister the fox he thought investigated the body he heard the rending of fabric the fox had found the wound it pulled on the torn trouser then began to worry at the leg he had no more use for the luger pistol no further magazine to fill it he had the ppk walther pistol in his belt he saw the shadow of the fox tug at the eagles leg mister hurled the luger at the fox it might have caught the foxs back leg or its lower stomach and it yelped shrilly but did not back off it gazed at mister they stared at each other if the fox had moved away then mister would have planted his hands down in the grass pushed himself up and started to run or walk towards the river it did not back off instead the shadow darted forward it was a blur against the grass mister saw something thrown up into the night air the fox caught what it had thrown up then went skittish and ran in tight squares with something in its mouth the fox played with the lower length of the eagles leg it bounced towards the leg and barked over it tossed it and jumped back from it then it settled mister heard the gnawing and the splintering of the bone he could not fire the ppk walther at the fox he would need all the rounds in the pistol when he ran when he went to the village where the lights burned to look for a car to take him out away a stone he looked for a stone he heard every sound from the foxs jaws he dropped his hand to the grass beside his buttocks he tore up the g r a s s and scattered it in front of him he cleared the grass from a patch the size of the handkerchief in his pocket scratching into the earth with his fingers he broke his nails and scrabbled deeper it was soft earth finely ground he did not know that soft earth milled and worked had been carried by rain streams from the edge of the field he burrowed with his hand moled his way into the earth to find a stone he was ever more frantic he would run when the fox had gone when he had found a stone and driven the fox off the eagles leg he felt the hard smoothness the little hole he had excavated was dark too deep for the moons light to reach into he started to scrape at the side of what hed uncovered and he felt the symmetry of the shape he thought that what he touched was the same size as the bakelite top of the twohundredgram jars of coffee powder that the princess bought his fingers eased from the side of the shape to its top and he cleared away more of the cloying earth until he felt the first of the six points that made the little star the mine was nine inches from his buttock buried under six inches of soil and root it was where his hand would have gone where the pressure would have been concentrated as he pushed himself up and readied himself to run the voice cold and without expression carried to him from the tree line time is moving on mister id have thought by now youd have run when the voice had dissipated in the darkness mister was left with the sound of the foxs teeth on the eagles leg and the frost was crisp in his hair the first light of dawn came in a soft smear on the hills behind ljut village chapter nineteen the low sun gilded the valley gold was painted on the hills and on the bare trees the lustre fell on the fields and was trapped in the grass and in the dead stems of the thistle and ragwort it nestled on the vineyard posts and glistened off the wires between them brilliant little shimmers of light ruddied the bristly back of a pig that had come out of the trees cover to snout for food the softness of the gold was daubed on the fields and the woodlands and played patterns on the smoke rising from the twin villages the smoke turned ochre in the early light as it peeped up from the chimneys and was dispersed the sun made dazzling reflections in the river where the water ran over shallow stones between the deeper pools joey cann had watched the dawn come the valley was laid out in front of him he rocked with tiredness and blinked tried to scrape the confusion from his mind if he looked for mister he looked into the sun that burned off the frost he could be patient the sun would creep higher into the sky and then he would see mister would know how the night had gone for him he sat on the ground with his legs outstretched and reaching to the yellow tape and he propped himself upright on an elbow the men around him snored quietly and the dog lay close to them he had thought mister would have run in the darkness would have gathered the courage and gone to the river would have cheated him away to his left he saw a column of pickups and ambulances come slowly down the winding track and they stopped near to the village he saw an old man come out of the front door of an isolated house further down the track wearing a uniform greatcoat and a cap of authority and carrying an axe across the river at another house that was separated from its village children burst through the door and a woman hobbled after them on a crutch they went to a man who sat bowed on an old tree log the sun rose joey saw mister and he knew that he was not cheated above the field grass he saw misters bent knees his torn suit jacket his tie that was askew at his throat and the hands that held his face and the hair on his scalp the smile was at joeys mouth he cupped his hands together and his shout broke the peace seemed lo scatter the gold dust that had fallen on the valley you should have run mister while you had the dark were you too frightened to run he jerked awake he did not know how long he had slept or where what stopped you he shook a shiver rattled him he was sitting and he thought he was falling he felt his weight slide and reached out to steady himself his hand found the wet grass and the muddied earth and slipped into the hole for a moment he could not control its slide he looked down he scrabbled for earth for a grip his hand was half an inch above the six points of the antenna that would detonate the mine his muscles were rigid he knew where he was he recognized the voice but could not see cann his stomach growled in hunger and his throat was parched near to him teeth scraped on a bone he stared down at the mine in the little excavated pit and saw the mud smears on the green paint he put the hand under his armpit locked it there in the night the trees around the rivers roar had made a dark line now the sun shone through them he could see each branch and each sprig growing from the trees trunks the river was safety a hundred strides away mister had never known fear he took his hand from his armpit brushed it against his stomach and felt the pistol in his belt then he worked the hand under the seat of his trousers and pushed himself up he nearly fell because of the stiffness in his knees he stood and started to massage his hips his knees and his ankles when he had worked over the flesh kneaded the joints and ligaments under the skin he stood to his full height made a bow arc of his back and stretched his arms he would run maybe he would close his eyes towards the trees by the river in his mind he put the boxes in their place he would run for the river a track of grey stone led from the river to the village where he would find a car he had the ppk walther pistol he readied himself he thought he would count to ten and then he would run he should not have but he looked at the ground between himself and the river the carcass of bones was bleached white was cleaned in the sun as if fresh paint was on it grass grew through the ribcage and the voice intruded once more what you have to think of mister is when its going to happen your first step or your last step or one of the middle steps at the start at the end or in between you dont know do you and you dont know whether youll scream like the eagle screamed after he had seen the first skeleton mister counted six more some were on their backs some on their sides and others had just crumpled down as if their knees had given way beneath them and their heads had fallen forward two of the white bone hulks were directly between himself and the river three more were to the right and two were to the left there was no pattern to them should he run the shortest way loop to the left or right or zigzag he gazed out at the bones go on mister run run so i can hear you scream his legs were stiff dead he could not take the step mister stopped the count he was short of the last number the wind played on the grass that covered the earth and moved the dead dark weed stems he heard the cry of crows above him and the gnawing of the foxs jaws on the leg bone he was leaden the light and the warmth were on his face he stood alone in the field god youre a disappointment to me mister is the fear that bad they woke they separated the ground hadnt moved for maggie bolton but the chassis of the blue van had three times theyd done it shed let frank do what neither the polish boy nor the young arab had been allowed to she couldnt have said which of the three times was the best but shed have been able to hazard which was the worst she was in her fortyeighth year it had been for her the first second and third time and there would not be another she doubted that even a kid of fifteen on heat would have chosen to lose their virginity in the back of the blue van on a bed of coats and rugs beside the new bucket if it had been with any of the men in vauxhall bridge cross theyd tried hard enough the bed would at least have cost them two hundred and fifty pounds in a west end hotel frank williams lay against her and his cheeks stubble prickled her breast so is that what all the fuss is about you maggie are an amazing screw i dont think so you are certainly not he turned away from her her back to him she dressed it would have been better with joey he had smooth hands and long fingers but he hadnt offered she hooked on her bra the light trickled opaquely through the back windows of the van and she found her knickers on the vans ribbed floor they were torn when hed ripped them off she wriggled into them and her tights and dragged on her jeans she wanted to be alone in her bed she wondered if hed talk about her to people in whatever bar he drank at if her name would go on a list well go on get on with it get on with what look after your prisoner find out whats going on youre great maggie dont hurt yourself i am a middleaged woman and so desperate for it that im the original easy lay dont worry im grateful youv cured my curiousity i thought there might be a future for us nothing good comes out of bosnia never has never will get rid of them she gestured behind her laid on the wheel arch carefully balanced were three knotted condoms she pulled on her blouse and her sweater then tugged her anorak out from under him she clicked open the metalsided box and lifted out the video camera and the collapsed tripod he was putting on his vest often washed and a fading dragon rampant on it she took the mobile phone from the integral batterycharger in the case his socks sliding on to his feet were threadbare at the heels she hooked the phones cables to the video when he had his shoes on he snatched up the condoms and leaned across to kiss her then he went to see to his prisoner and maggie took the video camera the tripod and the mobile telephone out of the van she walked a few strides down the track that was hemmed in by yellow tape she found a vantagepoint she wondered if she would be different when she returned to ceausescu towers whether the people she worked with would recognize it you know what think that tease bitch finally opened her legs i reckon she had it at last she set up the tripod then searched for stones inside the tape cordon and wedged them against the tripods feet it would have been better on all three times if shed thought of joey cann she screwed the video camera onto the tripods head she had never reached joey cann she held the mobile in her hand stood back to let the wind snag the tripod and the camera and she was satisfied that the picture would be steady he wore no uniform but she could not have discarded hers she would never reach him on the track frank was in animated conversation with the demining team men made grotesque by their plated waistcoats and visored helmets the wind brought her the flat tone of the shouted voice im thinking the fears worse mister each minute that you put it off the running will make it harder mister i want to see you run mister and i want to hear you scream she looked over the sunlit valley beyond an abandoned vineyard halfway between the treeline and the river and far from the yellow tape in the middle of an expanse of field target one stood the crows circled above him near to him was the body of target two and close to it was a blob of colour she could not identify it was all to her eyes so pretty joey had brought her there so pretty and so cruel she would never reach him she aimed the camera and dialled the number five men lumbered along the slight gap between the treeline and the yellow tape frank was ahead of them unencumbered at the back of the line was a german shepherd dog on a rope leash bigger than nasir and older when they came close joey looked into their eyes there was a weariness a dullness that matched the slow speed of their approach they wore overalls of dreary grey and heavy boots thick shapeless waistcoats with a flap that hung down over their privates and bulbous helmets with raised visors of unwashed perspex they carried thin metal probes and garden shears and one had a small handsaw another had a metaldetector hoisted on his shoulder and the one who held the dogs rope had a roll of yellow tape under his arm nasir growling was taken hy muhsin back into the trees frank made the introductions joey was asked by the foreman good english for his assessment joey scowled two men both british citizens went into the field just before ten oclock last night at one minute past ten a mine was detonated by the fugitive nearest to us target two we call him he bawled a bit then he went quiet alter midnight target two started to talk but target one shot him target one is alone he nearly moved at dawn he stood and readied himself lo move but then changed his mind hes not moved since he stood he hated saying each word to the foreman the man came into his space the others with him and their dog so the foreman said without enthusiasm we have one cadaver and one uninjured person that is correct correct what is the density of the mines we do not know mines were laid in the valley over a period ol nearly four years but it was not a disputed front line there is not a barrier minefield once there would have been a purpose to where they were buried but time and principally rain will have changed that they can be anywhere there may be ten a hundred or five hundred we have to assume always that we must work through a concentration of mines do you use the dog i think not the dog is too valuable if the casualty were still alive then there is great pressure on us to go faster i think we do not use the dog what do you do we make a corridor a metre and a half wide the foreman said it is very slow it is my estimate a hundred and thirty metres to him that is the work of a whole day the man is a criminal he shot the man with him you said that frank said softly he carries at least one weapon with a full magazine we have a prisoner the prisoner said there were two firearms in their vehicle i have searched the vehicle and there are no firearms in it however many shots he used for the killing he has the second firearm a ppk walther with a fully loaded magazine joey said the man who is dead is a lawyer wouldnt touch a weapon whatever plan you make you should assume that target one is armed do you know about mine clearance the foreman asked joey said that he did not it is necessary to be very careful we concentrate only on the work we go on our hands and knees and we probe all our attention is on the ground a few centimetres in front of our bodies we wear personal protection equipment but that is of little use to the man who sets off the mine the second man or the third if he is a few metres away will take the benefit from the clothing there is a full bomb suit from canada but it weighs thirty kilos and you cannot work in it not on your knees you have in the field a criminal an armed fugitive do you think i should ask my men to crawl towards him and forget that he is a criminal armed a fugitive and probe for mines and never look at him i cannot im not criticizing you joey said if he were not armed if thai were proved if he gave clear signs that he wished to surrender then i would reconsider the foreman shrugged should he run what would be his chance of setting off a mine joey asked it would be in gods hands hes not broken not yet joey said he will be they walked away taking with them their shears their probes the metal detector the roll of yellow tape and their dog the sun was rising and bathed the valleys fields they trudged off alongside the treeline and frank was close to the foreman joey thought it was how he wanted it to be he smiled at the four men who were withj him but none caught his gaze he sat down the dog nasir came to him it lay against his leg and his raised knee threw some shade for it the sreb four made a little huddle and sat apart from him in front of him caught in the suns strength mister stood and joey did not see a muscle of his body moving he would weaken joey knew it exhaustion hunger thirst and the creeping fear of the mines around him would sap mister and then mister would run he cupped his hands men were here mister who had the skill to reach you and bring you out but i told them you were armed and had killed and who you are theyve decided youre not worth the risk all thats left to you mister is to run and to hope midday judge delic having recessed his court till the late afternoon wheeled jasmina from the mercedes to the doorway of a boutique on ferhadija tilted the chair over the street step and pushed her inside they were no longer windowshoppers she knew the trousersuit she wanted black professional and styled from milan the car was left on the kerb a noparking zone but a black mercedes would not be interfered with by the police and up on the hill over the river workmen scrambled over and through their home the firemen took the strain on their rope relied on the grappling hook to hold and pulled the body on to the steep stoneclad bank of the miljacka the water dripped from it as it was beached around the icewhite throat of the body was a gold chain a fireman fingered it and read the inscription on the bar to dearest enver with love serif he wiped his hands on his overalls and activated his radio ismet mujic sat in his apartment the curtains drawn the gloom on his face his world collapsed and waited for the telephone to ring and as he waited he cursed the day that a man from green lanes in london had telephoned to urge him to receive strangers anxious to put to him a business proposition nikki gornikov slept off his overnight travel in his own budapest bed and marco tardi dozed in the rome transit lounge before the palermo feeder flight was called and fuat selcuk snored in the firstclass cabin of the austrian airlines flight to damascus going their different ways returning to their base camps they had each pledged that they would singly or collectively never deal again with albert william packer he was dead meat might as well have hung from a butchers hook monika holberg her desk and computer screen in the unis building abandoned walked into the holiday inns atrium crossed to the reception desk and saw her letter in the pigeon hole beside the key she asked for it to be returned to her she tore it into small pieces and gave the scraps back to the clerk to be dropped in the rubbish bin behind the desk as she pushed open the hotels doors she felt a sense of disaster falling on her it was the same sense she had known when coming back to her home at njusford on the island of flakstodoya to be told that her brother had hanged himself in the cattle byre the men and the woman of sierra quebec golf stood around goughs computer screen on the central desk and stared in tonguetied astonishment at the image presented to them a detective chief inspector reached for his telephone to make a routine call and found that his line was dead he looked up and saw that the immediate openplan area where he worked on the upper floor of the national crime squads pimlico offices was deserted in the moment that the first bead of sweat broke on his neck he heard the door behind him snap open and there were hands on his shoulder and his collar and he was lifted from his chair checking his watch to be certain that his call was in tandem with events two floors below the commander from the national crime squad rang the private secretary to the minister i think we are now in a position to share the rotten apple is out of the bucket then he spoke to the car pool and told his driver at what time they would leave for the custom house clarrie hinds told her daughter to get home and stop moaning and young sol closed down the screen on the last computer disk and marvelled at his luck in being chosen and the mixer waited for a call to alert him to the return flight so that he could send an eel to meet it and around the capital city men who dealt in business and pushed business grumbled at the inconvenience caused by misters absence the sun blazed down on the bunica valley it burned his face and his hands it seared into his eyes as it reflected back from the grass carpet mister knew that he had to stay standing if he slipped down onto the flattened ground under his shoes then he would never rise again would never run the sweat ran in his hair over his forehead into his eyes and made them smart with the sweat in his eyes the trees at the riverbanks danced and misted if he turned he would see cann and the shouts would cut deeper he tried to keep his gaze ahead of him on the dark pools of the river and the silver spates separating them if he looked down he would see the pit he had excavated and the mine each time the voice taunted him coldly teasing tormenting and torturing the fear was stronger mister did not know if he could destroy the fear behind him was the fox there was no meat left on the eagles ankle and shin its teeth were scraping bare bone he started to count but he knew that when he reached ten he would change the target to a hundred and then to a thousand he could not kick his feet in front of him and start to run the high sun beat on him and the sweat streamed down him and the strength dribbled from him it is a duel they had met at the ford the water over the stones was too high too fastflowing for an old man to cross that is stupid talk husein bekir called back you say it is stupid because you have not read books is that because like an old fool you cannot read books i can read dragan kovac grimaced smugly then perhaps like an old fool you have forgotten what you have read or forgotten what your teacher told you at school it is in history listen old fool there are stories in history about duels champions fought in single combat man against man to the death or until one submits its idiot talk you never listen i have talked to the foreman of the deminers they speak with me because i am a man of experience ami importance do they talk to you it is what lie tells me the foreman it is like the time of ban kulin or when the great khan came from the east or the time of king stephen tvrtko or when mehmet arrived from the south and the tyranny of the muslims began disputes were settled in single combat to the death or to surrender husein spat onto the ground dragan persisted that is why the foreman has come back here to clear your fields not that you an old fool will ever work them this spring i will plant my new apple orchard fifty trees and i will be here to harvest the first crop do you mean it this shit about single combat it is what the foreman said i dont understand that husein shook his head wearily because you are an old fool and you do not listen the foreman is an intelligent man so he confides in me a criminal from britain mr barnabys country came to our country for whatever corrupt reason he is followed by the british customs by our men and the international police he is in flight from them and with him is his lawyer they leave the road and come down the h i l l where my soninlaw is dead husein said grimly and go into the field the lawyer detonates the m i n e i heard his screaming like children in hell detonates the mine the criminal shoots him because the criminal has a gun and has killed the deminers will not move to reach him that pleases the customs man he is called joey that is a stupid name husein sneered like a girls name dont old fool interrupt he is young is junior he is nothing the criminal is a big man it would not be a contest singlehanded combat if they were in london but they are not they are here and the criminal is in a minefield and husein was triumphant which your people laid which pollutes my fields and the minefield makes them equal joey taunts him that he is afraid to run across the field to risk going through the mines if the criminal does not dare to run his spirit fails him then he loses dignity while they bickered the longstanding friends husein bekir and dragan kovac gazed out over the fields close to them the deminers worked in their taped corridors crouched over their probes away in the distance hard for them to distinguish in the sunlight the single man stood and around him was the emptiness who cares about dignity in a minefield did lila did my soninlaw did the first foreman you told him about the fallen post you sent him to repair it and he will never walk again dignity to a criminal is everything go into mostar find tula and stela dignity is the only thing they have if they are humiliated show fear plead for mercy then they have nothing this man there he tries lo hold his dignity and the young man tries to take it from him the police could shoot him but then he dies with dignity and happy and he becomes the legenda does he want to be remembered for his dignity or for his fear that made him surrender it is subtle but you would not understand that at the moment he does not know what to do i believe he suffers i think it is stupid talk again husein bekir spat when a man is in a minefield what value is dignity to him the picture on the screen was pastel rinsedout colour mister in his suit stood in a field in the custom house room of sierra quebec golf the team short of only sqgi stood behind gough their workplaces were abandoned the desks littered with file papers and photographs above the only tidied place where the computer was switched off was the sign cann do will do the picture in front of gough enmeshed them and none had the will to break free from it the image was of their target one they all had paper mountains to scale but the work had been pushed aside once the call had come through from vauxhall bridge cross and sqg had been summoned to goughs computer had rustled the keys found the network and had downloaded the picture gough wouldnt have been able to because he was weak on the new science but sqg was the wizard their work that morning and afternoon should have taken them into the final planning stages of the raids that would sweep into the homes of the mixer two of the cards the eel who had driven the lorry and the warehouse where the truck bosnia with love was garaged it was goughs intention that when mister returned he would find his organization disrupted under microscopic investigation and doubt permeating his lieutenants but the planning work was discarded the image fascinated them the camera angle never changed and the lens never zoomed it would have been a still frame but for the occasional wheeling swoops of the crows and the bluster of the puff clouds in the wind mister did not move he did not seem to change his weight from a rightfoot bias to a left foot he did not reach out with his arms to stretch or flex his hand did not go to his forehead to mop it the rain pattered on the windows facing into lower thames street but the shower had no reality for them the heat of the sun on misters head and shoulders were real they could sense it because gough had lit his pipe in blatant contravention of the inhouse edict cigarettes were on and sqg billowed smoke from a small cigar the room was fugged they watched mister and each in their minds played with his dilemma and wondered what they would have done faced with his situation the shouts thin and metallic played over the loudspeakers beside goughs computer made them squirm but they were all addicts the door opened heads turned briefly the glances to the intruders betrayed their feelings the chief investigation officer introduced the commander from the national crime squad there were some among them and gough might have led who would have gone to the walls and abruptly pulled down the sheets on which the cartwheel was chinagraphed and the plans for the next programme of raids but the screen held them cork intoned i thought you should know that this afternoon officers of cib entered national crime squad offices and arrested a detective chief inspector who was a primary leak source on investigations into the affairs of albert william packer the leak is plugged i am instructed yes instructed by the appropriate minister of the crown that we cooperate share with the commander and his people the fruits of our investigation i am told that united we will improve immeasurably on the chance of a successful prosecution of packer and the dismantling of his empire if he was heard it was not shown the eyes of the team stayed on the screen i intend initially to second one of sqg to the crime squad and for you to have one of their experienced officers in here and welcomed when packer returns the full resources of both organizations will be turned on him packer is he on his way back do we have a flight gough pointed to the screen reluctantly sqg and sqg edged aside and allowed the intruders a small space behind goughs chair the cio and the commander craned forward good god isnt that packer where is he hes in a field commander hes standing in a field gough said with dry civility he is standing in a field and right now his thoughts are far from buying an airline ticket the field is in a valley that is about ten miles southsoutheast of mostar why why is he standing in a field its not an ordinary field its not sown with parsnips or potatoes its crop is mines he is in a minefield how does he know he is in the middle of a minefield he knows because arbuthnot the eagle our target two stepped on one and is now deceased he is caught trapped in a minefield and his little mind is working overtime what about rescue the commanders voice was hoarse arent there trained people who can bring him out its a long story gough evaded too long for now thats arbuthnot the commanders chin and the chief investigation officers jaw were over goughs shoulders as he showed them the corpse and they peered at the dark shape in the grass that was slight insignificant and diminished by the scale of the fields whats that the commanders fingernail replaced goughs the point he took was beyond the standing figure and near to the prone shape against his nail was a russet blob unclear dont know gough said well go in on it gough hesitated and flushed thats a bit beyond me should i ring my granddaughter and have her ferried over sqg inserted herself knelt beside goughs leg and worked the mouse she highlighted the russet blob clicked and zoomed dragged it closer and clearer it was not necessary for cork to speak they could all see what he saw cork blurted christ its a bloody fox whats it got its got a bone its cleaning its bloody teeth on a bone whats that on the end of the bone i dont want to believe what i am seeing its a shoe its arbuthnots shoe the fox has eaten his bloody leg all except for whats in the shoe christ almighty the smoke of the cigarettes and the small cigar and from goughs pipe floated over the screen the zoom pulled out then sqg took the centre point of misters back and he was pulled jerked closer to the watchers they could see the silver streaks of perspiration at his temples the voice came over the speakers they were pindrop quiet as they listened are you going to run mister or are you going to beg for help to come and get you let me talk you through the begging throw the gun away first then strip get off every last stitch then beg youre naked and youre begging and all the world knows youre finished and a loser or you run those are your options mister come on come on the voice was gone light wind bruised the cameras microphone who is that the commander barked his name is cann hes sqg gough said flatly he is our most junior executive officer its torture psychological torture cork snapped whats his problem he is challenging him to risk his life in a minefield packer as damn near as makes no difference is in custody if youve anything to charge him with what youre doing is obscene even packer has rights i never sanctioned such behaviour all i sanctioned was surveillance then you didnt know your man gough said what did you want mr cork did you want a packaged legal process or the elimination of our target one i thought i knew what you wanted get him out that is an order mr gough remove cann easier said if you hadnt noticed mr cork that field and that valley and packer and cann are a long way from me but ill do what i am able an order mr gough how many mines do you reckon are there mister frank listened to the pitiless ring of joeys voice he thought misters shoulders out in the field were lower and he wondered whether misters knees were near to buckling frank had driven into mostar and dumped his prisoner in a police cell under iptf supervision and then had bought supermarket cold food and water he had come back to the crest of the hill then the call on maggies phone had driven him down the slope path with the food and water past the skeleton of a wretch who had tripped the wire of a pmra mine with the instruction from london the men had their backs to joey cann he crouched beside them and listened to what he was told as they ate and drank frank williams was a career policeman and he believed in the rigour of law enforcement and in the processes of the criminal code he listened to ante their spokesman and then to the chipped remarks of salko fahro and muhsin who had the dogs leash coiled in his hand he had seen the monitor picture from the video camera and had heard the mocking shout across the valley what he had seen and heard made a travesty of justice as he knew it when they had finished said what they wanted to he went and stood behind joey cann brought bread and cheese and an apple and what was left in the water bottle the head wasnt turned the eyes were locked on the back in the dark suit jacket that rose above the hazed heat of the fields are you listening to me im hearing you london want you out do they the instruction to be passed to you was made personally to me by douglas gough acting on behalf of dennis cork chief investigation officer not tomorrow or the day after but now out and quit is that what he said what youre doing is barbaric maggie rigged up the video and its playing over the mobile they are watching it in london they know what youre doing and like me they are disgusted at your selfserving arrogance youre going down to his level misters maybe going lower than him if you dont believe what im telling you out and quit then use your mobile and call your gough go on joey shifted his weight and took the mobile off his belt he peeled it out of the ragged leather case flipped off the back flap and took out the battery the battery went into his breast pocket and the mobile was hooked back on his belt frank spoke steely quiet those men behind you they call you nasir theyve given you the dogs name muhsin told you that nasir oric defend r of srebrenica their military leader was a hero salkos just told me that when the town fell the people rampaged and looted in the last hours before the serbs came in and they found warehouses stacked to the roof with undonated food but it wasnt for free handouts it was for blackmarket sale and that was criminal ante tells me that nasir who had been pulled out by the government to tuzla before srebrenica went under led a column of a hundred and seventy men who fought through the serb lines to link with the fighters breaking out handtohand combat against the odds and that was heroic fahro tells me that today nasir oric is a rich man not bad for an expolice bodyguard with a moneyspinning restaurant on the lake at tuzla and wont talk about the source of the startup cash why do they call me nasir only one side of him was a hero the other side of him was a good man and a bad killer its the sort of confusion this place breeds and youve got it bad so im telling you now i want no part of it nor maggie nor them do i leave you food we want no part of what youre doing hes not eating so im not eating now he turned frank saw the boyish sincerity wreath his face and the smile im going to win you know hes the loser im the winner at what cost frank asked sourly at what bloody cost the smile slipped the frown was above the big spectacles ive only one favour i need from you please request of them that the dog stays with me ill bring him back to sarajevo safe and sound a promise but id appreciate it if i could keep him the food and the waterll do for the dog if theres nothing better it was only a dog frank put the request only another dog frank left with the sreb four before he went into the depth of the trees he stopped and looked joey fed bread to the dog then poured water into its mouth he started to walk hurrying to catch the men ahead of him and the sun fell in shards between the trees it was a soft call thank maggie for what shes done for me give her my love he was weaker the sun was on misters back it was off his face and that brought slight relief he stood and did not move he gabbled numbers but they had no sequence no rhythm and he had no target number the numbers were random the decision was put off he did not know the time but the suns force had come off his face and away from the top of his head and was now on his back he was sinking the numbers in hundreds tens and thousands cluttered his mind when he lost them they slipped away from him then he thought of cann between the scrabble of numbers was the sight of canns face big spectacles a wide forehead curly hair without a comb a small mouth the clerk the paperpusher of sierra quebec golf at that age he would be little more than a probationer the kid stuck leech like to him why mister could buy policemen and judges and bankers and the civil service and what was canns price small change ten thousand pocket money fifteen thousand enough for a downpaymert on a flat the eagle had said you know what i worry about i mean it lose sleep about one day you overreach know what i mean take a step too far i worry poor old eagle good old boy and right again always he could no longer see the trees at the river because the sun bounced on them and his eyes were too tired to focus on them there was no respect in canns voice when he shouted he did not know how much longer he could stand and not move if he were to be beaten and to beg it would be soon he was slipping he played a game with a mans mind and with a mans life joey was alone with the dog he had fed it the bread and cheese and the apple for pulp crunching and all of the water that theyd left hed heard the murmur of the vans engine as it had driven away from the track and the pickups sometimes there were the voices carried on the wind of the deminers working from the track by the river but they were little more than whispers and he could not see them he said to the dog who was named after a hero and a killer doesnt worry me nasir if im going down in the filth with him and get to fight dirtier than he knows how he loses i win what i want is to have him in my hand and to crush him hes always won ive always lost but not here you can understand that nasir his head shook the hunger and thirst were worse and he could not cough up saliva to run over his tongue in front of him out in the sunlight mister fell joey croaked his shout dont cheat me you bastard dont beg dont cry stand up stand up you cheating bastard i want you running running among the mines and i want you screaming get up the sound on the speakers faded and was lost against the traffic on lower thames street the picture was dying sqch said it was the battery going down on the mobile or the power pack on the camera was exhausted she remarked that she was surprised the camera and the mobile abandoned on the vantagepoint by miss bolton when she had pulled out as ordered had lasted so long all of them in the room stared without forgiveness at dougie gough dont say it you dont have to tell me i take responsibility i think they are about to go into what is euphemistically called closequarters combat itll be in the gutter gorbals streetfighting i ask myself down there can cann win and then does it matter other than to cann who wins and who loses god watch for him the last image on the screen before the snowstorm was of the fox careering away with the bone and of the fallen man trying to push himself up chapter twenty the skies were clear and the wind had whisked away the few clouds over the hills in the east there would be another frost over the valley that night the same light hoar frost but in the last hour of the day as the sun balanced on the crest of the hill it still carried strength and threw down a final limited warmth it hit the back of a young man who sat with the clay mud on his trainer shoes the dirt on his jeans and the filth stains on his anorak and it bounced from the inside of his spectacles lenses onto his grimy unshaven face it made fierce colours on the coat of a dog who played at gnawing his fist it danced on the shoulders of an older man in the field who tried to push himself up and failed and tried again and made shadows from his crippled efforts it simpered over a fallen body but still had the power to cook its flesh and to make the stench rise from it the sun was on the weedstrewn fields that had once been ploughed and tickled the weeds driedout seed sacs and nurtured the flowerpods not yet ready to bloom and it rested in the days death on the grazing fields and on the carcass bones of the heifers and the bullock who had browsed there and it filtered onto the posts and wires and the rotted roots of a vineyard and it splayed out over a patch of ground that might one day be an orchard of apple trees the sun sank the red replacing the gold the shadows lengthening and caressed the rusted frame of an abandoned tractor it sparkled on a swollen river and caught each wave over the hidden stones of a ford and it laid down the trellised reflections of bared tree branches onto the dark deep pools where the trout and the pike hunted it dazzled the eyes of a retired police sergeant and a tired lifewearied farmer the one on a chair in his porch with his bottle in front of him and the other on the log in front of his house with the crude rolled cigarette hanging from his upper lip it flashed on the windscreens of the pickups that carried men up the hill with their armoured waistcoats helmets with visors their overboots and their sharp steel prods as the sun dropped so the valley quietened and the men who used hammers and power drills to repair their homes came down off their ladders and the women who had gossiped and laughed and yelled abuse at their kids while the heat bronzed their arms to walnut now scurried to drag their washing from the lines make a last broom sweep on their doorsteps close their doors and stoke their fires it would be a cold night because the skies were clear over the valley the sun had lost its gold and was an angry red the crest of the hill to the west cut the first small bite from the sun the ghosts came spectral groups at first little shadows the axle pins of their wheelbarrow squealed for lack of oil and they cursed at the weight of the hessian sacks they carried with the spades and pickaxes on their shoulders the faces of the ghosts were young and they wore field fatigues of greenblue or of combat camouflage they went to their appointed places the quiet around them was broken by the ring of the spades striking buried stones and the thud of earth clods thrown aside the ghosts were the poisoners on their hands and knees they put the plastic the chemicals and the metal working parts into the holes they had dug and loosened the screws that made the poison live and laid earth and small stones around the poison and filled the holes smoothed the earth and the ghosts measured out lengths of wire and used the flat shapes of their spades to knock in peg posts to which the wire would be tautened and tied later the rain would come and drench the ghosts and silt streams would carry the poison from the wood paths and from in front of the bunkers from gateways and tracks and the streams would take the poison and scatter it at random without shape in the fields and the ghosts would be gone the drop of the sun chewed at by the crest of the hill made the valley tranquil it was too low now to find a strand of wire over which the grass grew protectively the gold had gone he knew it would be the last time that he would try mister put his weight on his hands they crushed the grass he pushed himself over onto his knees and then he gasped a big breath pushed again his knees creaked in protest and he stood in getting himself up onto his feet he had swivelled his body he swayed he had weakened and had told himself it was the final effort he stood and rocked and his feet were numb more than half of the sun had disappeared beneath the horizon what was left was low in his eyes and it was hard for him to see into the trees but he thought he saw the wide spectacles and the pallor of canns forehead it was his last try he had rallied what strength was left to him five times he had tried to push himself up and five times he had subsided on to his haunches he flexed his toe muscles the circulation had staunched and the muscles were locked tight but his balance held and confidence trickled back well done mister a good effort now make my christmas and run dont quit on me now mister it was an hour since the voice had last shouted at him a whole hour since it had goaded him for an hour he had sat between his attempts to push himself up and the valley had gone quiet around him he had thought of the past and the present of the eagle and the mines of the cruncher and the mines of the princess and the mines of the mixer the cards the eels and the mines of the spieler cafes on green lanes the lorries coming through felixstowe docks and dover harbour and of the power and the mines it was the pungent smell of the eagle like he was rotting already that kept the mines in his mind but he was standing fuck the past and the present he would not run he would walk towards the future his mind was a shambling mess that was the sun and the hunger mister craved the future lie low go quiet young sol in the place of the cruncher maybe davey hendersons boy in the place of the eagle the princess back with him of course she would be a new cruncher a new eagle and the same princess and the word would goround the pubs bars clubs that mister had walked on through a minefield had had the balls to put his fee down stamp them on ground that was stacked full of landmines no fear no bloody fear he was mistet no bastard took liberties with him the shadows of the trees on the hill groped toward him he turned his body but kept his feet on the crushed grass the wind came in a little surge riffled the grass and brought him the smell of the eagle it seemed to cling to him he could beat the mines he was the untouchable there was a sliver of movement ahead of him the head of his shadow wavered far in front of him on a patch of ground that was bare or sparsely grassed mister saw the snake slide away from his heads shadow its skin was rich brown cocoa in colour but spread on it were paler blotches like water pools on an oil sea it must have been sleeping on the sunwarmed earth in the last of the days heat but then he had stood finally and the shadow had cooled the place where it rested the snakes place was on the direct line he would have taken the shortest route he would have walked to the riverbank he had no fear of snakes insects spiders he watched the snake meander across the patch he saw its head its needle eye and its jabbing tongue he was about to take the first step not running and not blind with closed eyes walking so that he held his selfrespect the snake went into the thicker grass that ringed the patch of crusted earth he looked a last time for it he readied his leg for the first stride he breathed hard sucked the air into his throat his lungs he had no fear it was as if a crisis had gone his shadow was further on than where the snake had slept he would follow his shadow to the river and leave the kid cann bawling and yelling behind him he touched the pistol butt above his belt as he tried to follow the last wriggle of the snakes tail mister saw the wire if it had not been for the snake he would not have seen the wire the wire did not have the lustred sheen of the snakes skin it was coated in dirt he followed the line it took in places grass sprouted over it and then it would reappear then it was hidden again he should not have looked for the end of the wire that ran at a height just above a mans shoelace knot he knew he should have squinted his eyes shut denied himself the sight of it and stepped forward the wires line took him away to the left past an old tree branch in which it was snagged and then it was angled higher he could see the stake that held it up and its green painted body with the faded stencil markings that had a squat cluster of antennae points just below the height of a mans knee with a ring above them to which the wire was fastened the breath wheezed from his body his knees went and with them his bladder the urine steamed on misters leg as he went down when he was on his hands and knees in the grass he could not see it the last of the sun was above the hills crest and the higher trees were webbed with it the sky spread bloodreddened light on the valley washed off it the brightness of the day he was broken his head was on his knees and his fingers were over his eyes but the tears came and the urine flowed on his leg joeys voice sang out god mister you are a disappointment to me not

help me you are armed mister throw any firearm away from you he took the ppk walther from his belt he swung his arm and hurled it high he saw it against the ruddied glow before it fell against the darkness of the hills slope i did it i saw you do it mister strip off i want all your clothes off you and your socks and your shoes everything then stand then ill come and get you thank you thank you cann he tore off his jacket and his fingers fumbled with his tie he ripped his shirt open and threw it at the grass then the belt in the dropping light joey watched as mister out in the field stood and kicked off his trousers he took the mobile phone from his belt and the battery from his pocket married them and punched the numbers he was tinny and distant in her ear its as if ive killed him i have destroyed him i know what i have done to get there jen i went down lower than him i was more cruel more brutal more vicious i sucked the strength out of him he was untouchable he did not know fear he is now standing in a field and bending to take off his shoes and socks and then he will be quite naked i told him to strip he said jen to me please for what ive done you wouldnt want to know me two days ago he thrashed me and i didnt cry out he had a big meeting i wrecked it i brought him down i peeled his men away from him he went into a field i am at the edge of the field i have taunted

i have to bring him out where he is jen its a minefield the rambling voice went and she was left with only the tones purr in her ear he was stripped was bare the wind was on his skin and it seemed to mister to heal him to soothe the burns and sponge off the sweat he held out his hands at his sides and made a cross of himself the sun had gone but left its fainter glow on the hills crest and the lights of the two villages shone distant and bright he saw the movement at the treeline cann came for him with the dog at his knee to bring him out dragan kovac watched from his porch and husein bekir from the log in front of his home it was their valley and was invaded by strangers they had the right to watch he stepped over the yellow tape joey started to walk towards mister he felt a bond with the dog the dog had no fear and the weight of its body rippled against joeys leg and that was comfort the dog gave him courage he had asked what would be his chance of selling off a mine he had been told it would be in gods hands the dogs paws glided on the grass but joey stamped it down with each stride he knew everything of the man who stood ahead of him with the arms out when he ate when he showered when he had sex when he cleaned his shoes he knew the cartwheel of his organization the pitch of his voice the gait of his walk and the assets secreted away that made mister first among equals only joey knew what had brought the fear to misters mind and had crushed him at the custom house if they had seen mister naked and holding out his arms in surrender they would be launching the pissup to end all binges joey alone owned the moment he felt no elation but a simple flat lack of satisfaction no thrill no triumph he had gone to the end of the road followed where it had led him and the vista was empty he did not look down joey reached the eagles body he smelt it and the dog sniffed at it he swung to his left and started out on a wide halfcircle that would bring him face to face with mister the dusk gathered around him the dog close to joey growled softly and bared its teeth as they skirted misters buttocks then his hip then his groin in the halflight gloom mister cut a pathetic and pitiful figure but compassion had long ago been sluiced from joey he saw the pleading in misters eyes and knew that he had won he faced mister he could not reach into the future he would lead his prisoner to the trees take him up the path and past the skeleton up to the crest of the hill and he would permit him to dress except for his shoes and his socks and would sit the dog down near to his prisoner in the morning when the vehicles came he would commandeer beg or borrow a ride to sarajevos airport and he would fly back to heathrow there he would hand his prisoner into the custody of the sqg team and he would go back to the bedsit on the top floor of the house in tooting bec and he would sleep he did not think he would ever again return to the custom house he had left the uniform behind he was not a part of the culture it was the price he paid the taking of mister did not come cheap he would be shut out he looked over misters body there was no power no threat he had no sight of the future joey went forward to take misters arm and to bring him out his first step was onto matted grass and a thistle stem that broke under his trainer shoe his second was on to a patch of ground that was bare he was looking into misters face his third step was snagged joey felt the restraint and kicked his foot forward to break the snag barnaby kept the mines on a shelf in his prefabricated office in the marshal tito barracks and when he had visitors potential donors to the mine clearance programme he always lifted them down and explained without emotion their mechanisms this is the antipersonnel bounding fragmentation mine which is proven as the most deadly of all those used in the bosnian war it has either a tripwire or a pressureactivated role but it is more usual in the tripwire mode we call it prom as you see ladies and gentlemen it has a bottleshaped body steel and the fuse is in the bottles neck the inside of the bottle has internal grooving which better aids the shrapnel spread fragmentation but this is a clever mine on a trip or pressure its first reaction is to fire a small black powder charge that throws upwards the main charge held by a tether a further twentyfive centimetres thats the bounding factor it carries nine hundred grams of explosive and the main charge detonates not at ankle level to cause maximum damage to upper thighs genitalia and the vital organs of the lower stomach the lethal radius is twentyfive metres the prom has caused more casualties to our personnel than any other mine this evening in your hotel when you order a good little slovenian red look at the bottle the waiter brings and remember the other bottle ive shown you the prom exactly the same size but a killer barnaby put the deactivated mine back on the shelf the faces of his audience as he would have predicted were limp he doubted many would order wine that evening with their dinner a woman visitor paused at the door and looked back at the shelf he asked her if she would like to handle the prom a little shudder crossed her face but she nodded he took it down and passed it to her she held it as though unconvinced that it had been made safe he said quietly because dispassionate factual description worked better with potential donors than melodrama the tether mechanism the jump before scattering the shrapnel is what makes it particularly effective when its on a tripwire it only takes a threekilo pull to fire it if your foot snags the wire youd hardly feel it her fingers trembled as she gave it back to him october dougie gough wrote the name in his notepad dragan kovac he poised his pen and waited for the translation i am a retired sergeant of police and so i am familiar with the style of statement that an esteemed gentleman such as yourself would expect the memory of that day is very clear to me i now know that the older man was called packer and the younger man was cann the man packer had stripped off his clothes he had surrendered the combat between the two was over packer had submitted it was last light cann came with a dog to bring him out of the minefield that he came into the field was the final marker of his victory packer was naked and the dog was near him guarding him and cann set off the mine it was a prom with a tripwire cann went down i had a fine view of it from the porch of my house packer snatched up some of his clothes and ran as if he had a sense of liberty he ran for the river when packer was nearly at the river the dog caught him i went from my house down the track to the riverbank and called the dog i am familiar with police dogs i had with me my longhandled axe it was becoming dark but there was light enough for me to see that the dog was injured by some of the shrapnel the mine had thrown and that the dog had bitten packers arm i took them packer and the dog back to my house the dog guarded him and had my axe and i waited for help to come then he cried out cann did in the field the dog heard it it limped away went back into the field i was left with the prisoner i had the axe but i am an old man i have been retired many years i could not keep the prisoner i was not to blame for his escape the dog went back into the field and from the time it reached cann he did not cry out again you should believe me i could not have kept the prisoner he was retired now had gone early but a telephone call had come to the bungalow on the outskirts of kilchoan the chief investigation officer himself and the request had been made that he should attend the small ceremony as the custom house representative a young diplomat hearn had met him at the airport and had driven him to the valley he had not been able to understand the speeches and he had wandered off it had been his wife who had suggested he should take his walkingboots he had sat on the riverbank and changed from his brogues to his boots then used the highest stones to cross the river he had walked across a ploughed field newly turned but not yet sown and across a grazing field where his advance had scattered goats sheep and two dry cows he had passed the skeletons he did not have to be told where to go the target that drew him forward was a waisthigh cairn of stones it was similar country and he felt comfortable small fields wooded slopes and distant mountains to that which bounded the road approaching his home on the ardnamurchan peninsula he stood quietly by the stones and soaked the place of its images and hed said the same quiet prayer that he spoke in his mind each sunday in the quiet of the chapel at kilchoan when the ceremony was over a drifting procession had followed him to the cairn the diplomat translated the words of the rugged bluff selfserving man who wore an old uniform greatcoat and a policemans cap he knew he must play the part of a sponge to their stories there was an official report which had been drawn up by the embassy half a year earlier but it had carried no sense of soul in its typed pages the retired policeman saluted him and stepped back an old man his cheeks nicked from the shave to mark the importance of the ceremony in the village came forward to take kovacs place and beside him hobbling with him was a german shepherd dog with its left front leg off at the knee he wrote the next name husein bekir farmer i came from my home and i waded over the ford and i thought i would be swept away and then i went up the track past kovacs house the old fool was whining that it was not his fault that the prisoner had escaped from him and i followed the deminers who had been called out we went on a path they had made between their tape and the trees at the far side of my fields they had big lamps with them they worked as fast as they dared to make a corridor across the field when they had gone halfway the light from the lamps showed him i had been told he was called joey a silly name he was on the ground on his side he was alive then they went faster i think they took great risks they found one mine a small one like the mine that has crippled my wife and a tripwire but it had become disconnected from the prom or the pmr and then they stopped why because of the dog the dog was beside joey it guarded him even where i stood in the trees behind the tape i could hear and i have bad hearing the growling of the dog the men were more i l ightened of the dog than of the mines each metre they advanced in their corridor before they stopped the growl of the dog was more threatening they said they would go no further unless the dog was shot and one of them was sent to the village of ljul to find a gun to kill the dog the serbs have many guns they have not changed i have worked with dogs all my life a good dog is as important in my life as my children or my wife i went down the corridor to where the men were with the lamps and their iron sticks i talked to the dog a rifle was brought from ljut but i gave my word that the dog would not hurt the deminers i saved the dog we reached him the dog was beside him and joey had his arm over it he held the coat of the dog it is a good dog it is of little use for work but it is a friend there should be a celebration tonight because of the certificate we should drink brandy until we can no longer stand there will be no celebration we are all honoured sir that you came the farmer shook his hand walked away with the dog and was replaced at the queues front he could not catch the name so he wrote foreman deminer he had lost most of his stomach and one of his arms and his right leg was very seriously injured there had been trauma and a great loss of blood if we had been able to retrieve him quickly within thirty minutes then we might have saved his life but he would still have required the amputation of his leg i think also he may have been blinded but i have not seen any autopsy report he confused me earlier that day i had met him and i had refused to move towards the man who was trapped in the field and had explained all of the dangers and he had listened to everything i had said why did he then go into the field why did he wait until we had all gone and it was dark before he went into the field i cannot say what drove him into the field his life had gone when we reached him we made this pile of stones where he was at the ceremony before he had abandoned it and had headed for the field and the cairn of stones a certification of area cleared had been handed by the deminer foreman to kovac and bekir and the diplomat had murmured in his ear that the certification was good for ten centimetres in depth enough for now the couple presented themselves to him he remembered her from the airport with the kindergarten am i shed asked either she had aged or she did not wear the cosmetic blanket he had last seen employed and four local policemen stood sombrely behind them he jotted the two names pc frank williams south wales constabulary margaret bolton surveillance consultant swc we felt we had to come we were a part of it you see a part of what he did here and we found each other here maggie and me we walked out on him and well carry that to our graves i said to him at the end that we were disgusted at what he was doing i called him arrogant im with the armedresponse vehicles now i do my shift i check my weapons back into the armoury at the end of my duty and i go home but i dont take my work with me i dont talk about winning and losing as he did did he achieve anything did he win do you know mr gough what were his last words to frank when frank ditched him they were give maggie my love if id been here if id stayed if id had to bloody well sit on him id have stopped him walking into the field but i didnt stay im a consultant now i lecture on surveillance practices and develop equipment then i go home to frank and we have a little meal and we dont talk about what happened here but hes with us i see those damn great stupid spectacles and his kids grin whats the worst he didnt want us to stay with him we were just in the way it was personal it was between the two of them im glad it was here in a rather lovely place the man who marched forward had irritation on his face as if not used to standing patiently in a queue he felt he was the bereaved relative at the chapel gate he sensed that this was a mourner who had travelled from sarajevo more because of a slack days diary than a degree of loss the name was rapped at him was he supposed to know it he did not he wrote benjamin curwin sis attached to united nations mission to bosniaherzegovina i hear they booted you out after the fiasco well it was all rather childish wasnt it id have thought an organization like yours would have known how to keep its people on a tighter rein i told him he was quote a fucking nuisance here unquote and interfering i told him to do his investigation someplace else because he was upsetting the cart serifs empire still stands and his reputation is augmented by the rumours that he possesses nato antitank weapons and a communications system we cant decrypt his tentacles still reach into the body politic he still owns the government but its harder for us to track his dealings not all gloom i was in london last week and heard the latest on your old target very far from gloom youre out of the loop now so you wont be up to speed packer reached sarajevo hijacking vehicles en route at gunpoint then holed up there for a couple of days with some un woman before moving on she treated some nasty dog bites on his arm now hes living like a trappist in northern cyprus i would have thought the scrubs or wandsworth would be preferable we monitor him there hes in a villa up a hill between kyrenia and ayios amrovisios courtesy of the turkish cypriots the word is its cost him five million to square them and that awful hood from the mainland fuat selcuk hes a busted flush his wife came out to join him stayed a month then went home shes now with her mother they say his major subjects of conversation when he can find anyone to talk to are the price of tomatoes the quality of the water supply and the frequency of the powercuts i heard hed been ripped off rottenly by his new number cruncher not all gloom hes behind a big fence sirens and electronics and lights must feel quite like gaol dont get me wrong i rather liked your man a prig but he had guts a hand was offered for shaking but he continued writing his notes and didnt take it he had feigned indifference when told of albert packers situation what he had learned since he had left the church was that the highest and thickest wall imaginable separated serving officers from former officers his status had gone with his identity card he had received in exchange for current reports and assessments a carriage clock a decanter set and enough whipround cash to purchase a rideon mower on his last day at the custom house before sherry with the cio and the pub session with sierra quebec golf he had headed the meeting where the crown prosecution service solicitor had pitched cold water on the prospect of a successful prosecution of atkins without the evidence of joey cann deceased the little queue had gone and he put away his pad and capped his pen he turned and laid his hand on the heap of stones the diplomat had stepped back as if understanding his mood the funeral down in the west country had been private the family had requested that the church did not attend and it had not been disputed there would be no plaque carrying sqgs name and his dates in the lobby of the custom house clear defiance of instructions cant have that broke all the rules in the book made a mockery of the m a n u a l brought it lets not muck about down on his own head put up a memorial and we send a message to future generations that we sanction personnel operating outside legality it was a vendetta unacceptable behaviour there would only be the stones in the valley he heard the approach of the car and the diplomat touched his arm a mercedes limousine approached hugging the hammereddown ruts dug by tractor wheels the doors opened a sleek elderly man helped a young woman into a wheelchair and bumped the chair towards the cairn he had not seen them at the village ceremony she held a small posy of flowers he felt a wearying sadness a spit of rain was falling he took out his notepad again and wrote down their names judge zenjil delic jasmina delic we had a choice to make the present or the future we chose to safeguard the future he bought me flowers before we rejected him i showed him the old burial stones in sarajevo on one was written i stood praying to god meaning no evil yet i was struck to death by lightning it is good that they have put stones here where the lightning struck i return his flowers she gave him the posy of alive strident colours he leaned forward and down kissed her cheek then laid the flowers at the foot of the cairn he stared at the heaped stones some had dried earth on them and some were covered with lichen he heard the car drive away over the field he felt a crushing weight of responsibility they had all told him he was not responsible the cio had said it and the team had clamoured it and his wife had sought to persuade him of it but he knew what he had done or had there been in that valley a young mans fulfilment the diplomat coughed then said quietly if youre to catch that flight mr gough he looked around him he saw the fields ploughed and grazed by livestock and a vineyard of new posts and new bright wire and the wooded slopes and the gold of the leaves on a big mulberry tree and the smoke from the villages chimneys and the river and he thought it a perfect place a place of peace he took from his pocket the little knife with which he cleaned the inside of his pipe bowl and opened it and knelt beside the cairn he chose a large stone scratched the words on it and wondered how long they would last against the weather cann do will do the words above the flowers glimmered back at him he turned on his heel
