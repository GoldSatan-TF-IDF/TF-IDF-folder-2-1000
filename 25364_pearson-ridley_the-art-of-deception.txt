ridley pearson the art of deception the ride of a lifetime maryann walker she lay on her side her head ringing her hair damp and sticky she understood that she should feel painone didnt fall onto blacktop from a threestory fire escape without experiencing painand yet she felt nothing she saw the space needle in the distance regretting that she had gone up it only once at the age of seven perhaps that had been the start of her fear of heights images from her childhood played before her eyes like a hurried slide show until she heard a car start and the first trickle of sensation sparked up her broken legs she knew undeniably that this was only the beginning when the floodgates opened when nerve impulses reached their mainline capabilities the pain would prove too great and she would surrender to it for this reason and a desire to glimpse the glimmering black mirror surface of lake union she pushed herself off the pavement with her shaky right arm its elbow finally propping her up she could feel her fathers locked elbows on either side of her smell his boozedup breath although hed been dead in his grave for two years now she shrank from the contact of sweaty skin nauseated by his sour smell and the repetition of his needs and sought sight again of the body of water that had been a kind of bedtime prayer for her she clawed herself high enough to catch a moonlike curve of shoreline just to the left of a bent dumpster pitched toward its missing wheel that loomed over her and made her think of a coffin the two white eyes that winked and quickly narrowed before her were not headlights as she first had believed but taillights meant to keep drivers from striking objects in their rear path stop but her faint voice was not to be heard her head led the way to the pavement this time and she answered the call of the pain below her she saw the waters she had come to think of as her own flat black like wet marble darkness punctuated by pinpricks of light swirled as he carried her away from the humming car to the bridges railing she had no strength to fight no will not even her acrophobia could power her to kick and claw for her life tears brimmed in her eyes blurring any image of him blurring the lights blurring the boundary between the living and the dead in the next few moments she would be both when he threw her over it felt like the act of someone distancing himself from something undesirable like hearing a rat in the garbage bag on the way out to the cans but as she dropped she thought of a ballerinas majestic beauty she saw herself as elegant and refined she found a balance a weightlessness that was surprisingly pleasant and she wondered why she had feared heights all these years this was the ride of a lifetime of mice and spiders daphne matthews negotiated the aisle between cots occupied by among others a spacedout seventeenyearold methadone addict a girl shaking from the dts and a streetworn fifteenyearold seriously pregnant with the continuing spring rains and cool weather like mice and spiders the young women migrated inside as conditions required the basement space held an incongruous odor of mildew and medicine spaghetti and meatballs bare bulbs strung up like lights at a christmas tree sale flickered and dimmed over twentysome teens two resident rns and two volunteers including matthews this was the shelters third home in three years a cavernlike basement space accessed via the second presbyterian church one of the five oldest structures still standing in seattle a thirtyblock fire in had taken all the rest just as the streets would take these girls if the shelter ceased to exist for the past five months matthews had doubled her volunteer time at the shelter less out of a sense of civic duty than the result of a combination of guilt and grief over the loss of a despondent teenage girla regular at the shelterwho had taken her life the girl also pregnant had jumped to her death from the i bridge matthews knew the young woman on the cot before her only as margaretno surnames were used at the shelter she asked if she could join her and the girl acquiesced less than enthusiastically matthews sat down beside her onto the wool blanket leaning her back against the cool brick wall sitting this close matthews could see a curving yellow moon of an old bruise that lingered on the girls left cheekbone an archipelago of knitted scars curving around that same eye no doubt margaret told people they were sports injuries or the result of a fall she was fifteen going on forty we spoke the other night matthews said reminding the girl the methamphetamine booze and pot wreaked havoc on the shortterm memories of these kids not that they listened to the counselors anyway they tolerated such intrusions only to serve the greater purpose of a warm meal a shower free feminine products and a chance to wash their clothes youre the cop the shrink i remember right but here im a counselor and thats all you were going to think about calling your grandparents i wasnt thinking about it you were after five days you have to leave the shelter for at least one night believe me i know the rules i dont like to think of you up there in the weather thats your problem i live up there defiant an attitude but behind the eyes fear matthews rarely lost her temper though she could pretend to when needed she debated her next move in what to her was a chess game that could make or break lives you can call for free it doesnt have to be collect i wouldnt mind getting out of here so much the girl conceded matthews saw an opening and seized it to hell with the regulations she pulled a sharpiean indelible markerfrom her purse grabbed hold of margarets forearm and wrote out her cell phone number in letters the size of the top row of an eye test clothes came and went with these girls notes in pockets came and went forearms were a little more permanent day or night matthews said no questions asked no police you call me and its woman to woman friend to friend margaret eyed her forearm angry a tattoo would have lasted longer day or night matthews repeated and pulled herself off the cot with reluctance can i ask you something the girl asked matthews nodded you think this place is haunted matthews bit back a smile old yes creepy maybe but not haunted havent you felt it it wasnt the first time matthews had heard this maybe a little she confessed like somebody watching theres no such thing as ghosts she said aware she was sounding like a schoolmarm the imagination is powerful we dont want to mislabel it but youve felt it too margaret said matthews nodded stretching the truth it took a long time to establish anything close to trust with one of these kids i heard this place used to be a storeroom or something pirates or smugglers or something like a hundred years ago ive heard it called lots of things a slaughterhouse a jail a house of ill repute she delivered this comically and won the first signs of light in that face smugglers why not matthews hesitated unsure if she should leave it herethe first tendrils of rapport connecting themor drive home her point once more if you do call your grandmother we have funding for transportation no ones kicking you out you understand but i want you safe margaret the baby safe the girl glanced around the room uncomfortable yeah she said well see as matthews reached the surface and her car her police radio crackled and the dispatcher announced a a harbor water emergencya body had been spotted the location was the aurora bridge matthews ran four red lights on the way there the lamoia john lamoia awoke from a twohour afternoon nap he was on night tour for all of march wondering where his next oxycontin would come from then he remembered hed quit the california king contained his feet despite the fact that he liked to sleep with his arm under the pillow and out toward the headboard at an inch over six feet hed been hanging ten off the ends of mattresses for his entire adult life so he thought of the california king as a spoiler a luxury item that once used makes you wonder how you ever lived without it lamoia could get around the bedroom blindfolded as hed built it himself hammer and nail twobyfour and sheetrock as the first element of phase one of his refurbishing the cannery warehouse loft a stones throw from elliott bay he was currently in phase threethe last of a series of storage closets by the guest bedroom at nearly four thousand square feet the loft gave him plenty of space to play with it remained a quirky space with a bachelors sense of independence a cops sense of budget and a mans sense of decor there was no long line forming at the door to shoot it for a magazine spread but for the view alone it was worth the price of admission he rolled over and petted his dog his nagging dry throat reminding him of his former addiction he wondered if it would ever fully go away the treatment that had begun following a broken jaw suffered in the line of duty had matured from medical necessity to medicinal abuse an addiction of legendary proportions lamoia still couldnt understand how he had allowed it to happen and even now three months into rehab he found himself still in the unforgiving grasp of need lamoia felt warm breath glance his neck followed by the wet nose of an australian sheepdog formerly called blue but renamed rehab when lamoia found himself using the dog as a sounding board lamoia wasnt entirely comfortable with the responsibility the dogs existence perpetrated upon his bachelorhood but then again bachelorhood didnt feel so right either since recovery his world had turned upside down lamoia did not run his life as a democracy but as a dictatorship he sat on the throne he chaired the board he dropped the gavel he made the choices and to hell with those who misunderstood him it had always been soor certainly since puberty and his discovery that women of every age shape size and color could not do without him this interest on their part had long since gone to his head sex was an addiction all its own he had lost himself to the sport of winning women for the better part of his adult life only oxycontin and prescription drugs had finally lifted him into another realm where indulging himself in new untested flesh no longer mattered in the end only the pills mattered timerelease pain medication what kind of geniuses were these guys when finally he could neither see nor have any desire to see the benefits of sobriety he had stood his ground defiant in his right to selfdestruct during those long months work had become a tolerated distraction a necessary evil that it was police work might have struck him as ironic had he been capable of conceiving of irony but such conceptions escaped him especially objectivity to the contrary during this period he had been as selfabsorbed as any other time in his thirtyodd years and entirely blinded to it beyond caring a living illusion and entirely without hope six months ago with his lieutenant boldt on leave at the time to assist a capital murder investigation in wenatchee washington lamoia had found himself in charge of the seattle police departments crimes against persons unit it had been like putting a kid in the cockpit of a he had floundered his way through insignificant homicide investigations that might have meant something to him had the oxycontin not dominated his every thought a domestic here a gang bang there could do them in his sleep morale at homicide hit at an alltime low under his stewardship when boldt returned he pasted things back together and identified lamoias addiction at that point things had gone to hell in a handbasket lamoia had wrecked the camaro totaling his only one true love and requiring hospitalization and more painkillers he took a leave of absence and that proved his undoingtoo much free time one november night lou boldt and daphne matthews had performed an interventionconfronting lamoia with his drug problem and offering him a chance to save himself or to face the inevitable consequences the intervention had worked by christmas lamoia was prescriptionfree and enjoying turkey at boldts house by new years day hed been back on the job but a dark cold march evening in rainy seattle could own a bite could drill an ache into formerly broken bones and make it hurt just to walk across the room to the toilet heaven came in all shapes and sizes whether a c a hot seattles best or a clear head with sobriety solid thinking had returned but oddly enough not the overriding need to have every woman who eyed him lamoia wanted something different now more connection less infatuation he wasnt sure what love was but he thought that might be it as a result he stayed away from the badgers at the cop bars the coworkers the waitresses who came on to him avoiding the urge to slip his hand between the jeans and the soft skin and light them up god how he had lived for that power the ability to reduce a grown woman to outright need they still called leaving casual messages on his answering machine the implications and invitations subtle but not misunderstood they wanted him only months ago he had let that want of theirs run his life dictate his arrogance demand his attention and now he had to live with that past and he found it embarrassing when the phone rang he peeked at the callerid dreading to play that rolethe flirtation that came packaged with expectation but the phone number proved familiar to him the fifth floor a case something to get him outside himself he answered the phone it was a jumper a drowning as good a way to start a night tour as any bridge over troubled waters the bridge shook with traffic making her knees dance daphne matthews tucked her raindampened hair behind her right ear in a gesture that was more automatic than necessary because of the headband her hair fell into her face if she let it because of a haircut she didnt like but could do nothing about the result was a black velour headband that put a speed bump just behind her forehead and she feared made her ears stick out the blue emergency strobe lights from patrol cars the amber lights of search and rescue and the blinding white pulses from an ambulance whose services would not be required hurt her eyes to the point of headache this along with the rain and the vibrations coming up her legs gave her a bout of vertigo she reached out to steady herself but stopped at the last moment discovering she had not yet donned the latex gloves required at any crime scene her hand locked instead around a forearm nearly as hard as the steel bridge railing when she realized this arm belonged to king county deputy sheriff nathan prair she let go and stepped back and away its been awhile daphne deputy prair she addressed him like a hostess to an uninvited dinner guest nathan prair had been a client of hersa patient departmental counseling following a shooting shed had to pass prair off to a civilian colleague when hed attached to her professing he loved her it had gotten to the point where thanking him or even speaking to him risked leading him on sending some unintended signal the question was why he was here this bridge was within city limits spd jurisdiction why the involvement of the king county sheriffs office either one of their guys had spotted the bodyshe hoped it wasnt prairor perhaps the lake itself fell into kcso jurisdiction the way politicians drew the maps anything was possible how have you been prair moved to fill the space shed made between them he was in that group of patrolmen that spent a couple of hours a day at the gym though he lacked the jutting jaw and heavy brow that seemed ubiquitous features of the other gi joes in fact prairs overly round face housed narrowset soft brown eyes that left him a confusing mixture of boyishly handsome and meanspirited even with the marine cut matthews had always thought his blond hair was more that of a surfer than the takenoprisoners cop he hoped to portray prairs biggest problem was that he believed women found his looks irresistible it had gotten him into all sorts of trouble it had gotten him dismissed from spd and later moved over to the sheriffs office deputy prair i dont think it appropriate that we have this or any conversation she looked around the bridge for john lamoia who was supposed to be on the scene already prair shook his head smile still in place that was what over a year ago i got a little jiggyit happens tell me thats never happened to you before one of your couch potatoes getting hot for you im glad you found reassignment she said as a concession i hope it works out for you on the job you sound like my grandmother or something this is me daphne its matthews and its lieutenant your charm is lost on me deputy he leaned closer and he lowered his voice into a whisper that cut through the damp air so it was you the titanic hit mystery solved she stepped back as john lamoia called out her name and approached in a stifflegged hurry john lamoia didnt walk he swaggered carrying his entire personality in a confident stride for all to see most of all lamoia existed to be noticed his trademark ostrich cowboy boots easily cost him a months salary and he was not shy to replace them when they scuffed up the thick brown hair cascading in waves and curls proved the envy of every woman on the job the deerskin jacket seemed an anachronism a relic of the flower power generation into which lamoia barely fit having been born too late to be certifiably hip and too early to be a yuppie equally loved by the brass and the patrol personnelnot an easy featas a detective lamoia got away with behavior that would have won others suspension he crossed boundaries and even violated ethics but always with that contrived shiteating grin of his and always in the name of right and good like everyone else she had a bit of a soft spot for him though she would never admit it lamoias timing couldnt have been better shed have to thank him later the shrink and the shrunk lamoia said no love was lost between most detectives on the force and nathan prair a man who by most accounts had tarnished the spd shield i need to borrow her a minute he hooked matthews by the elbow and steered her away out of earshot back down the bridge toward a gathering of patrolmen am i ever glad to see you she said listen you stand too close to garbage you start to smell like it couldnt let that happen to you oh sure truth be known lieutenant he emphasized im surprised to see you here night tour raining and all i was nearby when i heard the call she stretched the facts slightly this wouldnt have anything to do with that other teen jumper and you getting all sideways over your not stopping it whos analyzing whom she asked im just asking youre using an interrogative to make a statement john i just love it when you talk dirty she elbowed him playfully and he chuckled this was not their typical rapport and she found herself enjoying a lamoia moment you can almost see your place from here huh i suppose she was looking down toward the black water where the scuba divers swam beneath the surface with powerful flashlights the beams of which looked gray in the depths the body believed to be a womans had been spotted on the surface less than an hour before but had blown its bloat and sunk during the attempt to recover it some people didnt want to be found sid caught it he said scientific identification divisionthe crime lab caught what she asked lamoia was spared an answer as a semi passed too closelya patrolman shouted at the driver to slow downcausing the hastily erected halogen light stands to shake and nearly fall instead he pointed to where a lab technician worked over what looked like a tiny patch of dried blood on the bridge railing sight of the blood took her abacknot for what it was but for what it implied shed come to the crime scene because of the implication of a jumper the presence of blood indicated foul play howd we find that matthews asked very carefully the woman lab technician answered without looking up she added doesnt mean its hers of course its hers said lamoia well know by morning could be anything matthews said yeah sure all sorts of bleeders choose this section of the bridge for a view it was then matthews saw the drip line some of the droplets had been stepped on and smeared but the line was clear a second technician was busy delineating the area of sidewalk that contained the blood pattern that led from the roadway a more scientific study of the blood splatter would determine both direction and approximate speed of that trail but on first glance it seemed obvious car parked there lamoia said guy hoists her out of the trunk or the backseat carries her to herecarries not dragsbumps her against the rail as he gets a better grip and voila to bed she goes whose lead moi lamoia said try spanish john you dont wear the french very well si he said the hispanic lab tech winced at his lack of accent or maybe she was flirting with him she wasnt the first matthews studied the drip line again a part of her relieved that maybe it wasnt another jumper she knew she couldnt voice such a sentimentothers wouldnt understand excited shouting from below alerted them to the diver that had surfaced and was waving his flashlight toward the nearby dive boat marine unit was stenciled on its side a phone number a website address a new world a king county sheriffs special operations section the marine units involvement helped explained prairs presence they found her lamoia said stating the obvious a quiet descended over the four of them a moment of respect as the shouting spread up onto the bridge two of them were collecting her blood one of them was assigned to figure this all out and attribute it to someone matthews was there to observe but as the pale swollen mass that had once been a woman came to the surface with the three divers she turned and walked away very much aware that nathan prair watched her every step from his huddle with several other kcso officers she crossed her arms a little more tightly happy to be gone from the scene she realized she might leave but she could not and would not leave this case behind this one was hers as much as it was lamoias pretty in pink late afternoon the following day on the heels of several detectivesintraining poring over the two dozen local missing person reports as well as the pages of six threering binders filled cover to cover with sheets of reported runaways suspected headed to the northwest these binders representing only the last two months of flyers sent to spd a phone call was taken by the duty sergeant at public safety yo lamoia answered sergeant its phil at the front desk yeah phil whassup phone call just now come in the individual is one ferrell walker male sounded kind of young claims the description in the paper fits his sister and that for all he knows shes gone missingsomething about some asshole boyfriend who wont return his calls should i kick it upstairs on a memo or what no ill take it give me the fouroneone the duty sergeant read the particulars to lamoia and repeated his recollection of the conversation give me the tod lamoia said wanting the exact time of day the call had been logged all incoming calls to the switchboards main number were recorded digitally lamoia could access and listen to the message himself but his preference was that it lift the message off the master and preserve and protect it so theyd have it available later he caught up with daphne matthews in her seventhfloor office a hundred and fifty square feet of femininity in an otherwise grayish male world it always felt comfortable to him which he supposed was the pointshe did her counseling herechintz curtains on the window landscape artwork on the walls but it was the personal furniture that made such a difference even if it was from home depot as she claimeddark wood and leather instead of the gunmetal gray steel that came courtesy of the taxpayers an electric kettle a wooden variety box of tea and packets of splenda occupied a counter to the right of her desk heres my problem he said without a greeting matthews was packing up for the day filling a narrow black briefcase that looked more like a handbag im done for the day the sarge keeps asking me to rewrite the report on the bridge try english john haha youre really cracking me up here im not writing your report for you and in the meantime he continued i got this guy that says his sisters split the scene and that she matches the description we gave to the paper she looked up the thing is i got to make like shakespeare here for the next couple hours and when you call the number this guy gave the desk it comes up some grouch who says our boy aint coming to the phone while hes on the joband the job turns out to be cleaning fish up at fishermans terminaland seeing as how thats damn near on your way home thats a stretch she said but youll do it i shouldnt im tired and i want a glass of wine but you will he said i swear if i didnt have this damn report to write yeah yeah she complained and ill whitewash your fence while im at it i dont have a fence he said but i do have a couple closets i just built that need a couple coats rain check she said standing at the ready tell me again whom im looking for she left the honda alongside a rusted heap of a pickup truck in a parking lot of cracked and heaving blacktop that oozed a brown mud apparently too toxic to host even the heartiest of weeds dickensian in both appearance and smells the commercial fishing docks of south ballard had changed little in the last century a dozen or more small trawlers battered and destitute in appearance evacuated their catch to cleaning tables with open drain spouts that ran pink with guts and grime emptied back into the canal water where overfed seagulls and shore birds battled noisily for territory their cries piercing and sharp yet apparently unnoticed by all but matthews a few of the men mostly young and scraggly overtly inspected her as she followed directions down the line to the third of the cleaning tables even in jeans and a work shirt she would have felt selfconscious in this setting but dressed in tweed wool pants pleated at the waist and crisp in the crease and a navy blue burberry microfiber rain jacket with leather trim she felt about as comfortable as the silver salmon under the knife ferrell walker looked more seventeen than twenty lamoia had pulled two drivers licenses for her walkers and his sisters one maryann walker twentysix matthews knew from the data that his eyes were listed as green his hair brown his weight and that he wasnt an organ donor he wore a black rubber apron smeared with the snotty entrails of his livelihood the apron attempted to protect a pair of filthy blue jeans and a tattered sweatshirt equally smeared with resident stains he pulled off mismatched thick rubber gloves one black one yellow stuffing them into a torn pocket on the apron that hung down like a giant tongue he rinsed his hands in cold water from a rubber hose that ran constantly above his cutting stand he dried them on a soiled section of torn towel and thankfully did not offer one to shake obliged to display her shield she made sure he saw it walkers face was pinched as if hed been sat on as a baby she couldnt see the green for the dark deep eye sockets behind him on the high wooden workbench where the water ran pink a woodhandled fish knife rested its curving blade like an illfashioned smile walkers adams apple bobbed like a buoy as he answered her first question had he called the police to report his sister as missing he looked at her almost as if he knew hermen did this to her all the time but walkers variation was pretty convincing and disquieting not like maryann to miss work walker said and when that asshole said he hadnt seen her either that didnt sound right so i called you guys you people whatever she asked for and received the sisters pedigree some of which matched what shed learned from the drivers license twentysix blond five foot six smoker worked here at dock five last seenand this was the most troubling to her of allroughly three days earlier those in the know put her in the water over fortyeight hours this timing made maryann walker a likely fit matthews had a polaroid of the womans waterlogged crabeaten face in her pocket but couldnt bring herself to deliver it to this kid mention of that asshole made her think she might have another candidate to id the body youre making reference to a boyfriend she asked wait tell me its not maryann he said tell me this didnt happen whats her boyfriends name lanny neal he still had hope in his voice the description in the paper tell me im wrong about it sounding like maryann matthews looked around for a place to sit but thought better of it she didnt like the smell here the sound of the dead fish slopping wetly down onto the cutting tables she didnt like the sad look in walkers tired eyes or the thought that lamoia had passed this off to her so that shed be the one delivering bad news annas a cleaner too walker said boss is on me that its somehow my fault she hasnt showed so basically im picking up her work putting in a double he hesitated she wouldnt leave me hanging like thisnot without calling or something this body it looks like her unfortunately the body doesnt look like much mr walker too long in the water now you asked this lanny neal about her and his reaction was what exactly and i urge you to recollect what was said not what you felt about what was said she interrupted herself again i take it your sister is living with this individual or involved in a way that suggests he might have knowledge of her whereabouts hes jumping her if thats what youre asking and yeah shes pretty much shacked up since we dont have the boat no more which is on account of neal anyway cause once they started hanging out she bailed on methirty years of our family fishing these waters down the drainand that pretty much finished me off with the fucking bankers thank you very much mr neals reaction to your call lame walker answered dead fish were piling up awaiting him you mind he asked indicating the table she did mind but she told him she didnt and so they stepped up to the cleaning table where walker gloved once again worked the curved blade of that knife in such an automatic and efficient way that it bordered on graceful he tore loose the entrails and tossed them into a white plastic pail take me through the call please you asked to speak with maryann listen lady lieutenant whatever neals a scumsucking piece of shit i know it and he knows i know it he beats her up and she goes back to him and i just dont fucking get that you know and me im looking out for her and she blows me off like im the pond scum not that dirtbag shes hanging with so what im saying is we didnt exactly get into it neal and me he essentially blew me off his exact words were just tell me it isnt her his fingers moved the blade sliced and another fish was processed she waited for his attention he was sadeyed by nature a dog starved for affection her job biased her into such snap appraisals and though loath to admit it she went with first impressions i sincerely hope the jane doe is not your sister the fact remains your cooperation is essential if were to clear maryanns name from our list and that means answering my questions as theyre asked do you understand walkers gaze lifted off the fish he was cutting the look he gave her so penetrating that she averted her eyes we havent identified the body she now wondered whether she had handled this correctly she observed grief on a regular basis and tried to avoid labeling it some screamed some cried some went silent some became violently sick some became violent period neal said she wasnt there that he hadnt seen her and that at this point if he did it would be for the last time matthews scribbled down notes okay she said automatically its not okay he said the guy beats her lady hes awful with her and if hes done anything to her he lifted the fillet knife ill turn him into chum and feed him to the crabs his eyes reminded her of killers shed interviewed grief could do thatmake us do things we never intended its important we all keep cool heads mr walker were still just collecting the facts the evidence there has been no positive ididentificationof the body we found it would be a mistake to make assumptions about mr neals involvement at this point im not making an assumption he said im just telling you how it is it isnt anything until we know who and what weve got he was more kid than adult she thought a lovesick brother with a fishing knife sharp enough to split hairsshe reminded herself to thank lamoia for this one rain fell wetting her pad did she take prescription drugs recreational drugs if she was drinking and drugging lanny got her into it she wrote that down as affirmative booze drugs abusethe father son and holy ghost of domestic disturbances as the rain increased she debated pulling up the hood on the jacket but decided she wanted him to know she could take the weather do you have an address a phone number for mr neal walker recited a wallingford address and matthews wrote it down he went back to the fish this time he hacked the head off with a single blow then the tail then he minced the body entrails and all into pieces and swept it down the drain and the seagulls attacked the surface of the water with a frenzy remember mr walker we have not connected mr neal to any suspicious act this is the first ive heard of mr neal are we clear on this matthews worried where a younger brother might take this hed lost the family boat the family business what had she been thinking implicating neal she hoped she might steer her way back out women disappear mr walker tens of thousands every year some just up and walk away from their families their husbands their boyfriendstheir brothers thats right most show back up a few days a few weeks later id like to think we can pretty much put maryann in that last category he dragged a salmon in front of him with the knifes sharpened tip if it is maryann he said matteroffactly then all the more reason youd better talk to neal annas afraid of heights acrophobic whatever she made note of the phobia on the page of her notepad as it rained harder she again almost pulled up the jackets hood but decided against it once more rain drizzled down both their faces his eyes hardened making him seem much older than his twenty years so what do we do next he asked you tell us if maryann shows back up she passed him a business card that carried the office number and wrote lamoias extension on the back im concerned i may have given you the wrong impression mr walker about this being maryann i apologize for that i dont want you doing something stupidharming mr neal in some way all for nothing people get what they give in this world its no concern of yours sure it is its every concern of mine she added could you give me a phone number residential something other than work i told you after neal got into her head i dont have a phone an address im kind of between places right now okay this is pretty miserable weather this time of year theres ways around it so this is where i reach you she said looking around whats your work schedule right now he ignored the question i asked whats next in terms of if i dont happen to call you if anna doesnt happen to show back up were attempting to identify the body and i should be part of that she heard herself say we could arrange for you to view the body but theres absolutely no requirement for you to do so at this time mr neal could do it if youd prefer walker read meaning into her statement that help you get him watching him look at her something like that im not going to speculate on where the lead detective might take this i am not the lead detective you are as far as im concerned he said matthews wished she could start again he said if neal looks at that body then i want to be there i got any kind of rights like that me being her brother and all none whatsoever she said unsure herself its all up to the lead detective yeah well you tell him i want to be there ill pass it along you do that he said hoisting the next fish on the tip of the knife to its place of evisceration you help me ill help you bowing to buddha lou boldt had an ordinary look that few would expect in a cop fewer would expect the traits that accounted for a homicide clearance rate that shattered every spd record an enduring patience and an empathy with the victim that had gained such legendary proportions that the man made the law enforcement lecture circuit a second source of income his heightened sense of hearing not only kindled a love of bebop jazz but also could discern the most subtle nuance in the voice of a suspect or a witness in the throes of a lie his rise through the ranks had been predictable though far from supercharged he got the job done and seemed to enjoy himself in the process he shunned exposure in the press and yet notoriety proved inescapable the only sergeant to decline consideration for a lieutenants shield five years running he had remained in that position for more than a decade succumbing to promotion only when family finances necessitated he walked with something of an exaggerated stooptypically lost in thought a family man hed come to fatherhood somewhat late in life whenever he attended preschool parent functions he found himself with little to talk about dead bodies murder and assault made him a reluctant conversationalist it was while at one such function that his wife liz had introduced him to susan hebringer hebringer who had last been seen downtown had now been missing for several weeks following on the distant heels of one patricia randolf whod disappeared nearly two months earlier both missing and now presumed dead the case was eating a hole in boldts stomach to go along with other such scarshis medals were empty bottles of maalox liquid discarded like the bodies of victims whose deaths he hoped to solve thankless work but a job he wouldnt trade the susan hebringer case was an exceptionit put a voice to the face a child watching the back door for mommyit put boldt on notice serving up a reminder of the randomness of it all it could have been liz it could have been him and his two children staring at that back door waiting the ghost of susan hebringer a woman hed met only briefly but a friend of his family had come to own him boldts relationship with mama lu on the other hand had begun with an illegal immigrant scam involving shipping containers and it had developed over time into a professional association of sorts in which she acted as an unpaid informer in exchange for later favors boldt understood perfectly well that such relationships were twoway and he believed that his current visit to mama lu signaled traffic flow in the reverse directionshe needed a favor and he was obliged to do his best to deliver tonight he knew only that her inquiry involved a death and that like it or not if he could help he would if not he would do his best to appease her boldt knew from prior visits to the korean grocery that he needed to clear himself with the first of the two samoans a thicknecked squinting structure of a human being dressed in black it felt vaguely humiliating for a twentyoddyear homicide veteran to seek the approval of a bodyguard but boldt came to get the job done not pee on a fire hydrant so he flashed the man his shield playing along and announcedhe did not ask his one concessionthat he was there to see the venerable great lady thick with the smell of pickled ginger and sesame the grocerys interior made him suddenly hungry an elderly korean man with few teeth a chapped grin and expectancy in his arched eyebrows welcomed boldt from behind a deli counter that offered mostly unrecognizable cuts of meat fish and poultry fish heads and chicken feet quickly killed boldts appetite canned goods and sundries reached floor to ceiling enhancing the narrowness of the aislesa claustrophobics nightmare two ceiling fans spun lazily a dusty cobweb trailing from a paddle like a biplane banner at the beach boldt climbed the steep stairs cautious of a trick left knee the sweet pungency of chai overtaking the ginger oddly outoftune chinese string music grated on his musicians ear of all the affronts to the senses this dissonance proved the most difficult to take a buddha of a woman mama lu occupied an ornately inlaid black lacquer chair like a queen on a throne so wide and vast of flesh as to fill out a muumuu like a sleeping bag in a stuff sack her eyes shone like tiny black stones in a balloon of a face accented by generous swipes of rouge implying cheekbones now submerged in an overindulgence at the soup bowl her lips gleamed a sickening fireengine red a color echoed in an application to her blunt fingernails one of which her index finger curled to invite boldt closer mr both she said having never gotten his name right in the several years theyd been associated great lady you like some soup thank you he had learned long ago not to refuse a female attendant of seventeen or eighteen a petite thing with a wasp waist who wore embroidered silk from neck to ankle delivered a small table before him she averted her face avoiding his eyes as he sat mama lu chewed on a string of chinese words and the girl took off in a flash to points unseen the place was a rabbit warren you mentioned a death great lady he tried to push her knowing she might drag this out for over an hour he didnt have an hour neither did susan hebringer mama lu smiled but said nothing in reply there was only the music as they awaited delivery of the steaming bowls also black lacquer a wonton dish with streams of egg swirled in a dark broth the chinese spoon flat on the bottom and wide at the mouth allowed the soup to quickly cool mama lu concealed a burp that she clearly savored greatest detective ever work this city you must need an awfully big favor he said do i exaggerate always my heritage a faceconsuming grin please excuse you are a friend to this city great lady you give much back others should follow your example you humor me i honor you he said you are a dear and noble friend since when you running for office im just trying to stay above water these days soup make you feel better you tell mama lu what troubles you boldt took a spoonful the soup defined depth and character the two women whove gone missing he said feeling no need to fill in the blanksthe whole city knew about hebringer and randolf my wife and i knew one of the women mama lu grimaced and after a long moment nodded boldt ate more and requested a second bowl winning great favor with her if he could have raised a burp she might have adopted him you should write a cookbook sometime he said she said you busy man mr both forgive an old woman her selfishness i am always at your service great lady protocol was not to be dismissed boldt let her have her selfdeprecating moment but waited for her to reveal the true nature of her summons the second bowl of soup proved even tastier than the first you familiar with water main break mr both i might have missed that great lady yesterday night i caught the rain we had a couple of assaults overnight a huge trash spill in the bay i think i missed the water main lucky you not so lucky for second cousin here it camethe reason for his soup her cousin a euphemism for anyone of asian descent for whom the great lady felt morally or physically responsible over the years boldt had learned some of the code not all not by any stretch do you mind if i take notes she gestured for him to do so boldt pulled out the worn notebook taller than it was wide it fit into his hand like a cross to the devout she said billy chen his mother sister to my cousins husband she smiled all an invention on her part work road crew here in city good boy billy chen and how was billy unlucky boldt said billy dead she said im sorry for your loss he said how did it happen and then it registered though too late the sinkhole on third avenue interpreting yesterday night had left him on the wrong date and it took him a moment to back up the calendar to relocate himself the sinkhole raised a red flag only because of its location the only two reliable witnesses in the susan hebringer disappearance had put her lastseen nearby on columbia street once on first avenue and a few minutes later crossing second heading east uphill randolf was believed to have been in this same area at the time of her disappearance shop owners had been questioned bus drivers pamphlets distributedand to date not a single other lead had come then that immense sinkhole and now a dead body he sat up his pulse quicker pen ready billy working broken water main your people say he drown fixing itthat he no good at job medical examiner office mama lu not think so mr both billy chen no good worker want better job done much grief billy brings us all mama lu have no answer turn to good friend for answer where exactly was the body found boldt said do i ask you to do my cooking for me run grocery boldt grinned she intended for him to start from the start this woman didnt run a grocery she ran seattles asian economy who was she kidding he said the medical examiner doc dixon is a close friend he can be trusted hes very good at his job if he says billy chen drowned then im sure thats right i dont know the particulars but if doc dixon you will know particulars yes mr both if not accident you investigate yes as favor to good friend wemy departmentare only authorized to investigate deaths ruled suspicious causes great lady i can certainly look into this accident or whatever it was no problem but unless there is a determination of suspicious causes my hands are tied but you untie as favor to friend i can work after hours maybe take some lost time i just wanted you to understand it may go a little slowly i no understand im very busy right now the family might prefer a private investigator someone who can tackle this fulltime he couldnt believe he was recommending they use a pi he hoped hed worded this carefully enough he didnt want to offend the likes of mama lu not now not ever chen family prefers you mr both she set her spoon down and gently pushed at the small table before her she meant she preferred him as she dabbed her chin with the generous linen napkin the wisp of silk swept through the room and the bowl of soup disappeared a magician at work as close to a direct order as he was going to get the choice was now his let me see what dixie the me has to say about it boldt nudged his table same reaction bowl gone table dry table removed from in front of him you like fortune cookie she said no thank you you no like fortune cookie we make or break our own fortunes i dont need a cookie interfering but taste so good she said crunching down on hers and raining crumbs into folds she smiled thankfully she had her teeth in billy chen boldt said making sure he had the name right chen but he was thinking about both hebringer and randolf having last been seen in the same general area when mama lu said little birdie tell me cherry and third part of old underground city how you know what kill billy until you look the underground extends up there boldt asked adrenaline warming him in the late s seattle had been rebuilt following a colossal fire the reconstruction made in large part because of tidal flooding developed a city on top of a cityenormous retaining walls built around each of twenty city blocks and streets between them built up with soil and rock sometimes as high as thirty feet a good deal of the original city now lay underground hed done the tour onceit was a world unto itself down there antique storefronts stuff wreathed in darkness for more than a century some of it frozen in time some intruded upon by shop owners desperate for storage boldt couldnt have been less interested in billy chen it was all hebringer and randolf for him at that moment a pavedover section of the city left undisturbed for a hundred years the phantom of the opera boldt was thinking maybe so she said but with a twinkle in her eye that told him she knew more who is this little birdie great lady the wide shoulders shrugged boldt suddenly possessed enough energy to jog back to headquarters the underground shed handed him a hell of a lead i can look into this he told her trying to hide his enthusiasm you good man mr both she said reading whatever was on that fortune and finding it extremely amusing her body shook like a mountain of jelly hide and peep nordstrom and the tourist thing had worn melissa dunkins legs down to a pair of aching calves that would be shinsplints by the following morning at pm practically stumbling into her suite in the inn she headed straight for the bath with dinner scheduled for she had no time to waste a few minutes for a liedown in front of cnbc if she hurried melissa used the brass security hookandlatch lock to ensure her privacy against a random minibar inspection or turndown service she started the bathwater and began undressing immediately the water steaming piping hot and making her think for no reason at all of home and her husband and kids whom she missed on reconsideration more honestly she was happy to have the time alone nothing wrong with some selfindulgence once or twice a year her blouse off and hung up she drew the living room sheers across a large window with a panoramic view of puget sound slategreen water densely forested islands and the olympic mountain range served as a backdrop she drew the curtains in the bedroom as well mildly annoyed that they wouldnt close completely but as they faced a darkened construction site a skeleton against the slowly fading evening sky she didnt worry about it she undressed fully off to one side nothing mattered much at this point but that bath she slipped into the complimentary terry cloth robe angled the tv to face the bathroom angled the bathroom doors fulllength mirror and readjusted her efforts twice so that she could see a reversed image of market wrap from the tub turned the volume way up toe in the water heaven she shed the robe slipped into the foaming tub and nearly squealed with delight it felt so damned good a moment later she climbed back out ignored the robe and sneaked into and across the suites living room where she snatched a beer from the minibar she returned to the tub a conquering hero twenty hedonistic minutes later melissa dunkin dried herself off with a towel the size of a rug slipped back into the robe and headed straight for bed do not pass go the covers drawn she shed the robe and lay back into the crisp sheets naked glowing the baths heat slowly seeping out of her flushed skin she zapped the tvs sound and dozed as relaxed as shed been in ages if that dinner hadnt been on her palm pilot shed have let herself sleep until morning she would never have accused herself of womans intuition she left that for the touchyfeelies the birkenstock set who frequented the wholefood stores and took chinese supplements they couldnt pronounce melissa dunkin considered herself pedantic but effective and efficient as a businesswoman adequate as a mother accomplished as a lover she pulled the sheet up over her chest as she cooled luxuriating in the serenity of a selfinduced stupor it was at that moment she saw the mans reflection in the bathroom mirror which at its present angle was trained with a view out the bedroom window he glowed red then suddenly green as a traffic light changed he held something to his face binoculars aimed into her window at her naked until only seconds before oh my god she coiled into a fetal ball stretching for the phone while clinging to the sheet that hid her from him she snagged the handset and ended up dragging the phone by its cord across her oversized pillow she was dreadfully cold all of a sudden her skin coursed with gooseflesh her teeth actually chattering the talking head on the tv looked out at her so calm and collected the collision of fear and dread inside her left her nauseated she wasnt about to call some minimumwage hotel receptionist not melissa dunkin she dialed for an outside line and punched in catch as catch can the ringing phone demanded to be answered but john lamoia hesitated in crimes against persons the telephone was its own kind of crapshoot its own lottery the detective that answered a call automatically accepted whatever case presented itself sometimes a murder worthy of his time but mostly domestics beatings with baseball bats stabbings with kitchen knives gunshot wounds of every varietyit was enough to keep a man like lamoia single enough for him to give it time to let someone else catch this one hed had one bit of good news and he felt reluctant to spoil it with some worthless case that would demand his time a truck driver had read a story about maryann walker and had called in that hed seen a car parked on the bridge right before midnight he hadnt gotten a good look at the driver but lamoia had put a detective on a telephone followup the trucker was currently on a run to boise to try to get a decent description of events when the trucker returned to town they would follow up yet again his office cubicle was personalized with a sports illustrated swimsuit calendar an audaciously pink rabbits foot hanging from a thumbtack a collection of classified newspaper ads each offering a chevy camaro and a life in hell comicstrip frame his home eight to twelve hours a day or night or holiday never mind the razzing he took for the pressed blue jeans the ostrich cowboy boots the deerskin jacket he and only one other capdetective carried a sergeants shield if he didnt want to answer a cold call then he wouldnt finally he picked up the phoneduty overcoming reason lamoia is this a detective am i speaking with a detective id like to report a peeping tom he immediately had her in his mind as white thirties well educated the callerid helped the market inn catered to a certain set a set that could make trouble for a detective he sat up in his chair and grabbed for a pen any homicide detective worth his salt would have paid attention to this call susan hebringer one of the two women missing from downtown had reported a peeper twentyfour hours prior to her going missing an alarm sounded in lamoias brainhed caught a good call sergeant maam crimes against persons its my squad she whispered into the receiver hes right across the street right now i can see him over there lets stay calm okay he checked the clock and wrote down the time pm im assuming youre in the market inn what floor five do you happen to know what direction youre facing no the water do you have a water view lamoia spun around to face the map of the city and the clearance board above it that tracked which cases remained active hebringer and randolf were up there in red marker with boldts name in the lead column theyd both been up there way too long the living room if im facing the water this guys to my right north okay fifth floor and you are currently where in bed alone yes alone indignant afraid clothed or unclothed not clothed no theres a robe on the floor id rather you not move if hes still there he has binoculars i think lamoias pulse pounded at his ears a peeper with binoculars susan hebringer im going to ask you to sit tight im going to take your room number and call you back on my cell phone im maybe five minutes away max ill have patrol cars in the area in less than that the key here is not to give this guy reason to bail if he thinks youve made him hes out of there i want him out of there i understand that ms your name please he wrote down the particulars and practically begged her to remain in bed and to act calm he made the calls on the run for the elevator for a lousy peeper report this would be the biggest show of manpower spd had ever mobilized susan hebringer if he had time hed get a call to boldt if not boldt then matthews top of the lineup he needed the heavy hitters assuming his role as commanding officer lamoia directed dispatch to put out an for the bay tower construction site officers in two patrol cars responded within seconds and were advised to enter the area cloaked with a bol be on lookout issued for an adult male possibly fleeing the area possibly in possession of a pair of binoculars or a telescope another three foot soldiers called in all in the general vicinity and once advised of this fact lamoia used them to bracket the area in case the guy slipped the two teams from the patrol cars with just five minutes to act he felt hed done as much as humanly possible to throw a net around this peeper the phone call to boldts residence put him onto voice mail and he left a cryptic message to return the call he asked dispatch to send boldt a page a call to matthews paid offshe was on her way over he juggled all this while keeping an open channel and something of a running dialogue with melissa dunkin still curled up under a cotton sheet in suite when dunkin reported the peeper gone lamoia dialed up the urgency to his people on the ground ten minutes later fifteen minutes after receiving the call from dunkin a search was on in the construction site with lamoia fearing theyd lost him thirty minutes later that search included fifteen patrolmen the foreman of the construction site and a vice president of the company putting up the building by the time the construction site was crawling with law enforcement lamoia found himself sipping coffee in the company of a visibly shaken melissa dunkin who had eschewed the gojuice in favor of vodka on the rocks from little minibar bottles with tiny aluminum caps dunkin wore a dark wool suit that shed thrown on hastily judging by the wrinkled and incorrectly buttoned blouse matthews arrived in blue jeans and a tshirt looking great introductions were followed by the explanation that the prosecuting attorneys office no longer permitted a male detective to interview a woman without a female officer present the truth it was hardly why matthews was there a patrol officer would have satisfied regs lamoia wanted matthews to look under the hood and she was present to willingly oblige a dotcom in redmond he asked yes but you did tourist stuff around town here today after lunch yes dunkin said shopping mostly matthews asked not only shopping but it included shopping yes the aquarium pioneer square the monorail a busy day lamoia said very matthews asked and did you then at any time sense that you might be being followed or watched not at all not in the least my god you think this guy was following me lamoia recapped you came back to the hotel locked the door to your room pulled the drapesas far as theyd goand undressed for a bath thats correct you were in a state of undress only twice when outside the bathroom he repeated from his notes the beer and in bed after the bath i was in the tub she reminded going on to describe her arrangement of using the doors fulllength mirror to afford her a view of the television this was a new one for lamoia and so he had her show him he placed a hotel towel into the damp tub stepped in and sat down she aimed the door until he could see the bedrooms armoire she asked for him to verify the angle yeah there he said stopping her i got the television but im also looking right out that window at my men over there on the construction site he had a view of me she mumbled he didnt know if her slurred tone was a product of the booze or shock i think he had binoculars he was holding something in his hands lamoia believed with certainty that a perv peeping a naked woman would most certainly be holding something in his hand but he didnt comment instead he asked a camera oh god you think what im going to find myself circulating the internet lamoia doubted there was a lot of demand for pictures of naked middleaged execs even on the internetional house of porncake as he called the web but he bit his tongue let me ask you this ms dunkin and i apologize in advance for the way this may sound but is your business with the redmond dotcom of such a nature that advantage might be gained by influencing you in any way blackmail influence can take many forms its an lbo hostile or favorable i refuse to think lamoia interrupted thankfully you dont have to thats why you brought me in on thisuswe do the thinking for you he offered her his wellpracticed smile we consider everythingevery possible scenarioand then go about eliminating them one by one the more options we eliminate and the more quickly we eliminate them the sooner were on the most probable set of circumstances the sooner were on a suspect and putting that person away for this its as simple as that all parties involved support this buyout she said this has nothing to do with that lamoia was inclined to believe likewise but also didnt want to jump to the conclusion that shed just been peeped by a serial kidnapper responsible for hebringer and randolf he thought about boldt wondering why his lieutenant hadnt returned his call lamoia considered bringing sid techs into the room to determine the likely line of sight that in turn might suggest the exact spot the perv had been standing from the suite he could see his guys scouring the construction site across the street dunkin saw this too and for the first time it occurred to her that the police were working a little hard for a simple peeper report hey she said whats with all the guys over there anyway theyre looking for evidence i understand that but why exactly matthews said hopefully to help identify the person responsible you do this for a peeper a sergeant and a lieutenant an evidence team am i in some kind of trouble here that im not aware of maybe youd better sit down maam lamoia indicated the padded bench at the end of the bed this may take a minute to explain matthews said dunkin kept looking out the window several more officers had arrived to pull yellow tape around an area of the construction site there have been some disappearances lamoia said women matthews added melissa dunkin sank to the edge of the bed and listened in stunned amazement it wasnt long before the hotel bedroom hosted an elaborate setup of tripods measuring sticks and a portable laser meant to recreate the angle from which the perv would have been able to view the room a japaneseamerican sid tech wearing a don henley world tour tshirt called out for lamoia he showed him the setup and explained that the laser would lay a frozen rope out the window across the street to the construction site he switched on the laser allowed it to warm up and then sprayed a fine powder into the room a tiny stream of bright green light hung in the dusty air you do the voodoo very well lamoia said the radio crackled got it a deep voice reported one of the guys across the way had located the beam and was waving back at them as he spoke on the radio lamoia said i want the mirror shot out of the bathtub as well combine them and have that section of the platform over there dusted for prints photographed you name it no problem it is a problem lamoia corrected its just not your problem less than an hour later lamoia matthews and two sid techs stood on the fifth floor of the construction site the laser work had identified a square yard of floor space where the peeper had stood on the edge of that area delineated by crime scene tape a tiny plastic stand held a twoinch yellow plastic triangular tag bearing the numeral that indicated several small piles of geometric mud and dirt presumed to be because of the vague pattern it formed discharge from a shoe or boot sole the construction elevator stopped clanged open and a silhouette of a fairly big man emerged lamoia identified lou boldt by the determined stride of his brisk walk hey sarge lamoia continued to address his lieutenant by his former rank the same rank the same job that lamoia now occupied even in the relative dark of the construction site boldt looked tired and worn lamoia put this off to susan hebringers disappearance some said he was having trouble at home others claimed he was sick but lamoia knew the true source of boldts physical decline whether his colleagues understood it or not good work john boldt said shaking hands with his sergeant as they met he nodded cordially at matthews shoe treads said the evidence guy a little overeager for recognition boldt had a norman schwarzkopf reputation within the department newcomers always sucked up to him lamoia said maybe its nothing more than some hump working his joystick boldt looked to matthews for confirmation he stayed in here a long time he had at least a couple of opportunities for full frontals of her lots of time with her stretched out on the bedalso naked if it was masturbatory as johns implying it would have been over much sooner maybe the guys on viagra lamoia said fighting a grin she said another explanation would be that it wasnt masturbatory at allbut a collection phase subsequent to trolling and prior to abduction boldt said completing her thought a possibility is all she said but yes upon learning after the fact that susan hebringer had reported a peeping tom to police just prior to her disappearance caps homicide squad had worked closely with special assaults to chase down each and every reported incident of sexual harassment and voyeurism focusing a great deal of attention on any such reports in the downtown corridor or filed by downtown residents uniformed patrols had been alerted to pay special attention to vacant buildings billboards parking garages and construction sitesall possible viewing platforms for the peeper private security firms directly responsible for these same structures were contacted as well do we have any idea how long he was up here lamoia held his flashlight between his teeth while consulting his notes to make sure he had it right boldt liked it right the first time the vic personally witnessed him out here for twelve minutes digital alarm clock on the bedside he explained couldve easily been a lot longer than that since she was in the tub for over twenty and on the bed snoozing for an undetermined time any fluids or emissions up here matthews asked the sid technician nothing to the naked eye so far we could luminol and the like if you want under black light when reacting with the chemical agent luminol human blood glowed green other tests existed for bodily fluids of socalled secretorspeople whose blood contained a set of specific blood proteins lamoia answered we want boldt added please any tricks youve got to detect saliva or semen and if we come up with anything id like it dnaed and run against the state and the feds databases whether you get a hit or not i want everything kept on file and full written reports got it along with every girder up here i want you to dust for prints on the stairway railing at every landing both sides of the turn he answered the technicians curious expression its where people take hold just do it he signaled lamoia and matthews to step away and the three shared a moment of privacy anything boldt asked lamoia looked across to dunkins hotel room the japanese tech was waving at him lamoia felt stupid waving back but he did so these lab guys would never be cops shed done tourist stuff lamoia answered some shopping anything specific in the shopping lingerie swimsuit anything that would have had her outside of a changing room partially clothed or at least wearing less than her street clothes i shouldve asked that lamoia was ashamed to admit boldt had been a paper shuffler for a couple years now yet still had better instincts than any two street detectives combined was it random boldt asked the milliondollar question your gut check boldt requested matthews shook her head no lamoia said not random deliberate but i got serious problems with that even if he trolls the tourist spots even if he follows em to their hotels or their condos how the flock does he know what room shes in unless its the other way around boldt suggested theyd worked these angles raw back at the public safety building for the sake of hearing it aloud lamoia said he spots em from up herewhereverthen waits for them to leave the hotel and knowing what they look like he stalks them for whatever reason at least twice he grabbed them matthews said timing and locationthose are your reasons nothing more complicated than that which opens up the possibilitydepending on why he took offthat our ms dunkin just made his list lamoia told boldt she leaves town tomorrow taxi straight to the airport he wont be following her lucky for her too bad for us boldt said we could still bait him lamoia suggested install some babe on one of our squads to strip in front of windows matthews said i wonder whod be volunteering to oversee that operation lamoia mugged at her boldt was not happy the problem is its not a specific hotel a single building hebringer and randolf both lived here ten blocks apart you cant bait every town house every hotel theyd been around this track enough times back in the situation room weeks even months of it now boldt was in rough shape under fire from the press the brass the families of the missing women and even his own wife so maybe hebringer getting peeped was nothing but shitty coincidence lamoia said referring to what they knew about the missing woman drawing a look from us when it doesnt deserve it maybe its got us by a nose ring when its nothing but a black hole maybe i walked into that tonight maybe not john matthews said we dont ignore this she told boldt his sticking aroundthat counts for something keep it up boldt told them pointing to the cordonedoff area he said make him talk to us would you please he added with a snarl a confession would be nice room with a view doc dixon a big bear of a man with hooded eyes and a wide face signaled matthews and won her attention before pointing toward his receptionist who manned a sliding glass window looking out onto the medical examiners waiting room his sign meant langford lanny neal the possible boyfriend of their jane doe had just arrived and was being kept waiting matthews acknowledged checked the wall clock and debated calling lamoia one more time resigning herself to the fact that a phone call wouldnt help the traffic situation nothing would help seattles traffic not even an act of god feeling obliged to do so shed left a message at the fish dock where shed met with ferrell walker providing the time and location of the identification at the medical examiners office hoping the message might not reach the griefstricken brother in time but one eye continually tracked to the reception window wondering if walker might appear matthews had never liked the medical examiners office and avoided it whenever possible dixon ran the mes more as a doctor than a bureaucrat displaying a keen interest in each and every body that passed through his doors and the legal system that claimed control of them in death matthews didnt have the same kinship or friendship with dixon that boldt shared but through boldt she had acquired a profound respect for the man where most of the homicide detectives had developed at least an uneasy comfort at the mes matthews a rare visitor found the basement setting the medicinal smell and the overpowering silence repulsive perhaps her feelings stemmed from the doctoroffice look of the place tube lighting gray carpet white lateral filing cabinets the efficient young men and women spanning seattles ethnic palate all dressed in white lab coats some carrying clipboards some answering phones it felt too normal one expected something more dismal and finalsweating rock walls and bars on the window a doctor with a speech impediment a nurse with a limp this felt more like her obgyns office this setting didnt work for her at all lamoia entered his sergeants shield clipped to the pocket of the deerskin jacket he winked at the receptionist an african american woman who had to be in her sixties lowfived one of the young docs who made a point of catching up to him and took matthews around the waist steering her toward the double swinging doors that led into the meat lockerthe primary receiving room that housed twentyone refrigerated drawers and sported three stainlesssteel autopsy tables with drains lights and video cameras there was at least one other autopsy room that she knew ofmore of a private surgery suite where dixon or his chief assistant occasionally tackled a sensitive or particularly gruesome case she abruptly put on the brakes not allowing lamoia to escort her through those doors before it was necessary and her effort had the unintended effect of turning lamoia toward her and briefly making contact with her they bounced off each other gently and for a moment there was only that contact lingering in the nerve endings of her skin that our guy out there lamoia stepped back from her keeping it business yes langford neal she said giving her jacket a small straightening tug boyfriend or former boyfriend if its maryann walker in there and the doc thinks it is the doc got hold of a better drivers license photo than i did one of her eyes the left i think is still where it belongs and its apparently a match for color blue heights about right weight could be right discounting for saturation and bloat ive got a call in to the brother to try to locate dental records for her lamoia glanced in the direction of the reception area let me tell you something about our little angel neal two convictions as well as a number of complaints from previous love interests this guy plays rough he served thirty days in county for one of the convictions the second he was in for six months out in four the news moved neal up the list in both their minds she understood the added spring to lamoias step nowhe loved having the jump on information that certainly helps she said but we shouldnt lose sight of the brother either tentoone she was killed in or near the boyfriends pad given the underwear the bare feet and the rest of it the brother could have harbored jealousy and anger over his being deserted for neal thats powerful stuff neal has two convictions for knocking women around you kidding me not losing sight of the brother thats okay but we focus on neal if he does in fact id the body as her then from what you were saying your take is to run him straight up to the bull pen and have a go at him is that right that or use a conference room here youre thinking that this viewing may put him offbalanceher being so ripe and alland that we pounce while we have the opportunity youre a lot smarter than you look he took it in stride lamoia had his timing down to an art form he kept it businessfor the time being this put her on edge her defenses at the ready you want to sit this one out im okay with that youre way too sweet for a floater especially one thats been in the meat locker for a few extra days she knew she could handle it shed seen plenty of dead bodies some in dreadful condition but it didnt mean she wanted to ill take that as a compliment i think you think too much he said meeting her eyes to drive home his point lamoia had large brown eyes and knew how to use them to effect meaning you gotta teach yourself to feel matthews he leaned against one of the two swinging doors he wasnt going to make her follow inside youre all engine its the handling that counts everything came down to cars for lamoia you get that down youll be just about perfect who said i wanted to be perfect but he didnt answer her he left her there to think about it the door flapped shut behind him timing was everything decades earlier in municipalities across the country medical examiner and coroner offices had learned to separate the individual making an identification from the room containing the body as the smell tended to cause fainting and vomiting some used video some a windowmost used both as did the king county medical examiners office where a color tv was mounted to the left of a narrow window that housed a venetian blind controllable from the inside lanny neal was handsome in a ski bum kind of way cocksure of himself judging by the rigid shoulders the smug expression and his willingness to blatantly check out matthews leveling his gaze and drinking her in head to foot she knew she should wait to question him but hed fired the first salvo with that rude survey of her topography and she fell victim to the challenge when did you last see maryann she asked the question didnt rattle neal in the leastalthough lamoia looked a little uncomfortable neal remained calm and collected as if he were there applying for a job this further irritated matthews couple nights ago how many nights ago saturday i guess you guess or you know matthews pressed saturday night late you werent worried about her pissed was more like it you didnt report her missing whys that why should i she blew me off her tough luck maryann was gone on to the next matthews knew the attitude she asked him about the last time hed seen maryann where they were at the time what maryann had been wearing her mood lamoia interrupted i think theyre ready for us a plain white sheet on a stainlesssteel gurney filled the video screen lamoia knocked on the glass and the blinds came up like a curtain being raised a hand appeared on both the video and through the glass drawing back the sheet and revealing the remains of a womans head at once both pathetic and terrifying the lips were grotesquely distended as if pumped full of air an eyelid had been stitched shut apparently to spare neal the sight of an empty socket matthews heard herself catch her breath lamoia remained intractable neal stared at her for a long time exhaled slowly shook his head slightly and looked away with glassy eyes it was not the reaction she would have expected of a murderershe and lamoia met eyes and she knew he felt much the sameleaving her to wonder just how good an actor lanny neal might be this in turn prepared her for the q ampa she was already planning in her head yeah neal said still looking away from the window maryann walker lamoia asked neal looked a little green his skin carrying a light sheen that hadnt been there moments before you got a mens room around here lamoia directed him down the hall meeting eyes once more with matthews and communicating his own surprise at neals reaction the commotion came from the front of the office where the receptionist stood out of her chair too late to prevent the entrance of a man wearing a torn sweatshirt and filthy blue jeans it took matthews a moment to identify the late arrival as ferrell walker walker paused in the middle of the medical examiners central office looking lost yet determined matthews immediately picked up on the kids frenetic energy it jumped around the room like sparking electricity he held the attention of everyone in the office as heads lifted and a silence of apprehension descended these people had no idea he was a grieving brother this was the wild man on the subway the lunatic in the hotel lobby of the employees in the room only the receptionist made any attempt to intervene and she reconsidered after taking a few steps toward the kid lanny neal didnt yet see him matthews left the small hallway that offered the viewing window and moved across the central room toward walker who avoided her by closing in on neal the fingers of his right hand danced like a gunslingers dont matthews shouted but her reprimand had the unintended effect of stopping not walker but neal allowing walker to close the distance even faster matthews knew without knowing what walker had in mind knew without knowing that for a few precious seconds walker remained impressionable knew without knowing that she was going to have to talk walker down walker now to her left lunged with reptilian speed pinning neal who was a good deal larger than him down the small hallway lamoia drew his weapon instinctively but matthews waved lamoia off as the curved blade of walkers fillet knife flashed through the air and came to rest against neals throat the question you have to ask yourself matthews began addressing walker as if shed rehearsed for the role is not whether you believe mr neal harmed your sister or whether you think yourself capable of doing harm to him its not even about the prison time you will serveyoull get a life sentence for something like this ferrell meaning mr neal will have destroyed both you and maryannthe question is what maryann would say to you were she here at this moment whether or not she would approve of you destroying your own life in an effort to save hers a life already beyond saving she inched closer now fifteen feet away she won his attention though with no immediate results the blade remained against neals throat she said mr neal identified maryann just now shes here and you can see her for yourself if you want she pounced on what she believed would be his greatest desireto see his sister againnever taking her eyes off walker as she pointed toward the hallway where lamoia waited she had to steer him back into his grief and away from anger and blame do you want to see maryann again ferrell that would be nice wouldnt it believe meyou keep up like this youll never see her again youll be in prison when it comes time to bury her and your actions here right now will have delayed any possible prosecution of mr neal for whatever role he may or may not have had in your sisters death lanny neal strained through clenched teeth this is bullshit walkers eyes danced matthews moved yet another step closer twelve feet now youre lying to yourself ferrell if you think youre doing maryann a favor you think murdering a man in cold blood is going to help her how do you think its going to help your situation in any way youre making a lot of trouble here she nodded at lamoia she wanted walkers attention divided john is this going to save you trouble me im looking at writing up reports for the next week if this guy makes the wrong choice not doing me any favors no matthews agreed she extended her open hand toward walker once you pass me that knife this incident is closed do you hear me ferrell closed theres only mr neals word against your own the sergeant and i the people in this office no one saw anything a grieving brother got a little out of control big deal lamoia said wheres the foul he did this to her walker said his voice raw bullshit i did neal groaned we dont know what happened matthews said thats still being determined if youre right then youre right but its a risky assumption on your part and what if youre wrong ferrell what then what if you kill an innocent man here today wheres that leave you maryanns killer at large and you in jail behind bars where you cant do anything to help us we need your help here ferrell youre her only surviving kinthats hugely important to our investigation walker tensed instead of handing over the knife a mans thunderous voice boomed from the far side of the room put down the knife young man doc dixon sounding like god himself behind matthews and to her right walker glanced over in that direction increasing the pressure on neals throat as he did so dixon said you dont use a knife as a weapon in the basement of a hospital it sounded so convincing there are a few hundred trained doctors in the floors immediately above us emergency rooms surgical suites im a doctor several of my assistants in this room are also doctors were not going to let him die no matter what you try were going to save him the moment you try anything sergeant lamoia over there will either put a bullet in you or break every bone in your body and another thing to think about no one here is going to be in any great hurry to help you believe you me lamoia was maybe ten feet behind her now this is one way do not enter matthews said theres a legal process thats meant to handle this its a process that works ferrell knives dont work trust me knives are messy dixon said you mess up my carpet and im going to personally beat the spit out of you dixon moved for the first time growing ever larger in her peripheral vision cobralike as he approached matthews had somehow overlooked dixons formidable presence all these years suddenly she understood much more clearly the attraction between dixon and boldtbirds of a feather walkers pale eyes flipped between dixon and matthews stop right there he warned matthews took a step and said hand me the knife and it stops thats the only way it stops put maryann in this room ferrell take the rest of us out of here its only you mr neal and maryann put maryann right here where im standingyou can do that i know you canand then ask yourself what shed say how would she react to your threatening mr neal this way what would she tell you to do she took yet another step toward him six feet dont listen to me dont listen to doc dixon you just listen to her to maryann walker stared at her she said drop the knife ferrell to her amazement walker dropped the knife lamoia rushed him tackled him and had him on the floor dixon assisting lanny neal leaned over him you worthless piece of shit matthews retrieved the knife from the carpet it was heavier sturdier than she had imagined lamoia cuffed walker out of routine but then wondered aloud if they should book him and matthews put it onto neal to make the decision to press charges or not a griefstricken brother facing a possible viewing of his murdered sisters body how tough would the legal system be on walker murdered neal said repeating her well at least youre listening mr neal thats a good place to start the debt where is he ferrell walker asked he occupied one of the two guest chairs in doc dixons spacious office matthews patrolled the area behind dixons desk where at head level the rooms only window looked out at ankleheight to the sidewalk above you need to convince me mr walker that were making the right decision concerning your release the other guys got him right the guy who tackled me youre not helping your case any if i was going to do anything to that piece of shit it would already be done okay you think im going to have a chance like that again he tracked her constantly as she paced his deep eye sockets fixed onto her every movement you saved me i didnt save anyone i intervened and on mr neals behalf not yours do not twist this around to your liking if we release you we need some reassurance that youre capable of controlling your emotions your anger i lost my head he grinned at her cool and collected like so many of the street kids they dealt with is that what im supposed to say there is no supposed to she lied in fact that or something close to it was what he was supposed to say but she didnt appreciate the irreverent tone and its not what you say but what you do that matters to us okay i get it now if you let me go then i owe you walker said youre saying i owe you something like a snitch that kind of thing right listen no problem thats not at all what im saying i get it its okay i want to help you nail lanny its not okay you do not owe me you owe it to maryann to let us do our jobs you owe lanny neal the right for us to bring evidence against him or not he is not guilty simply because he was her boyfr he hit her did things to her and well look into all that but in point of fact mr walker a homicide investigation typically looks at the immediate family first relationship partners second and close friends last you are the immediate family the one we should be looking at first not mr neal so look at me he said opening his arms to her did you kill your sister mr walker for matthews it was a question that begged to be asked she studied his body language carefully he stared at her dumbfounded cocked his head and said who are you people he beat her he said hed do this and now hes done it he displayed none of the reactions she might have expected from a guilty partya pregnant pause rapid eye movement or breaking eye contact adjusting himself in the chair even so the idea would not leave her entirely and lingered in the back of her mind neal had the more likely motive neal the opportunity and if what they knew about neal was true he had the sordid history as well walkers rage his vengeance was so prevalent that it filled the room assigning guilt was an easy jump for her he said from what im hearing i owe you a favor for helping me out stopping me like that im good with that i didnt want him seeing anna before i did i was upset okay i cant thank you enough for what you did it cant happen again she said i realize that im sorry the student cowering to the teacher the little boy who knows better she cautioned him we will instruct mr neal to file a restraining order against you itll be his choice to do that or not that doesnt bring charges against you but it serves to put you on notice it draws a line in the sand that youd better not cross anna and i we repay our debts he said there is no debt are you hearing anything im saying ill be a good boy dont push me mr walker lanny neal is the one who needs restraining you see to that lieutenant matthews and youll have no problem from me its not how it works she said youre damned close to threatening a police officer she was murdered you said so yourself you have her killer in custody so do something about it you need help ill help you helped me out i wont forget that youd better forget it that is not the point shed lost her patience and her composure walker seemed to take this as a victory he broke her legs didnt he matthews felt a stab of surprise in her chest you see i can help you if youll let me he said hed do that said hed break both her legs if she ever tried to leave him he watched her reaction confirmation and his eyes welled with tears he broke her legs didnt he oh god poor anna im not at liberty to discuss the particulars he sat back look at it this way i didnt want your help either just now i didnt want you getting in my face in my head like that but you did and it worked out for the better right see all im saying is sometimes we get help when we dont see it coming its a good thing i can help you like that were done here she announced well want to speak with you again and when we do well find you at your workplace unless i find you first he said childishly meeting eyes with her and straining to communicate something more she winced go back to work go back to your life if anything comes up regarding the investigation ill make sure youre informed you see another favor thats standard procedure mr walker that is not a favor none of my actions should be construed as personal favors any such misinterpretation save it he said rising quickly to close the gap between them she could smell the overpowering fish odors and his sour perspiration she nearly retched the only question i have is whether or not you give me back my fish knife matthews glanced down at dixons desk where the gunsmoke gray blade rested by dixons pen stand that knife has history walker said family history it felt wrong returning that knife to him but it felt equally wrong to confiscate the one item that was probably all he had left of his family against my better judgment she said holding it by the blade and offering the knife back i wont forget this he said she closed her eyes as he left the office torn between reversing her decision and watching him go but then he was gone the decision made for her crossing the mes to a conference room where lamoia held neal she put away her thoughts of ferrell walker as she swung open the door that led out of the offices and into the small reception area littered with magazines matthews caught sight of a brown sheriffs uniform the medical examiners office was a county not city department meaning kcso had as much or more business here than spd nonetheless she knew in advance knew instinctively who this uniform belonged to the wide shoulders turned the blond head swiveled and just before the door shut she caught a glimpse of the profile of deputy sheriff nathan prair what business did nathan prair have here was it maryann walker or was it daphne matthews she turned around quickly hoping he hadnt seen her she hurried toward the conference room a part of her wanting escape she knocked once turned the handle and stepped inside her heart beating a little too quickly why dont you walk us through the events of the night maryann went missing lamoia said neals erratic eye movement constant swallowing to fight dry mouth and perspiring upper lip warned matthews to pay strict attention to the lies she felt were certain to follow here was more what shed been expecting of walker when shed put the question to him by prior agreement shed let lamoia kick things off at an appropriate time yet to be determined she would take over and he would be the one to stay quiet if they sensed they had a live suspect they would finish up by doubleteaming neal at which point matthews would play the hardass and lamoia the more patient reasonable cop turning stereotypes on end and hoping to keep neal guessing wed been at my moms the two of us wed had a couple drinks dinner at my moms my mom likes rum wed had a few rums i guess lamoia clarified this is you maryann walker and your mother right state your mothers name please frances frances kelly neal you had dinner the three of you which night was that saturday lamoia took a moment to make a point of counting backward his favorite line of offense was to play the fool to begin with slowly migrating to the hardline cop any suspect learned to fear march twentysecond neal said we come home after dinner to my hang you know and went to bed i watched the sports while she you know she was busy busy how you know im afraid not busy he pumped his cupped hand up and down beneath the sheets ms walker was performing oral sex on you while you watched the sports news neal grinned proudly but he couldnt keep his eyes still thats it lies she thought as lamoia caught her attention and rolled his eyes what time would that have been lamoia asked after dinner like i said that would be the local news q that would be fox that would be correct he mimicked lamoia and the sergeant impressed matthews with his ability to remain calm and not rise to the bait neal liked to hear himself talk that played in their favor she wanted some of that action for herselfif you know what im sayingand i wasnt exactly complaining but lamoia interrupted well skip the playbyplay if you dont mind you did or did not have intercourse with maryann walker on saturday march twentysecond thats a did for sure matthews asked using a condom or without that would be without neal gave her a tennis pro smile lamoia said following the intercourse you watched more television or read or went to sleep or what slept at least i did maryann might have gone out the window you want to explain that for a smoke neal clarified cant stand that shit she used the fire escape used it all the time i saw her out there on the fire escape it was later a lot later probably for a smoke right i saw her out there yeah i just said i did confusion fanned the edges of his eyes approximately what time was this later can you be more precise neal glanced first to matthews then to lamoia as if hoping one of them might help him out he pinched his temples between the fingers of his right hand and apparently appealed for divine intervention she was beginning to put more faith in walkers suspicions lanny neal was a selfcentered egotist who had a record of abusing his girlfriends he didnt lie very well despite what must have been a great deal of practice i remember her out there seeing her out there i didnt like it when she went out there dressed like that she never seemed to give a shit what she was wearing claimed no one could see her so high up and all and thats another thingshe dont even like heights but for a smoke shit shed climb the space needle anyway shed go out there in like a tshirt and underwear showing skin and all she was talking he continued at first i wondered who the fuck was out there with her then i saw the cordless phone was missing she was out there on the fire escape on the goddamn phone with someone maybe it was the phone ringing that woke me up in the first place and i do remember what time it was this seemed to dawn upon him and matthews thought he was making it up as he went all twos flashing at me two twentytwo the clock by the phone on her side of the bed i remember that two two two flashing away and i looked out the window and there she was on the goddamn phone two twentytwo am you ought to be talking to that brother of hers always begging her for money bugging her punkass kid blaming her for everything bad happening to him probably him on the phone probably him who did this to her what exactly do you think happened to maryann lamoia asked how should i know all disgusting like that the way she was looked like she drowned or something is that right what exactly was maryann wearing at the time out on your fire escape i just told you next to nothing a description of that clothing could prove useful to the investigation well she sure as shit wasnt going to go out there bareass again you understand not after the last time id caught her again he stopped himself lamoia met eyes with matthews communicating that they had their first real look at langford neals inner workings interrogators lived for such moments lamoia supplied youd smack her around let her know who was boss i didnt say that did you smack her around that night lanny hit her upside the head or knock her off the fire escape or what she was bleeding wasnt she she was bleeding and you didnt know what to do thats bullshit i seen her out there and i went back to sleep end of story she woulda had on butt floss white butt floss she always wore the same thing matthews said thong panties and what about on top a tshirt a blouse a robe one of those camelthings a camisole two humps right where they belong nice and tight matthews cringed at his reckless confidence a camisole and thong underwear no sweatshirt no robe shes hotblooded im telling you went out there all the time in next to nothing for a smoke a sweatshirthow the hell should i know does she own one yes but that night it was a freak show anyway warm for a change you can check that right lamoia said well check all of your statement lanny every last word he looked briefly bewildered but then regained his confidence and restated that the last time hed seen her shed been out on the fire escape woke the next morning and she wasnt there not that that was all that unusual she went to sleep later than me and got up earlier probably headed straight for a coffee hit a seattles best down a few blocks you should check with them right they open at six and shes always one of the first through the door so her clothes were gone lamoia stated in the morning im talking aboutwhen you woke up whatever else shed been wearingthose clothes were gone what clothes how the fuck would i know clearly flustered neal shook his arms in front of himself as if his hands had gone to sleep she wore them to bed thats all im saying lamoia reviewed his notes a moment ago you said you fell asleep after having sex with ms walker that you fell asleep after the sex now youre saying she wore panties to bed can you be more precise she wore them to bed before i took them off her he added and that would have been after the sports after the hummer to be more precise and what clothes if any did she leave behind at your apartment that morning shes the one picks up not me lamoia said irritably so youre saying she cleaned house that morning before she left for the coffee listen she had clothes at my place okay how the fuck do i know what was there and what wasnt she lived there with me dont forget right clothes what on the floor or something how the hell would i know matthews thought the story was getting away from him the little pauses the rapid eye movement she excused herself and left the conference room returning a few minutes later with autopsy photographs of two different women she wasnt hoping to win a confession to cause some perry mason moment in which langford neal hung his head weeping and detailed the events of that night she did however intend to run neal through a litmus test if she came away with anything she hoped to at least identify his lies and to make sense of his motivations for telling them making a legal case was not her responsibility all that she wanted was the truth until the attorneys were invited inneal had yet to request oneshe could basically say anything she wanted could match him lie for lie she knew how to use her looks against guys like neal just before reentering the conference room she tucked in her blouse and squared her shoulders emphasizing her chest let him look all he wanted to let him be distracted she placed the photos in front of neal lamoia knew theyd made the handoffneal now belonged to her she said we had a similar fatality last year also a young attractive woman were investigating possible connections the connections being bridges and water neal said andor the men these women dated youre looking at me for some head case that jumped off a bridge a year ago no were looking at you for maryann walker mr neal she made a stage show of looking over at lamoia who said anything about maryann jumping not me lamoia answered nor did i matthews said try the papers the television neal protested matthews said maryann walker did not jump mr neal but you just said she was beaten badly possibly raped and subsequently was discovered in water wearing a torn thong underwear and a cotton camisole topjust exactly as youve now described for us how she arrived into that water remains under investigation neal lost the shiteating grin youre clearly a smart man she lied a man who understands women you dont have to tell me that some women get themselves into difficult spots make promises and change their minds get a little too drunk and ask for it and then beg off the sex with the old headache excuse they cocktease a guy and then refuse to put out lamoia did a double take on matthews neal looked uncertain right matthews said yeah sure id buy that and sometimes a guys got to tune her up a little let her know whos boss sober her up theres a way this works and theres a way this doesnt work and it doesnt work when shes in some drunken willing mood one minute and then an ice maiden the next neal saw the trap then i ah i dont know what youre talking about no no weve got a half dozen prior complaints against you lanny all of them are for taking a heavy hand with your girlfriends you logged a thirtyday stint at county you put a girl named eileen rimbauer in the emergency room with a broken collarbone are you aware that maryann walker had five such emergency room visits in the last six months did she happen to tell you about those her brother knows ill tell you that she claimed to have fallen down the stairs of the boat said her hand got caught in a winch she read all this as if it were printed on the page which it was not pretty lame excuses you ask me she also had some woman problems that make a lot more sense if some guy is playing it a little kinky and rough so what you need to look at mr neal is not the door not my chest not the detective as you have been but what happened that night you need to look at the underlying circumstances that started whatever argument resulted between you the conditions that escalated that particular argument into violence were cops yes but believe it or not were human weve heard it alltheres nothing you can tell us that will surprise us this being your third strike with the batteredwoman law in effect youre facing a serious uphill battle if convicted you want half a chance convince us that you and maryann had a disagreement that night that things got a little out of hand a disagreement takes two people mr neal thats a whole lot better than some guy pounding on his woman for no reason whatsoever can we start there she was out on the fire escape talking on the phone maybe im not sure about that smoking a cigarette cause otherwise no way would she have been out there im telling you she did not like heights not to get away from you we had sex is all maybe i was rough i dont remember i was pretty loaded that night but ill tell you one thing you never heard maryann complaining about the sex believe me she liked it rough she asked for it rough that night out there on the fire escape thats the last i seen of her two twentytwo am matthews repeated the woman hardly slept you understand that where there are mitigating circumstances in a casean argument for instancethe investigating officer is required to take them into consideration these things come out in trial no matter what theres no sense for a detective to push for capital murder if theres a domestic case where the girlfriend was complicitsay acting like a drunken slut one minute and going for a carving knife the next you need to think about that because a guy beats up a woman the sides get drawn long before the jury sits down for the first time believe it neal wore shock in his eyes which matthews took as a small victory am i getting through lanny she asked rhetorically she was all fucked up in the head all bent out of shape over her asshole baby brother said shed let him down losing the fishing boat and everything that she owed him big time but shit he was just working her mooching crying in his beer i wanted her taking care of things around home for us to get something going but im telling you she was all fucked up okay matthews took a deep breath and savored the surprise that hed begun to open up shed been drinking a lot that night got herself all dumb and loopy we had the sex you know just like i said her on top all angry like fast and furious and i dont know meanspirited you know like she didnt want to be doing it matthews didnt like the next images that filled her headsweating through the camisole sticky hair the slapping of flesh sometimes it was like that with her neal said quieter for the first time a little strange like that like she wasnt really there you know tripping out the more i seen of her like that the weirder it was to tell the truth shed get herself off it wasnt about me it was like i wasnt there matthews attempted to wipe those images from her mind but they wouldnt fade she spoke over them was there anything that night in particular that the two of you argued about anything said that maybed come up the other times youd seen her like this im telling you she got the most pissed off when i brought up ferrell and how it was bugging me the way he never left her alone jesus the guy was always showing up at the weirdest times sniveling about money and how shed fucked everything up and she didnt like me talking about him bitching about him shed pretty much taken care of him since their old man bit it her momi dont know nothing about her mom whether she bolted or croaked or what she could be dead too for all i know so you argued about the brother matthews said that night not that i remember im telling you we got back to my place and she went all horny on me shes half undressed and going down on me practically before i got the tube on according to you she was out on your fire escape in her panties and a camisole top maybe a sweatshirt you dont know cant remember im assuming barefoot and now fastforward shes in the water matthews paused there are problems with your story mr neal are you aware of that we started out with you and maryann pretty much in the same miserable condition you watching your sports broadcast while she services you now you say she was oversexed and practically raping you we started out with her getting up in the morning and heading out for coffee but we know for a fact she ended up in the water the night before howd she get there howd she get to the water neal asked as if he was suddenly on their side im telling you i saw her out on the fire escape heard her talking on the phone he appeared less confident now if there was a part of his story to exploit it was maryann out on the fire escape matthews tried again how about this maybe shes still drunk out there on the fire escape maybe youve got the time wrong maybe shes drunk tired a little shaky still from the sex and she smokes a cigarette and goes a little dizzy and goes right off that fire escape oh yeah im with you lamoia said it wasnt like that neal objected shes trying to help you out here lamoia said she goes off the fire escape and she isnt getting up and you mr neal realize with your history this is not going to look right not good at all your halfnaked girlfriend carrying your sperm at the bottom of your fire escape how you gonna explain that one lamoia said but the condition of the bodythat fits going off the fire escape thats good thinking lieutenant it wasnt like that neal repeated but to a jury what youve got to ask yourself is how itll look to a jury cause ive got to tell youits pretty damn convincing to me to me too lamoia chimed in neal wore a full face of sweat now his eyes jumping between his two interrogators matthews leaned into the suspect where he could smell her where he couldnt avoid her but sadly for you the truth always plays better you know what i think i think you hit maryann i think you got angry with her and you struck her and things went badly for you you thought she was passed out like the other times but she never got up sometime that night or the next morning you discovered she was dead youd killed her and now what maybe for whatever reasons it turned you on maybe youre like that maybe you did things to her after she was dead she lowered her voice this was her ground now theres nothing quite like that anger of yours is there it gets away from you that kind of anger it turns back on you doesnt it bites back then comes the moment you dont understand youre riding a rocket while your little sweethearts gone all limp youre all over her with your stuff because thats how the arguments always endright the two of you in the sack clawing at each other and starting out all ugly before the sex starts to heal things only this time it doesnt heal does it this time she isnt coming awake who the fuck are you he asked his eyes dilated im your way out of this mess we arethe sergeant and i you want out of this dont you lanny lamoia dragged his palms across his pants the jangle was in the air like the smell before a thunderstorm she said i want you thinking about the lab tests when that nasty bruising occurred when she broke those bonesbefore or after she died what you didnt think we knew that yet seventeen broken bones lanny what you thought wed think her hitting the water did that and speaking of water what about when the water went into her lungs before or after death youve got to consider the jury and how this could turn out for you because this meeting right here right now this is a good chance for you to help yourself we dont deal in stories we process the facts and let them tell the story and thats the story the jury believes the one and only story the more you bend it around the worse your chances of cutting a deal with us matthews stood up and made a point of smoothing the wrinkles in her shirt as if shed picked up some of his filth by sitting a little too closely lanny neal remained fairly composed maintaining an air of selfimportance that he wore on his face along with the good looks he didnt deserve interrogations were as much about timing as the questions asked she and lamoia exchanged looks and lamoia cut neal loose asking that he stay close to home no travel outside the city without notifying the police impressive lamoia said after neal was gone if a little unorthodox whatd you think of him matthews asked mixed review lamoia said she felt disappointment seep through her she wanted so badly for this to be over to wrap it up and put maryann walker to rest but her review was mixed as wellneal seemed something of a contradiction we wait for the lab results both sids and dixons maybe thatll clear it up for us wishful thinking and they both knew it a drowning is a drowning a fall a fall the signature combination of antibacterials and preservatives never failed to remind boldt of death images of bruised and bloated corpses indelibly stamped in his consciousness from the autopsies he had attended he never lost count this was a place where the soles of feet bore identification codes in black marker where nakedness reigned and was never attractive floortoceiling stainlesssteel refrigerated drawers with sliding trays capable of supporting four hundred pounds and sixfoottwo frames he hoped beyond measure that it was a place susan hebringer would never visit but he had his doubts although state law required investigators to attend autopsies of any death of questionable or suspicious causes it was not any such requirement that brought boldt here that requirement had already been fulfilled by detective chas milner instead it was because it was here at the mes that the dead whispered their last words through their translator doc dixon he of the large head wide eyes and soft smile boldt said i hear things got a little western earlier we all handle grief differently that kid is wound pretty tight daphnes not convinced she should have let him go she cooled him off i think hell be all right its the other guy im worried about boldt said this langford neal dixon nodded yeah i know what you mean none of this was dixies problem boldt and dixon discussed a rerelease of a chet baker compilation on cd boldt describing the mans singing voice as cream and honey dixon leaned toward bakers horn playing being a trumpet fan himself since when are you into vocalists dixon asked liz is trying to convert me to opera sounds like shes trying to cure your insomnia same thing the cadaver in question was that of mama lus cousin billy chen dixon doublechecked the address swung open the square stainlesssteel refrigerator door and slid out the tray containing chen on silent rollers let me ask you this dixon said since when do you show interest in what went down in the books as an accidental drowning its a favor to a friend dixon answered by lowering his head and giving boldt a look over the top of his reading glasses boldt explained hoping dixon would see the connection this guy was found within a block of where hebringer was last seen there was a water main break caused by what boldt asked in other words youre letting hebringer get to you is that from liz or matthews i can understand how a disappearance is harder than a homicide the lack of closure two disappearances even harder susan hebringers husband calls liz about every other day shes stopped telling me about it but i know its continuing their daughter and sarah are in the same ballet class youre a lieutenant what the hell are you doing in the field boldt answered the captain cut me some slack she smelled a task force coming and wanted to avoid that she untied my leash on this one so what it should be your sergeants case not yours youve never taken an autopsy away from one of your assistants boldt asked that seemed to sting dixon but boldt wasnt sorry he enjoyed the freedom of the past weeks and didnt want it ending just yet an exception had been made for him and he wasnt about to challenge it you lose perspective you lose focus isnt that a boldtism there are no boldtisms boldt said there are two missing women and an experienced street worker who drowned in a couple feet of water add to that an area of unexplored underground that part of town thats what im told so that makes things more interesting sure does but tell me chen was an accident and im out of here i wish i could dixon unzipped the body bag to the neck chens face was the color of an athletic sock that gets washed with the wrong load of laundry a faint purplish yellow his lips were circled in a brown blue boldts chest tightened oddly he needed complications he needed unexplainables he needed billy chen to point him somewhere and yet he didnt want it if susan hebringer walked into sarahs ballet class tomorrow billy chen went back into cold storage boldt was feeding off the dead using chens death as a possible steppingstone and the thought of this repulsed him his lips believe me id rather not admit this office made a mistake that word from dixons mouth electrified boldt the source of this mistake my guess is that it resulted from this coming in as an accidental death head trauma suffocation due to immersion of the nostrils and mouth in a liquid there are no pathonomic findings for drowning we put head trauma way up our list chen suffered head trauma ergo the drowning fit we sometimes look for what were told to see it happens someone has a lunch date he goes through the motions and lets his expectations determine his findings we see a fine white froth or foam in the air passage evidence of vomitinga drowning is a drowning a fall a fall his lips boldt repeated wanting dixon to translate the purple bruise that surrounded chens mouth michael one of my best assistants overlooked two items the lividity is inconsistent with the suspected cause of death dixon drew boldts attention to the clowns face of discoloration around the mans mouth then he unzipped the rest of the body bag snapped on a pair of disposable gloves and lifted the corpse at the waist notice the buttocks boldt observed a purplish orangeblack doughnut of discoloration on the dead mans left buttock lividity exactly buttocks and lips boldt asked thats the point one is either sunnyside up or over easy when one dies we cant be both this lividity he said returning boldts attention to the dead mans buttocks probably occurred while he lay waiting to be found not after he was bagged not while he awaited his turn on the slab long before all that boldt remained confused and said so dixon explained a head trauma drowning means that chen took a blunt object to the headan ibeam a slab of cementprobably as a result of the huge volume of water down there hes either dulled or unconscious the lungs fill with water he coughs and vomits at this point hes unconscious for sure the heart stops pumping the blood settles to the lowest spots and coagulates in this case his heels and buttocks he hoisted the cadavers stiff left leg the bottom of the mans heel showed a similar discolored circle boldt prompted him which brings us to the lips the discoloring around the mouth is not lividity but more likely a hematoma asphyxiated his lungs contained only a few ccs of water enough to kill him to be sure but not the lungfuls wed associate with accidental drowning resuscitation the emt report doesnt indicate resuscitation no chen was flatlined when they found him down that hole no vital signs they never got far enough along with him to attempt ventilation the patient was unresponsive to their initial attempts at cpr maybe they left something out of the report boldt said any of the various procedures would have showed up indirectly with inventoried equipment charges were not seeing that on mr chen check if you want to check ill check boldt agreed ask them about oxygen at the same time oxygen michael missed this as well he read the accident report the emt report and he saw what he expected to see what he missed was an elevated oxygen level in mr chens venous blood gases we expect to see levels at right around seventyfive percent mr chens venous oxygen level was eightyeight hes in shape a runner no way supplemental oxygen is the only explanation for levels like that were going around in circles so youre saying it was the emts they did attempt resuscitation no not according to their report they didnt what im telling you is weve got inconclusive evidence to support a clearcut method of death its entirely possible that mr chen was caught from behind dixon said whoever it is hes pretty strong chen struggles winning the hematoma surrounding the lips his assailant manages to drop him chen encounters the blunt object hes unconscious and hes about to drown and dont ask me how but the air around him is spiked with o id check to see if anyone was welding down there oxyacetylene something that might explain it a sloppy emt report explains it we work closely with these people im not going to mudsling help me out here dixie ive got a pair of missing women with that sinkhole raining down around them the emts could have hurried him out of there and then later covered it up when it came report time because they realized the guy died in their care improper care you never know boldt wasnt sure that helped him he had no desire to prosecute a couple emts dixon suggested a fireman would have supplemental oxygen who responded to that cavein a fireman killed chen boldt said in total disbelief i know it doesnt make any sense not unless it was someone who didnt want to be found then why apply the oxygen dixon asked as frustrated as boldt thats what we need to answer we youd better write it up dixie i may have to stick it to those emts the gift lieutenant we got a delivery at the third avenue entrance for you matthews who wasnt expecting anything said just sign for it and send it up would you pete cant do that anymore lieutenant sorry new regs shed read that memo at some point what a pain in the neck well at least sign for it then ill be down to get it guy says he wont leave it for anyone but you then hes going to have to wait hes been waiting lieutenant this is my third call up there shed been in meetings and hadnt checked her messages it seemed possible ask him what it is who its from she heard the inquiry through the receiver then pete said he was going to put the guy on the line hey lieutenant she knew the voice but it took her a moment to identify it mr walker i told you i could help she suffered a chill like a small shudder rippling through her the image that filled her imagination was that of the family dog leaving a dead squirrel on the doorstep we discussed this you had to say those things i understand that i understand the way things work im not sure you do whats in the package mr walker she took a wild guess what would the adoring student bring the teacher some fish fresh fish fish its hers he said sadly proof that sack of shit is lying if he says he didnt do anything to maryann mr walker ferrell its illegal to involve yourself in an active investigation we went over all this another chill swept through her this wasnt the first time a bereaved relative had attached himor herself to a case but shed never personally experienced it instead of celebrating the cooperation she felt boxed in youve got snitches right so im a snitch dont knock it til you check it out if you leave the package for me mr walker ill pick it up later no way i get to see you or i take it with me whats wrong with you you want to get this guy or not you have to leave the package mr walker theres nothing i can do about it they xray them electronically sniff themtheres all sorts of security now that i cant do anything about it takes a couple of hours ill look at it and ill call you no way im waiting what happened to your double shift new arrangements mr walker im waiting like it or not she could hear the phone being passed back to pete lieutenant the gruff voice inquired tell him im on my way down go ahead and start it through security okay pete in fact such security took only a matter of minutes she wondered if it was stupid to show walker shed exaggerated the situation to hell with it shed accept the package get walker out of there and warn him not to try it again a few minutes later she passed the lobby coffee stand and approached the busy security checkpoint at the buildings main entrance on third avenue ferrell walker stood waitingthere were no chairsjust on the other side of the twin metal detectors to the left of the lumbering xray machine he wore the same sweatshirt and blue jeans that shed seen him in earlier the same day she could imagine that smell even at a distance pete a burly patrolman in his early fifties whod worked the front entrance for years indicated a somewhat soggy brown corrugated cardboard box that waited on a folding table the noise generated at the entrance by all the security questioning and the signing in and the beeping of the metal detectors and the grinding of the xray machines conveyor belt created a jagged tension in the air that matthews always felt in the center of her chest as a threat of violence she used the garage entrance on most days appreciating the calmer approach taken there as a result of an officersonly policy but here in the coffeescented foyer with its high ceiling standing under the faint light of overhead fixtures with dull bulbs chosen for their low consumption of energy she felt more like a tourist at the security check of an airport in a foreign country the cardboard box seemed to grow in size and significance she lost sight of walker due to the security installation but could feel him standing over there staring at her bring him through please pete the officer on duty signaled for walker to step through the metal detector but walker refused matthews stepped around to where she could see the kid and said to him you can leave it with him in the plastic tray theyll give it back to you when you leave walker looked skeptical theyll give it back to you she repeated walker removed the long fishing knife from a handsewn leather sheath tucked inside the waist of his pants and hidden by his sweatshirt he seemed impressed that she should have anticipated this he placed it in the dirty plastic tray and pete making a face of open curiosity moved it aside and out of reach walker passed through the metal detector and pete fanned his hand in front of his face making light of the mans fish odors matthews and walker stood in front of the cardboard box and she asked that he open it pete drew closer protective of his lieutenant you open it walker said somewhat childishly but there was a menace to his voice as well its policy that as long as youre here you open it yourself mr walker i gave you the chance to drop it off she checked her watch merely to drive home her next point we either do this now or not but i havent the time to stand here discussing it she wanted to show him a firm hand dispel any notions that he might have that they had formed a personal friendship she knew all too well that if she didnt watch it walker could attach to her letting her fill the void left by his dead sister she didnt want any part of that it was behind the dumpster in the alley behind his place walker said digging into the box he pulled out a navy blue michigan sweatshirt with yellow block letters matthews tried her best not to react neal had mentioned the possible existence of a sweatshirt this fit with that part of his statement and she felt elated with the discovery he tried to pass it to her but matthews refused and then called to the security officers gloves she directed walker to hold it at the shoulders pinched between his fingers attempting to initiate as little contact with him as possible she fired off questions at him how much contact have you had with this can you identify it as your sisters exactly where and when did you find this garment he answered her crisply that hed boxed it for her that it was his sisters and that hed found it behind the dumpster in a search hed done that same morning following their encounter at the mes once protected by the gloves matthews took possession of the sweatshirt turning it around to inspect the random pattern of dark brown orbs that speckled its fabric and a similar but larger stain on the neck of the sweatshirt dried blood im going to need an evidence bag here matthews instructed one of the gate personnel this person took off at a jog toward the bank of elevators i done good right ferrell walker asked testing her you may have contaminated a vital piece of evidence matthews would not acknowledge that walker had accomplished what she had not could not without a court order to search neals residence without probable causehard evidence against nealthey still lacked that court order ironically the sweatshirt if found in a public area as walker claimed might present the necessary probable cause im telling you he did this you have to leave this to me your participation has to stop here are we clear on that you helped me i helped you he said looking a little wounded were helping each other only his tentative tone of voice gave away that he was testing the situation the relationship i help you just like you help those girls her breath caught he knew about her volunteer work at the shelter had he followed her well take it from here she said strongly ill be in touch not if im in touch first he said voicing the same childish sentiment he had earlier in the day he stopped at pete and took his knife back though pete required him to reach the other side of the security gear first pete said its illegal to conceal that weapon im a snitch walker said proudly with that announcement pete spun around to check with matthews who just shook her head in disgust when she looked again walker was nowhere to be seen now you see him now you dont it went against all her training her substantial education and certainly the rules set forth for volunteer workers but upon hearing from an spd narcotics officer that a street kida girlhad invoked her name during a sidewalk shakedown from which the girl had been released daphne matthews found herself personally involved her first stop was the shelter where she learned that margaret had been kicked loose after the maximum stay allowed where to look next a late march storm swept angrily over the city driving frigid rain behind a nasty wintry wind that made it feel more like december she pulled up her collar and ran for the honda this wasnt a night for a pregnant girl to be out in the elements and matthews didnt want margaret having to negotiate street favors for the bare necessities of warmth and a place to sleep she knew what these girls did in order to survive with margaret putting her name out to an officeran obvious cry for helphow was matthews supposed to return for the evening to her houseboat and a glass of wine she decided to make one loop of downtown looking for the girl fortyfive minutes max it wasnt as if she had a hot date waiting once into the drivers seat she brushed the rain off her and turned toward the backseat in search of her umbrella looking out the cars rainblurred rear window she thought she saw a figurea man for surestanding behind the railing of the wedgeshaped concrete parking garage standing there and looking across at her turning around in the seat adjusting her rearview mirrorsboth outside and inshe picked him up again a black silhouette like a cardboard cutout standing absolutely still on the second level of the triangular parking garage after the first spurt of panic iced through her she thought it was probably walker and though disturbed he might be following her shed done nothing yet to shatter his regard for her nothing to turn a fan into a foe though she knew how fine a line she walked as she calmed ever so slightly not one to shrink and wither she decided to face up to him she threw the honda in gear bumped it out of the shelters parking lot and drove quickly around the block and into the garage entrance she resented taking the parking stub realizing it would cost her a couple bucks to get her message across to walker but peace of mind was cheap at twice the price she drove up the ramp to level two and parked in the first open space she encountered she grabbed her purse locked the car with the remote and walked quickly toward the area of the garage where shed just seen the silhouette no one she called out mr walker she took hold of the railing and eased her head out for a more panoramic view the new football stadium loomed to her left dominating the skyline and obscuring a good deal of the safe as residents called baseballs safeco field to the right skyscrapers competed for a view of puget sound she looked above her and below her in the same general location wondering if shed gotten the level wrong when she looked straight down at the sidewalk she took into account all the pedestrians alert for anyone hurrying anyone fitting walkers general build his sweatshirt and jeans anyone looking back up at her it was during this surveillance that she spotted the rooftop light rack and bold lettering of kcso patrol car it appeared on the street to her right immediately adjacent to the parking garages exit prair she wondered a daily runner matthews ran and ran hard she flew past the rows of parked cars circled down the oily car ramp shed driven up all in an effort to keep her eye on that moving patrol car as it cornered the parking facility she wanted desperately to get a look at its driver she wasnt merely running but sprinting down the echoing confines of the garage the myriad of colorful lightsneon traffic lights headlights and taillightsspinning like a kaleidoscope focused as she was she didnt see the group of four street punks until she was nearly upon them huddled together under the overhang of the garages next level they looked over at her with hollow eyeshollow heads was more like itthe pungent odor of pot hanging in the air the patrol car sped by on her right she looked out but too late one of the bigger boys in the group came out toward her from between the parked cars what are you looking at she debated displaying her shield but decided against it kids like this held a particular dislike for authority in doing so she experienced what must have been a defenseless civilians panic but if high on pot they didnt represent much threat of violence no matter what the posturing it didnt fit the model if the pot were an attempt at a comedown from an amphetamine high though she had problems her volunteer work at the shelter had not gone for naught another of the young toughs this one with peroxide hair and a face that held enough piercings to set off an airport security check followed on the heels of his friend shes finelooking eh manny the kid coughed and spat the phlegm attaching to the car he passed matthews stood her ground there was a man up here up there she said pointing to level two just now maybe six feet tall looking west maybe in a sweatshirt and jeans maybe a uniform take it somewhere else the bigger one said but his eyes had locked onto her purse she is damn fine the kid with the dye job whispered to his buddy encouraging him forward defining his own interest in matthews did you see a patrol car king county sheriffs yeah right replied the leader sarcastically up there on level two she said theres four of us lady he stepped out from between the cars now only a few feet from her where was that sheriffs car now that she needed it this south end of town was rough at nightthe very reason the shelter was no more than a block away some of these hotheads carried weapons she didnt want that in the equation bribery on the other hand had its place twenty bucks answers my question she tried to put his attention on her purse out of her mind not wanting to see him as a criminal but instead as a source of information if the blond kid wanted to try his dopedup luck at groping her the purse carried a beretta a can of mace a single pair of handcuffs a mobile phone and a palm pilot connecting that purse to the side of his face would put the kid in the next county reaching into the purse grabbing hold of the weapon chambering a roundall that would probably take ten seconds that she wouldnt have didnt see no cruiser the leader said but maybe the uniform yeah how bout that twenty the option presented itself for her to grab the gun while pretending to retrieve the twenty though it upped the stakes considerably she had no intention of shooting some stoned kid nor of provoking the remaining three to fire on her she asked what color uniform this question would separate fact from fiction blue for spd dark brown khaki for kcso army maybe the kid took another step closer she found his answer intriguing for if hed believed a khaki uniform meant an army officer it added credibility to why he and his pals hadnt fled whereas a blue uniform would strike the fear of god into any one of these kids but khaki was more likely king county sheriff not army evaluating her situation came down to mapping an exit route she felt confident she could outrun any one of these kids the problem was that this leader stood between her and the exit the only ramp available to her led up and into the garage cars streamed around this parking garage their lights glinting like those of a carousel so many people so incredibly close by and yet oblivious to her predicament her extreme isolationone against many alone and yet surroundedbore down on her what color shirt she asked what about that twenty she faced a choice thenher gun or the payoff she clicked open her purse and for a moment the sounds of the city surrendered to the intense drumming in her ears she drew a twenty from her wallet keeping her hands hidden behind the screen of her purse there lay her gun on the bottom of everything was the small can of pepper spray a far more reasonable means of defense given the threat she made one stab for itfingers darting through the contents of the purseand by an act of divine intervention she touched the cans cold metal and drew the mace from her purse her hand concealing it they all heard the car enter from the other side of the building saw the spread of its headlights as shadows crawled across the stained concrete during this brief distraction matthews placed the twenty at her feet and cradling the pepper spray turned and walked toward the ramp that led to level two she heard the big kid hurry to retrieve the money the scratching of the soles of his boots on the concrete she sensed the other kids bold advance as he tested the possibility of following her maybe scoring a little payoff of his ownmaybe money maybe something else dude the big one called out as the headlights swung to encompass them all matthews hurried then not running not wanting to signal her fear up the ramp and straight toward her honda the lights flashed and the horn beeped behind the signal from her remote button she wondered what the message was as she bumped the honda out into the busy street like stepping through a stage curtain and walking into the audience she searched for significance in every incident every encounter she experienced the psychologist seizing upon every opportunity to learn something about herself in the process she nearly forgot about the man in the khaki uniform overlooking the shelters parking lot nearly but not quite old friends new enemies you want peepers we got peepers but i gotta tell you johno your guys have been through these already because of hebringer and randolf marisha stenolovski slid a file cabinet drawer open the files went back twelve or fifteen inches stenolovski stuck out a few inches in all the right places herself hed been there done that last thirty days ill know it when i see it it had been a year earlier a cop bar both of them flirting a little too openly she stood a good three inches taller than he lanky dark slavic skin brooding eyes a screamerhe remembered that as well it had lasted a week or two hed dumped her for someone no doubt couldnt remember for whom just now the problem with relationships at work they came back to bite you she lowered her voice youre an asshole john until you need my help you dont give me the time of day what am i damaged goods leftovers i dont care that you leave me for some singer good riddance but the way you avoid me now its disrespectful the singer he remembered now i dont avoid you have we said two words in the last six months a woman got peeped over at the inn im looking for similar complaints she slapped the steel file drawer there all the peepers a guy could ask for look hard johnny maybe youre in there too she walked off he remembered that walk strong alluring legs to the moon one foot placed exactly in front of the other like a runway model so her butt shifted back and forth like a pair of puppies in a paper sack shed donned a pair of his boxer shorts one morning topless just the boxer shorts nothing else they ate bagels together at the kitchen table her dressed that way he remembered more about her than he might have thought it shouldnt have surprised him that the one case file that interested him turned out to have stenolovskis name listed as the investigator life was like that he should have known because there were only a couple fulleights in special assaultssa the rest worked it parttime he caught up to her as she sat atop a metal stool in an office cubicle covered with magazine tear sheets of barefoot water skiers a photo of a nephew another of prague or moscow someplace gray bleak with billboard ads he didnt recognize definitely eastern european in the photo she had her arm around a very old lady with hair the color of winter clouds he cleared his throat with me you get what you get sometimes thats a good thing sometimes not if youre pissed youre pissed but if i apologized it would be wrong because it would be insincere im not sorry for any of it anything we had except that since then maybe ive treated you wrong she smiled so pull up a chair asshole he smiled back yeah thanks ms tina oblitz the phone cradled between his shoulder and ear lamoia was guessing that the oblitz file had been passed over during the hebringerrandolf race for lack of what his department called connective tissue because oblitz herself had tried to withdraw the complaint that sticky note in the file would have tainted itwhy further investigate something that didnt happenbut it was just this postit that intrigued john lamoia this is she lamoia introduced himself by rank and awaited the mandatory pause of shock value telephones werent the greatest his beeper chirped and he yanked it off his belt wondering if rehab was bugging the neighbors the dog had attached himself to lamoia and reportedly would wail hours on end when lamoia was off on night duty no such problem during the day shifts the dog needed a shrink maybe matthews would give it a spin he recognized the phone number on the pager as the mesdixon must have completed the autopsy on maryann walker yes sergeant tentative cautious you recently filed a voyeurism complaint with us then you called back to attempt to retract the complaint it was nothing i was mistaken and we he continued as if uninterrupted detective stenolovski actually informed you that once filed a complaint cannot be retracted its fine its nothing its not fine with me ms oblitz ive got a case im working a stalking voyeurism ive just been reviewing a similar case file from your initial complaint im thinking our current case might be the same guy who was watching you no one was watching me sergeant i was mistaken if theres blackmail involved extortion then i can help with that ms oblitz its nothing like that then what is it like i beg your pardon stenolovski says the initial complaint was quite convincing you saw this guy out your hotel window thats important to me ms oblitz then you call to distance yourself suddenly you dont want anything to do with it ive got to ask myself is it because youre afraid have you been threatened extorted i need to know about that its not that its just that i was mistaken okay so im wrong i still got to talk to you ms oblitz about that original complaint a womans gone through something awfultwo others have gone missingand i think you may be able to help me with this i think you know what shes going through a long pause he could hear her breathing not now not over the phone lamoia experienced a great sense of victory he closed his eyes drew in a deep breath and combed his free hand through his hair okay thank you so when where he added youre in the bay area its going to have to be by phone im afraid im traveling up there on business monday im in the w name a time he said she asked him to wait a minute i have an opening at four four to five will that suit you four oclock fine whatever you do dont announce yourself at the desk would you not sergeant just call up to the room please done he hung up the phone with a smile he owned ms tina oblitz she just didnt know it yet the discovery process bernie lofgrin typed the blood on that sweatshirt your boyfriend delivered lamoia explained to matthews it matches maryann walkers theyre running dna now meanwhile were here for a little chat sid she asked were going to search his apartment right if he lets us in we get a plainsight search lamoia answered but for anything more than that well need a court order and for that mahoney wants a print or prints developed on the sweatshirt some hairs other than maryanns a second blood type semen something to bring neal into the picture with physical evidence and the lab is working on it he added call me recklessi dont feel like waiting another twentyfour hours on this and im along because she asked because i like you matthews why else she felt herself blush and tried to cover it by saying gee john youve got me all feverish thats the idea he said well cool off with a drink later dont count on it she said though it didnt sound so bad lamoia she asked herself who was she kidding because you see things the rest of us dont he said answering her original question and because someone has to keep an eye on him while i inspect his car he allowed this to sink in she was sitting up facing a car when she was hit not standing not running away dixie can prove that if not the sweatshirt maybe neals car the point being something is going to win sid a ticket into neals apartment and ill take it however we can get it he gave her one of his highvoltage smiles as he used a credit card to trick open the lock on the apartment houses streetside door the dark stairwell smelled sour of spilled beer and wine tobacco and other things in various states of organic decomposition that she didnt want to think aboutstreet sex and intravenous drug use and always that tinge of the sea these combined with an odor that she took to be poisoned mice or water rats entombed in the walls in various stages of silent decay should we have maybe called for backup she asked in a forced whisper were fine lamoia said climbing the stairs two at a time and reaching inside his jacket for his handgun as he got to the landing it didnt feel all that fine to her and she nearly said so you didnt have to come he said then whyd you ask me along what the hell john these arent even my hours because i knew if i didnt youd be all moody about being left out this irritated hernot the comment but the fact that he had her dead to rights i asked you because i knew you had nothing better to do tonight and i thought you might enjoy seeing me take this guy down seeing you take him down she restated so im what your audience its not like that and you know it what is it like john she whispered they stood outside the apartment number listed on lamoias slip of paper she was angry now angrier still that she allowed it to show he met eyes with her and whispered back i like your company matthews youre smart youre clever and like i said you see things in shitballs like neal that the rest of us miss a case like this maybe we find evidence maybe we dont and if we dont the evidence may boil down to this guys behavior his reactions am i right and who better than you to sit up on that witness stand and charm the shorts off a jury to where they buy a collection of circumstantial evidence that pins him as capable of anything including lying lamoia reached up and rapped his knuckles on the door he indicated for her to step back and he readied the weapon before him she understood then that the pistol was nothing more than posturing on lamoias parthe wanted to scare neal with this entrance to establish a degree of distrust that would set the tone for the interview to come she admired him for this gut instinct of his sometimes she wondered who of the two of them understood human behavior better who is it neal asked through the door sergeant lamoia and lieutenant matthews mr neal the man opened the apartment door with none of the reluctance or hesitation that matthews might have expected of the guilty and she took note of this such cocksure confidence could be its own telltale its own undoing for a rare breed of suspect the door opened into a room dominated by a large worn couch covered in an unpleasant green cotton that looked more like a bedspread a wooden chair facing it and a coffee table with badly scratched veneer that clearly doubled as a footrest a shabby aluminum card table that belonged in an airstream trailer held two empty beer bottles and a pair of disposable picnic containers of salt and pepper the table was situated in front of a large doublehung window its jamb and sill pockmarked by a dozen coats of poorly applied paint it looked out onto a black metal fire escape and beyond an unexpectedly impressive view of lake union finding the oneman kitchen neat and clean surprised her she would have expected neal incapable of housekeeping a plainsight search of the small bedroom revealed the television hed mentioned previously as well as a second window access out onto the fire escape also part of his earlier statement at least in his description of the place his earlier statement held up the artwork if it could be called that amounted to travel posters of beach resorts showing scantily clad bronzed women enjoying bright sunshine while surrounded by palm trees and umbrellas he caught her staring i was an internet travel agent until the meltdown happened put most of us out of business and now lamoia asked i dont think we established your employment mr neal a little of this a little of that between jobs right now between women too lamoia muttered maryann was helping with the rent matthews said neal shrugged a little youll hear it from the maggot anyway if you havent already the brother lamoia clarified hes a parasite and dont look at me like im the pot calling the kettle black because its my apartment in the first place my car my things im between jobs is all and maryann helped out so what lamoia said sit down mr neal an order not a request neal displayed his disgust as he slouched into the grasp of the green monster outwardly reluctant in this act of obedience matthews purposefully stood over by the table out of neals peripheral vision but with a clear view of him temporarily pushing away the continuing concern for margarets whereabouts and the confusion over both ferrell walker and nathan prair that had robbed her of sleep she focused on the suspect alert for every twitch every nuance as he reacted to lamoias line of questioning with his detectives notebook lying on his pressed blue jeans lamoia said you mentioned your car what kind of a car is it please ninetytwo corolla color kind of gold champagne right champagne you said the car was yours yeah only yours yeah you have the only set of keys or did maryann have a set listen we werent married lamoia said so she did not have a key people who spend a lot of time in boats they dont make the best drivers maryann she was a danger in that car he repeated she did not have her own key youre real quick sergeant neal craned his neck then to locate matthews i figured you were probably snooping around while the sergeant here held me riveted with his line of questioning you figured wrong she said were trying to show some respect by coming to your home rather than dragging you downtown were trying to get to the truth of what happened to maryann lamoia said i didnt see a champagne corolla out on the street on our way in neal shook his head and grinned at the same time so you knew about my car before you asked me is that supposed to scare me or something sergeant lamoia responded i know a lot of things before i ask you lanny thats why your answers count so much i know what you guys are thinking he wormed his hands together and wouldnt look at lamoia interpreting the spill patterns in his worn brown rug instead but thats bullshit and we both know it what are we thinking lamoia asked dont hand me that you know and i know so thats that yeah lamoia agreed thats pretty much that it doesnt make me good for this a persons history is an inescapable thing lanny think about it we got it down in black and white that you like to backhand your women that stuffs not admissible so youre a lawyer now what happened to travel agent lamoias comment won another spark of eye contact between the two and matthews saw a conflicted personality working hard to contain himself lanny neal wanted to release some of the pentup anger he was feeling but was smart enough to know that would work against him lamoia said lets get back to the location of that corolla parked in a space out back has it been to the shop recently no been to the car wash oh yeah i spend a lot of time at the car wash with the soccer moms in the minivans you got me nailed i can see that reading me loud and clear i need a straight answer on this one langford you have or have not cleaned the car in the past six days the directness of lamoias question sobered neal he sat up straightthe kid in the classroom caught doodlingsuddenly understanding the severity of lamoias questions whats with that an answer is all have not what you think in killing her i drove her to the ballard bridge and tossed her you want to search the car is that it shed gone off the aurora bridge matthews made mental note of the mistake if you wouldnt mind lamoia glanced over at matthews it might help to clear this up all the more quickly if i took a look at it yes have at it another look between matthews and lamoia lamoia said the lieutenantll stay here while i go down and check it out neal clearly didnt like the idea he appeared to weigh the value of dissenting but indicated a hook by the apartment door where a set of keys hung i wont be going into the vehicle lamoia corrected i wont even be touching it a cursory external examination is all because you dont have a warrant are you guys charging me with something should we be fuck no im just asking whats going on here whats going on lamoia replied flatly is that im going to go out and look at your car while lieutenant matthews asks you a few questions he added do you have any problem with that no problem he confirmed reluctantly lamoia left the apartment and matthews moved around to the same chair in front of the green couch and faced neal the mans demeanor changed noticeably which came as no great surprise to her accustomed to controlling women neal would believe he could gain the upper hand over matthews it occurred to her that she couldnt rule him out as the man watching her from the parking garage if those kids had lied about the khaki clothing then anyone could have been up there watching her when was the last time maryann was in your car mr neal what is all this with the car why do you have to hassle me i didnt do anything to maryann when you say you didnt do anything exactly what do you mean anything of a violent nature is that it because we know you had sexual relations with maryannyouve already told us about that you cohabitated here in this apartment she reminded you argued at least you implied as much i need to advise you mr neal that we take your answers seriously theyre being written down and were assuming youre making every effort to aid us in our investigation are you going to tell me now that you never struck maryann never threatened her never abused her in any way or fashionbecause when you make a sweeping statement like the one you just made you force me to reconsider every other answer youve given us i didnt kill her he said though he sounded much less convinced and matthews made note of the last minute of their exchange as she was writing he said she was in the car all the time okay maybe not every day but all the time did you ever strike her when she was in the car im not saying i ever hit her do you need for me to repeat the question she found herself interested in his ability to pay attention to the questions and identify some of the traps she was trying to lay neal was no stranger to such interrogations if she had to guess her colleagues in special assaults didnt keep track of the number of times a person was brought in for questioningbut had they she believed neals jacket would be littered with such interviews i never hit her when she was in the car never hit her period was maryann ever in an accident in the vehicle damn near the way she drives matthews noted the presenttense answer wondering at the same time if neal had yet to fully accept maryanns death or if it was merely a slip of the tongue guilt and remorse could play tricks on the brain should i repeat the question no accidents okay she let the tension in the air settle like waiting for smoke to clear then you could see no reason no explanation for any of maryanns spilled blood being found in or on your vehiclethis nineteen ninetytwo champagne corolla blood his eyes went wide and she could feel his chest knot with panic he was wondering how shed jumped to this thinking what hed overlooked what shed led him into its a simple enough question she said or would you like me to repeat it as well whats all this about the question concerns possible explanations for blood found in your i heard the goddamn question i asked what its about neal gave the impression of genuine surprise at her implication they might connect maryanns blood to his car she didnt trust this impression but she took note of it nonetheless if he could play his girlfriends then why couldnt he play investigators guys like lanny neal grew accustomed to playing everyone around them to get what they wanted it made him difficult to read and she found it even more difficult to trust her own assessments domesticsand this had every indication of being just thatusually cleared on a confession or a statement by the guilty party some eighty percent of domestic homicides were cleared through confessions to the first officer to arrive on the scene lanny neal was bucking the odds but it didnt let him off the hook lamoia stepped through the door without knocking hands in plain view mr neal he said strongly approaching the couch keep them on your knees matthews understood immediately where this was headedneal did too for that matter she stood out of her chair wishing lamoia had consulted her first shed softened up neal with her questioning might have gotten to a confession if lamoia had given her some time he then asked neal to stand and carefully patted him down searching for weapons this completed he delved into the cushions and cracks of the green monstershe didnt envy him that jobbrushed his hands off and set the suspect back down into the couch are you familiar with courtordered search warrants lamoia asked neal matthews wondered if the patdown had been motivated by real evidence or lamoias desire to imply the discovery of real evidence with lamoia one could never tell she continued to believe she knew where this was headed though for the first time she began to question from what it had come yeah ive applied by phone for permission to search and seize your property mr neal specifically your car im well aware that we already had your verbal permission to inspect the vehicle but this more formal step is necessary to protect what we call the chain of custody in terms of evidence collection do you understand not really the warrant stuff sure but why i thought you might tell me lamoia said it could save us all a lot of time matthews told the suspect what we were just discussing is of relevance here his face reflected a mixture of annoyance anger and uncertainty if theres blood in that car ive got no idea how it got there none matthews informed lamoia that theyd just been exploring various possibilities for any such evidence she dropped the hammer with since we know that mr neal has the only key to the vehicle its not the only key he spoke up his eyes pleaded for understanding you asked if maryann had a key she didnt but it wasnt the only key ive got one of those spare key things inside under the driverside rear wheel this news hit her like a bomb and she could see it had with lamoia as well though he hid it cleverly from neal disguising it as a yawn that he covered with his hand he wanted neal thinking he was bored anything but a second key lamoia said rear wheel up on the axle one of those magnetic boxes matthews asked and you would expect that key to be in place at the moment last time i used that was a good two months ago its gotta be there locked yourself out lamoia asked over on fortyfifth wed gone to that thai place vietnamese whatever it is maryanns birthday im going to check it out lamoia informed matthews you okay here fine matthews said i hit a bird last week neal volunteered right side of the car right he called out after a retreating lamoia lamoia stopped with your permission mr neal im going to check for that key he waited for a response neal looked back and forth between the two clearly weighing cooperation versus objection he looked as if he might ask a question of matthews but she made no effort to encourage this if lamoia was operating on a bluff the wrong answer now could sway neal to start protecting himselfthe last thing she and lamoia wanted neal said what the hell lamoia opened the door but did not leave he turned to neal and nodded faintly sending the man a signal you have my permission neal conceded if a randomly placed key existed somewhere on the car any decent firstyear defense attorney could shred their attempts to lay blame on neal for any damaging evidence collected confusing matthews further was neals willingness to cooperate with the search his earlier conviction and brief prison time when combined with what was obviously an aboveaverage intelligence should have prevented him from making any such agreements guilty or not she thought i hit a bird he repeated for her benefit sure you did she said trying her best to sound utterly unconvinced no key mr neal lamoia announced when he returned less than five minutes later i checked the same location behind all four tires yeah his bravado seem to crumble matthews had seen this dozens of times before that point when the lies collapse under the weight of truth then it fell off somewhere or maybe i never put it back after the last time sure im telling you but he couldnt think how to complete the thought lamoia was just getting warmed up crawling around under the car just now you want to know what i found he asked this to matthews as if neal werent in the room whats that she answered some hair a nice little smudge of blonde hair and blood bottom of the rear bumper and more on the bottom of the gas tank rear of the vehicle he said for neals sake you ever hit a blonde bird you scumbag backing up maybe youd like to start doing some talking on account sid is going to collect all that physical evidenceincluding i want to bet some blue cotton fibers from the sweatshirt that you yourself put maryann in that nightand youre going to lose any chance you had to put us or the court on your side of this you understand how that works dont you youre no stranger to the process an argument matthews said seizing on lamoias discovery of this evidence she felt energized gripped by adrenaline maybe she shoved you hit you swore at you all that affects the way the lawyers look at a domestic but if that evidence piles up ahead of time lamoia said then what the hell do we need you for how the hell you going to get anyone to listen if weve already got you in the bag were listening right now mr neal matthews said but neal looked as paralyzed by lamoias announcement as she felt every time they had a leg up on this guy he threw her into doubt with an unexpected reaction she cautioned herself to work the boldt methodlisten to the victim follow the evidence discount witnesses and ignore the suspect completely until all the facts were in she tended to react emotionally to suspects at least on a surface level and to trust that reaction it was this opposite approach of theirs that made their combination such an effective team with lamoia things were a little different he tended to cut to the chase go for the heart and then leave it to her to show the suspect the error of his ways she added we wont be around forever lanny this thing will be out of our hands soon she said wondering if they could be so lucky and into the hands of the attorneys at that time your chance of gaining any points for cooperation pretty much disappear i dont know anything about any blood being under that car thats the wrong answer lamoia said his cell phone rang and you know what that is he asked the suspect viewing callerid that would be my court order coming through to search this dump he silenced the ringing of the phone with the push of a button and held the device to his ear lamoia he announced into the phone talk to me darlin tell me what i want to hear voice male a blinking message light was no great surprise to matthews as she returned to her office that evening in what had become an automatic gesture she dialed in to retrieve her voice mail which announced that she had six messages she cringed as she intuitively anticipated that at least one of these could be from deputy sheriff nathan prair hed attached himself to her once before and now with their renewed acquaintance with the description of the brown uniform in the parking garage she felt nearly certain she would need to deal with him again the first message on the system was an earlier one from lamoia asking for her company when he went to interview a possible peeper victim tina oblitz he explained oblitzs prior attempts to cancel the order as lamoia put it and how he hoped he might gain insight into hebringers and randolfs vanishing act she felt closer to johnhis teasing bordered on flirting his earlier struggle with the oxycontin had revealed a more human lamoia some people were helped by such challenges and lamoia had the makings she scribbled down his initialsthis was how she took note of all such phone messagesa reminder to return his call the second message caught her by surprise and because of her premonition she mistakenly assigned the voice initially to prair though her brain quickly straightened her out lieutenant matthews it was ferrell walker i wondered if my gift helped you out i dont have a phone so listen ill call you back her image was not of walker at the mes half out of his mind with grief nor was it the boyish man delivering his sisters soiled sweatshirt as a gift it was instead an image of walker in his bloodied apron standing in the falling rain his eyes bloodshot with fatigue but looking up and down her body his wet matted hair one black rubber glove one yellowshe remembered so many details of that interview pass she said aloud deleting the message at the start of the third message the first vestiges of concern warmed her spreading through her like a shot of alcohol me again she was mad at herself for being distracted by prair only to be blindsided by the much more obvious emotionally unstable ferrell walker trouble came in threesshed heard detectives talk of this for years though dismissed such superstitionsand yet it seemed shed been served up a pair walker said i forgot to mention that i love what youre wearingespecially the orange blouse it was peach not orange she thought as she looked down past the phone and took in her clothing listen we could have a beer or coffee or something talk about the case do you even drink coffee so much to learn about you how had he managed to see the color of her blouse she wondered shed worn her gray rain jacket all day because of the persistent drizzle shed taken it off only when inside the thoughts connected like a magnet picking up filings she glanced over at her office window the blinds were twisted open not possible she pressed the keypad to save walkers message then crossed the room peered curiously out her seventhfloor window and twisted the blinds shut it wasnt as if she wore her rain jacket zipped to her neckhe could have seen her anywhere away from the office but to do so he would have to have been watching her and watching her closely the fourth message played automatically from the speakerphone as she stood across the room walkers voice yet again me again sorry but we could take a walk or something it doesnt have to be a drink later she took a deep breath to clear her thoughts shed worked with dozens upon dozens of disturbed men some across an interrogation table some in a corrections facility sex offenders drug addictshomicidal suicidalsocial misfits ferrell walker was still grieving no doubt and had clearly transferred some of his feelings for his unavailable sister onto her such transference was more typically directed at people considered close to the individual not a virtual stranger but there were no rules to such things no commandments to follow walkers final message ran goose bumps up her arms then down her spine and into a nauseated stomach i hope im not scaring you with these messages i know womenespecially attractive womenmust be scared in this city right now im not going to hurt you or something i want to help you get lanny neal is all the sooner the better as far as im concerned the unspoken message there was that in fact he might be planning to hurt her if neal was not brought in she sat down heavily into her chair her hands steepled before her lips one more thing to deal with she struggled to evaluate him as she might a patient with the death of his sister he had preexisting emotional conditions that allowed the possibility of a fantasy stage where matthews was seen as his solution to all ills and injustices shed made a mess of it by not laying down strict guidelines at his first offer to help her worse yet such a fine line existed between love and hate that she now faced a very difficult job of distancing herself without repercussions the sixth message was from boldtjust the sound of his voice came as a great relief something about mama lu an autopsy and a possible connection to hebringer and randolf though she didnt focus on it clearly walkers bloody apron still foremost in her mind without the mounting evidence against neal without walkers initial callin and his attempt to assist in neals prosecution by turning over that evidence she might have believed walker capable of having killed his only sister himself she couldnt rule it out entirely even so end of messages the voice mail announced a pleasant automated voice that had no idea of the worry those messages instilled in her she stabbed the speakerphone button and disconnected walkers messages and his unflinching tone echoing in her head first things first she would start a file detailing the passing of the sweatshirt making notes about the silhouette in the parking garage transcribing the various phone messages if he continued to harass her the existence of that file would help her make a case she would not allow him to rattle her shed seen much worse than ferrell walker although in her patients the conflict the violence the obsession or fixation was always directed at others not her always someone elses problem she was the facilitator not the target the cop not the victim she packed up and headed home but found herself checking her rearview mirror a little more often glancing around while stopped at red lights and triplechecking the cars automatic door lock walker had put the bug in her and it wasnt going away her houseboat on lake union had been bought well before the citys techno renaissance when the floating oneandahalfstory homesactual houses on pilings and accessed by a wooden dock down the middlehad been a latenthippie community nonconformists who wanted a home in the city but not the cost of the land beneath the houses had been dirt cheap back then an awkward phrase given their setting now those same homes went for high six figures and matthews had long since realized she was living in her k at the very least she had quadrupled her investment her houseboat last on the left of dock c was constructed of gray shiplap thirtygallon terracotta flower tubs sat to either side of the hemp rope railing that surrounded her deck no green thumb shed tried annuals in the tubs for a while but kept killing them off they currently housed a variety of korean boxwood that required no attention she walked briskly down the dock her cole haan flats clapping like gunshots her heart rate elevated as she wondered if shed been followed her houseboats front door was african mahogany and bore a carving of a dove she could do without she entered locked the door and threw its deadbolt removing and hanging up the rain jacket reminded her of the color of her blouse and reintroduced a wave of brief panic at the thought that walker not only had managed to see her with her jacket off but was brazen enough to mention it the downstairs was finished cedar the furnishings sparea foldout couch a woodburning stove a handcarved cherry rocker an eightbyeight post in the center of the small living room supported the roof the galley kitchen was separated from the living area by a small island countertop that hosted three stools a walkaround phone a cutting board and a suspended wooden rack that was home to wineglasses the killer home stereo had taken her three years to acquire she fired up sarah mclachlans surfacing and cranked the volume if anything eventually sank this place it would be the high count of books and professional journals that overflowed the bookshelves and rose to towering stacks on the floor a narrow padded window seat offered her favorite reading nest snuggled in there a fire going a throw pulled across her legs she had consumed many hours of pure blissat least those hours that werent tied down theyd been increasingly few in the last several months something drove her to not just fill her schedule but pack it full of work volunteering at the shelter running and the gymit didnt matter as long as she filled am to exhaustion without time to think for thinking was the real enemy thinking about herself the lack of romance in her life the isolation the poverty of public service the missed opportunities after a dinner of broiled chicken breast and a green salad with rice vinegar she changed into flannel pjs built a fire and tucked herself into the window seat a glass of archery summit pinot in hand she felt a bit guilty about not stopping by the shelter to inquire about margaret but walkers phone messages had unsettled her and the comfort of home proved just what the doctor ordered she being the doctor chapter by chapter she lost herself to barbara kingsolvers prodigal summera book she found unexpectedly titillatinga rare and muchneeded escape from psychology reviews she caught herself dozing off luxury came cheaply these days at she noticed the firm bright green display of the kitchens digital clockshe heard what her mind registered as an unfamiliar sound the houseboat had a life of its own never perfectly at rest battered by water and weather always shifting settling creaking and groaning these pops and grunts the wooden cries and long eerie sighs helped to form a personality uniquely its own matthews knew that personality well these same sounds lulled her to sleep they woke her up on some occasions they frightened her as they did on this night she suddenly felt more awake her brain sorted through the database of familiarity with what she now heard filtering out the noises that accompanied any night on lake union the seaplanes landing and taking off motor craft highway traffic distant ferry horns sirens and the noises of her neighbors going about everyday life she lay there ears ringing slightly as she stretched to hear beyond the walls she couldnt be sure what she heard or whether or not it was just a bad case of nerves those phone messages had rattled her so had her experience at the parking garage more than she had thought she promised herself that she wouldnt let this get the better of her yet she glanced across the room to her purse which hung by its strap from one of the three ladderback stoolsher handgun cell phone the small can of pepper spray and a mini maglite barbara kingsolver drew her eyes back to the novel as she told herself that noise carried well and did funny things across water no reason to get all worked up but shed momentarily lost the chance at sleep another few minutes passed behind the efforts of the delicious pages the melodious singing and the sumptuous wine going on midnight feeling tired again at a chapter break she inserted the bookmark spun her legs off the window seat and mechanically folded the throw she handwashed the wineglass in the kitchen sink its glass squeaking and placed it carefully down into the drying rack she watched a seaplane landthe last of the nightas it taxied across the lakes black water as the groan of the propellers faded she heard yet another unfamiliar creak from the bones of her houseboat this time she grabbed her gun and moved to the front door intent on escorting walker off the dock never mind that the residential phone numbers and addresses of police officers went unpublished never mind that shed carefully watched her cars rearview mirrors and had assured herself she hadnt been followed she remained convinced it was ferrell walker creeping around out there and it was beginning to get to her thumbing aside the curtain on the narrow window to the left of the front door she peered out toward bob and blairs place their downstairs lights were off the blue glow of a television emanated from the window of the loft she saw that robert and lynn were still awake next door lynns nephew gin visiting from japan was currently prowling the refrigerator shed been pulling the blinds extra carefully on that side of the houseboat as gin had a teenagers voyeuristic tendencies with all the sounds she knew she wouldnt sleep well if she didnt take a security lap around the house it wouldnt be the first time shed lapped the house more typically such trips were made to ensure structural integrity in the middle of a raging storm heading out now on a relatively calm night with only a slight drizzle while pushing her chest into a knot hardly compared with challenging a fortyknot wind and sideways rain she grabbed the halogen penlight from her purse pulled the goretex jacket over her pajamas and let herself out while throwing the night latch to ensure no one sneaked in behind her precautions any practicing forensic psychologist learned to live with themexcons who blamed you for their incarceration returned to pay their respects excops whod been tossed from the force for drug abuse or continued spousal abuse decided you were the instigation behind their removal prosecutors and detectives arrived at all hours believing they had every right to free advice barefoot on the redwood decking she headed counterclockwise around the corner increasingly cautious with each turn her toes curled from the cold wet wood she tiptoed in bare feet moving in a trained controlled fashion and snagged a splinter in her foot hopping on one foot to avoid the shooting pain she balanced against the house and lifted her foot to the light the thing was the size of a toothpick and sunk in pretty deep her focus shifted beyond her foot to the deck where a thin film of rainwater left a silvery patina offset from that sheen were two muddy boot prints that led in succession from where she stood to her mudroom window the window was beneath an overhang dark in shadow suddenly it felt much colder out there had been boot prints found at the construction site overlooking the hotel and melissa dunkins room she envisioned a manhands cupped to that window peeping her her orbit of the house completed her nerves tingling she hurried around to the back door and the hidden house key lamoia needed to hear about this a moment later she was locked and bolted inside the splinter and the pain it caused a forgotten footnote she wanted to tell lamoia immediately given that he was currently working a similar case his tour over hed likely be home by now she hurried through the house pulling blinds and doublechecking locks feeling both exposed and vulnerable she shed the raincoat but wrapped herself tightly in a thick robe poured herself another wine and sat down by the phone staring at it what to do a pair of possible boot prints was that any kind of evidence a couple of noises heard outside as it was she walked a delicate line in the department part professional headshrinker part cop this duality a full lieutenant who had been through the academy yet a cardcarrying phd in psychology left most of the department thinking of her as a shrink not a cop an outsider to raise a red flag over a pair of boot prints would make her look green to say the least she picked up the phone and dialed when lamoias recorded voice spoke she nearly talked over it you said it i didnt so leave it and dont sweat it ill get back to you beep she spoke his name reconsidered and hung up a minute later her phone rang the callerid returned out of area her hand hesitated over the cradle and she caught herself terrified to answer then her brain engagedshe would not allow anyone to do this to her she answered you rang lamoia cool calm collected she resented that tone of his i got your machine she said i screen he said callerid caught your name and number you ought to be blocked you know she scribbled out a note to herself got that right whats up she hesitated his calm making her not want to sound like a schoolgirl he said not to be rude but im not exactly on your speed dialer its going on one oclock in the morning the late late news is rolling around in a couple minutes the weekend coming up or not i picture you as an earlytobed earlytorise kind of person beauty sleep and all that not that you need it and so then i get to thinking that maybe youre checking up on me making sure i havent succumbed to the great temptation and i want you to know i wouldnt do that john she interrupted not ever you know that what we didlou and iwe did out of friendship it started and stopped in your kitchen that night im not the percodan police dont think like that what am i supposed to think help me out here doc whyd you call if not to check up on me she stuttered and said to to check up on the lab work of neals at twelvethirty at twelvethirty yes a skeptical hesitation on his part okay what do we know she asked nothing yet he suggested clearly intrigued its a little soon dont you think she couldnt bring herself to sound like a whiner she overheard detectives mocking such women all the time women on and off the force she told herself that if shed actually seen someone out there with her own eyes if she could have supplied a description anything at all worth investigating then yes she would have included him he asked you wouldnt happen to be lonely would you back to his old self i beg your pardon if she told him now this far into their conversation hed either overreact or laugh out loud she couldnt handle either reaction right now you sound i dont know a little off he said im fine she wanted to keep him talking to hear his voice you sure i could rent a video something like that theres a twentyfourhour blockbuster over on denny you got any popcorn lamoia offering friendship maybe she was the one on drugs it wasnt a social call we could make it one no thanks she said though surprisingly reluctantly the offer didnt sound bad at all youre right about my hours how about a rain check she felt touched that the usually selfish lamoia could be so giving of himself ulterior motives how badly did he want her at the hotel interview whatever he said thanks john she felt an obligation to hang up but at the same time didnt want to she left a pregnant pause on the line so are we done here or you got a minute lamoia tested she liked the sound of his voice ive got a minute she said casually trying to sound nonchalant and wondering if shed pulled it off he said a businesswoman name of oblitz the one that filed a complaint and then tried to withdraw it the one i left a message about who tries to withdraw a complaint yeah i know i tried to explain that to her stenolovski before me i thought you might tell me why a woman reports a peeper and then tries to back out of it thats a nobrainer she had a guest or shes being extorted maybe but more likely her friend pressured her to withdraw the complaint or they got there together yeah well its set up for four on monday the wthe suspender set the new one across from the olympic he said sarcastically she made an opening for me in her busy schedule good of her well crack hebringer and randolf wide open with this you and me i can feel it whadda you think hill would make of that sheila hill their captain boldts immediate superior had been lamoias former lover a fact that matthews was not supposed to be aware of but there wasnt much she and boldt hid from each other they had once been lovers themselvessomething no one was supposed to know and no one did no one would believe it she and lamoia were known to tangle fuck em if they cant take a joke hearing his voice brought her a long way out of herself she wanted to thank him for that but held her tongue he asked you sure youre okay offer of the video still stands a lamoia she didnt know and frankly didnt trust had he run out of women in the department to conquer had someone in the locker room put him up to this challenged him to go after her because she had steadfastly refused to date anyone on the job she didnt count boldt as a date and never would nearly one in the morning and lamoia making like it was early evening night tour did that to people ill do the interview with you she agreed well thats a start by the time she hung up she had almost forgotten about the pair of boot prints two peas in a pod the ws splitlevel lobby featured twin stairways that led around an island bearing a flower vase and up to the black lacquer reception desk where young people in black clothing and wearing wireless headsets greeted guests with white teeth and tones of waytoocooltogetexcited the halogen lights were set so low that these receptionists seemed to emerge from the haze hiphop pounded from speakers in the ceiling lamoia territory to be sure he had the appropriate sarcasm and cynicism down pat yo yuppie puppy he said to the male receptionist flashing his badge against the request of his interviewee april fools is tomorrow this is the real thing he drew a blank expression from the kid with the wetlook hair and the silver stud in his left ear the kid wanted him to think he saw such shields all the time but clearly he did not hotel guest oblitz shes expecting us the black arm percent cashmerepointed theres a house phone to your did i ask for a house phone that headset must do something right hotel guest oblitz he barely hesitated now crisp his voice echoing off the stone a few heads in the lobby lifted and turned the kid moved his mouth like a beached fish matthews spoke into lamoias ear such bedside manner dont criticize what you havent sampled you really are shameless is the whole world a fire hydrant to you john he flashed her a look that ended it a guys gotta make his mark from a distance she saw the figure of a man enter the hotel look up toward the registration desk and then leave as quickly as hed come the wrong address the wrong hotel she wondered or had that been the man in the boots outside her mudroom window the night before had those boots even been outside her window the night before she wore her paranoia tightly around the neck room nineeleven the rigid receptionist said in his best iwanttosoundolder voice matthews returned to the job at hand room nineoneone lamoia repeated cocking his head to matthews he said how perfect is that she said the word youre looking for is ironic elevators to your right the manchild wanted them gone chill lamoia barked keeping the kid attentive matthews explained first wed like a look at your registration log for the past three months lamoia added and the corresponding billing charges tina oblitz had the gray power suit going a shimmering metallic silver blouse string of freshwater pearls silver tourneau black pumps narrow dark eyes that preoccupied themselves with matthews to the left of the desk phone lay a sweet little mm semiautomatic clipped into a black leather holster designed to be worn in the small of the back the holster was weathered and sweatstained indicating years of wear the obligatory laptop mobile phone and pocket pc sat atop the black enamel desk plain sight she said noticing lamoias attention on the handgun i didnt want any surprises permits in my purse if you want to see it glock glock seventeen she answered hed heard of the model but never seen one weight light as a feather polymer grip magazine holds ten used to be seventeen but it was heavier of course this is not a recent addition to your wardrobe he said did i panic when this peeping tom showed up and then run out and buy a gun i dont think so detective i believe in a womans right to defend herself in seven years no shots fired but it has served its purpose a couple times its never more than a few feet away from me lucky it he snapped im at the firing range once a week you both know what im talking about its sergeant not detective and its lieutenant matthews he corrected my mistake no he corrected his contempt for the executive set obvious your mistake was trying to cancel this harassment complaint you filed why the backpedal you want a seat she asked id like an answer he said lamoia turned to matthews you want a seat matthews shook her head declining he looked back at oblitz no well stand tina oblitz took a corner of the small couch withdrew a cigarette from a fancy holder that lay on the glass table lit up and hogged down that smoke like an addict whod been away from it for years her body consumed it when she exhaled hardly anything came out she looked satisfied like a boozer after a stiff drink she said the other detective and i we discussed this the complaint is still on file ms oblitz and seeing as how weve got an active case that could use a lift your cooperation would be appreciated he said i explained this over the phone i believe you know thats why were here i never agreed to two of you matthews said the department requires a woman officer be present in any interview or interrogation involving a female as she said this as she looked at this woman something nagged at her and then danced out of her thoughts as oblitz spoke youre the chaperone oblitz asked sarcastically hope you dont mind my saying so but you dont look the part i dont mind matthews said unflinchingly it took a lot to intimidate the graysuit set she asked have we met before are you sure you wont sit down the ember of the cigarette went nearly white with the next inhale whatever it was it nagged at matthews again as elusive and annoying as a mosquito in the dark lamoia said we believe your attempt to withdraw the complaint may have arisen out of your being compromised lamoia said or that an attempt was made to compromise you oblitz wore a lot of makeup but where her real skin showed it turned paler is that so she said matthews said voyeurism escalates to rape rape can escalate to homicide weve lost two women alreadythey went missing from downtown how many more until you decide to cooperate shit lamoia reminded i mentioned that over the phone that we had ourselves a situation were not the tabloids matthews said contrary to what you might believe not every piece of information leaks from a police department lamoia said its only the big stuff and believe it or not your sex life doesnt register anywhere on that richter scale shit shit shit lamoia asked do you remember anything about it what he looked like where he was at the time how he might have singled you out no it completely slipped my mind they both took the sarcasm as the first step toward open communication youre married matthews had noticed the showy rings but oblitz apparently felt obliged to display them for her anyway you were with a partner other than your husband you know oblitz snapped youre going places lieutenant sharp as a tack you are matthews contained her anger well mr george ramirez paid the hotel incidentals including three roomservice charges and an allday adult film pass lamoia answered her puzzled and pained expression you know what they say the titles dont show on your bill dont believe it an order number does sweet valley thigh ms oblitz your manfriend talked you into attempting to withdraw the complaint you filed with us for all we know he talked you into all sorts of things including the warm chocolate and the whipped creamroomservice order number three at fourseventeen pm your business we could care less but that peeper is our business and well ride you ms oblitz until we come away with whatever you can tell us about it two peas in a pod oblitz picked up her cigarette lighter and flicked it so that the flame burned she held it out between her and lamoia peering through its yellow glare she placed the lighter back down somewhere in the process another cigarette lit smoked spiraled were not looking to indict you for your sexual preferences or practices matthews said were here because we believe you can aid our investigation that your experience may be directly connected to at least one of the women whove gone missing sometimes it took voicing the words airing her thoughts her spine tingled and the hair on the nape of her neck stood on end change the hair color and tina oblitz looked a lot like susan hebringer too much like her to be coincidence boldt would have said matthews told the woman you wear a scarf on your head or a hat when you go out she clarified a dark scarf a sideways glance of disbelief now just how the hell would you know that may i see you with it on lamoia gave matthews this leeway though he clearly didnt understand the request oblitz grunted a complaint retrieved the scarf and tied it over her head my hair doesnt hold up under your constant rain she complained not without spray and i hate that look do you see it matthews asked lamoia who continued to look confused the resemblance she completed hebringer he whispered more of a gasp how could we have missed that we didnt miss it matthews said it just took us awhile to see it oblitz looked on her head tracking them comically like a spectator at a tennis match she stood by the couch cigarette flaring focused on matthews what do i do she asked to help tell us about your day lamoia said the runup to your spotting the peeper its been awhile oblitz said whatever you remember matthews suggested a newfound kindness in her voice oblitz settled back into the couch still wearing the scarf i had a few extra hours she recalled i hit the museum the annie leibovitz show some of your tourist stuff lamoia shot a glance toward matthews his normally dull chocolate eyes were alive with excitement they hurried down the dimly lit hotel corridor toward the elevators when matthews steered them to the fire door and the stairs lamoia had just been notified that the preliminary lab report on lanny neals car had come through and both were eager to learn the results it doesnt make our job any easier nor does it make me feel adequate in predicting him she held the door for lamoia our job lamoia said stopping only inches from her i like the sound of that dont get all mushy about it she held her ground not allowing him to intimidate her with this closeness her back to the cold metal door the two of them nearly chest to chest she said construction sites tourist traps i dont see hebringer and randolf fitting into that both being locals both living downtown but i suppose we start there because it was handed to us we work well together he said leave it alone would you no he headed through the door then and down the first flight of stairs matthews hesitated for a second regaining her composure controlling herself his voice echoed up the concrete stairway chocolate and whipped creamever tried it in your dreams you got that right he said his shoes slapping faster and more loudly as he continued his hurried descent chumming matthews stood in the parking lot by her honda awaiting walker as he punched out at a small shack at the foot of one of the fishing docks the air pungent with saltwater the wind heavy with a cold mist she squinted against the blow taking in the damp and the beauty of the shipping canal and the greenish gray hill rising toward the blinking radio towers american flags hung everywhere even in the rain a boy rode his bike a mangy dog running to keep up the sound of rubber tires running on wet roadway had become so familiar to her that the scenery did not exist without it the same way downtown demanded the low cry of the ferry horns bellowing out into elliott bay this great city was fungal smells and mystical sounds dreary skies and paper cups of steaming coffee it was rubber boots and rain slickers a place pedestrians waited at cross lights the trawlers had serviced these same docks for more than a hundred years matthews could hear the clipclop of horses hooves on cobblestone she could hear the fishmongers shouting out prices as little blondhaired boys carried fillets wrapped in newsprint over to welldressed house servants and cooks you need my help again dont you walker called out to her across the blacktop some questions is all she said loudly as he was still some distance away he wore an old pair of running shoes not wafflesoled boots as shed expected this discovery bothered her for it still left the person responsible for the prints outside her mudroom window in doubt how bout that drink he said catching up to her he wore the same clothes shed seen him in before wet at the knees caked with mud on the lower leg they did not appear to have been washed i dont want you calling me anymore mr walker she added any further attempts to make contact on your part will be considered harassment do you understand thats the thanks i get he cocked his head what youre teasing right you want more stuff is that it something you need done im sorry for your loss she said she saw confusion register on his face if you find it difficult to get over the grief there are programs counselors i can what the fuck counselors you want me off your case then you were closer to an arrest in this case she said cutting him off this hit him like a slap in the face some spittle bubbled at the corner of his lips you need me he whispered i can help you i need you to stay out of this your involvement could compromise our efforts mr walker that sweatshirt that compromised your efforts i suppose hed caught her and the slight hesitation on her part cost her though she salvaged the moment by turning it to her advantage okay ill admit it there is something you can do to help us out i knew it he said deliberately a quiz show contestant confident his answer had been right all along i need to see your drivers license and i need to confirm your residence nextofkin paperwork she explained although this wasnt the real reason behind her query i dont own a car and i dont have a license because i let it expire but you probably know that already right i mean whats the point he indicated the docks behind him i bus up here i bus back into the city homes a hole in the ground a place out of the rain ive got a tarp a box of some stuff thats home thats what fucking lanny neal left me with when he took maryann off the boat he stepped toward her another wave of anger gripping his eyes another pulse of nausea seeping into her why ask questions you already know the answer to are you toying with me i was under the impression youd driven lanny neals toyota corolla she lied she went fishing with the fisherman it wasnt an impression but a suspicion that resulted from the lab work on the car your sisters birthday dinner a couple months back thats bullshit neal drove this was her first confirmation that neal had been telling the truth about that particular night it was also the first shed learned that walker had been along for the celebrationhis sisters idea no doubt she couldnt see neal inviting him he got locked out of the car is that correct the guys a numb nuts ive been telling you that did maryann hurt herself that night hurt herself how i was hoping you could tell me he beat on her all the time if thats what youre asking im asking if you witnessed any violence between the two in neals car that night again walker cocked his head i get it he said nodding slowly sure he did damn right he did mr walker it does no one any goodleast of all maryannif you fabricate your responses if you lie to me sure i can see that he said still with an almost whimsical beguiling expression but im not lying am i lieutenant i did see him he did hit her that night knocked her around you risk invalidating everything weve ever gotten or will get from you if youre caught in a lie you understand that mr walker that includes the sweatshirt what do you want from me daphne am i allowed to call you that this was a device she used on suspectsestablishing rapport through use of a given name having this reversed on her ran chills up her armsthe sleightofhand magician whos caught in the act i want the truth i want some answers thats all ill tell you anything you want me to tell you youve just got to let me know it doesnt work like that lanny neals still walking the streets so dont tell me about it working its not working i can help with that daphne me and you we can team up here we can get stuff done you know what im saying it does not work like that it works however we make it work i have a kit in my car she announced its a fingerprint kit real simple takes about five minutes you dont even have to clean up there are forms to fill outconsent forms whats this about it takes us another step closer to neal thats what you want right she asked of course thats what i want so well roll out some prints and help move this forward if its all right with you she hadnt wanted lamoia along for this reasontwo cops wanting prints would have put even an eager beaver like walker on notice he stared at her until she finally met eyes with hima concession of sorts theres so much i can do for you she struggled with a response well start with the prints and take it from there if thats okay with you five minutes later walker was rolling his right index finger into a box on a wsdoj card he sat in the front seat of her car out of the mist and the rain her cell phone and starbucks tea between them npr played from the radio she turned it down and then cracked a window to vent the smell coming off him howd you know he locked himself out of the car walker asked he tell you he was that stupid he tell you i coulda had him in that car and the engine running in about three minutes flat let me tell you somethingyou work on boats long enough you can do anything any kind of mechanical electrical repair whatever kind of problem there is numb nuts didnt have a clue all stressed out over losing his keys fuck me guys like that ought to be taken out back and shot she set him up to roll prints from his left hand the ink pad was colorless though he left a fingerprint on the card this is all about the car isnt it walker asked fidgeting you started by asking about the car maryann drove his car i can help you with this stuff were solid on this right you and me there is no you and me matthews said i meant what i said about no more contact sure you did no drink no coffee no contact right mr walker he directed himself to matthews then turning to face her in a deliberate overly dramatic way i can help you he declared popping open the door and slipping outside a chill damp wind took his place beside her as he leaned back inside the car a darkness overcame his face and she thought that this was a side of the man she had not yet seen do your job he said or ill do it for you nothing ventured nothing gained matthews attempted to keep up with john lamoia whose long strides carried him quickly across the sky bridge leading from the king county corrections facility where lanny neal had been held for the weekend traffic ran some fifty feet below them the vibrations of the sky bridge reminding her why she never liked taking this route she preferred a good old sidewalk im just saying there may be inconsistencies worth taking a look at she told him its an arraignment thats all were up against the time limit it has to be now he pleads not guilty on with the show the inconsistencies can wait until the probable cause hearing i dont think they can well keep that thought to yourself if you dont mind id like to review it all with lou hes not interested i think he will be riddle me this lamoia said if not the boyfriend then who the brother he didnt allow her to answer cutting her off youre the one saying the brother failed to give you the signals youd expect youre the one saying neal had motive opportunity and a predisposition toward abuse pardon me if im stepping on your psychological toes here but we saw the brother bust his bubble and vent his steam the guy went after neal with a knife a knife is a weapon of passion a brother doing a sister is most likely a crime of passion so why didnt he fillet her if he blew his stack whyd he toss her off lanny neals fire escape and run her over using lanny neals car and leave her sweatshirt behind lanny neals garbage bin does that kind of planning fit with what we know about ferrell walkers personality im not against the idea of neal she said calmly and yet determined to have her point heard i would just like to see the proper paperwork the proper order to things this is rushed its an arraignment were fine trust me they dodged a couple of young lawyers who worked for the state lamoia took matthews by the elbow and guided her to the wall dont do this okay dont muddy the water you want to turn in your psych evaluation fine evaluate and write it up you and i are on to better things with oblitz her and hebringer looking alike i can taste it he leaned into her now so closely that she couldnt hold focus on his face ive got guys watching construction sites guys patrolling the tourist traps were running backgrounds on all hotel employees from maintenance to the bellhops something somewhere is going to break the sarge is all over this water main break and some chinaman who cashed it in down there but im thinking we beat him to it and deliver him the prize and i dont need fucking lanny neal on my plate right now okay the shit heap backed his car over his girlfriend he stuffed her into the backseat and then launched her from the aurora bridge sid can prove most of that does it bother me that sid didnt do as well in his apartment theres nothing that can hurt us were either of us expecting a smoking gun not me maybe i was holding out a little hope for blood evidence but thats all right hes our guy lamoia held up a manila envelope and i have it on the authority of the uws oceanography department that hes a lying sack of shit when it comes to seeing her out on that fire escape with two twentytwo flashing on his clock according to this maryann did her swan dive before midnight otherwise the tide carries her toward the locks they back it up with tidal charts computer printoutsthe works hes caught in a lie and that makes him good for it as far as im concerned this latest information was news to matthews her impression had come from the gutfrom watching neals reactions as they had questioned him he wasnt what she expected of a guilty party and though she knew she couldnt take that to the bank arraignment would start a countdown to a probable cause hearing theyd have anywhere from one to ten days to make their caseand for her sake as well as lamoias she wanted to be sure that case stuck if neal skipped on a technicality she worried where that would send ferrell walker in the courtroom thirty minutes later matthews and lamoia sat among the pimps prostitutes and drug addicts awaiting neals threeminute arraignment spanish and asian translators stood just behind the appointed public defenders doing their best to keep the suspect apprised of the rapid exchange and instant negotiations between the bench and the bar after a half hour of this it seemed more like assemblyline justice than the real thing as an expert in her field matthews had spent a good deal of time in the witness chair but attending a district court arraignment soured her mood just prior to neals entrance into the courtroom matthews felt the hair on the nape of her neck stand rigid and she intuitively turned around to examine the myriad faces in the crowded courtroom lamoia turned as well and so typically of him spotted walker first there he said without pointing back row far left as matthews met eyes with the forlorn brother he hoisted a brown paper sack into view and gestured that hed brought it for her this is not good she said to lamoia you want me to handle it for you happy to do it he has every right to be here i warned him i wanted no more contact with him if you dont mind i think youre handling it might make it seem more official to him what are you not telling me he asked perceptive as always i held off because i didnt know the best way to handle it at this point id like to talk to you and lou about it what i should do the latenight call lamoia asked she answered him with a saddened expression youre shitting me some phone calls he may have followed me to my place i dont know she explained finding the boot prints outside her window matthews dont okay ill rip him up and use him for chum lamoia stood but at this same instant neals name was announced by the bailiff and the man was led into the courtroom by a uniformed officer matthews tugged lamoia back down into his seat lanny neal pleaded not guilty expressed remorse for the loss of maryann and was offered bail of fifty thousand dollars an astonishingly low amount given the charges with a bail bondsman hed walk for five thousand putting his car up for collateral the wheels of justice rotated and less than five minutes after he first appeared in the courtroom lanny neal left under escort essentially a free man there would be a probable cause hearing set and much later a court date all the while lanny neal was likely to remain free on bail matthews knew the importance of cooling down ferrell walker in order to avoid a jack ruby moment touching lamoias arm she said lets talk to him together lamoia glanced down at her fingers resting on his forearm and she jerked them quickly away they pushed past the waiting suspects and the exhausted defenders finally reaching the aisle lamoia called out to walker and stopped him at the door to the courtroom the three moved as a group out and into the wide hallway outside the courtroom where wooden benches offered family and friends rest for weary legs heads hung desperate voices exchanged overworked cliches in worried whispersit isnt fair he didnt do it the uniformed guards bored with hearing such claims looked straight ahead in a stony silence lamoia moved them over to the water fountain where a noisy compressor would help cover their conversation he walked ferrell walker said with some heat in his voice its only an arraignment they let him go lamoia said they let him make bail that surprised us too but its not unheard of believe me neal is going away for your sister walker made no indication hed heard lamoia his full concentration was on matthews she experienced his attention as nothing short of worship an intense adoration that felt invasive and a little sickening i told you wed handle it from here she said i told you you needed my help he contradicted holding up the same paper sack he had indicated earlier lunch lamoia said matthews and walker locked into a stare that excluded all else she understood then that this was the moment walker would cross the line from love to hate and that she would be the one who pushed him over that line and that she had no choice in the matter this inevitability frustrated her tightened her voice and shortened her breath walker was in fact doing this to himself she was nothing but a proxy required to deliver the crushing blow to separate them she said i dont want or need your help not now not in the future were all done here his dark eyes flared behind his resentment he dropped the sack at her feet though it seemed to float in its descent well see about that walker said he glanced up at lamoia for the first time acknowledging him though in a roundabout way you should have stayed out of this he turned and walked away quickly lost in the crush of the countys judicial process shit lamoia said matthews picked up the paper sack she opened it looked in and asked for a pen from lamoia she then stirred through the contents a wristwatch a pack of cigarettes a butane lighter a womans wallet with what appeared to be a speeding ticket clapped in its leather jaws what do you want to bet he broke into neals apartment and confiscated this stuff she said if he did he just screwed us he thought he was helping thats the sad part if its from neals apartment itll invalidate it as evidence if its evidence im aware of that john this shit wont do we gotta do something i think i just did it she said regretting the tone shed taken with walker and wondering at the consequences a wallet and a watch knock knock come in boldt said when he saw it was matthews he said hello there its been awhile have a seat matthews wondered where his compliments had gone boldt had always had something nice to say to her little observations that had always made her day they werent there anymore and she missed them he said john told me about the guy outside your window he shouldnt have it was shoe prints is all ive asked sid to take a look better late than never before she could protest he explained on the off chance its related to our hotel peeper its not theyre over there now does anyone ever ask around here we have a photo of a waffle pattern from the construction sitethe voyeur watching the hotel maybe we can match them you wont i have two candidates of my own she said suspects she shook her head listen it could have been a handyman i had my screens put on a couple weeks ago that was optimistic of you still feels like winter to me the prints are not connected to hebringer and randolf lou id rather an educated decision on that be made a group decision okay with you youre not yourself he pushed back the office chair and studied her you know after about a hundred people telling me that im tired of hearing it yes even from you id suggest you hand off hebringer but i know you better yes you do so drop it he apologized im sorry you didnt deserve that something else is bugging me the city worker drowning the emts tell me theres a section of the underground there still intact the city wont let me down the sinkhole because its too dangerous can you believe that someone tell that to susan hebringer so im exploring the possibility of an alternate access theres a woman at the u a dr babcock looking into it he added so are you going to tell me who your suspects are or is your plan to try to distract me she never got much past him she wasnt even sure why she tried the floater maryann walker right he knew the case she has a younger brother thats number one there may be a little transference going on he seems to think hes watson to my holmes lovely the other possibility is nathan prair again he was on the bridge the night we investigated sheriffs office is involveddont ask me how hes his same old creepy self and i think theres a chance he was watching me or at least keeping an eye out for me over at the shelter you want me to talk to him bring him in a personality like his no thanks but no thanks guys like prair they live with expectation bringing him in wed add fuel to the fire and at that point hed have to prove to himself to me to everyone involved how right he was about the perfect match he and i would make ive been through this before with him the best approach is to give it distance and thats it a list of two we can handle that thats the short list she said the long list includes every con ive ever helped put away whos now out on parole it might have to include langford neal as wellthe boyfriend weve charged with running over maryann and then tossing her off that bridge hes a controlling personality has a history of abuse im a woman whos making decisions about his future and thats bound to sit wrong i can see him getting curious about me and that can lead to some ugly behavior im not liking where this is headed he said that makes two of us so lets do something about it its a passive crime lou that complicates matters walker leaves me phone messages that turn my stomach prair shows up in parking garages and then disappears ive got some mud and dirt outside a window what charges do we file and how much do i want to discourage walker given that he just supplied us with evidence we otherwise might not have found what evidence some of his sisters personal effects her wallet a watch and a pack of cigarettes theres some paperwork in the wallet including what appears to be a traffic citation we left it all off with bernie before we dug into it hell process it for latents and hairs and fibers and then give us a look if the brother is compromising evidence then thats obstruction you want him locked up well lock him up john wants to question him sure but i may have scared him off earlier i was pretty tough on him i had him roll some prints my guess he wont be showing up at work for a couple days the other thing is we dont know where he got this evidence at first john was furious and rightly so but then we thought it through if neal had this stuff hidden if walker found this stuff hidden rather than in plain sightit actually could help us build a case thats playing with fire and we both know it daffy you dont want to get in the middle of this im already in the middle what id like is to get to one side to let john be the center of this guys attention that takes a little manipulation with personalities like this it cant be done all at once boldt put down the pen and removed his reading glasses a depth to his eyes drew her in so much going on in there so how can i help he asked mersido and mersidont lamoia said entering boldts office without knocking he hooked a chair with his boot spun it around to face them and plopped down into it were discussing daphnes being harassed possibly stalked boldt said hands in the air lamoia quipped it wasnt me and flashed another trademark smile my recommendation is that heiman and i kneecap walker and thats the end of it he slides around the sidewalks on one of those little dollies for the next ten years teach him to mess with our family matthews chuckled nervously id prefer we play a little more inbounds than that suit yourself save the taxpayers a wad looking at matthews he said and i gotta tell you its one job id put my heart and soul into he was openly flirting with her and she wondered why that surfaced in front of boldt of all people she wasnt sure if she should share this or not but if boldt found out later that shed withheld it there would be hell to pay he made an indirect reference to hebringer and randolf boldt stiffened such as it was one of the phone messages he said it was dangerous out there that i didnt have to worry about that with him then i want you out of your houseboat youll take a hotel room courtesy of the department until weve had a chance to follow up thats unnecessary she had feared an overreaction boldt reminded you found boot prints outside your window whatever the situation i want you off of that houseboat to lamoia with walker mentioning the disappearances i want him brought in for questioning youre reaching lou and we both know that listen phoners rarely stalk stalkers rarely phone two different patterns two different personalities and im thinking two different people walker and prair boldt repeated but you dont know that whoa there said lamoia when did prair get into this matthews explained most of her encounter at the parking garagethat a witness had seen a man in a khaki or brown uniform she added an infatuation like prairs is harmless its just annoying honestly im more concerned about walkers overeagerness to please but connecting him to the disappearances thats unworthy of you he made that connection for us boldt said its a daily news item lou the whole citys talking about hebringer and randolf come on lamoia attempted to break the tension between them nathan prair is not harmless he said just ask that motorist he iced boldt spoke up quickly he was acquitted of that john it was found to be a good shooting it was never a good shooting and the three of us damn well know it lamoia said an uncomfortable silence overtook them lamoia moved restlessly in the chair im with sarge he said the houseboat is too dangerous for you right now ill clean out my guest room youll stay with me until we make sense of this matthews barked out her reaction glancing at boldt who grinned talk about the wolf in sheeps clothing lamoia was not beyond laughing at himself im not going to hit on you youboth of youdid me a favor awhile back im returning it thats all yeah right matthews said her beeper sounded from inside her purse silencing all three hesitation and expectation hung in the air if lamoias or boldts pager went off within the next few seconds then typically it meant a major crime all three held their breath as matthews inspected the device the possibility of another hebringer or randolf on everyones minds her shoulders relaxed the shelter she said dont worry i know what its about consider the offer lamoia said she looked up at boldt anticipating another moment of shared amusement instead boldt said in all seriousness consider the offer or pick a hotel you are not going back to that houseboat silhouettes a sense of relief washed through matthews as she spotted margaret across the cavernous basement room the pregnant girl had returned to the same cot these cots were as close as it got to something they could call home she wanted to thank sheila for paging her but it would have to wait margarets eyes had sunk deeper into their sockets as if the skin on her face were shrinking her hair was both tangled and flattened and oily she caught matthews studying her rough day at the office the girl said reacting to that stare may i matthews indicated the opposing bed youre wasting your time its mine to waste matthews said closing her eyes appeared difficult for margaret as if she might be in pain are you feeling okay have you ever been pregnant no matthews said but id like to be sometime dont be so sure it sucks i feel sick most of the time unless im high when im high its not so bad when youre high matthews said your babys high too lucky her him whatever you going to preach to me cause if you are maybe we could do this another time sobriety was a requirement at the shelter but its definition remained unclear most of the girls arrived high anyone caught using while in residence was first counseled and consultedusually involving matthewsbut was kicked out on the second offense repeated violation of the rules won a girl a thirtyday ban from the premises as a rule the staff tried to limit the proselytizing some of the christian centers suffered for their evangelizingthe girls didnt want to hear that jesus or anything else could save them nothing had saved them so far no not going to preach matthews said she tried to sound relaxed as she thought about health problems for the mother and neurological and other damage to the fetus i didnt ask for this baby its beyond that now like it or not i knew you were the preachy type you got that look you know sister teresa she rolled her head facing away on the pillow please go away i got a headache and ive got a hole in my stomach margaret this isnt about just you anymore you cant ignore that baby what about your grandparents forget them would you theres a place south of safeco once ive got a place its gonna work out id think twice about staying here in the city youre underage there are people who prey on girls like you margaret theyll have you dealing for them youll get arrested call your grandparentstheyre your chance out of here you know them real good do you the baby will be born addicted how fair is that fair she placed a hand on her swollen belly are you getting enough food the baby needs nutrition pizza crust you might say im eating italian what if we called them together id be willing to do that you dont get it do you maybe not theyll tell hermy mother shes their daughter after all theyre gonna tell her and shell tell him because shes a pathetic weak woman and thats just what she does and its his babyyou understand that right his baby her boyfriends baby and hell either kill me or keep sleeping with me making me do things you understand that right i am not going back there forget it so well think of something else will we really matthews saw a possible solutionjail time a womens juvie facility would offer health care for mother and baby the irony didnt escape her as a cop she couldnt recommend to margaret that she get herself arrested youre good here for another few nights it gives us time to think about this just forget it would you im here for the food the shower and the bed not for you not for counseling i like it up there i have friends up there theyre like family if you use your baby ends up addicted i got that the first time matthews took the girls arm and turned it to make sure her own phone number was still inked there she reminded the girl that cop or not she would never be a cop if margaret called margaret said yeah yeah matthews crossed the room discouraged she thanked sheila for the headsup but didnt get into particulars for all her problems margaret was in relatively good shape by shelter standards she fixed a weak cup of tea and sat alone in the corner trying to sort out options the tea bag leaked onto the table once she removed it she drew patterns with the discharge stretching it like a river across the plastic veneer she finished the tea still stuck on talking margaret into getting herself arrested the rain had started and stopped again by the time she left she crossed the churchs fairly well lit parking lot arrived at the honda key in hand and climbed in she couldnt help reminding herself of her most recent visit and her spotting the man up in the parking garage and though she fought the urge to do so she took a moment to check the garage again seeing no one up there she told herself to forget about it but found it easier said than done rushhour traffic jammed the downtown streets and understanding that at best it was the lesser of two evils she elected to try aurora willing to suffer the five oclock creep for the lack of lights and the ability to circumvent downtown she left the church parking lot traffic flow was indeed like blood in a clogged artery it took her ten minutes to make three lights when she finally managed a left she checked her side mirror for any cyclists or other yahoos trying to cut the corner on her and she spotted a light rack that was at once both familiar and unfamiliar it wasnt an spd patrol car she knew that much it might have been sfd except the fire guys used red not blue lights in their rooftop racks the blue lights indicated police or sheriffs office she blamed her reaction on the fact that theyd just been talking about prair less than an hour earlier putting the man solidly in her thoughts sight of that light rack spiked both fear and anger in her was nathan prair following her around town following her home watching her from parking garages had it been prair outside of her mudroom window and if so how much of her had he seen it added up now that it seemed so obvious to her as a law enforcement officer her home phone and address went unpublished but it was well within the pale that a king county deputy sheriff could obtain that information walker was unlikely to know the location of her houseboat prair could get it with a phone call she waited at the intersection behind a flurry of angry horns and as the light turned yellow quickly took the left turn trapping those behind her with the red light asking lamoia to come out into this mess of traffic at first seemed unthinkable yet thats just what she did she would execute some evasive tactics and eventually find her way homehopefully with lamoia close behind looking for anyone following her yo he answered its me hey you listen it may be nothing and im keeping my eyes peeled but i have half a notion that prair is with me in traffic and i wondered if you could use your connections over there to see if he happens to be on duty at the moment and if so if they know his tentwenty traffics bad and its getting dark im heading down toward safeco i thought id loop it oncegive it four right turns in a row you know do it and then put yourself in a holding patternmake it a couple lapsi can be there in a matter of minutes sweet of you but its a mess out here im going to go get some of my things at my place and then take lou up on the offer of a hotel he suggested the paramount if you want to meet me there i wouldnt complain id rather catch up to you now catch prair in the act theres no law about driving around the city listen i can make these calls from the car keep orbiting safeco ill be there in five minutes he hung up she felt incredible relief hed done as she hoped but not as she asked proving that he was predictable in an unpredictable way a half mile later the relief gave way to panic as she reached safeco field and the honda unexpectedly sputtered and died knock knock whos there as her car drifted to the side of the road matthews cursed herself for choosing such a remote part of town in all of seattle you couldnt buy yourself an empty street at this time of day except around a sports stadium that wasnt in use a curtain of rain fell all of a sudden its impact deafening she reached for the handle but then locked her door reminding herself to stay inside its me she said when lamoia answered her call less than a minute later whats your tentwenty im jammed traffic is a bitch and just for your information mr ihaventgotaprair came on duty with the night shift hes believed to be on bus duty downtown my guys checking all that but heres the humdinger he paused you ready for the humdinger she didnt think she was she wanted to explain her car had died and get some help on the way but before she could tell him he continued right on the citation the speeding ticket walker slipped you at the courthouse his sisters speeding ticketmaryann walker that citation was written up by none other than deputy sheriff nathan prair her world folded in on her like the legs of a card table collapsing she felt trapped pinned down she blurted out the honda died im dead in the water over by safeco field died how sputtered and quit i coasted to the side of the road gas he said i dont like it well it isnt my dream vacation either she said a little testy you could have been sandbagged matthews you sit tight do i have a choice the phone went silent and she dropped it into her lap she had hoped he wouldnt disconnect the call the sound of his voice so reassuring but she hadnt been about to ask him to stay on the line prair had known maryann walker ahead of her death that made her feel terribly vulnerable at that moment of realization a car pulled up behind her headlights shining in her rearview mirrors like spotlights her eyes burning she strained to identify it as lamoia then quickly realized it wasnt her purse lay on the floor to her right it contained her defense arsenal she stretched for it and as she did she turned the key the engine grinding along with the rush of blood at her ears she caught the strap and sat back up in her outside mirror she saw a mans dark silhouette approaching and was reminded once again of the parking garage she warned herself not to overreact spotting her own sudden weaknesses she dragged the purse across her lap and was reaching inside when she jerked her hand out with a start as bare knuckles rapped loudly on the window glass help you male deep voice the rain obscured a decent view of him swish swoosh the rubber blades did the only dance they knew rain coming down hard now like pebbles cast into a pond knock knock again can i give you a hand stronghis voice told her that much she didnt want to look at him because she knew that eye contact empowered the attacker she silently begged for john to hurry up her fingers crept back into the purse though nervously this time as if she might get caught no thank you too softspoken she raised her voice no thank you all set she thought to add someones on the way im good with cars fixing them or breaking them she wondered im all set put it in neutral the deep voice instructed let me at least get you out of this lane it was in fact a lousy place to have come to a stop halfway across two lanes small tendrils of terror began in her crotch and rushed up through her no thank you how many times did she have to say that his rapping on the window bothered her she wanted him to go away stop it she bellowed she didnt mean to say that didnt mean to sound scared predators fed on such fear im trying to help came the male voice youre gonna get hit sticking out like this she cracked the window less than an inch just enough so there would be no mistaking her words or her tone id like you to leave now please lady im trying to help here go away now she used too urgent a tone too frantic she didnt want to give him that she rolled up the window and looked straight ahead lady shaking the car he pulled on the drivers door handle put the damn car in neutral and let me get you out of the road her right hand now inside her purse touched the butt end of the handgun her left hand joined her right and she chambered a round still out of sight he shouted youre going to get yourself hit sticking out like this a huge sound erupted all at once and she jumped she thought shed been rearended the good samaritans belt buckle pressed up to the window glass the fly to his pants at eye level she briefly considered firing her weapon at that target leave the lady alone asshole although she couldnt see her rescuer she recognized the voice as that of nathan prair and a trickle of dread ran through her which was the spider and which was the fly do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars this time it was lamoias wisecracking voice she heard unmistakable and welcome it must have been to prair he said youre a long way from home sailor you wait over there in her lap the mobile phones timer continued to count the seconds she had never disconnected the call lamoia had heard the entire exchange with the man whod stopped to help her words were traded out there tempers were flaring a metal clicking of handcuffs so familiar to any police officer lamoia informed the stranger the woman asked you to back off and leave her alone you refused which means youre under arrest for harassing a police officer the strangers astonished voice said a police officer you have the right to remain matthews threw her head back the dull offwhite of the ceiling fabric formed the sky above her the guns knurled grip warmed in her hand a throbbing pushed at her temples a membrane ready to explode prairs arriving on the scene had triggered a whole series of thoughts she caught sight of his flashing roof lights in her rearview mirror wondering when hed turned them on and why she hadnt seen them until then the sound of the rain and the three men arguing filled her ringing ears the rain shook the car prair had hidden that hed knownor at least had metmaryann walker prior to her murder why and what impact did it have on the case on daphne matthews unable to take the isolation she climbed out into the rain and glanced toward the side of the road from where nathan prair looked back at her out the side window of his cruiser the rivulets of rain cascaded down the gray glass looking like rows and rows of tears on his face prair stared at her as cold a look as she could recall had he read her thoughts her fear did he sense that they knew his dirty little secret she wanted the truthsuch a simple thing to ask so difficult to attain prair rolled down the window the tears disappeared i was trying to help he called out she nodded some rain came off her hair sparkling in the glare of lamoias headlights she said back to him ive been getting a lot of that lately if the shoe fits is this waiting really necessary an uncharacteristically impatient daphne matthews asked lamoia the two of them watching the detainee through the interrogation rooms oneway glass lamoia said you know the drill yes she did the waiting allowed the suspect time to comprehend the severity of the situation and police the time to collect as much information on the individual as possible but shed never waited out that time as a victim before and the resulting anxiety owned her what about prair she asked what about him you let him go let him go lamoia asked hes a cop who responded to a situation under normal circumstances hed be considered something of a hero for helping you hardly are we going to talk to him not formally he answered but the ticket his having known maryann she felt exasperated everything turned on its head we dont show that card until we can back it up with something itll send him so deeply underground well need to dig through five layers of lawyers to know what clothes hes wearing he lied to us not on the record he didnt hes a cop matthews however hes involved in this he knows exactly how were going to play it we do the dance or we lose himits as simple as that i want to pressure him she said tonight tomorrow as soon as we can i know the way this one thinks john if we squeeze him we stand the most to gain you going to pull rank on me is it going to come to that she asked the two studied each other lamoia said okay but hell talk his way out of it and we wont have squat im being impetuous youre reacting to a tough situation that wasnt easy out there youre lashing out at all available parties whos the psychologist and whos the detective she asked he nodded okay you want the detective your fuel line was crimped probably with a pair of pliers and maybe it was a rock that one of the tires kicked up shed overheard this preliminary report from the police garage she didnt want lamoia making it worse than it was his annoyance manifested itself as flaring nostrils and a worried brow lamoias level temper was one of his most valuable qualitiesshed heard that when he lost that temper things could get a little wild as a patrolman had once put it she had no desire to be the object of that display the guy we arrested wears clodhoppers with monster soles its entirely within the realm of possibility that this asshole frequents empty construction sites i can detain him on harassment charges at least until the t is back online and we know for sure whether he has a record or not where are we boldt asked from behind them she could read boldt by his tone of voice she heard concern they met eyes tenderly and with feeling she wanted to hug him studying her face he said knowing you you already think were wasting our time lamoia quipped andy sipowiczs got nothing on you sarge he was offering help she said now hes cooling off in the box like a street thug i wonder if thats the right way to handle it lamoia told boldt about the gas line boldt said to matthews well there you go adding listen youre not the first stalking victim to think weve got the wrong guy thats victim response oneohone he asked lamoia whats his pedigree gary hollie west seattle an accountant with something called cross ship llc lamoia held himself back a moment before saying i hate accountants a young patrolwoman approached at a brisk walk and delivered a coy grin to lamoia as well as the awaited computer printout matthews tried to ignore the womans open flirting never met her lamoia defended himself without looking up from the printout it was his prescience that disturbed her the most she didnt want him reading her thoughts lamoia said seems our mr hollie went down for illegal trespass in maryland less than two years ago that could be anything matthews said including a peeping charge dealt down lamoia said hes yours boldt told lamoia strategizing a game plan im a presence thats all you take the chair i want to pace got it lamoia said already at the interrogation room door he looked back at matthews you see something you dont like give us a knock or a buzz a gracious offer but also a little patronizing what if i dont like any of it she called out lamoia motioned boldt through first age before beauty he said gary hollies oversized head was reminiscent of a jacko lantern and had nearly as much hair he wore a neatly trimmed black mustache above pursed lips that struggled to contain a simmering anger forest green chinos a white buttondown shirt and the thicksoled office shoes completed the look if they ended up pressing charges they would have a good look at the waffle pattern of those shoes lamoia introduced boldt as the guy who runs the show around here he then took a seat in an uncomfortable chair across the warpocked table from the suspect everything about the box was austere and drab from the vinyl flooring to the acoustictiled ceiling punctuated with randomly lanced pencil holes boldt wandered the perimeter studying the familiar walls like a building inspector a mirror of oneway glass occupied most of the west wall a window through which daphne matthews would observe the interview hollie complained in a tight nasal whine of a man held hostage by stress and tension this is what i get for trying to help the lady who are you people lamoia played the game allowing a drawnout silence to settle into the room beneath the steady presence of forced air we appreciate your taking a few minutes to help us sort this out i have a right to an attorney yes you do and you may exercise that right at any time no one here has denied you that right youll recall that i offered you the chance to place that call if you so desired you also threatened to charge me i informed you that the involvement of attorneys would necessitate i book you those are the facts mr hollie currently i can still change my mind right now were just two guys talking about an incident thats as likely to go away as it is to stick if you want to walk out of here then ive got to make your arrest go away thats what were doing here me and you were making like magicians were working out the disappearing act so whats he doing hollie indicated boldt distracting you worrying you the boss is here to make sure i dont knock you sideways and use you to mop the floor because im known to have a little bit of a temper when it comes to defending my family the woman you threatened is a police officer i work withwe work with highly respected and loved by all you picked a hell of a target hollie i did not target her she asked you to back off several times her phone was on i heard it her car was blocking two lanes she told you to go away you chose to ignore her request she was being unreasonable whereas banging on a window wrestling with a door handle and shouting at a driver is the epitome of reasonable behavior the car was blocking the road hollie said his attention alternating between boldt and lamoia i was trying to help the car was stalled in traffic would you have just driven by the headlights were on it was raining a woman inside alone you see now were getting somewhere lamoia said like for instance how did you know there was a woman inside that car how did you know she was alone he stammered looked a little dazed and then recovered because i went up to the window and looked inside you get off on looking in windows do you lamoia asked turning to make eye contact with boldt what the hell does that mean maryland two years ago you want to tell us about the trespass charge hollie blanched chewing nervously on his lower lip like something was stuck in his teeth his fingers drummed rapidly on the edge of the table as a sheen appeared below his eyes and above his thin eyebrows a criminal record was like a pole marker on a racetrackno matter how fast you ran it kept reappearing in front of you were calling maryland right now lamoia informed him you dont want to work a story on me because i do not like stories i respect a man who owns up to what he did the past is the past eh mr hollie youre single or you wouldnt say that hollie said with authority theres no such thing as the past when youre divorced it stays right there with you every day the alimony the anger the memories you never get past it not completely so enlighten me about these charges my ex got it in her head i was going to steal our son from her im talking kidnap she made up a bunch of crap about me harassing hernone of it trueand got a restraining order in place the woman is psycho and of course they believe the woman not the guy right you show me one time they believe the guy the restraining order wouldnt let me within a hundred feet of a house that i was paying the mortgage on try that out so you ignored the order lamoia realized he sounded less confident and regretted the letdown i entered the housemy house and when no one was home i might addand got a bunch of my clothes a couple cds and a picture of my son for that i got arrested and charged and convicted he huffed and shook his head ill tell you something i drew a line on a map as far away from maryland as i could getexcluding southern california because that place makes me sickand i ended up here in seattle away from her and i might add away from my son which is killing me if you were a father youd understand that gesturing to take in boldt and the room he said but take a look around im still not far enough away from her boldt spoke for the first time asking calmly mr hollie would you have any objection to our lab guys making a quick impression of your shoe soles maybe looking over your car what are you talking about hollie seemed caught between a laugh and a cry agreeing to the search will expedite the process boldt advised however youre under no obligation to cooperate and there are no guarantees of the outcome hollie squinted his eyes shut like a man kneeling before the altar asking for forgiveness all i wanted to do was help the woman out out of the car or out of the road lamoia questioned turning his words the opportunity still exists to help boldt advised by clearing you our lab guys can move on it was a bit of a stretch but sounded convincing enough lamoia and boldt awaited his answer expectantly a pair of gamblers waiting for the roulette ball to drop ive got to call a lawyer first lamoias head bounced in defeat we brought you in for answers now we get lawyers if the lawyer says its okay ive got no problem with you looking at anything of mine shoes car what do i care hollie made it sound as if he were cooperating or intended to cooperate but it was all a ruse not even the stupidest pd would advise him to submit to such a search without evidence and charges in place the suspect reminded them im starting all over out here though ive got to tell you im reconsidering that decision as well he met eyes with boldt who wore his disappointment openly is there any place left in this world where anyoneand i mean anyone at allis still sane boldt signaled lamoia he wanted a chat in the hallway they had the wrong guy and both cops knew it of bridges and badges thank you for meeting me you didnt say anything about him being here deputy sheriff nathan prair pointed to lamoia like a man ready to pick a fight prair lived coiled like a snake ready to strike im the translator lamoia explained you feed her the bullshit and ill sort it out later real cute prairs round face and surferblond hair normally took ten years off his forty but on this day fatigue painted his eyes a sickly gray it wasnt his workouts holding his shoulders square and high but a steely determination not to appear intimidated in the company of a police sergeant and lieutenant bent on questioning him he fought off that fatigue like a driver too long behind the wheel blinking continually and overexposing his eyes so they looked at times wide with fear the three stood outside the nordstroms rack store on pine an unattractive street corner only yards from a bus tunnel station entrance matthews had let prair name the spot and it intrigued her that hed chosen this place he was on duty but taking a few minutes of lost time to meet with her a warm wind ripped off puget sound and carried a seagull at blazing speeds overhead lamoia tracked it like a hunter his eyes fell onto prair and the deputy stiffened against lamoias wishes matthews handed prair a photocopy of the moving violation that prair had written up on maryann walker she said we could probably give you a dozen false reasons why were here nathan but the thing is were all cops we all know better we could put you in the box and talk around the edges of this and see if we couldnt get something to spill out of you but youve been through enough of that to know better dont you think i do so im just going to put it to you straight weve got the ticket that you wrote up for maryann walker a week prior to her going off that bridge were asking ourselves why in the world you would withhold that information from the investigating officer seeing as how it could come back to bite you as now it has cars and trucks rumbled by some yahoo across the street had a blaster playing rap music at the decibel level of a jet taking off and here i was thinking you were going to thank me for getting you out of a jam yesterday i guess im just lucky you showed up she said life is just chockfull of happy coincidences like you knowing maryann lamoia said just like that prair agreed he radiated a smile what you two think i actually had any way of knowing standing up on that bridge that the woman below was one of probably sixty or more violations id written up that week are you kidding me he addressed lamoia you ever work traffic you know what im talking about three kids in clothes too big for them went by on skateboards timed perfectly to catch the pedestrian crossing light never had the pleasure lamoia said i came up gumming sidewalks the night maryann was killed you took forty minutes of personal time killed she was a jumper last i heard no way lamoia said you were on that bridge you knew wed found the blood trail knew what we were thinking you were there prair we were all there together skip the theatrics youre ripping yourself a new one mcds he said i went off the clockeleven eleventhirtyfor a quarterpounder and fries right or wrong she read his face as truthful whether prair knew it or not hed just supplied the window of time suggested by the universitys oceanography department neals claim of seeing am on the clock had proved far too late to account for the physical sciences of the ocean maryann walker had gone off that bridge before midnight matthews caught lamoias eye and knew he was thinking the same thing lamoia had his detectives notebook out and in hand which mcdonalds prair buried his face in a large hand shit he cleared his expression and supplied lamoia with the address marginal way at the turn for seatac matthews asked are we going to find you had a history with maryann walker beyond this moving violation excuse us a moment would you prair seized matthews by the arm and led her out of earshot from lamoia who craned toward them as if hoping to hear seeing this prair moved her a little farther a couple of big hefty women came out of the rack carrying too many bulging plastic bagsthey looked like elephants with saddlebags both talked at once going on about the deals theyd just made and all the money theyd saved matthews thought youve got to spend it to save it does anyone see the irony he said lieutenant forgive me for saying so but whatever was said in sessions with you was privileged and said in confidence and is supposed to stay that way you have fantasies about having sexual relations with the women you pull over deputy on several occasions those fantasies have had a direct influence on your behavior was that the case with maryann walker is that the case with me thats got nothing to do with this prove it she was wondering if that was the case with her as well had prair crimped her gas line in order to play the hero and save her had he hoped to win a roll in bed as her thankyou i dont have to theres nothing to prove youre coloring your opinion based on privileged information lieutenant never mind that theres nothing to itit wouldnt hold up if there was she broke his grip and stepped back lamoia moved in ever the protector she said to prair you should have come forward when the body was identified last week woulda shoulda coulda let me ask you this would you have come forward if youd been me my history she probably wouldnt have but she didnt say so that shooting colors every impression there ever is of me never mind that it was ruled a good shooting no one remembers that part if id have come forward on walker id have distracted the investigationexactly whats happening nowand that helps no one especially you lamoia said matthews glanced over at the patrol car prair was driving registration plate kcso shed looked down at the rooftop of that same patrol car from the parking garage across from the shelter there was no room for coincidence in such matters she felt the blood drain from her face you just happened across me broken down like that yesterday she said what if i did im asking do you make a habit out of following women around in their cars its not like that then write it up the way it is the way it was lamoia ordered do it voluntarily do it by tonight or well pass an official request through channels thatll have you hoisted up a flagpole by your short hairs every meeting with maryannchance encounter or notevery phone call the fouroneone on your whereabouts every waking second the night she died if so much as one comma is out of place this thing is going to rain down on you nathan were going to want your time sheets for the past month we want copies of every moving violation you issued if there are holes in your time sheet were going to want detailed explanations of every missing minute witnesses to your whereabouts you name it you carried the gold shield onceyou fill in the blanks prairs eyes went icy knots formed like hard nuts at his jaw thatll be it for me you two know that my record time sheets ticket carbons are you shitting me that puts me square in the crosshairs thats where you are lamoia informed the man deal with it ten tonight on my desk or the shit starts raining down on you with that the skies opened up as if on command and dumped buckets lamoia and matthews ran for the bus tunnel entrance prair headed for his patrol car the seagull reappeared overhead caught in the rain barely able to fly matthews saw it struggling and then it was gone lost in the gray along with hundreds of pedestrians scurrying for shelter from the storm buried history boldt awoke to the sounds of liz showering and the fisheye distortion of his sons peaceful sleeping face nose to nose with him he didnt remember miles having snuck into bed with them for one blissful moment he lay there staring at the little man realizing this would likely be the best part of his daythen like tiny sprouts ripping open the seed husk thought began to penetrate that peace he had an appointment later in the day that might supply answers about both chens death and possiblyhe allowed himself to believethe disappearance of susan hebringer he had at least two administrative budget meetings on the schedule that he dreaded lizs minivan needed to find its way from the banks underground parking to a body shop on broadway sarah had afterschool ballet and if lizs car wasnt out of the shop by then boldt would need to arrange pickup by five whats your day look like liz stood naked in the doorway toweling off shed added back some of the weight the lymphoma had claimed finally covering her skeleton again in delicious womanly flesh not too bad he said looking up at the moment you want to lock the door a minute she asked yes i do along with her weight some appetites had returned as well boldt slipped out of the covers so as not to wake miles crossed the room and pulled the bathroom door shut behind himself as he brushed his teeth she undressed him pulling down his pajama pants and helping his feet out the same way she did with the kids he considered teasing her about this but didnt want to ruin the moment he left the sink water running to cover their sounds liz dropped the towel pulled herself up onto the countertop and turned to face him this okay with you she asked he stepped up to her gently eased her legs apart and they embraced do you hear me complaining responding to his kissing she eased her head back against the mirror drops of water raced down its smooth surface her fingers wormed into what remained of boldts hair as he dropped to one knee good morning she said in a husky appreciative voice starting out that way boldt was thinking dr sandra babcock could have modeled in a blue jean ad and proved to be much younger than what boldt had expected of a tenured professor of archaeology midthirties at best she had a clear complexion soft green eyes and a slurry southern way of speaking she had a playful sparkle to her eyes and the distracting habit of rolling a mechanical pencil between the fingers of her right hand like a majorette with a baton if her office reflected her thought patterns then theyd get along fine neat and tidy not a paper clip out of place two discarded yogurt containers in the trashnonfat strawberry he noted that shed saved the plastic spoon as it stood out amid a group of pens and pencils in a weekend edition coffee mug but for all the organization the pretension that accompanied the director of any university department dr sandra babcock churned inside as her fingernails were gnawed to the quick he appreciated knowing that in advance birds of a feather he thought they killed a few minutes in social discourse boldt lectured regularly for the criminology courses at the u and babcock had done her homework they got through the doyouknows and haveyoumets without too many overlaps after a few tentative silences between them boldt saw clear to open up the conversation to the purpose of his visit he said day before last i interviewed a pair of emts either they lied to me or theres an explanation for events that im missing as i explained over the phone dr babcock i need the cliffs notes on this citys underground and if possible accessi need to get under that section of third avenue and the city wont let me down in emts they claimed they had not attempted resuscitation on a man who i believe died later than what they put down in their report its not them im after i just want the right answers where exactly on third between cherry and columbia she glanced up to a large wall map of downtown seattle that was nothing like what hed ever seeninstead of city blocks a good deal of downtown was represented as excavated walls and floor plans boldt said i have only a vague notion of the citys underground a couple of blocks around pioneer square the fire in the late s the tidal floods and the decision to elevate the shoreline of the city but according to these emts they encountered what they believe was underground clear up on cherry and third a few strands of hair broke loose from behind her ear and cascaded into her eyes she brushed them aside twentytwo city blocks were buried when they filled in the flats a hundred years ago retaining walls were built surrounding the old ground level and then the streets backfilled to elevate them some twenty feet higher it took over a decade to complete the underground tour accounts for only three city blocks plenty of other sections of the underground still exist most sealed off and awaiting us like time capsules for the most part theyre on private property theyre dangerous and though were constantly trying to gain access in order to inventory and photograph fears of lawsuits and insurance coverage discourage cooperation from the early s on city utilities were run along the old underground sidewalks the perimeter area between these retaining walls and the brick walls of the old buildings down there when i read about the sinkhole id hoped the city engineers would allow us access but the needs of archaeology took a backseat to getting traffic running again and the complication of much of this being private property on the other hand if you could get methis departmentaccess youd be doing the history books a favor id be happy to tell you what youre looking at i was hoping this might work out the other way around im afraid not the city flatout turned down my request but a police lieutenant cant you gain access even to private property if you want shed clearly granted him the interview because she saw boldt as her ticket into the underground it doesnt work like that he said this but his mind ground through the possibilities dixons confused autopsy might provide enough unknowns to win boldt the necessary paperwork babcock teased him into wanting this with her explanation as the city streets were filled in to lift them above the flood levels people moved block to block by climbing ladders crossing the new streets still under construction and then back down a ladder to another block it went on this way for years eventually the retail stores moved up to the new street level but the old storefronts still existed theyre still down there she continued what used to be main street is now underground i imagine thats what your emts found themselves in stores and shops and sidewalks that havent been touched for over a hundred years youre the one with the ruby slippers lieutenant giving in to her urging he said ill need the name of the owners i can get that for you no problem its to be treated as a crime scene first an archaeology dig second if at all i can live with that she extended her hand for him to shake ill leave the decision to you boldt accepted her handshake though somewhat reluctantly he had the feeling hed walked into a trap babcock had the callused hands of a farmer or fieldworker she said okay youve got yourself a deal the hearing matthews considered the evidentiary hearinga probable cause or preliminary hearinga formality shed attended only two such hearings in her decade of service and then solely because shed been called as a witness when lamoia informed her that hed included some of her paperwork in his report to the prosecuting attorneys office and that because of this she was advised to attend the hearing she lost her temper admonishing him for submitting a report that was little more than notes on a napkin she arrived at courtroom d like a plane coming in too fast for a landing tires smoking and wing lights flashing what the hell were you thinking she said to lamoia where they sat three rows behind the prosecutors table lamoia held his finger to his lips requesting she lower her voice the hearing was not yet in session but the prosecutor a stumpfaced woman named mahoney sat within earshot he said we do what we do his only explanation i scribbled out a memo to you john that was not a psych evaluation it is now no it isnt thats just the point we both want neal for this matthews i included the memo because it supports his frame of mind at the time of his statement which was when he lied about the window of time its that false statement that mahoneys hanging our case on for the time being lets not forget that the blood on the sweatshirt came back maryann walkers yes but hell if mahoney is going to put ferrell walker up on the stand to tell us all where he got that sweatshirt from behind a dumpster in the back alley she said within a few yards of the same vehicle we know ran her over that works john but it brings walker onto the stand for possible questioning it opens up the threat on neals life at dixies and a personal thing between them thatll not only invalidate the sweatshirt but confuse the judge and leave room for reasonable doubt we gotta trust mahoney on this she knows what shes doing she wanted the psych report it wasnt a psych report you think the pd wont know that its a hearing not a trial theres all sorts of leeway here matthews calm down you or mahoney should have asked me for a psych report with all the time we had lamoia said sarcastically annoyed with her now mahoneys going on vacation next week and i wanted her to handle it besides defense agreed to the scheduling and that means they had as little time to prepare as we did when the shoe fits im not saying its perfect but you play the hand thats dealt you do not start quoting country music cliches or im out of here she sat back and stared at the ceiling wondering how lamoia could take the wind out of her so effortlessly when he got a few too many beers in him or on rare occasion submitted to the pressures of the job and lost his cool he had a tendency to start spouting sidesplitting oneliners like ive got tears in my ears from lying on my back and crying over youa personal favorite of hers she heard a little kenny rogers heading her way and ducked to avoid it so im here she said to support a psych evaluation that isnt a psych evaluation but the point is youre here lamoia said realizing the worst was over see theres a bright side to everything the hearing ran like a scaleddown trial it was mahoneys job to make a case against neal and she went about the task in workmanlike fashion offering neals vehicle as the murder weaponhairs blood and tissue had been collected from the undercarriage of the corolla a small amount of this organic evidence had been subjected to dna testing and had been matched to maryann walker there was more to come the lab tech announced from the witness stand mahoney hurried her presentation apparently knowing that the court too regarded such hearings as pro forma and did not want to belabor her points thereby annoying an overtaxed judge prior to the actual trial matthewss evaluation was regarded as icing on the evidentiary cakea way to incorporate possible motives for the crime and to subtly bias the judge against the defendant at the earliest possible moment the public defender a slightly overweight secondgeneration indonesian man in his late twenties named norman seppamosa with thick glasses and a pug nose seemed outgunned and overwhelmed until he surprised everyone in the courtroom by requesting to crossexamine matthews a request immediately granted he stood from his chair at the defendants tablean act of grandstanding normally not seen in such a hearing as there was no jury to impress and ran through a litany of questions that established matthewss credentials daphne matthews saw ferrell walker directly behind mahoney occupying a seat in the last row he nodded hello to her as seppamosa got started mahoney said your honor i think were aware of ms matthewss credentials and qualifications the judge an african american woman in her midforties and an outspoken liberal clicked her tongue disapprovingly at mahoney matthews found herself distracted by walkers presence the reason i ask these questions your honor seppamosa explained is merely to establish that we and the court should certainly accept the credibility of such an experienced and wellestablished expert witness matthews felt her internal earlywarning radar flash an alert and saw a similar concern sweep the patronizing smirk from mahoneys face as well with an unwanted heat swarming up her spine and across the flesh of her back matthews had but a few precious seconds to prepare herself for a round of aggressive questioning having sat through nearly half an hour of unchallenged testimony she had arrived in the witness chair believing seppamosa would merely take furious notes lifting his head occasionally as he had been doing all along and await the calling of the next witness with the man standing at the end of the table glaring at her with him sweating so profusely as to stain the underarms of his suit jacket with him addressing the court and lauding her expertise and reliability she knew she had trouble he had been lying in wait nothing less the judge sternly reminded mahoney that if she had an objection she would be well advised to address the court formally not in unannounced outbursts this is not a revival meeting ms mahoney this reprimand indicated an erosion of support that clearly wounded mahoney and drove her back to her yellow notepad to where matthews couldnt tell if she was listening or not if seppamosa was coming after matthews then she believed it was to get some or all of her testimony tossed exactly what testimony remained to be seen i see in the investigating officers report that you were present at mr neals apartment on march twentyeighth of this year thats correct matthews said checking a calendar offered by the bailiff in your expert opinion dr matthews at that time did langford neal display any hesitation or reluctance in granting his permission for police to search his nineteen ninetytwo toyota corolla he did not and in your expert opinion dr matthews given that the state has made a case that evidence collected from that vehicle suggests the vehicles possible involvement in the crime is this behaviorthis willingness to share such evidence with policeconsistent with what youd expect in your vast and welldocumented experience of a guilty party yes or no no is it consistent with what youd expect of an innocent party matthews hesitated but realized her hesitation hurt their case more than quick efficient answers surrendering such evidence would be more typical of an innocent party yes but not reserved to he interrupted her because basically mr neal was handing over the smoking gun seppamosa said was he not mahoney reminded the court there was no pistol or firearm associated with the maryann walker homicide the bench reminded mahoney to object formally or face a court fine matthews was instructed that she did not need to answer the question ms matthews seppamosa said suddenly dropping her title an omission she took seriously because the state has failed to produce any witnesses other than oceanographers as concerns the timing of this event and seeing as how counsel is basing a good deal of their suspicions of my client on what they call this inaccurate window of time id like to question you about the q ampa sessionshould i call it an interrogation of my client mr langford neal you were in attendance were you not i believe copies of the investigating officers report of that interview have already been put into evidence by ms mahoney matthews said she was directed to answer the question yes i was in attendance so it says here seppamosa said then maybe you dont need my help matthews said winning a suppressed grin from mahoney or shall i read it for you seppamosa clearly intended to play hardball the psychologist understood the importance of staking out her own territory and showing her willingness to engage she sent the message that she would not roll over for him and the attorney looked over at her with a renewed appreciation following the comment not the entire document he said a smug expression winning his face i would however appreciate if you read for the court page seven of the transcript lines eleven through eighteen ive taken the liberty of highlighting the section this would be the defendant langford neal speaking to you and to sergeant john lamoia crimes against persons the lead investigator on the case point counterpointhed turned her small joke around to sting her she was now to read some part of the neal interview into the court record while simultaneously indelibly searing it in the judges mind mahoney thumbed a document with the dexterity of a chief librarian seppamosa handed matthews a copy she read the lines and had no idea where he was going with this seppamosa seemed to have missed the point of the expert testimony reading this line would only support the strength of mahoneys case against neal matthews cleared her throat away from the microphone and then read neal maybe it was the phone ringing that woke me up in the first place and i do remember what time it was all twos flashing at me two twentytwo the clock by the phone on her side of the bed i remember that two two two flashing away and to your recollection ms matthews is that verbatim to my recollection yes it is this then is the contradiction to which ms mahoney referred in her questioning of the oceanography expert a dr bryon rutledge it would be inappropriate of me to answer for either dr rutledge or ms mahoney this is your understanding of the conflict is it not it is the body had to have gone off the bridge before midnight therefore mr neal could not have seen her on a fire escape two hours past midnight thats the kind of inconsistency that wins an investigators attention indeed seppamosa returned to the defense table foraged inside his salesmansized briefcase and came out with a bedside digital clock in hand he then had matthews read from a police inventory that accounted for all items in plain sight as documented this based on a courtordered search of neals apartment she read the make and model of neals bedside clock and the court confirmed that seppamosa now showed matthews the exact same model of clock matthews did not see what was coming but knew without a doubt that shed been led into an ambush she searched her thoughts in order to attempt to anticipate the attorneys take on the bedside clock but still had no idea where it was leading she glanced out into the gallery only to see that both mahoney and lamoia looked equally puzzled and on guard to anticipate the question was to be prepared for a clever response failing this she felt set up and ready to play the scapegoat seppamosa plugged the clock into a floor receptacle alongside the stenographer and it occurred to matthews that hed practiced this at least oncehe knew where the power was he knew what he was doing he fiddled with the clock and turned it to face her for the benefit of the court he said making sure both the judge and mahoney were shown the face of the digital clock would you please read the time of day represented on the clock two twentytwo matthews said i cant tell if its am or pm seppamosa said cheerfully its am theres a little light that glows indicating pm if the court wishes the judge cut him off insisting the court did not wish seppamosa noted for the sake of the record that matthews had correctly identified the time of day as represented on the clock he then dropped the bomb that matthews felt in the center of her chest as a current of electricity and is the number represented on the clock steady or flashing ms matthews its steady she reported not only reading on the page in front of her but hearing aloud in her memory neals statement of all twos flashing at me flashing away for the benefit of the court i am now unplugging the clock seppamosa quickly replugged the clock then aimed its face at matthews and now the time and the quality of the numerals twelve oclockone two zero zero and are the numerals steady or flashing lamoia came out of his seat and headed for the courtrooms back door practically at a run flashing her heart sank for now she knew exactly where he was heading flashing as in mr neals statement to you and sergeant lamoia flashing yes what time does the clock say now he showed her the face again twelveohone one minute past twelve if it please the court the judge bid him to continue not quite following the line of presentation dr matthews do you recall the window of time that maryann walkers body had to have gone off the bridge this according to testimony provided by the states expert witness dr rutledge matthews hesitated shed just stated this herself seppamosa said your honor im happy to have the court stenographer reread the between elevenfifteen pm and twelve am matthews said seeing no point to stretching this out even longer rule number one in court keep it quick when youre losing and to simplify that testimony this was determined by the direction of tidal flow was it not and the distance the body had reached prior to retrieval something like that your honor if it please the court i could reread but the judge was not in a pleasing mood the significance of this presentation mr seppamosa is in the nature of the numerals your honor flashing which is exactly as the defendant mr neal reported initially to police the numbers of such clocks flash only when theres been a loss of power and the battery backup is insufficient the clock resets to twelve midnight and then begins to keep time again retrieving a sheet of paper from his table seppamosa crossed the room toward the witness chair ms matthews im going to ask you to read one more item for the benefit of the court mahoney stood up and properly objected this time suggesting that seppamosa was badgering the witness in asking her to read documents that did not pertain to her expertise in any regard seppamosa defended his choice of matthews because she was a respected member of the police community and could be trusted to tell the truth he then offered to subpoena a variety of expert witnesses if the court would prefer clock manufacturers power utility representatives the judge heatedly declined the offer clearly rebuffing the man in the process but seppamosa was not to be deterredhe was a man with a mission more alive and cheerful than any pd matthews had seen stand before the court matthews was directed by the judge to read the letterhead off the sheet of paper supplied to her the letterhead is for puget sound energy it appears to be a web page printed or faxed to mr seppamosa the highlighted text please seppamosa said practically crowing by this point she read an area that included all of ballard wallingford greenlake and phinney ridge experienced a power interruption at eight fiftynine pm on march twentysecond this interruption lasted an average of three minutes with the maximum lost time in phinney ridge estimated at seven minutes twentyseven seconds seppamosa spoke loudly luxuriating in his perry mason moment i submit to the court your honor that this power outage switched off mr neals bedside clock at exactly eight fiftynine subsequent to that the power remained off an additional three to five minutes somewhere around nineohfour the power came back onwhile mr neal and ms walker were still at mr neals mothers house having dinnerreturning power to and resetting the clock which now began to track time as if nineohfour were actually midnight mr neal did hear ms walker on the phone he did witness ms walker out on the balcony mr neal did see the clock flashingflashing as it is reported in the statement he signed for the police the very same statement they are claiming condemns him by invalidating his reporting the correct time of nightflashing the numbers twotwotwo two hours and twentytwo minutes after the reinstatement of power by pse at nineohfour or eleven twentysix pm your honor the very discrepancy the state is attempting to use to suggest guilt on the part of my client is in fact the discrepancy that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that mr neals original statement to the police was factual entirely factual and does nothing whatsoever to suggest my client in any way lied at any time to authorities nor has he at any time contradicted the window of time for this crime put forth by the states very own expert witnesses the judge took this all in and directed her attention to the prosecutors table ms mahoney the state requests a continuance to review the material that has come to light continuance nothing ms mahoney an annoyed judge declared youve insufficient evidence ms mahoney if the state wishes to try mr neal youll need to start again she lowered the gavel lightly and released neal on his own recognizance matthews heard a commotion at the back of the room she looked up to see ferrell walker leaving as fast as he could three blocks north of safety with tom pettys i wont back down running in her head matthews abandoned the idea of a hotel room for a second night and returned to her houseboat angry over losing ground at the probable cause hearing angry at lamoia for not anticipating the contradictory evidence put into play with the flashing clock angry at herself for allowing seppamosa to manipulate her and the facts to his clients advantage she wanted a drink she deserved the comfort of her own homeshe was sick and tired of being told what to do she climbed the ladderlike stairs to her tiny bedroom weary from a long afternoon of meetings meetings begot meetingsa tried and true axiom of police work she wasnt looking forward to the following day she poured herself an expensive glass of a nearperfect wineagain the archery summit pinotdrew a hot bath and settled into the idea of spending a mindless somewhat inebriated night in front of the television but as preparations for the bath continued she thought about margaret out on the streets and found it impossible to enjoy herself she thought about nathan prair and the fact that he had yet to submit the report lamoia had demanded be delivereda report matthews hoped would clear up whatever relationship had existed prior to the young womans murder as she undressed in her bedroom paranoia crept in despite the fact that shed covered every inch of glass in the house whether by window blind or thumbtacked towel down to her bra she couldnt bring herself to disrobe any further still partly clothed she wrapped herself up in a robe and headed back down to the houseboats tiny bathroom where with the door locked she undressed she caught herself folding clothes she knew were headed for the laundry and recognized the action as a warning signhairline fractures in her sanity to make matters worse she overreacted knocking the stack of dirty clothes into the sink and stirring them up into a tangled ball having forgotten her glass of wine she donned the robe again and headed out to retrieve it but found herself walking extremely slowly attentive to every errant sound part of the problem for her came from the look of the place the fact that covering all the windows had shrunk the space to a claustrophobic size she resented the intrusion her feeling forced to defend herself this way the depressing darkness of the room with the lights along the lake removed from view wine in hand she relocked the bathroom door intent on soaking away both the days tensions and her increasing fear some sounds some dirt found outside a window a few strange phone calls from a disturbed kidwhen she quantified the events of the past week they seemed nothing to get worked up about had she been on the receiving end of this list as a psychologist shed have wondered at the fuss but being on the receiving end as a potential victim heightened the urgency in a way she had never fully understood before the piping hot water helped the wine go to her head but the wine failed to quiet her imagination as shed hoped what should have been a few luxurious moments of peace found her swapping places with melissa dunkin bathing in the hotel room despite her being locked in a windowless room she could feel a strangers eyes feasting on her anything anyone could be out there at any time there was no place that could be considered completely safe she mentally reviewed locking both doors and all the windows but she didnt trust herself the bath itself seemed like a failed ideait would lull her into a stupor shed come out of the bathroom a half hour later dazed and dull the perfect victim catching herself slipping back into paranoia she reached for her wineglassher medicationand missed knocking it to the tile floor where it smashed at a volume twice as loud as it should have shards of jagged glass walltowall awaited her bare feet the spilled red wine looked like a pool of blood goddamn it her voice rang out equally loudly bouncing off the mirror the tile and the tub she felt foolish idiotic the bath was a bust the whole evening felt like a bust where a certain personality might have left the mess to enjoy the bath while the water remained hot matthews felt obligated to clean it up immediately martyring herself in the process using the toilet seat as a steppingstone she climbed out of the tub forgoing a towel for the robe and the sense of privacy and inched her bottom along the countertop and finally leapt out the door and into the hall she slipped her feet into a pair of rubber boots at the back door grabbed a broom and dustpan and went about cleaning up as she accounted for the last of it she felt another wave of anxiety steal into her chest stewing in selfpity she saw her life as her stalker must see it jampacked and yet empty she thought it too bad she couldnt clean up the pieces of her recent past the way she had this shattered wineglass two broken engagements still partly reserving herself for an unavailable married man who showed less interest now than ever before shed made a career of repairing other lives but had proved unable to mend her own she looked around to see a virtual cocoon the windows covered the doors locked and deadbolted afraid of her own shadow she was the person to whom others turned to be rescued from their fears she decided against the wineit was only making things worseand tried some mahler instead nice and loud like sitting in the second row of benaroya hall she sought refuge in a mindless television show but found it unsatisfying unable to shake the feeling that someone was watching her back to the wine and another deep glass she now felt warm to the core but still worried feeling pathetic and childish matthews nonetheless took the commercial breaks to patrol the houseboat on one such foray she grabbed a pair of flannel pajamas and returned to the bathroom and changed into them electing to continue to wear the robe in the process she missed a crucial part of the television show and turned off the set on the verge of tears another glass of wine and she was feeling drunk unable to lose the feeling of being watched a few too many glasses of wine in her she determined that walker or prair or someone had hidden cameras in the house and she made it her mission to find them what was so unreasonable about that there were spy stores in town that sold fiberoptic cameras that fit into smoke detectors electric switch plates bathroom fans and heating ducts she started out methodically but within minutes found herself frantically pulling books from shelves yanking artwork off the walls and uprooting potted plants had she looked behind herself she would have seen a path littered in destruction and might have stopped herself but it wasnt until shed come full circle that she saw her downstairs in ruinsbooks scattered plants and lamps tipped over the walls bare and crawling with unfamiliar shadows from lamps on their sides hurricane daphne actions did in fact speak louder than words she saw her rampage as a sustained scream a cry for help of epic proportions her mobile phone chirped from somewhere on the kitchen counter she searched for it contemptuously as if it too might be watching her matthews daphne its ferrell her breath caught hed called again with impeccable timing and on her cell phone a number he simply could not possess you let me down daphne she felt as if hed poured ice water down her back i asked you not to contact me could he sense her terror did she dare hang up on him you said it was a process a system that it worked i dont see it working daphne and i dont see you doing anything to fix it its a process that takes time mr walker believe me were doing everything dont hand me that crap if you were doing everything you could hed be locked up not free to do what he wants you and i talking about it is not going to help im going to hang up now i brought you her sweatshirt get this straight the more you try to help the more you hurt our chances of putting away your sisters killer tampered evidence is inadmissible since when cant an informant supply evidence since the informant held a knife to the suspects neck since the informant is related to the victim since the informant has repeatedly been asked to stay out of it since the informant is not an informant in the first place police informants are recruited and managed and records are kept of their activities you are not a police informant mr walker you are not helping things okay okay cards on the table walker asked mr walker you are not listening i can help you daphne mr the two missing women the sudden silence in the room and over the phone was replaced by a pounding in her ears as a slide show of recent events flashed through her consciousness hebringer and randolf had stolen away boldt and his cap team for months she had personally worked up profiles interviewed family members and torn open the lives of these two women to where secrets no longer existedsex toys family turmoil medications and past lives included as a resident of the city ferrell walker certainly knew of the departments dedication to the investigationsso was this tease of his an act of desperation or a legitimate offer if the latter did she dare refuse him im listening she said her heart continuing to race as adrenaline coursed through her she reached for the wine bottle and upended it ill help you find those women if youll get lanny neal behind bars for good weve been looking for those two women for a long time mr walker what makes you think because i know things you dont and how am i to believe that lets just say ive had a vision the two of them strung up like marlins maybe youve been looking in the wrong place she didnt consider herself easily rattledstrung up like marlinsand yet this homeless bereaved street person had her shrinking and shaking as she took yet another swig of wine in an attempt to settle herself a dream or something more concrete wouldnt you like to know childish toying with her yes i would mr walker youre scared because i know more than you he said i can understand that but theres no reason to be were friends the two of us i wouldnt hurt you you wouldnt hurt me i can help you you can help me tell me youll help me the psychologist pushed aside the frightened woman in what she considered a moment of personal triumph the arrest and conviction of lanny neal isnt about you mr walker its about us doing our jobs as for your contributing to our ongoing investigation into the disappearances then do your job he complained we are were doing just that by letting him go by buying a bottle of red wine and taking the night off oh god hed followed her watched her he knew her cell number she fought to hold herself together to place the psychologist ahead of the victim howd you get this phone number she blurted it out without thinking her internal wiring a mess from the unwanted cocktail of wine and adrenaline she realized that the phone would reveal to her the callerid information once she disconnected she had to know where he was calling from and she had to hang up on him to get the information but with walker dangling information about hebringer and randolf she knew she couldnt hang up not yet why cover the windows like that it spoils the view her entire body twitched as her nerves seized she never let these guys win yet the temptation was to hang up she could stare across any interrogation table faking selfconfidence and leveling intimidating looks that made even the most heartless think twice about going up against her so why couldnt she face ferrell walker over the airwaves she disconnected the call her fingers fumbled through the phones menu choices in search of callerid pay phone she lunged for her home phone and dialed as her mobile began chirping again the callerid blinked on the screen pay phone walker calling back emergency operator a controlled voice answered matthews introduced herself recited her shield number and requested the street address for pay phone number she was placed on hold as her mobile continued to ring then the mobile went silent as the voice mail engaged two transfers later she reached a supervisor nearly five minutes after that minutes consumed by the supervisor establishing her legitimacy she was finally supplied the address of pay phone an address just two blocks south of her hanging up the phone she sensed the walls of the room closing in on herphysically movingand though shed heard such anxiety attacks described in sessions from the other side of the couch only now did she experience the terror associated with the physical environment shrinking suddenly the houseboat was but a cage from which to be plucked walker was two blocks away and watching her already on the run she snatched up car keys purse and cell phone giving little thought to stepping outside the safety of her home clomping down the dock in a pair of rubber wellingtons her robe slipping open to expose her flannel pajamas matthews fished her handgun from her purse and chambered a round she lumbered past a welldressed couple neighbors returning from dinner they made way for her the woman calling out and offering help a blur of white terry cloth matthews clomped her way up a set of wooden steps that led from the dock to street level beneath an overhang of limbs maple trees and a sycamore reaching down with their long bony fingers an area where even she had to duck and maneuver in order to avoid having an eye poked out her head averted she ran smack into a person the unexpected contact took her breath awaypart solid physical contact part shock in such close quarters amid the jumble of lacelike mottled light from a streetlamp she saw only the brown uniform at first the resulting wave of terror filling her head like a rush of blood from standing up too quickly shed struck a mans chest a tall man she looked up into the eyes of nathan prair daphne his surprise sounded genuine though hers won the moment he took her by the shoulders i he stuttered was just coming to see you i wanted to apologize for there was no rational thought or logic guiding her at that moment only a primal instinct to flee no calculation no clever excuse for the bathrobe and wellingtons what came out of her mouth was half scream half alarm like a martial arts grunt while delivering a blow she shoved prair connecting in the center of his chest and to her great surprise sent him backward and offbalance she crossed the street to the parking lot and stood a fraction of a second too long looking for the honda that wasnt there only to realize it was in the spd repair shop behind her prair had regained himself and had turned toward her daphne wait up a moment later she had the departmental pool car unlocked and started prair ran across the street toward her gravel and mud flew as the car skidded out onto pavement in a lazy fishtail that nearly decapitated a row of mailboxes she raced past a standing pay phone that she assumed to be number craning her neck to take it in it stood empty forcing her to wonder where walker had gone to her houseboat the chevy blew through a red light into traffic car horns sang protest behind her as she fishtailed yet again careening into the opposing lane before jerking the wheel to correct and recrossing the double yellow line the cars speedometer needle twitched as she rattled over potholes doubling the speed limit in a perfect world she would have had the time and presence of mind to make a call and ask dispatch to electronically clear traffic lights affording her a straight shot into public safety she would have at the very least announced herself to traffic patrol the wet roads shone like polished stone as she took a sharp left she lost the back half of the chevy and like crack the whip on ice skates found herself floating at unbearable speeds the chevy connected solidly with the front grill of a mazda coupe the sounds of shattering glass bigger and bolder yet somehow less significant than her shattering wineglass of only minutes earlier she realized that walker had won the game and the resulting anger caused her to lay on the accelerator and drive the car on a steady course in her mind there was no stopping for an insurance swap she was three blocks north of safety two more red lights slipped behind her before it registered that she had just hitandrun a motor vehicle there would be hell to pay if anyone had caught her plate she skidded the tires to a stop in the police garage threw the shift into park and ran from the car like it was on fire two grease monkeys on night duty looked up in unison the buildings heavy steel door came open awkwardly matthews struggling to find the strength that normally required little effort with her back pressed up against the concrete block wall she fought to catch her breath the first sensation of security melting through her the red glare of the exit sign caught her eye the color suiting her for some reason this hallway smelled of old tires gasoline and human sweat from inside the building a pair of uniformed officers young kids assigned night duty approached her while clearly trying not to stare the woman officer turned and asked may i help you lieutenant matthews she identified herself fighting off a grin the young woman asked youre kinda in the wrong place maam do you have an appointment i am lieutenant matthews officer she badged her my mistake lieutenant the woman officer sobered and straightened a poster girl for good posture theres a situation matthews said attempting to explain the robe and rubber boots that had clearly won their attention saved as the door to the garage jerked open and one of the grease monkeys a civilian named roy whod worked the garage for years said hey listen lieutenanta chevy or not this heres a pool vehicle and it went outta here looking good and you brung it back with half the rear quarter panel tore off we got us some paperwork thats got to get done send the paperwork up to my office roy matthews said striving for dignity realizing the futility of that effort she turned her back on all three and stomped her green rubber boots toward the waiting elevator safety had come at the price of humiliation throwing the net when the phone rang at pm there was no doubt in the boldt home who should answer he received fewer of these calls since the promotion to lieutenantpaper pushers werent in demand as much as squad sergeantsbut he still kept his finger in the pot boldts team rarely made major decisions without his input hed been hoping for word from sandra babcock hoping to gain access to the underground given that the city had refused him entrance through the sinkhole due to safety concerns he answered the living room phone listened to lamoia on the other end and agreeing with everything his sergeant suggested grunted out yes five or six times in a row as he hung up it suddenly felt more like am inside his headwide awake by this time liz had appeared in their bedroom door wearing a sky blue pajama top of a synthetic that had all the qualities of satin hanging on her like a coat of paint down to midthigh he knew she wore only that top and nothing else for that particular choice was her signal for what she had in mind and he felt sorry to disappoint them both as he cradled the receiver he also hung his head too bad she said you would have liked it yes me too for that matter nice to hear can you be twenty minutes late wish i could yes you do she said offering an understanding face and sympathetic eyes being a policemans wife couldnt be easy he knew this and tried to cushion the blows whenever possible theyd made it through the most dangerous years the most stressful years both of them straying from the marriage but only once as far as he knew though liz for a much longer period hed never learned the identity of her lover and wondered if he ever would as a lieutenant the demands were on his time the pressures more political in nature the internal problems of his people leaving him feeling like a camp counselor this call proved a little bit of all three she wouldnt want to hear about it they both worked hard to leave their jobs at the officean unattainable ideal but one worth striving for how long she asked an hour if im lucky he said all night if im really lucky he won a grin from her a small but important concession good for you had they not been personally tied to the disappearances it would have been out of bounds for her to ask if it involved susan hebringer and boldt might have felt uncomfortable about including her but the rules had changed since the mother of their daughters classmate had gone missing and boldt thought maybe it was for the betterliz deserved to know more about what took him away at at night he told her that lamoia had called that daphne matthews had jammed herself up and that it needed untangling but that yes there seemed to be an unexpected connection to hebringer and randolf then go she said knowing this made no difference to his decision and yet it did ill stay up and do some prayer work they came at lifes solutions from two different angles but boldt had finally settled into feeling right and good about it believing that maybe one couldnt exist without the other that the material and spiritual were far more interconnected and yet entirely separate at the same time he was still learning about her world shed given up on his the day she walked out of medical treatment for the lymphoma and yet there was a meeting of the minds more often than not i could use that he said wanting to support her efforts she had something to say to him but kept it to herself a coy grin taking the place of the words he wanted to hear it but knew better than to ask the secret to the success of their marriage these days was as much about knowing what not to say as it was knowing what to say he admired her for her restraint they shared a kiss she smelled softly of the lotion that he knew her to spread all over her body prior to bed this was a night of great sacrifice indeed where is she now back at her place lamoia answered the two of them at a near run as they approached homicides situation room when boldt shot him a disapproving look lamoia explained that they had a patrol guarding her dock everyone else is here heiman gaynes deluca and morse brandons home sick marshas still on pregnancy leave listen up boldt shouted addressing the gathering as he and lamoia entered the bland conference room that served as a staging area for major investigations the four detectives were strewn around the room heiman in a chair gaynes propped against a file cabinet deluca towering over a stack of equipment trying to get the rooms video projector switched off before boldt realized theyd been watching a movie on tbs the room smelled of coffee and old socks the video went to a solid blue panel though the sound of the action flick lingered for another few seconds until deluca found the right switch research morse said winning a round of nervous laughter from his colleagues boldt managed to suppress a smilethe trick to effective leadership was to keep people guessing heres where we stand boldt explained in a militarylike tone matthews had a call suggesting a possible lead in the disappearances name of the contact is ferrell walker brother of the jumperthe case that lamoia caught a little over a week ago we have a sheet including a department of licensing photo he said indicating for lamoia to pass out the flyers note that the photo is a couple years old now he was just a kid at the time this guys gone seriously downhill hes wearing the street looking about twenty years older last seen in dirty jeans and a ratty sweatshirt that zips up the front navy blue or black maybe works day labor cutting up fish down at the fishing docks on the canal might have friends around there made a reference to matthews that he was basically homeless so thats what were assuming weve got to keep the patrol units on the construction sites and the hotels weve got another on matthewss residence so were a little shorthanded in terms of uniforms available to us you all clock out in an hour but i want you to stay on this at least until twountil we find him if were lucky lamoia has assigned each of you a section of the city i want you to toss every homeless person you encounter until we find walker or where he might be holed up bring him in for loitering vagrancy public nuisancei dont give a damn just get him in here lamoia added consider him dangerous he carries a bladea serious knifelike a goddamned sword he indicated his right side over here in a scabbard sounds like a fucking pirate deluca said a couple of the others chuckled boldt addressed deluca brian youll work the bars around the canal he and lamoia had worked out the assignments that went with the sheets but listen i want all of you to get the word out on the street that theres a hamilton for information that proves good each of you grab a radio lamoia said along with cell phones weve got no excuses for losing touch no lost time no doughnuts or burgers or fried chicken this to morse no video games or talking up the waitresses a few minutes longer than necessary okay guys this is hebringer and randolf walkers talking about boldt reminded lets not forget that if anyone had been thinking of throwing a wisecrack into the mix boldts comment stole the oxygen from the room go lamoia said watching the four hurry and feeling a sense of power that his word counted for so much gaynes paused by her bosses you need a woman to hang with matthews im good for that whatever the hour i dont care she moved on knowing better than to wait for a reply you boldt asked his sergeant something you said just now lamoia tapped his temple with his index finger you got the juices going sarge are you going to share this kernel of wisdom im gonna skate by matthewss crib and roast a few marshmallows with her anything comes of it youll be the first to hear why do i doubt that boldt asked lamoia flashed him the trademark smile a tony randall smile complete with the animated sparkle coming off the front tooth get gone boldt said voices hi mommy im home lamoia called loudly to the houseboats front door he held up an einsteins bagel bag displaying it knowing it was her favorite trick or treat matthews had yet to make a sound but he knew she was in there knew she wouldnt want him waking the neighbors the front door opened slowly the living room dark matthews looming as a gray figure in sweatpants and thin white tshirt she looked good despite herselfwith no makeup and uncombed hair this was a daphne matthews hed not seen before but he liked it he attempted to pass the bagel bag through as an offering saying you look like that kid in the exorcist standing at the door he smelled the stale and closeted air from inside but she wouldnt accept the bag she said ive got all the girl scout cookies i need how about a rain check john i need your help he said when a woman was locked up he could nearly always find the key he lived for such challenges he said ive got a riddle for you pass ah come on i dont want to play johnny sure you do and ill tell you why because you cant stand anybody having the answers ahead of you of being out of the loop and ive got the answers matthews answers you need believe it you shut that door and i go to boldt with what ive got sad eyes searched his face the door opened a few more inches lamoia could taste victory he said little joe knew you volunteer at the shelterdo you remember that tonight he called your cell phone a number he couldnt possibly have turned up without a direct connection to you am i getting your attention she swung open the door and lamoia stepped inside love what youve done to the place the martha stewart bomb shelter thing is fetching fetching she said as if hed spoken a foreign language she locked the doors dead bolt and latching hardware lamoia noticed the police bar to the left of the door realizing shed had it barricaded towels on the windows nice lighten up can i turn on a light she said i like it this way that worries me she snatched the paper sack and peered inside sesame toasted with light cream cheese but how matthews i know more about you than you even want to consider believe me she looked askance at him the bagel pleased her and he felt good about it she lathered it up with cream cheese and took a ferocious bite an appetite was a good sign she spoke through a mouthful of food uncharacteristic of her its a mandatory leave until they review it i failed the breathalyzer did you know that i heard yes a couple glasses of wine and i failed it i was not drunk john i was scared she said but there you go boldts on it hell ramrod it through its paperwork mostly youll be back in the saddle in a day or two four or fives more like it meanwhile im without my shield and my piece he heard it coming then realizing hed been invited inside not for his offer of a bagel and shoptalk but because she needed something from him this wounded his pride so what is it he asked a drop gun she said her request hit him like a slap in the face you of all people matthews was the most vocal opponent of handguns on the department times change not that much they dont funny what a good dose of reality will do for you he said the sarge asked me what i had to do with it you i got this feeling he thought we were getting personal like that us she asked not that its entirely unthinkable he said in a tone meant to test her reaction i suppose its within the realm of possibility you and me i mean stranger things have happened name one matthews said she put on a pot of hot water her movements seemed lighter all of a sudden like shed ditched a heavy coat youre coffee right he said eight no nine years weve worked together and you have to ask what i drink its polite to ask well its rude when two people have known each other as long as we have its espresso she stated see she was right of course i have an espresso machine someone gave me for christmas it was for your engagement he said it was gaynes you remember that he shrugged he felt his face warm regulars fine he said if youve got it if its not a problem a souffle would be a problem black coffee i think i can handle lamoia asked to use the head revealing a perceptive understanding that this was a houseboat she pointed around the corner of the galley asking aloud if he hadnt been here before he answered obliquely as if maybe he didnt remember as lamoia urinated his eye wandered into her medicine cabinet left slightly ajar an orangebrown prescription bottle presented itself a white cap that was childproof but not lamoiaproof he zipped himself up flushed and used the resulting noise of washing his hands to cover his reaching in there and spinning that bottle around the script was a year old his eyes danced nervously to the door ensuring the lock was in place amitriptyline ten or more in there he liberated two of them and slipped them into the coin pocket of his jeans safekeeping a voice in him cried out what the hell are you doing but the answer came instantly insurance relax it doesnt mean im going to take them he shut the medicine cabinet door to the exact position hed found itever the good detective he looked himself in the mirror astonished that the reflection came back absolutely normal as he unlocked the door and joined back up with her guilt spiked through his system like a series of tiny fevers how bout i get you out of here and buy you breakfast at my favorite diner he asked how bout you get me a drop gun peepers are nonviolent youve said so yourself when weve dealt with them in the past walkers got this notion hes part of the investigation grief does that right suddenly youre the psychologist tell me im wrong youre never wrong john sarcasm from matthews would normally drive him from a room when she got really pissed off she let her intelligence loose uncaged like some zoo animal just waiting for the chance and he knew better than to try to stand up to it but this time he found himself unwilling to let her drive him out for that would be a double win him having your cell phone number lamoia said thats what our focus ought to be thats gonna be what connects the dots here matthews because that is the one thing impossible to explain we solve that well know where to find him well find him at the canal she said cleaning fish tomorrow morning no we wont hes blown off work you know that my guess is hes in the wind he knows he went too far with his offer to help with the two disappearances hes gotta be hooked up to that somehow if hes making that kind of offer mentioning it to you was a mistake he is not hooked up to the disappearances she protested hes a griefstricken sad excuse of a human being whos lost and emotionally fragile and is trying to bait me into including him with information he doesnt possess just so he can be a part of something right now hes a part of nothing his sisters murder is all he has left so explain him having your cell phone number he got it off the phone while in the carits all i can think of for me it adds up differently surprise she said again resorting to sarcasm only then did lamoia notice a massive tangle of wires and a tape recorder by the home phone you know danielson in tech services she asked whats the deal if im to get a restraining order against him i need at least one of my refusals on tape welcome to the womans side of the newandimproved stalking law same old same old you ask me she made herself tea and poured hot water through a funnel loaded with too much coffee he didnt tell her she said calmly i need a weapon and in case i have to use it i dont want it traceable lamoia churned inside to hear this youre making me worried he said im making you coffee she corrected he sampled her effort it tasted bitter and burned he told her otherwise tea drinkers what did they know are you going to ask he said about your version of the cell phone number what else okay im asking hes been inside the shelter lamoia said confidently your name your address your cell phone theyre tacked up on a bulletin board somewhere am i right it talks like a street person it walks like a street person whos to question his being down there nice theory but its women only john guys must wander down into there now and then whether its looking for some girl or thinking its coed sure they do youre right so one of them was walker maybe on purpose even very intentionally when you werent there and he lifted your she interrupted stuck back on the earlier part of his suggestion it would explain his watching the shelter she was thinking about the figure in the parking garage what if those street kids had merely told her what they thought shed wanted to hear what if it had been walker up there looking down on her more to the point why did she feel so uncertain about sharing that nathan prair had been lurking at the end of her dock she answered that question immediately knowing that she hadnt been completely innocent with prair had not remained percent objective with him during counseling not that shed ever done anything that could be remotely construed as a comeon not even close but something about him had made her tack a few more minutes onto a session had given him the benefit of the doubt when evaluating an answer later she had wondered if shed allowed herself to be charmedan egregious error an unforgivable sin for any psychologist she knew prairs presence on her dock had to be mentioned but not now not lamoia she feared the cap sergeant might resolve the situation with a baseball bat and no one needed that its open this time of night right he asked she answered with a dontaskmetodothis look the sarge wants him in for questioning i want answers how he got your cell number call whoever it is you gotta call down there and lets get the flock out of here it smells funky in here you know that boy you really know how to flatter a girl yeah he fired back at her thats what they say it came together for matthews slowly like learning the steps to a dance not something she could jump into this idea of walker in the shelter like so many times before in other investigations she found the early information too much to process as a whole a stew stirred up that had to settle before being tasted its ingredients properly understood for lamoia it wasnt stew but spaghetti and he was throwing it at the wall as he always did waiting to see what stuck for him she was part of the mixhed thrown her up there too by including her in his theory lamoia didnt develop theories so much as test them he didnt put his work on paper he put it in the field and that pretty much explained to her why she found herself strapped into the passenger seat of his jetta shortly before midnight another of lamoias wild hairs and she along for the ride as much for the company as anything else you feeling better he asked lamoia drove fearlesslyhis approach to so much of life she envied him that while at the same time hated being his passenger i resent you dragging me along john god he loved women she fought against the silence that followed she said your mind goes to strange places when you feel yourself under attack youre safe with me he said in the most serious voice shed ever heard him use always and forever no one will ever get to you with me around matthews she didnt want to cry in front of him she glanced out her side window only to have her focus shift and the mirror image of her glassy eyes superimpose itself lamoia gallant who would have thought she said making statements like that can get you in trouble im always in trouble he said he won a private smile from her from here on out youll stay at my loft end of discussion she laughed into the car thatll be the day no thatll be tonight thatll be until we clear this thing she searched his profile for any indication he was kidding the car drifted through yet another greasy turn and she made no attempt to steady herself instead she settled into the seat wondering how and why everything suddenly felt a whole lot better pack a bag he reached across and took up her left handan impossibly caring gesture for john lamoia she did not recoil did not tease him for an instant they met eyes he squeezed her hand gently ran his thumb down her palm she felt it to her toes i know you think im crazy thats all right matthews you and everyone else he flew through traffic colored lights reflected in the black shine of the wet street this too shall pass snuffing the flame they started with lamoia entering the shelter alone just as he assumed walker would have done matthews entered a moment behind him waved hello to the attendant checked the guest book and then walked past a screen to roam the aisles between the cots with the midnight curfew a half hour off a fairly steady stream of desolate young women trickled in as lamoia stood before a gunmetal gray steel desk listening to a woman who had more chins than a sharpei as she explained the shelters womenonly policy to him the arriving girls read a page of rules and disclaimers before signing in as the hefty woman in charge oversaw this procedure a neglected lamoia looked quickly for where walker might have picked up matthewss cell phone number his eyes combing several bulletin boards paperwork on top of the desk and a handful of flyers offered to arrivals to his discouragement the only phone number he could find on any of the literature was the shelters tollfree hotline matthews he called out loudly finding himself on the verge of being thrown out cop or not matthews found herself entering the dormitory and reliving the day shed sat down with margaret trying to convince the girl to contact her familyshe recalled the conversation nearly word for word her own frustration at margarets impertinence she remembered taking the sharpie from her purse and using the indelible ink to make a point about her determination to help she remembered so well inking her cell phone number down the girls forearm this recollection hit her like a slap in the face she spun on her heels and ran coming around the privacy screen and meeting back up with lamoia she stopped abruptly unable to get a word out he tested you okay and stepped closer you look like youve seen a ghost mention of this raised the head of the attendant he had spoken a shelter watchword without knowing it expectancy hung in the air like static before a storm as this woman and lamoia awaited her response the smell of hot chocolate permeated as did the distant nasal whine of a girls earphones as she listened to rap music on a portable cd player other way around matthews said hoarsely her voice belying her stoic exterior i think the ghost saw me for once matthews you lost me not the other way around her forearm matthews said i wrote my cell number on her forearm with a sharpie she hollered out the general alarm man on the floor as lamoia was led around the privacy screen he saw several dozen teensmost all wearing surgical scrubs as pajamas they sat on the edges of their cots aiming their hollow faces in open curiosity some girls came down a hall with wet hair the announcement of a man had cleared the showers walk me through this lamoia said quietly aware of their audience im not sure what youre getting at there are two possibilities matthews said either walker met up with margaret sometime later and she told him what that number on her arm was i have serious reservations about that she nodded her agreement surprising him second possibility he overheard my conversation with margaret and saw me write my cell number on her arm in real time right as i did it right here lamoia mulled this over his brown eyes shifting and lighting on various focal points her face the wall her face again he asked thats the best youve got john you know when you know something and you really know it no matter how much you can talk yourself out of it youve been there right weve all been there before this is one of those times im right about this one hundred percent he glanced around the room saw the girls watching them like some kind of freak show and theres something else matthews said her voice returning to that warm dark husky complaint shed fallen into only moments earlier her tone suggested conspiracy so he leaned even closer to her to where her breath ran warm on his neck for months the girls have been complaining about this place being haunted she caught his condescending expression no no hear me out not creakynoiseskindofhaunted but being watchedthe feeling they were being watched especially in the showers was it her imagination she wondered or had the whole room gone quiet lamoia looked in the general direction of the showers for her the hallway suddenly seemed to stretch much longer john she asked you trust this he questioned completely and absolutely he whispered back at her then well start in the showers so the girls cant see what were doing agreed matthews said and matthews just for the record if we strike out you never talked me into doing this if i get tagged as a ghostbuster ill never live it down i was told this room was probably a salting room at one point matthews said explaining the large drain in the shower rooms brick floor at which lamoia was staring intently or a stable or carriage house lamoia suggested you put a drain in a basement matthews especially one close to water as we are here and youre going to have water in your basement fact of life meaning if the sarge wasnt all hot and heavy about these emts mentioning the underground then maybe i wouldnt go there but a drain in a basement i dont think so i think this thing was at ground level at some point she looked around studying the shower rooms old stone walls gray mortar added sloppily in the nottoodistant past lay frozen where it seeped from the seams youre saying it isnt dirt on the other side of these walls im saying the sarge is trying to make a connection between a possible underground section of the old city and hebringer and randolf hes the one who put a bug in my ear now you raise the possibility of a peeper down here and i gotta go with that with you because youve got this thingyou know what i mean and ive gotta take this wherever i can take it as stupid as it may seem im not saying its stupid john i am matthews it is stupid but to overlook it thats even stupider theres no such word yeah well at the end of this there may be he said stay tuned the castiron drain twelve inches across was positioned directly in the center of the large room some white pvc plastic pipe had been suspended from the stone ceiling as temporary plumbing to supply the shower water the space smelled of young women shampoo and soap nothing like a mens locker room and this made lamoia uneasy in all his vast experience with women he had never entered a girls locker room turn out the lights he instructed matthews obeyed without comment without interrupting his train of thought ushering the room into total darknessthe only sounds the steady rhythmic splash of water dripping from the showerheads that and lamoias shallow breathing how bout a flashlight she whispered expectantly even a little anxiously instead lamoia struck a match shadows jumping and bending across the crumbling brick walls the room was set into motion as he moved carefully along the far wall the match held close to the bricks and mortar the flame burned brightly at first then shrank the shadows fading and lamoia tossed it to the floor he lit another the dripping water mimicked a heart beating lamoia worked the flame high to low left to right his own pagan ritual the fire flickered danced and then blew out enveloping them in darkness once again bingo lamoia said softly with another lit match he tested the same spot againa slice of mortar about shoulder height again long shadows raked the walls as the small flame first flickered and then was extinguished matthews asked why keep putting the match out whats the point its not me lamoia answered its wind he held another match between them so they could see each other but the effect was disorienting now the shadows waved and commingled on the floor theres a hole poked through the mortar here he said pointing and here peepholes matthews not ghosts not goblins dirty old men im guessing and maybe one much younger one with a thing for a very pretty cop she crossed her arms against the chill oh god she moaned wed better call sid lets wait on that it may be nothing lamoia suggested much to her obvious consternation he stepped forward and whispered into her ear he may be watching twenty minutes later lamoia had marked with chalk another four such rents in the mortar all with unobstructed views of the shower stalls where the young women had bathed themselves he made one last test alongside the brick wall that faced the cot where matthews and margaret had spoken the matchs flame blew out he and matthews met eyes hers filled with alarm sometimes i hate being right she said one of the girls asked what was going on and lamoia vamped saying he was a city engineer checking structural consistencies of the chemical compounds used in the mortar mixture this seemed to satisfy the girl and confuse her as well youre working a little late arent you he answered im volunteering my time young lady i havent been home for dinner yet youre pretty buff for an engineer she said this from a seventeenyearold with a tattoo lamoia mugged for matthews shutting her up before she leveled him with another sarcastic remark they reconvened outside the shelters main door in a musty basement hallway that was part of the church i feel sick to my stomach she said arms crossed tightly that is so disgusting so invasive so awful so common he said guys start poking holes in walls when theyre about eight matthews you dont ask the point now is to find these bastardsbecause these arent prepubescent kids who dont know any better these are pervs cavedwelling troglodytes that deserve to have their equipment surgically removed he looked around somewhat frantically give me the dime tour would you these guys are on the outside of these walls and we gotta find out how the hell they got there he added now while we can still rain on their parade ancient doors the second presbyterian church that hosted the shelter in its basement labyrinth remained open from am to midnight seven days a week hours the shelter kept as well matthews led lamoia back to the bottom of an extremely old stone staircase that theyd descended on their way in a few thousand runaways had traveled this same route over the last year after this were gonna want to take a lap around the block he said looking for jimmied doors storm drains basement windowssomething with access to whatevers on the other side of these walls the walls had been constructed of large stone and whitewashed but even though we gotta do that my moneys on the blessed virginor whatever the flock this particular set of bells is calledbecause with them leaving the doors open all hours the bums have got all sorts of access one door somewhere down here a few loose stones is all it would take youre a real poet you know that do we know where either of these doors lead they were heavy doors old and of dark wood and castiron hardware medieval like something from a castle dungeon one sat at the end of a small deadend hallway the other was set into what appeared to be an exterior basement wall both doors were locked we do not she answered emphasizing their partnership theres a lot of history down here a lot of mystery too he pointed out that both doors had locks that would likely open with skeleton keys she said which speaks to the age of this place i was thinking more like how tough theyd be to pick he snapped sarcastically he turned to face her weve got two choices here we can talk to the holy roller whoevers in charge or it being midnight i can do my thing and we can be through either of these doors in about three minutes he produced a leatherman utility knife dont leave home without it as long as im involved id appreciate it if we did things legally as unsettling to you as that may be so now youre going to reform me she looked around at the rock walls the gothic arches overhead seems as good a place to start as any fifteen minutes later both doors hung open the minister was a bald man with an oily complexion a slight frame and cantilevered eyebrows that looked sewn onto his forehead he had a quiet but sunny disposition as if being rousted at midnight was part and parcel of his job perhaps it was one of the doors led to storage a massive masonry cave nearly rectangular in shape lit by bare bulbs and strewn with cobwebs and layers of dust wooden chairs were stacked haphazardly red velvet seat cushions the fabric torn open by homesteading mice leaned as unstable towers a leather chair had its covering peeled back from the arms like skin from a bad burn there were candlesticks and file cabinets steamer trunks and even an abandoned pulpit canted to one side so that its cup runneth over old rustcovered chains were bolted to the far wall matthews commented on the enormity of the spaceit looked to be sixty feet deep or more lamoia strategically wormed his way inside discovering a tunnel with a low ceiling that led to a former wine cellar also long since abandoned the dust alone announced that no bums had trodden here matthews picked her way through the rubble following him together they faced a brickedover stone arch in a soft voice lamoia said we want to be wherever that once led the minister overheard his comment and informed them that to his knowledge any doorways and windows that had once communicated with what had then been a sidewalk a hundred years earlier had all been brickandmortared closed permanently sealed was how he put it a storyteller by nature he held them captive with a tale about an old rumrunning smugglers tunnel said to have run up skid rownow yesler wayleading from the waterfront and connecting to several churches and speakeasies that predated the great depression and prohibition they connected the old smuggling tunnel to these underground sidewalks where they had quite the black market going for themselves lamoia gave the man only half an ear impatient to open the second door when it was finally opened the other door led to a long underground hallway off of which was a music room a small library with dehumidifiers running a vestments closet and several more stonewalled rooms dedicated to church administration and service utilities they took their time to study each in turn searching for hidden access to the underground which from the discovery of the peepholes and the ministers stories seemed likely to exist while inside what amounted to an oversized custodial closet a room filled with steel pipe and electric water heaters lamoia silenced matthews and the ministerwho once started talking proved hard to quietand pressed his ear to the cold sweating stone leaning away from the wall he motioned for matthews to listen tell me what you hear he whispered matthews pressed up against the damp chill her face then approaching the color of the whitewashed stone voices she muttered mens voices voices in the dark the beatup red door caked and cracked with generations of paint hid behind a dumpster down a deadend alley a half block from the churchs west wall lamoia might have missed seeing it had a street person not materialized out of thin air but with this mans appearance in the alley where a moment before there had been no one the detective sought an explanation he and matthews rolled the dumpster aside and lamoia turned the rustencrusted doorknob the door opened behind the complaint of its hinges the smell of human piss wafted up stinging his eyes he covered his face and turned away lets call for backup he said this could get ugly thirty minutes later shortly after one in the morning lamoia led the way down a set of steep rickety wooden stairs into ripe musty air guided only by the narrow beam of a penlight matthews followed closely on his heels and behind her four uniformed patrolmen two with nightsticks in hand two brandishing handguns cobwebs pipes wires and valves lions and tigers and bears lamoia whispered over his shoulder through the pitchblack the comforting sounds of the city faded lost overhead suddenly translated into a deep penetrating rumble that rattled ones chest matthews reached out and took hold of his deerskin jacket a child with mommys apron she let go then lamoia pretending not to have noticed his penlight shone barely five feet ahead illuminating broken wooden planks that had once been a sidewalk together they sidestepped the debris following along the wall of a perfectly preserved brick building the windows with much of the glass still in place lamoia directed the beam through one of these windows piles of broken furniture and junk untouched for years a time warp they passed a barber shop and a millinery the hat racks still in place twenty yards later the wall changed from brick to stone and lamoia used sign languageforming his index fingers into a crossto indicate that he believed this was the church wall matthews concurred with a nod then pointed out the narrow arrows of white light that crossed the sidewalk ahead as they slowed the dust from behind them carried forward and illuminated those shafts of light even brighter five white beams in all cupping his hand to her ear he said that someone had to look inside and that it shouldnt be him matthews agreed and stepped forward placing her eye to the breaks in the wall pulling her eye away she confirmed its the showers her heartache obvious even through a whisper the smell in the air was of peppermint sour and all too human the voyeurs had ejaculated onto the walls and the sidewalk matthews covered her mouth suddenly nauseated a hundred crime scenes or more and this was the first time shed felt ready to vomit suddenly the four uniformed patrolmen pushed past them a flurry of hand signals and quick preparation of their weapons lamoia returned hand signals taking charge a silent orchestration of the minutes yet to come she understood the urgency then from up ahead and around the corner she heard the distinct and unmistakable sound of laughter they walked inside what amounted to a tall tunnel the churchs basement wall once at street level to their right the mortarandstone retaining wall built to enclose the city block and elevate the street a century earlier to the left overhead dustcovered wires encrusted conduits rusted water pipes and gas lines had been added haphazardly over the years tangled like veins in a limb a halo of purple light fanned out from what had once been a skylight in the overhead sidewalk back during the decades of reconstruction when the two sidewalks the two different street levels had been forced to coexist one of the old seattle the other representing improvement and change the din of drunken male voices grew more present a pack of wild dogs encountered in the forest lamoia the hunter cut ahead of the uniforms and peered around the corner he held up four fingers to matthews it sounded more like ten adrenaline cocktails for all charging her system with a menthollike chill and drying her throat lamoia articulated a series of hand signals to the patrolmen and she envied him his cool she felt lucky he was the cop you wanted at your side in situations like this he thrived on adversity she recalled his telling her that she was safe while under his care and though loath to admit it she knew this was true accepted it as fact in militarylike precision the six of them rounded the corner moving swiftly but silently her courage returning quickly as she thought of margaret and the other girls in those showers the jaundiced eyes of the drunk and the desperate peering in on them she fed on these guys her bread and butter she opened up their heads like cracking nuts the patrolmen reached them first knocking away the beer cans taking them completely by surprise but then there was a burst of activity to their rightnot four guys but more like ten the other six scattering like seeds in the wind walker she called out believing in the dim light shed recognized the back of a head confusion as two of the patrolmen took off after them a flurry of cursing and yelling one of the homeless guys vomited a patrolman who had run off in pursuit returned emptyhanded yo listen up you too turd breath lamoia addressed the one whod puked a bearded guy wearing an old ratty jacket to what had once been a nice suit police lamoia said like a southern cracker me and her too weve got a couple simple questions for you this is not the ringtoss you dont get three chances you talk you walk you lie and its straight downtown to central bookinga night in the can courtesy of your city government well check for priors warrants parole status and well cash in our miles all at your expense so for the next five minutes try your level best to do something smart like listen cause me and her we know the way it is and if you go all squirrelly on us were gonna know that too and trust me you dont want to see what happens next any questions no hesitation on his part whatsoever okay good then lets keep our hands where we can see them ladies sit your butts down on the ground and well do some business a moment later all six sat on the wooden planks of the ancient sidewalk like kids in kindergarten lamoia asked about peeping the showers and got six heads all shaking no at him dont know what im talking about lamoia picked two out of the group him and him instructing one of the patrolmen to cuff them and get them downtown one of these two immediately spoke up confessing the peeping insisting didnt do nothing wrong lamoia allowed this one to stay behind he nodded and the patrolman headed off down the tunnel with the other any other takers they raised their hands sheepishly all avoiding eye contact with matthews lets hear about it lamoia said first to speak up gets a gold star matthews felt sick to her stomach as she learned that theyd treated the peeping like a driveup window it was guys like this that supported the stripper joints on first avenue the adult bookstores and video booths diluted beer and sticky floors lamoia seethed beneath the veneer of comic impatience who heres good with faces he asked it buys you a trip downtown tonight but a hall pass the next time theres trouble community chest time people anyone interested no one volunteered he selected the least drunk of the group a guy probably in his late twenties who looked about fifty cheap booze did that so did the street drugs or maybe he had the virus lamoia and the other cops slipped on disposable gloves indicating an end to discussions matthews slipped on a pair as well thinking disposable lives the final patrolman emerged from the dark with two more of the escapees no sign of walker had she imagined that wishful thinking time to peep mug shots instead of naked teenagers you perv lamoia grabbed hold of the street persons red handkerchief knotted around the mans neck and led him like a dog back down the tunnel at public safety lamoias attempts to win the mans cooperation ended with the detective providing him hot coffee and buying him a carton of marlboro cigarettes at two in the morning he then worked him through a few dozen mug shots until confident of the mans sobriety and his ability to make identification the man picked out the faces of three vagrants hed seen in the underground with an anxious daphne matthews monitoring the event from the corner of the small interrogation room lamoia arranged yet another arraysix faces in small windows on a single cardand slid it in front of the homeless man dirty fingers with jagged nails took hold of the card like a nervous gambler toying with his cards the guy studied the faces in the cutout windows the cracked skin of his dirty hands flexed as he stabbed a facebottom left this guys been there a bunch lamoia turned the card around for matthews to see as she stepped closer he ever use the gallery the peepholes lamoia asked sure all the time his finger rested on the photo that was not a mug shot but a drivers license id the face belonged to ferrell walker we call him the fisherman the homeless man said cause he stinks like shit a new view of things matthews had been to one or two parties in lamoias loft apartment huge affairs teeming masses noisy with music blaring empty it looked less like a bachelors pad than shed expected the collection of modest mostly mismatched furniture was complemented by the dramatic lightingnothing but funnel lights on brightly colored wires the focus of the area was the large wellequipped kitchen and what was obviously a stunning view of elliott bay for it looked so even at night wow she said yeah i know ever the modest one he shut and locked the metal door with three locks like her and the houseboat hed bought his place for a song he at a time when the neighborhood had been a needle park and the mayor had been offering tax incentives riding the wave of californication and the sodo neighborhoods gentrification back when there had been a kingdome he now found himself with a piece of a trendy location rejuvenated by the construction of the safe and the new football stadium like her own houseboat the loft was now worth a small ransom and like her lamoia would one day cash in on his good fortune and ride into the sunset in one of his trademark camaros blue sighed from the couch and thumped his tail on the cushion lamoia scolded the dog for being on the furniture but then greeted him warmly when the dog bothered to say hello a weekend architect lamoia had constructed a few walls into the enormous space dividing it nicely but leaving much of it open off the central livingdining area and kitchen was a master bedroom and a bath to the south that he showed her with pride pointing out several details like highspeed internet connection to the north of the kitchen was an office with a single twin bed as a couch and a guest bath across a wide hallway he placed her bag in the office left her for a minute or more and returned with a red beach towel making apologies for his linen the towel proved heavier than expected and before she unfolded it he said dont ask dont tell understood the registration comes back expired previously owned by a man who smoked too much and died behind the wheel of a ford pinto ill return it the minute they lift my leave just so were clear i was not the officer who responded to that wreck im clean you cant harm me with that no matter what happens got it the other thing in there he said without naming the taser stun gun she would later find is the same kinda story consider it a gift no strings attached its all a gift john i appreciate everything youre doing for me yeah well lamoia at a lack for words no quick quip we could watch some tv he suggested its past two in the morning wind down the dog nuzzled him wanting bed as badly as she did listen he said theres wine beer pop food help yourself to whatever you want mi casa su casa i figured you for an empty fridge you figured wrong meals out at diners i can see ive got an image problem you are not telling me youre a cook chef he said when its a guy its a chef and youre a chef she asked disbelieving hell no a grill meister and a takeout king any food you want any country any flavor and i can have it here in a half hour thats a real talent a culinary art form exactly me and the kitchen phone its all technique good night john she said thanking him again happy to have you the dog moved in with her sometime before sunrise warming her feet and taking up too much of the small bed she woke with four hours of sleep ravenously hungry staring out at the beauty of elliott bay and the lush green islands beyond a world unaware of her problemsthe exact perspective she needed at that moment she popped open the window and drank in the sea air it had a taste to it that she associated with this city lamoia snored loudly from the far room his don juan image unraveling with each breath she smiled privately and shook off the fatigue scratched blue behind the ears where he liked it and prepared herself for a shower thinking that on this morning things were okay going on good and that a cup of tea and a bagel wouldnt hurt anything at all hitting the wall although the underground access discovered by lamoia and matthews had at first interested boldt as a way to gain access uptown this interest lessened when it was explained that each block of underground stood isolated behind a retaining wall and did not to anyones knowledge connect one to the next more than six city blocks one hundred thousand square feet each separated the site of chens death and the shelter boldt held out hope that with the help of his university contact he would be able to gain access he began his day by talking a grease monkey in the police garage into taking a look at lizs minivan since hed missed the appointment yesterday he then fired off a vitriolic email to captain sheila hill complaining about matthews being placed on administrative leave and suggesting that the situation be rectified by the end of the day if cap was to effectively continue its work into the investigation of hebringer and randolf he reread it twice spellchecked it and sent it convinced hill would see the error of her ways a political beast hill would not want the possible tarnish of having slowed down an active investigation that carried so much press exposure and baggage boldt knew it was prosecutorial suicide to have matthews sit down with walker ahead of her suspension being lifted and he now believed walkers mention of hebringer and randolf key to the investigation he had in fact left matthews a voice mail encouraging her to set up a meet as soon as walker next contacted her hed alerted special ops and technical services wanting them ready to move at a moments notice he wanted matthews wearing a wire around the clock and hed asked a detective heiman to write up a request for a court order to trapandtrace incoming calls to both her office phone and cell phone the us attorneys office could facilitate this request ferrell walker was complicating things boldt wanted a rendezvous he wanted answers less than an hour later sandra babcock finally came through providing a list of property ownership of eight businesses and stores that she believed might offer access into the section of underground where billy chen had lost his life this access would circumvent the citys refusal to allow boldt down inside the sinkhole boldt gumshoed for ninety minutes business to business store to store eventually gaining an audience with the vice president of seatel bank a balding man who smelled of cologne the vp confirmed the bank sat atop an old basement and summoned a maintenance man to escort boldt downstairs boldt knew that both randolfs and hebringers finances had been checked and doublechecked certainly if both had been customers of this or any bank it would have been redflagged but he didnt recall that information off the top of his head and this left him wondering if his team hadnt made a mistake did the abductor troll bank lobbies looking for women cashing large checks looking for brunettes who wore their hair to their shoulders he grew irritable through the waiting wondering what the hell took a maintenance man eight minutes to reach the lobby there were times eight minutes meant nothing and then there were times like this when thirty seconds could set his teeth to grinding thats him the vp said pointing across the lobby boldt saw a gaunt man with sleepy eyes a bad set of teeth and tight sinewy arms bearing a tattoo of a red rose on his left forearm boldt hurried across the lobby and introduced himself struggling against allergies or asthma the man wheezed basements over here forgoing his name the plastic tag on his coveralls read per vanderhorst he seemed nervous as did most people when meeting a cop for the first time boldt doubted he was the first cop a guy like vanderhorst had met but at the same time if the guy had felony priors he wouldnt be working for a bank like seatel i wanted to ask if you saw any flooding in your basement when that water main broke boldt said as vanderhorst led the way not a drop he forced his reply dryly from his throat sounding like someone was choking him vanderhorst used one of about twenty keys on a ring to open a door marked private then led boldt down an unattractive corridor past an exit sign on the right and another private door to the left at the end of this hall they entered one marked authorized personnel only and descended two short flights of concreteandsteel stairs at the bottom of which vanderhorst hit a second light switch and motioned into a sterile immaculately kept basement area that provided storage my daughter has a friend vanderhurst boldt leaned on the u in the name he wanted to get vanderhorst talking open him up about the water main break rumors of the undergrounds existence anything he could get from the man but hed been given a guy who could hardly breathe much less make conversation i heard it was the underground that flooded in this block boldt tried vanderhorst wheezed this is dry storage mostly it was stone and concrete walls steel beams supporting the low ceiling tube lighting bouncing off white and gray paint rows of industrial shelving aligned north to south stretched like library stacks floor to ceiling cardboard boxes bearing codes in thick black marker occupied every available inch of space how about below this floor boldt asked anything not that im aware of the thin man stood there like a statue boldt asked if hed ever found people down here who didnt belong im not going to say it has never happened because i havent been here all that long but this is a bank they dont like the idea of strangers cruising around they moved on couple more rooms down here you might want to see he showed boldt three other rooms one jammed with heatingventilation ducts and equipment another tangled with electric phone and communication wires a third larger and much older that housed plumbing and steam heaters no longer in use the walls of this third room were brick covered in thick layers of paint generations earlier some window openings had been bricked closed and painted over those window holes suggested an outside wall boldt rubbed his hand on the cool brick im looking to get on the other side of this vanderhorst remained disinterested a maintenance guy going through the motions wouldnt that be dirt boldt repeated his earlier question about flooding somewhat astonished that the quantity of water so close wouldnt have resulted in any flooding listen what do i know you could check with my boss he asked irritably you seen enough still touching the wall boldt asked have you ever come across any doors holes in the wall the floor anything that might lead somewhere outside this basement the bus tunnel they had problems with that water main thing i think this comment stirred boldts interesta light went off inside him which wall is that vanderhorst pointed to the nearest wall of the rectangular room with some checking boldt determined it was the same wall as the one in the utility room with the brickedup windows were done here an excited boldt announced vanderhorst led the way back upstairs letting boldt go ahead as he lagged behind to shut off the lights boldt reached the exit door down the hall which was alarmed with a red panic bar youll get me fired you push that vanderhorst stood a few yards behind boldt watching him hed crept up on boldt and that bothered him wheres it lead onto columbia its a fire exit you want to see the security people theyre the first door to the right upstairs in admin boldt thanked vanderhorst and walked through the lobby back out onto the street debating his next move he had other businesses yet to explore within this city block all with potential access to the underground according to babcock frustrated by his lack of discovery at the bank boldt called into the office and assigned two of his detectives to do that doortodoor footwork for him to his right he saw the entrance to the bus tunnel station that fronted public safety he made up his mind choosing the tunnel for himself when washington state builds a transportation project percent of the contracted cost is budgeted to the arts for aesthetics the result is an eclectic mix of sculpture writing music and painting little gems that catch the public unaware in the case of the pedestrian entrances to the bus tunnel it included poetry engraved into the kick plates of the stairs as well as colorful sculpture attached to the walls at the pioneer square station escalators stairs and elevators lead down first to a vast tier an open plaza that spans the tunnel traffic below providing passengers access to any of several additional stairs and escalators for northbound or southbound bus routes the incandescent lighting is bright sounds echo off the concrete and tile and because the buses run electrically once into the tunnel there are virtually no odors other than a faint trace of burning rubber a condition that put boldt ill at ease the underground bus tunnel stations had not proven popular enough to account for the enormity of such a facility it swallowed up the two dozen passengers down on the platforms awaiting the arrival of a bus and boldt along with them the director of bus tunnel maintenance a man named chuck iberson was a big man with florid cheeks and thinning white hair ibersons military background showed in his attentiveness and respect for boldt he had treated boldts summons with the utmost seriousness arriving to meet him in less than fifteen minutes by nature boldt couldnt help looking at people as possible suspects ibersons overzealous willingness to respond so quickly like per vanderhorsts mealy and vaguely sleazy sniveling persona made the detective think twice about the personalities that lurked beneath a bank janitor might have a shot at an unsuspecting woman as might a man in a position of authority like iberson boldt knew from his years of experience that suspects often surfaced in the most unlikely places im interested in the water main break back on the twentieth and twentyfirst of march he felt impatient hed come down here on nothing but a hunch nine out of ten times such spontaneity proved a mistake what a mess iberson appeared suddenly uneasy and boldt wondered why the possibility if any that a person could gain access to the underground from inside the tunnels boldt continued iberson look confused by that suggestion for impact boldt returned to his original question im investigating the drowning of a city worker pinpointing the source of the flooding may help us out some iberson appeared somewhat relieved boldt explained the emts and fire rescue who hauled him out reported being inside an area that sounds to us like a part of the old underground access to that area might solve some of the questions surrounding the workers death i got no problem with that whatsoever you want to look at my tunnel its yours but i dont know nothing about no underground city and if you want to see where we flooded well have to walk it and its tight in those tunnels he pointed to where the stations expanse condensed to the mouths of two concrete tunnels that each carried oneway bus traffic so well walk it boldt answered okay but i gotta put you in an orange vest and hard hat i can live with that ten minutes later iberson led boldt up the left tunnel walking against the direction of bus traffic they both wore dayglo orange vests and yellow hard hats the transportation department used a good number of double buses joined in the center by an accordion nicknamed dragonsbecause the second of the two sections was dragging behind the firstthey stretched some fifty feet stem to stern and were hated by all motorists if i tell you its a dragon coming iberson warned you put your back against the wall and keep your toes behind the white line them tail sections tend to wander a little so dont trust what you see passing a gray door marked emergency exitalarm will sound boldt asked about the exits iberson explained eers pronouncing it ears emergency evacuation routes two per block in both tunnels where do they come out up top boldt asked most are spiral staircases leading up to trapdoors in the sidewalks boldt had walked third avenue for years and never paid attention to the existence of the trapdoors what trapdoors they look like metal plates up there granted a couple of the eers connect through to adjacent buildings but most head straight to the surface swear to god talk to me about the ones that connect through buildings it occurred to boldt these buildings might be candidates on babcocks list listen with all due respect i keep the tunnels lit and drained and the ventilation system working i dont know all that much about the eers there wasnt much of anything to see a bus approached and boldt pressed his back to the curved concrete it swept past sucking his tie from under the vest iberson never broke stride id like a complete copy of the original construction plans boldt said including the ventilation and drainage systems iberson stopped walking and waited for boldt to catch up i didnt build them detective but i can see what i can do for you it was lieutenant not detective but boldt didnt correct the man iberson pointed out two drains in the roadbed this is where we first saw problems normal drainage is no problem and we have pumps that kick in at a certain volume but once that water main broke we couldnt keep up we had two feet down here before we knew it enough for the buses to hydroplane so we closed down it was a bitch the overflow had breached the ventilation ducting it wasnt the drains backing up which is what we first thoughtthat our pumps had failed he pointed to a massive grill installed high on the cement wall dont ask me how because we still havent figured it out but this baby was basically a waterfall boldt said that other emergency door we passed that would be more like the middle of the block a little north of center id like a look at it boldt clarified inside it iberson motioned boldt back well before a dragon rushed past wind and dust kicking up behind it he said sure thing they walked a distance in silence by this time boldts thoughts were sparking as he assembled a possible explanation for both the missing women and what iberson had been telling him he explained as if he absolutely knew this to be fact your ventilation duct penetrates the original retaining wall constructed to enclose what once were streetlevel storefronts when the water main broke it flooded that area deep enough that your vent went underwater creating your waterfall and flooding your tunnel they reached the door it was marked boldt asked this is which kind spiral stairs and trapdoor or building access iberson shrugged he didnt have a clue you want a look yes iberson disarmed the door with a key and led boldt through saying immediately its not the trapdoor variety boldt hadnt thought so but he said nothing preoccupied with trying to put himself in chens shoes or even those of hebringer and randolf the floor was textured steel plate the walls a gray metal paneling the lights flickered on with the opening of the door it was a manmade hallway leading twenty feet straight ahead to another door detective lead on they walked twenty or thirty feet before climbing a short flight of steel fire escape steps at the top of which yet another sign on a steel door warned of alarms iberson keyed this door as well and pushed it open it accessed a basement room bearing large exit signs directing pedestrians up a flight of stairs to reach the surface the room itself felt eerily similar to the bank basement vanderhorst had shown boldt if iberson had his directions correct then it even seemed possible this room shared a wall with the bank the basement smelled of fresh paint and mildew boldt could hear the rumble of the overhead street traffic for the first time a sound absent in the bus tunnel iberson said most all of the basement accesses ive seen look about like this basically nothing in them but a few signs directing traffic boldt turned and studied the wall the door had led through it too showed evidence of former windows having been bricked up the hallway they had passed through connected this wall to the bus tunnel boldt stood there for a few seconds all else tuned out he put hebringer and randolf into this spacea transcendental moment when he experienced an actual image of a man dragging an unconscious woman by the arms it was a dreamy jagged image not born of anything that had happened here but his own creation he knew this perfectly well and yet he went with it allowing himself the luxury of a vivid imagination the man had the woman by both wrists her hair cascaded to the floor her blouse ripped her bra pulled down exposing her right breast her head hung to the side lifeless the killer pulled the gray door open only to have boldt find his own left hand on the cool steel metal the killer looked back at him but before boldt could see the face it melted along with the man himself susan hebringer lay on the floor of the manmade hallway connecting the basement to the tunnel her eyes popped open and she looked directly at boldt her face and body changed to that of chen the city street worker chen had been clubbed on the back of the head and was bleeding then he too was gone did you hear anything i just said iberson asked boldt lifted a finger for silence he studied the door as would any sid tech running his fingers along its edge reaching overhead fingering the crack at the hinges in a voice he did not recognize as his own he asked how often are the alarms checked the door alarms he clarified i ah boldt motioned for iberson to step through the fire door with him and the two stood in the steel hallway and boldt pulled the door shut behind them arm the door boldt instructed ibersons hand shook slightly as he keyed the panic bar okay boldt asked okay iberson answered boldt pushed against the doors panic bar and swung the door open no alarm sounded boldt shot iberson a knowing look no fucking way iberson said astonished pardon the french he said covering himself boldt examined the doorjamb and located a wire intended for the panic bar the wires insulating sheath had been cut open a thin blue jumper wire twisted to connect two of the four multicolored wires the main part of the wire had been cut no longer connected to the panic bar boldt pointed out the modification to iberson fuck me iberson said no longer apologetic for his language check the other one boldt said pointing back toward the tunnel iberson took off at a run the hallway was like a jetway at an airport it thundered as iberson ran boldt turned and studied the hallway as iberson stepped through the far emergency door and back into the bus tunnel the man pulled the door shut behind him a moment later when he pushed through it was to silence no alarm ill be goddamned howd you know that ibersons surprise seemed authentic if hed had anything to do with the tampering of these doors he was a damn good actor boldt reasoned it throughthe disarmed doors gave the perpetrator access from both the tunnel and from wherever the basement exit led he reconsidered was it access or an escape route was it both his chest tight with anticipation he knew this was a solid discoverythe tampering all but confirmed it he thought it through again an exit or entrance from the bus tunnel an exit or entrance from the basement of some building up on third avenue it doesnt help him he muttered whats that iberson asked studying the sabotaged wiring on the tunnel door as boldt had on the interior door same story here boldt moved panel to panel along the hallway wall he pushed thumped a fist against the steel then jammed his fingers into the cracks and pulled hard as if trying to open a cabinet that had lost its handle one after the next he proceeded down the length of the hallway crossed over and started up the north side of the hall the third panel away from the bus tunnel rattled loudly when he thumped it with his closed fist he signaled iberson to join him and the two of them ran their fingers into the cracks attempting to pry all at once the panel jumped off its frame several inches it was held by a wirea section of the same colored wire used to bypass the alarm systemstwisted on the far side of the panel in the dark a damp heavy air surged through the open crack it smelled like a swamp in there reaching for a pair of latex gloves boldt said youre going to have to close the southbound tunnel make an excuse like hell in about ten minutes this place is going to be crawling with lab personnel boldt checked his cell phone service no signal ive got to get to the surface he said anxiously in the meantime we lock this up you and i go out together no one touches anything and if anyone asks you tell them it flooded again whatever you want i dont care but i want no mention of police no mention of my visit no mention of the lab guys you screw it up ill not only have your job ill have you in for obstruction are we clear on that i got it iberson said he glanced back at the partially open wall panel and shook his head if i hadnt seen it with you didnt see it boldt said yeah yeah you didnt see it boldt repeated sternly the hell i didnt iberson said i gotta put my boss into the loop you want i can put you two in touch directly closing down a tunnel thats serious business more serious than you think boldt nearly said i saw pay phones on that upper level iberson checked his pants pockets as he shut the eer behind them you got any quarters he asked running blind four out of the six available patrol cars were stationed around the section of downtown defined by second and third avenues and columbia and james respectively the officers on duty in these cars had been issued a be on lookout for any individual most likely male fleeing any door or trapdoor that could be construed to be a part of any building in that block or adjacent to that block basically if anyone or anything looked or moved suspiciously he was to be taken into custody immediately and brought to public safetys central booking the remaining two cars cruised the immediate area these two rovers also monitored the city bus dispatch radio channel on handheld walkietalkies in case a bus driver reported anything unusual the pieces in place and with boldt turning over the underground hallway to sid he and detective second class bobbie gaynes a member of lamoias cap squad and the departments first female homicide detective lowered themselves through the space created by the removal of the steel panel in eer and slipped into the darkness of a section of underground that had likely seen few living people in well over a hundred years boldt might have preferred three or four specially trained urban warriors from the emergency response teamertas backup but such a request would have required a formal appeal to special ops and would have wasted too much time boldts impatience had worn thin as it was it having taken nearly an hour to do what hed been ready to do the moment hed pulled that panel off the air extremely cool and smelling dank and musty hit boldt in the lungs and he nearly coughed he and the detective both carried flashlights with theatrical red gel taped over the light casting a dull reddish purple light that carried only about eight feet helping to protect their approach they ducked and crawled through infrastructuregas pipe and a tangle of wires boldt shone his light behind them illuminating an imposing stone and mortar wall that rose beyond the abilities of his flashlight they climbed over a small mound of chipped and broken brick boldt thought he heard rats scurrying but didnt want to think about it not his favorite household pet he and gaynes emerged onto what had once been a city sidewalk on what had once been a different level of third avenue or whatever theyd called the street in the late s the sidewalk consisted of short heavy redwood planking some of it now rotten most amazingly strong and intact to boldts right he saw the old storefronts ghostly and disturbing overhead more of the clumsy network of pipes and cables braided into an unforgiving mess lamoia had described some of this in his report on the arrest made at the church there really was another city down here boldt realized and the student in him found it somewhat fascinating overhead steel ibeams shouldered a huge pipe that he assumed to be the water main after another ten or fifteen yards the sidewalk gave way to several inches of imposing mudan area that proved to be the edge of the flood wash from the broken main he trained his flashlights red glare down onto the mud where he saw a series of tracksshoe or boot prints a disadvantage of the red light was that it blurred edges with his heart fluttering in his chest boldt leaned closer recent tracks without a doubt chen he wondered the emts or did these belong to someone else the very person boldt now pursued as they waded into the anklehigh muck the sucking sound proved noisy and concerned him boldt led the way careful not to disturb the existing prints that he wanted preserved for collection by sid he was not one to believe in prescience or supernatural gifts it was true that he at times possessed an uncanny ability to place himself inside the head of the victim to experience the crime from this point of view in a visceral almost tangible way but he attributed this to the database of experience he had collected in his head not to an otherworldly spell it was also to this experience that he attributed his and others ability to sense when the trail was hot a skinprickling rush of adrenaline that forewarned the hunter of the proximity of the prey he had this feeling nowa keen sense of foreboding as if a hand might strike from the shadows at any moment ahead of them the narrow tongue of mudcovered sidewalk opened up where to their right a section of the hundredyearold brick wall had collapsed here they could see through and into the subterranean complex viewing a crosssection of its history over the course of decades past walls had been torn down concrete poured steel beams installed sandra babcock and her archaeology team would celebrate a find like this for years to come but for now boldt signaled gaynes ahead leaving the deep mud behind as they continued to follow the busy path of shoe prints he stopped and listened every few yards his hearing more sensitive than most he heard a hissing that he couldnt put a direction onto overhead behind them in the bus tunnel the dull red glow from his flashlight caught the delicate lacework of cobwebs both to his left and right and he realized there were no such obstacles in his pathsomeone had been through here recently enough to clear out the spiderwebs with no more shoe prints to follow the mud now well behind him boldt followed scratch marks on the concrete directing gaynes with hand signals through an open door to the left down a hall and then through another door to the right without a doubt the hissing sound grew louder closer boldt touched his ear and gaynes nodded agreementshe heard it too he caught himself not breathing the tension in the air suddenly palpable he took a long controlled breath and gaynes followed suit she reached for and armed herself with her beretta though she did not chamber a round for the noise it would cause every hair every nerve ending told boldt that something or someone lurked nearby having paused long enough for his eyes to fully adjust boldt experimented by turning off his flashlight gaynes did the same his instinct had been correct enough ambient light existed for him to vaguely see a gray patchwork of the door and wall beyond this patchwork was barely anything more than absolute darkness and yet it was not absolute darkness and this held considerable significance for boldt for it implied the existence of a source of light and that in turn suggested something someone human at that moment the hissing made sense to him a coleman lantern he leaned forward peering around the corner of the rotten doorjamb and down a long corridor several doors to either side the charcoal gray progressed to an elephant gray and by the far end of the hallway a pigeon graythese were the colors that sarah would name and he thought of his children and family as he rounded the corner and stepped into the hallway gaynes close behind neither he nor gaynes wore a vest and he thought it a foolish oversight hed long ago promised liz and himself to avoid harms way whenever possible understanding the importance of keeping their family whole susan hebringer had drawn him down into the underground had clearer thinking prevailed he might have sent lamoia or heiman or someone else the hallway seemed to dim though so faint was any light that he couldnt tell gaynes tapped him on his shoulder switched on her gelcovered flashlight and holding it in her left hand quickly formed a fist around it boldt stopped as the hand signal directed she touched her ear for a moment boldt could hear only the rhythmic pulsing at his temples and the highpitched whine of blood pressure then he understood why the hissing had stopped he heard a hinge creak and this he thought was what gaynes had wanted him to hear at the same instant their twoway radios crackled and screecheda broken signal of code calls from the patrol cars overhead neither boldt nor gaynes had thought to turn their volumes down they might as well have shouted out a warning to whatever or whoever lay up ahead that door creaked again followed by the unmistakable sound of a person running boldt and gaynes as well took off dodging fallen objects ducking out of the way of hanging pipes his head a knot of pain his throat dry those promises made to liz raced to the forefront of his thoughthe was a father a husband he owed people his safety but at the same instant susan hebringer was being dragged down the hallway that he now ran and there was nothing to stop him he rushed through an open doorway and turned left throwing his right hand out in front of him to send gaynes straight into another huge room they split apart the sound of the person running came from farther away not closer he felt he was in some central hallway shared by the back of what had once been stores huge sections of plaster and lathe walls were missing exposing rooms of all sizes shelving overturned furniture and piles of junk he made a wrong turn and found himself in a small room instead of another hallway he turned around and tried another door trapped yet again a maze retraced his steps pushed on a doora hallway at last he charged forward at a run lieu gaynes her voice muffled by walls here lost him his radio carried her voice then as she attempted to alert the patrols up top to keep an eye out boldts radio picked up her signal with ease but the lack of acknowledgment from above indicated the signal was blocked and had not reached anyone else boldt hurried ahead making a series of wrong choices landing in dead ends in rooms cluttered with dusty junk the enormity of an entire city block underground registered in him hed lost his way entirely suddenly facing a series of windows the dirty glass still intact finding himself looking out onto yet another section of sidewalk he used the radio whispering to try not to give away his position gaynes im facing a section of sidewalk looking south i think your tentwenty right here lieu center of the building i think a big room a bar or drugstore maybe anything nothing he waited straining his ears to hear well aware the person who had fled could easily still be down here crouching hiding waiting for a chance to slip away im going to work west and then north circling back toward you he told the radio you hold all eyes copy lights on he said ensuring they could discern one another from the person they pursued copy boldt carefully negotiated his way around the perimeter of the enormous underground city block backtracking and retracing his steps where necessary he crawled under fallen timbers stepped through vacant window holes and eased his way through doorways alert for rotten beams or other debris raining down onto him unannounced alert for his suspect to spring up from behind unexpectedly and take a swing at him he found himself in a full sweat damp and burning up from head to toe the toxin of fear escaping all at once there was more mud boldt wondering if hed gone full circle he stepped through the goop reaching a doorway and scrambled over a hill of metal that had once been a fire escape his flashlight found gaynes looking back at him bewildered gone she said he vanished but who a homeless person susan hebringers abductor chens killer he tried the walkietalkie again to nothing but static he said maybe they got him up top you cant see five feet with these things she tore off the flashlights colored gel boldt did the same they made their way back gaynes in the lead that hissing we heard boldt said announcing what they were after yes she agreed it took them twenty more minutes of false turns and opening doors of hallways and storage closets and more discarded junk and litter than seemed possible before boldt carefully pushed open a door revealing a cluttered livedin room twelve by fifteen feet the former storage room had red brick walls and no windows a mattress with blankets plastic milk crates containing cardboard boxes of food boldts gloved fingers triggered a batterypowered fluorescent and the room came to life this hideaway was an investigators treasure chest its conversion into a living space included a door on cinder blocks that held a camper stove several white plastic tubs filled with water and a box of books boldt picked up immediately on the cleanliness to the air the musky stink of the basement barely discernible only then did it dawn on him that the light in this room was batterypowered not coleman gas and his eyes drifted slowly behind him as he spun around to see a half dozen fourfoottall pressurized tanks green tanks oxygen tanks one of them with its valve cracked open and hissing lieu gaynes asked she knew that perplexed look of his meant he had thought of something she had not boldt said suddenly the elevated oxygen level in the late mr chens blood gas makes a hell of a lot more sense boldt reached down into one of the milk crates and came up with a new years eve party favor the kind that uncurls when you blow into it i think our mr chen might have spoiled someones party misplaced affection with little or nothing to do without her suspension first being lifted matthews made margaret her top priority once again unable and unwilling to take the downtime for herself she knew this obsession with filling her time went beyond accepted limits knew she had real problems when it came to allowing herself to relax knew that at some point such obsessions came to a head and stung you usually when you could least afford it most of all she secretly knew that downtime would allow her the opportunity to take stock of herself to examine her goals and aspirations to come to grips with the fact that she had none beyond getting through the day she had no idea what she wanted for herselfa man a family a career time off independence a hobby a cause if she took time to stop and think of it she feared the emptiness of her current existence might prove too overwhelming currently she lived to solve other peoples problems whether at public safety or the shelter facing her own was nowhere on her radar and this in turn led her back to finding margaret and doing something to help her a call to the shelter confirmed what she already knew because even if margaret had been thinking of staying there by midmorning the place was virtually deserted the girls back on the street there were any number of haunts where she could look for her pioneer square the market the area in front of the westlake center several of the malls sometimes these girls just rode the bus routes back and forth sitting in the last row talking hours at a time as pregnant as she was margaret wasnt stripping wasnt hooking but she might be drugging and this matthews wanted to prevent at all costs the girl had mentioned eating pizza crustsim eating italianbut matthews couldnt remember a particular pizzeria she walked a few more blocks until locating a pay phone that actually had the phone book intact she was flipping through the yellow pages under italian restaurants hoping to jog her memory when her cell phone rang she turned the face of the phone so that she could read it blocked call a sharp shudder passed through her matthews she answered i thought we had a deal walker we do matthews said gripped briefly in a moment of panic the result of surprise she tried not to be too obvious about her looking around for him but felt her senses winning out as she rotated a little too quickly inspecting every corner every shop window every vehicle where the hell are you the temperature felt like it had dropped about thirty degrees then a calm overcame her as she reminded herself that she need not allow him any authority over her the eye of the beholder she thought she warmed she had a job to doboldt wanted her to bring him in by accepting his earlier offer this while allowing him to believe he still maintained the upper hand walker said sure doesnt seem like it to me lets see i offer to help you and you agree then all of a sudden you take off from your place half dressed like some ghost is chasing you then you hook up with dirty harry what is wrong with you i think we should get together and talk about it she said calmly her experience and training finally able to separate out her personal stake in this their discovery of the peepholes at the shelter had profoundly affected her forcing her concern away from herself and onto the girls her determination now was to bring walker in for questioning as boldt wanted im disappointed in you daphne i need your help ferrell i want your help believe me you dont want to disappoint me lifes little lessons come so hard sometimes like something his mother might have said to him no it was all she managed to say you lied to me about helping each other no we can work this out ferrell its not what you think lets get together and discuss it she racked her mind for some carrot to hold out as an offering to him theres a possible witness to maryanns murder she let that sit there a moment a truck driver passing over the bridge at the time we may be able to put neal in a lineup lets talk about thatyou and i she continued to search every crack and cranny for sign of him she didnt believe he had a cell phoneto her knowledge hed never used one in calling herso where was the land line he was using she heard the unmistakable sound of spitting steam and she immediately spun in a circle through a window of a coffee shop on the next corner of the same block she spotted a figure on a pay phone hello he said hed seen her turn around she lost her breath for a moment hello she answered onehanded she worked her purse open and her fingers frantically searched its contents for her wallet wanting the thirtyfive cents necessary to operate the pay phone if she could call through to lamoia if she could allow him to overhear this conversation he might make the connection and send a surveillance unit she hoped in the next few minutes to trick walker into sitting down with her to discuss hebringer and randolf if successful she wanted backup she said my colleagues dont think you could possibly have information about the two missing women theyre wrong he said his voice a hoarse whisper she allowed that change in tone to get to her and again reminded herself not to yield to him she said you need to know that were still determined to build a case against neal that will stick just because he lied about the time doesnt mean he didnt do it i understand that she said but our legal case was fashioned around that lie and we lost ground in the hearing because of that we havent given up believe me in fact she didnt think anyone had done anything on the maryann walker case since the probable cause hearingalthough the lab work continued the forensics will be convincing it takes awhile youre bullshitting me he said youre waiting for me to give you what ive got before you actually do anything thats not how it works she placed a quarter onto the small stainlesssteel shelf she dug for a dime if you start lying to me daphne then whats left we have a witness she repeated a truck driver who saw him on the bridge she heard only his excited breathing and realized the seductive role that hope played in his small existence walker said you would have used him already no it was night dont forget that bridge is dark her mind reeled with how to make this sound convincing her fingers pinched a dime she adjusted her position so he couldnt see her lift the receiver and let it hang she placed her thumb over the cell phones tiny microphone hole and slipped the two coins into the guts of the pay phone they rolled noisily inside she punched out lamoias direct line brought the receiver to her ear and heard him answer dont talk listen she said into the pay phone she awkwardly joined the two phones inverting the pay phones receiver wondering if lamoia could hear any of this she said eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable ferrell we always thought of this guy as a last resort but were ready to play that hand nowwe could arrange a lineupand we just might do that if you agree to share what you know about these missing women god how she hoped lamoia was getting this youre going to suggest we meet no doubt yes i was are you lying to me again daphne would you risk something as stupid as that playing your little games teasing me like walking around that houseboat in that tight tshirt and underwear but never getting naked whats with that anyway her throat went dry he could be making that up she said unable to recall walking around her place dressed like that how could she turn this around back on to him why wouldnt her mind get off that image of him looking in on her halfnaked is that how it was with maryann ferrell youve got us confused dont you was it out on the boat did you watch her youve got us confused dont you did you watch your own sister by herself with lanny neal what shut up his tone told her she had scored a hit and this actually surprised her for shed brought it up only as a distraction something to fill his head with a different image but that tone of his children saw or overheard their parents making love and were never quite the same for the experience with no parents left had ferrell walker spied on his own sister peeped his own sister even with someone else killing her the guilt over having done that would torment him where was it ferrell you at lannys apartment you saw her didnt you saw them however that happened accident or not saw what he was doing to her he spoke barely above a whisper but just enough to be heard how could you know that her arms prickled in gooseflesh she had him going nowher dentists pick probing the cavity and striking the nerve she thought of lamoia and how he unexpectedly put the accelerator down in the turns in order to avoid skidding she too put down the accelerator he was getting things you never got from her and she liked him in a way that she didnt like you and that hurt didnt it you dont know as much as you think again barely discernible indicating shed thrown him deep into thought or recollection these were the moments she lived forshed cracked open his conscience and was climbing inside the process allowed her to intentionally refocus walker onto neal and off of heralso a deliberate act on her part they had neal under surveillance as it was at the very least this effort of hers might provide them the opportunity to apprehend walker as he made another attempt on neal she asked is that where that anger at the medical examiners came from it wasnt just her death was it ferrell it was more than that it was that she liked him loved him even and you were left out in the cold in the process isnt that right she thought of lamoia listening in here i am on one corner of marion and there you are in that coffee shophow much sense does this make ferrell we can sit downthe two of us togetherand discuss this our case against neal what you know about the two missing women maryanns gone but im here for you ferrell here for me i dont think so tell that to dirty harry hes bad for you daphne i warned anna and she ignored me look where it got her her brain froze and she saw the events of the past few days in a whole different light immediately regretting where shed just now so carefully led him walker or prair or whoever had driven her out of her houseboat in a state of panic had also pushed her into lamoias care walker somehow knew this resented it and drew parallels to the loss of his own sister the massive psychological knot this would causefirst the transference on his part then her own mimicking of maryanns shacking up with nealmight never come untangled even in the most cooperative patient walker found himself watching instant replay and she now began to see the complications of events that had changed his tone with her had pushed him across the fine line between adoration and hate its complicated she said suddenly bonetired twinges of fear creeping back up her spine ill show you mine if you show me yours he said suddenly childish again his degree reverse was both too quick and too convincing he was suffering the psychological equivalent of the bends hed surfaced too quickly i wont lie to you ferrell i want whatever help you can give me with the missing women she imagined that by now at least one car was rolling toward their location perhaps even lamoia had gotten the switchboard to forward the call to his cell phone and he was currently listening in while on the way himself why dont you get us a table she said ill come over to the seattles best with you and well sit down and discuss this how many more crumbs did she need to leave lamoia shed both given him the address and named the establishment at this point she felt certain it was safe to leave the pay phone and approach walker ferrell ten oclock tonight you be at the door to the shelter if i see youre alone well talk if not again she heard his shallow rapid breathing she could picture him sweating yet cold excited yet scared dont be stupid daphne she heard the steamer again but a large truck rounded the corner and doubleparked and the sunshine bouncing off it blinded the coffee shops window ferrell she said already dropping the pay phone and moving up the sidewalk toward the coffee shop at first she walked but then as the hum of the room grew louder in her cell phone she began to jog and finally to run the blind spot on the window shrank with her angle as she approached from a blinding silver to black and finally to transparent again the pay phones receiver dangled on the end of its cord lamoias jetta turned and rounded the corner swerving out of the way of the doubleparked truck hed been careful not to show himself on footwas trying to let her know that he was nearby and available as backup but it was too late ferrell walker was gone allieallieincomefree at pm a matter of hours after matthews had spoken to ferrell walker she calmly drove her repaired honda south on first avenue the black leather wallet containing her lieutenants police shield sticking out of the top of her coach purse boldt had obviously pressured captain sheila hill into reinstating her because there had been no review board or formal review shed gotten the call that the meet with walker had been approved and that meant reinstatement the last few hours at spd and public safety had been the mobilization of a surveillance team that included several plainclothes detectives from narco and cap as well as a threeman blackclad ert unit from special ops and even a rooftop sharpshooter boldt had suspended the search of the third avenue underground while sid combed the lair and the surveillance of construction sites continued meaning his manpower was stretched as shed prepared for the meet matthews had asked lamoia to wire her up an invitation usually assigned a fellow member of the same sex the idea was for him to clip and tape the transmitter to her pants to avoid ripping hairs off her skin although not exactly an intimate moment it felt that way to both of them what with him running his fingers inside the waistband of her pants brushing the elastic of her underwear true she wore less clothing showed far more skin at a pool or the gym but men didnt run their hands down your pants at either he couldnt manage to get the tape to stick very well so he ran his fingers even deeper he stepped back suddenly as if shed bitten him listen im not doing such a great job maybe we should get a skirt in here finish it she said unbuttoning her blouse at the navel she fished for the wire he was attempting to pass her she asked would it help if i unbuttoned my pants not unless you have twenty minutes to spare he teased ha ha she said trying to sound like that hadnt fazed her he tested the tape and it held im fine you dont sound fine she said mind your own business when a man has his hand down my pants it most certainly is my business youre playing with me oh yes she said absolutely i love to see you squirm im not squirming of course you are he grunted again she teased him finish the job and get your hands out of my underwear youre nervous thats what this is about right your nerves you really know how to woo a girl woo the tape finally held her fingers caught the wire he passed and she drew the small mike up inside her blouse she unbuttoned yet another button of her blouse and clipped the lavaliere to the elastic bridge connecting the cups turning to face him as she buttoned herself for a moment she allowed herself to believe he blushed with the sight of her you have a real way with the women she said thats what they say she brushed herself off smoothing the blouse he looked a little too closely and pursed his lips bunching his mustache shed never liked mustaches much a cry for help he said repeating a possible explanation of walkers behavior that she had raised at an earlier meeting if i have it rightand remember i may notthen theres a psychological progression walkers going through a decline that has everything to do with what is more than likely confusion over his relationship with his sister neals stealing maryann from him neals abuse of maryann the subsequent murder and then walkers transference of his need to protect maryann over to me transference comes in all flavors john from lite to extrastrength he latches on to me he follows me for reasons known only to him he has chosen me to represent maryann in his life maybe hes just trying to gather the courage to tell me something i dont know maybe he saw more of the murder than hes shared with us that wouldnt surprise mehis guilt over watching them in the first place preventing him from telling us exactly what went down it would also explain his conviction to see neal put away for this crime but hebringer and randolf im not pretending i have the answers she said unbuttoning her pants and tucking in her shirt the act itself implying an immodesty that clearly surprised him i could be way off base with any of this my original thinking was that he didnt know anything more about hebringer and randolf than what hed read in the papers but that he recognized a way to bait me into meeting him im still camping on that side of the river lamoia said but the way he made this meetpreempting what was to be an attempt on my part to arrange something inside something contained something that worked better for us and the fact that lou likes walker being positively ided for having been in the underground and then this guy getting away from lou and bobbie down there and lou never liking coincidences and suddenly thinking walker could either have something on hebringer and randolf or might even be a part of it himself and here we are here we are lamoia echoed she felt his objection to her playing this role and appreciated his restraint in not verbalizing it doing her damnedest to appear collected and composed she said calmly listen john i think we pushed him over the edge with neal walking away from the probable cause hearing and with my subsequent attempt to distance myself from him it was a bad judgment call on my part if he misses maryann as much as i think he does then at some point he will come after me this level of obsession leads to abduction its my turf i know what im talking about she said answering his head shaking no it could be for something as innocent as a confessionconfiding his guilt about knowing more than hes told usor something more serious and if he should get me he will not get you you need to think unconventionally something youre good at neals apartment is a possibility the family homethis place he lost when the business went bad a trawler is entirely possible she met eyes with lamoia and lowered her voice these places hold significance for him hell take me to someplace that holds significance he will not if you guys lose me she interrupted id check those places i just mentioned first the aurora bridge after that jesus youre as sick as he is she continued in her businesslike tone if i go missing john dont do it by the book promise me that times the enemy okay hes an organized personality he knows what hes doing he lives to control the situation when he senses hes lost control as he did earlier he takes action that alone separates him from what you guys think of as loonies trust me if he should get me and then lose control of the situation she couldnt complete that thought even in her own head just find me john and fast however you have to do it just find me cross my heart said the alltime rule breaker lamoia opened his arms an improbable invitation from a guy like him she stepped forward cautiously afraid he might make a joke of it but he didnt and so she held herself close to his chest the thumping of his heart like timpani she tried to think of something amusing to say to cushion the moment for them both but the feeling of his arms around her of that absolute sense of safety lodged a walnut in her throat and she couldnt get a word out she squeezed and he squeezed her back and for a fleeting moment there was absolute peace in her world driving now past the all nude storefronts a wino walking unsteadily behind a grocery cart filled to overflowing the tourists intermingled with the citys subculture neither acknowledging the other she marveled at the tolerance at the coexistence of two such diverse cultural strata she felt herself being injected into this like a vaccine into tainted blood down through pioneer square where groups clustered around street musicians where grayhaired hippies sold trinket jewelry from the tops of cardboard boxes and college kids waited in lines outside the music clubs test one two she said into the empty car her dashmounted motorola squawked and called back copy that decoy she hadnt liked the moniker assigned her for this operation but it wasnt her place to comment on it a few turns later she pulled into the church lot marked private parking strictly enforcedvehicles will be towed and slipped the cardboard permit onto her dash before locking up she wore her hair over her ears in order to cover the tiny ear bud that carried the network of radio traffic surrounding her surveillance she tested the gear once more as she dumped her keys into her purse okay boys im all yours copy that decoy the calm voice returned softly in her ear no jokes from dispatch no humor these radio operators were the grumpy librarians of police work she reached the overhang and the door in the side of the church that led down to the shelter at five minutes before ten five minutes ahead of schedule the sky opened up with a drizzle that felt like the misters over vegetable stands in supermarkets she thought sarcastically how perfect it was to further complicate things with the added hassle of the raintraffic would slow longdistance surveillance would be more obscured and any rightthinking person would seek some kind of shelter from it making the undercover roles harder to play effectively without standing out she listened in her one ear to the radio reports from the observation points outside her houseboat for boldt didnt put it past walker to use the meet to buy himself a chance to get inside her houseboat either souvenirseeking or in order to await her return there the rain was apparently stronger over lake union and one of those keeping surveillance reported a redandblack umbrella on the dock unable to identify the person holding it thats a neighbor matthews said barely moving her mouth in case she was being watched by walker the redandblack umbrella belonged to robert a man who could have played stunt double to ernest hemingway if they hassled robert shed hear about it for months to come location by location the four undercover detectives and the leader of the ert squad reported into dispatch confirming their positions reporting sightings considered possibles for walker filling the radio with activity where no such activity existed in the real world she knew that lamoia had parked the jetta on the second floor of the car park engine out and was sitting in the cars backseat making it more difficult for others to spot him keeping an eye on her through the cars back window she felt the attention of all those eyes and ears both onstage and exposed for all to see if and when her moment came with walker it would be recorded videoed and analyzed as would any subsequent interrogation she felt uncomfortable in the spotlight even a little sick to her stomach as it didnt feel much different to her than walking around her houseboat certain someone was watching someone was watchingmany someonesand for a person accustomed to doing the watching she found the reversal of roles unpleasant going on vulgar walker himself was no doubt watching as well and she could only hope he couldnt see or sense the swarm of protection that had been created around her for she felt certain it would put him off and prevent him from approaching her when she needed to speak to dispatch she would fake a small cough fist to mouth and quickly talk nothing so far she reported immediately identifying it as an amateurish comment tagging herself a desk jockey for all in the communications truck to laugh at and make fun of her she felt tempted to just stomp off and forget about this whole thinglet them find some other way to collar walker but a bigger part of her wanted this resolved both for her own saketo get walker off her caseand for boldts because she thought he was putting too much faith in walkers connection to hebringer and randolf standing there in the light rain the object of so much attention she felt an added pressure to reassemble the various parts into something that made sense something that explained hebringer and randolf and felt maddeningly frustrated when she failed after repeated tries what could walker tell her that they didnt already know did prairs lurking abouthis possible stalking of herhave to do with his infatuation with her or his involvement in maryann walkers life prior to her going off that bridge how could anyone consider a man with lanny neals past an innocent in all this round and round she went the minutes ticking by walker was late or out there studying her along with the othersthe reports in her earpiece identifying first a homeless man on the street corner behind the church and then finally possible solid heading for decoy from southeast corner of lot matthews saw the figure coming still at a considerable distancehe was the approximate height of walker blue jeans a dark sweatshirt with a hood covering his head he walked with purpose either to reach matthews in a hurry or to get out of the rain she tensed and warmed with his approach she found the radio traffic in her left ear distracting as dispatch calmly assigned new positions to two of the undercover detectives in the field placed ert on alert to the suspects current location and asked the sharpshooters to stand down their rifles until further notice matthews knew this meant nothing more than that they were ordered to keep their fingers off the triggerno sharpshooter took his eye off the sight orders or not she resolved to do as little talking as possiblewalker had wanted the clandestine meeting let him do the talking the closer that figure drew the less matthews thought he looked right for walker and the greater her sense of dread his hips moved a little too fluidly the gait of this persons walk didnt feel like walker at all hed sent a surrogate someone to deliver a message her muscles had frozen she wished like hell that rattle in her ear would stopcouldnt they just shut up the approaching persons right arm lifted and both she and that voice in her ear had the same thought at the same moment a knife the sharpshooters were readied ert was assigned a red alert but nothing glittered in the pale cast of the overhead bulb no metal sparkled the hand grabbed hold of the hood and stripped it off the head short hair but spiked smooth skin a nose stud it was a young woman heading for the shelter nothing more you on a break the girl asked matthews who held out faint hope she still might be a messenger something like that waiting for someone matthews vaguely recognized the facecarmine caroline carley in this piss the girl asked is it carley yeah youre matthews right the cop word got around quickly her reputation as a cop could distance her from these girls forever orit occurred to her a beat too latewas carley testing that she had the right person for the message thats right is it full she asked pointing to the door sometimes the shelter posted a volunteer out here at the entrance to notify late arrivals of the lack of occupancy there was a sign that served the same purpose but the girls rarely paid it much attention for the first time in the last fifteen minutes her earpiece mercifully went silent the com officer had switched it off both to allow her to think clearly and to ensure the suspect didnt hear any ambient highpitch chatter coming from it matthews hadnt bothered to check inside but she told the girl there were still beds available her nerves on edge that walkers message was yet to come i didnt know you smoked carley said mistaking matthewss electing to stand barely protected from the rain youre okay miss matthews carley reached for the door handlea large wroughtiron ring matthews stepped out of the way asking is there something you want to tell me carley looked at her strangely a message from someone maybe matthews pressed carley paused and matthews could feel it coming the girl hesitated the door open now and said margaret got herself that place south of the safe her and this other girl is that what you mean margaret again that same pang hit her in the chest oh was all she managed to say carley stepped through the door her footfalls on the stone receding into the basement enclave the earpiece popped and matthews heard dispatch stand down a number of the participants in the surveillance operation these commands were nearly immediately followed by a male voice interrupting and identifying itself only as gray with police radio codes a combination of numerals operatives were given a variety of different handles from animal names like wolf and dumbo to nicknames like sparky and hooter to colors of every kind we got ourselves a crossdresser people headsup kcsoeightynine is incoming from yesler eightynine matthews clarified forgetting to try to cover her speaking for the sake of the mike eight nine affirm gray replied co dispatch lets run a check on that south the instruction was back to public safetythe south precinctand the spd radio dispatcher monitoring the radio traffic normally the commanding officer would monitor from there as well but she knew boldt was more than likely in the command van unnecessary matthews said she glanced toward the second level of the parking garage and the area where she knew lamoia was sequestered longing all of a sudden for some kind of contact with him a sardonic turn of phrase a comforting look something to make this okay because this did not feel okay she allowed herself to believe she saw movement up there at the back of one of the cars her imagination she wondered lamoias voice came urgently from a handheld radio through the dispatch communications and into her left ear she allowed herself to believe hed somehow sensed that longing shed felt listen decoy hes on bus detail over at so we know this for fact right so he could have made your tentwenty in the course of the job do not jump to conclusions you got it hang in there treat it as a right thing let the fish come to you acknowledge copy that she said her fist to her mouth once again slipping back into her role effortlessly why just the sound of his voice should calm her she had no idea but it had and she wasnt asking any questions gray hes pulling over one block north on yesler this struck her as odd if this was the normal course of duty as lamoia had suggested but she endeavored to stay calm co dispatch officer on foot heading south decoy hes yours in five four three two she picked up prairs large silhouette as he passed a hedgerow and walked into the parking lot on foot he walked with his usual confidence stiff spine and military demeanor lieutenant he said avoiding use of her first namea first deputy prair she said for the sake of the tape recorders out there an uneasy silence settled between them as he stepped up to her only a few feet away what is it you want he asked what are you talking about she said the message what message the message said youd be waiting here at ten pm that you wanted to see me you want to try again i got the message lieutenant she said i dont know what you mean but you could start by explaining your presence at the end of my dock last night a gust of wind tossed her hair prairs face tightened and for the first time he glanced around as if sensing the surveillance the wind blew again a mixture of rain and cold air this time and as he reached out and moved her hair off her neck a move that briefly terrified her she realized he hadnt sensed anything hed spotted the wire from the earpiece what the hells going on here you got a thing going here you stepped into that thing she said you squirreled it i was told to meet you here what is it with you deputy i got a message said you wanted to see me a written message she asked central took it while i was on patrol i bet they did listen lieutenant save it matthews said well have a chat over at public safety sort this all out such were the instructions she received from dispatch through the earpiece im on ten minutes lost time he complained well well make it an hour matthews said i got a message check it out central will have a record of it coming in she stepped up to him her anger rising youve got all the bases covered dont you he held up his hands like he wanted no part of it i dont know whats going down here lieutenant but if i squirreled things i was set up blue boldts voice hollered over her earpiece blue crash the nest on my authority you crash the nest right now her houseboat she understood then that boldt believed walker had used the meet as a distraction had used prair to cement that distraction and that the ultimate goal of that distraction had been to penetrate the houseboat prair backed up out into the rain dont go anywhere deputy you got this wrong lieutenant he appeared intent on breaking into a run stay where you are deputy this is not my thing matthews you got that wrong im going back to my car my route i dont need no trouble too late she informed him you stepped into it now weve got to clean it up to apologize he barked out winning her full attention she tugged the noisy earpiece from her ear he was beginning to get wet in the rain i was there at your place the dock to apologize swear to god for the way ive been the stuff ive done i fucked up not telling you about ticketing the walker woman that was wrong i wanted to come clean for that try to set things straight my car she said stepping closer and driving him back a like amount this parking lot that parking garage she said pointing to where she knew lamoia was watching that was you i should have told you about the moving violation that was stupid he wouldnt admit to any role in the sabotage of her honda all of it nathan or none of it you cant put filters on this he moved another step back wearing frightened eyes i was there to apologize he repeated nothing more a pair of plainclothes detectives entered the parking lot at a jog youre offcom lieutenant one of them called out were all done here thanks to roy rogers he said addressing prair you won yourself a backstage pass to the fifth floor and were your personal escorts sir they stood to either side of the deputy you got this wrong he said to matthews well see about that she said back to him but she felt halfconvinced that he was right and that left her all the more confused alone again nathan prair invoked his right to a guild representative a lawyer ahead of his interview effectively nullifying that any such interview would take place and through the process casting additional suspicion onto himself he was released pending a board hearing though it seemed unclear any such hearing would ever take place as spd had little authority to remand a deputy sheriff it would take the attorneys some time to sort this all out boldt threw a fit in the situation room angry at his team for the failed surveillance operation the bungled intelligence furious with walker for having stung them he ordered lamoia to orchestrate a sweep of all known locations for walker in a bid to bring him in for questioning lamoia broke a key off his key ring and handed it to matthews asking if shed mind feeding rehab when she returned to his loft theres no reason to go back to your loft john although i appreciate the offer the hell there isnt weve had the houseboat under surveillance all night long twice it has been searched and swept top to bottom its probably the safest place in the city right now its on our hotspot list matthews dont give me shit about this were going to roust every homeless haunt in this city in the next couple hours i need all hands on deck for that we will not be watching your crib we will not be sweeping your crib youll stay at my place at least one more night maybe longer its that or a hotel you know the sarge you know the drill this is not me darlin you want to complain you go over my head i will be my guest her bluff having failed she winced and tried to charm her way out of this requirement how bout i feed blue and then go over to my place she wasnt sure why shed attached so fiercely to the idea of independenceshe didnt actually relish the idea of being alone in the houseboat yet something compelled her not to accept his offer she felt it showed weakness to accept leave just one guy to watch my dock walkers a fisherman matthews hes probably just as likely to try a water approach i dont have the manpower even if i did i couldnt justify it to a lieutenant who doesnt want you staying there do me a favor dont make me take another meeting with the sarge hes in a stink i dont need it not tonight if we turn up walker ill promise to call and let you in on it okay it hadnt occurred to her that they might not include her in on this interrogation but with her as the victim it suddenly made sense the number im going to call is my own loft not your cell you copy that he added in the meantime im going to advise dispatch that youll continue to wear the wire right up until you undress for bed okay she gave him a look he said dont give me that this is not kinky its just on the off chance this guys holding another ace he wouldnt let her get a word in edgewise dont forget matthews it was you who put this notion into my head that this bozo might be cozying up to nabbing you not the other way around you got any peeves you take it up with the lady in the mirror not me okay she resolved herself to the notion that attending walkers interrogation was far more important to her than where she laid her head for a night besides secretly with all his gab lamoia had convinced her she didnt want to spend the night alone anyway having a dog and a cop down the hall was just fine with her the wind gusted as if someone had switched on a fan elliott bay whipped up into a whitecapped froth that rocked the lumbering ferries side to side upon reaching lamoias loft matthews had initially misunderstood blues incessant whining believing the dog missed its master as did she only to realize he needed a trip around the block to relieve himself donning one of lamoias slickers and an old felt hat matthews set out for a quick trip around the block bringing the beretta along in the righthand pocket as a security blanket the formerly industrialized neighborhood was a hubbub of commerce by daya coffee shop a rug store a gourmet market a magazine and newspaper specialist a smoke shopbut by night little more than a rolledup sidewalk in a loft neighborhood the curb lined with range rovers and troopers the blackleatherjacket set strolling in pairs during good weather renting dvds and staying home when it rained blue left his mark on a few dozen vertical surfaces from the corners of buildings to no parking signposts he staked his territory out like a surveyor marking a street corner and actually waiting for her to lead him across the street when the slanting rain hit she thought of her partially open bedroom windowof many of the lofts windowsand picked up the pace of her return a drizzle was one thing but this kind of sideways storm could soak the place perhaps it was nothing more than the anxiety of wanting to seal the loft from the storm and the accompanying adrenaline that pumped into her system but a few minutes after she picked up her pace a few minutes into realizing that she and blue were inauspiciously alone out on this streetwhere had everyone gone an agitation overtook her like the feeling when a limb aches and itches from the inside out that awful feeling begged her to check ahead of her and behind left to right in an increasingly frantic effort to see if anyone was following her paranoia swept over her as quickly as had the wind when blues pace quickened the nails of his paws scratching the sidewalks concrete in a flurry of sharp strokes it drove her heart rate faster pushed her legs first into a jog and finally an outright run the two of them in competition now blue heeling to her side his wet tongue dangling matthews lifting her knees rocking her ankles controlling her breathing to where they closed the last two blocks back to the building in a fullon sprint winded and yet laughing as she told blue what a good dog he was she let them back into the building and took the stairs eschewing the assistance of the elevator it felt much warmer than when theyd left she reached the apartment door slipped the key into three of the five locks available and unlocked it she unclipped the leash patted blue on the head and was hanging the slicker back onto the coat tree when blues slobbering turned her around the dog was licking the floor he glanced up toward matthews as he did soas if he knew betterput his nose to the plank flooring and then advanced several feet and licked again for a moment matthews thought how cute a sight it was but that moment passed quickly followed by an inaudible sucking for air in a room that suddenly offered none blue was licking water off the floorwater in the form of wet boot prints blurred vision a moment earlier while out on the street matthews had been feeling sorry for herself for being alone now she wondered if she were alone and wished more than ever that she was she wondered if shed tracked those prints into the apartment a half hour earlier herself had they already been there then and shed simply missed them because of blues pestering john she called his name three times each louder than the previous attempt she backed up and blindly reached behind herself never averting her eyes from the expanse of the loft and its long wall of rainstreaked windows water tangled on the surface like silver thread with her right hand she unlocked each of the three door locks that she had relocked only moments beforeshe wanted a quick exit if needed her left hand searched the slicker located the beretta and slipped it quietly out of the pocket she switched off its safety chambered a round and took it in both hands barrel pointing down and slightly to her side she cleared her throat as she spoke blue lifted his head attentively i am armed she called out loudly into the room i will shoot on sight go away now or announce yourself i repeat i am armed and dangerous she thought she squatted an act that blue took as an invitation to be petted friskily trotting his way over to her she pushed the dog out of the wayan act he took to mean she wanted to play she pushed him again blue nuzzled her nearly tipping her over one set of prints the beaded water thicker to her right lessened to her left the soles of the shoes having shed most of the rainwater after only a few steps the angle of the track suggested an origin in the guest roomher bedroom go away now she hollered again to blue she whispered find him motioning out into the room the dog looked at her curiously nearly obeying but holding by her side uncertain of the game find him she repeated the dog thumping its tail a mixture of excitement and confusion she stepped deeper into the room her head light her arms heavy she considered turning around and running but only briefly she was done running tired of playing the victim sometimes the role of victim was a product of ones situation sometimes it came down to a matter of attitude a series of choices she was the one with the training the one with the pistol the one with the determination it was walkers turn to fear her prairs turn to fear her she reconsidered those shoe prints slowly convincing herself that they were hers as the mind is wont to do under such pressure she wasnt about to squat and spend more time inspecting the floor wasnt going to be caught off guard by the intruder walker she called out loudly moving cautiously through the loft blue panting at her side she swung the weapon still aimed at the floor in front of her right to left left to right a slowly tracking metronome sweat trickled down her jaw as she flashed with heat her eyes dry and stinging the windows rattled in unison behind a gust of wind the air smelled of seawater and fresh rain a combination that on any other night she would have found pleasant even intoxicating just get me through this she pleaded internally given the lofts open floor plan and vastness of space she felt like a bug in a terrariumsome unseen monstrous eyeball tracking her as she moved her mind raced a restless impatience nagging at her to clear the room as quickly as possible secure the door and windows and then call lamoia blue followed on her heels a worried whine escaping him like a leaking balloon lamoia would return home at some point she reminded herself one option was to get her back against a wall with a good view of the entire room and simply wait for his return she could callget someone down here regardless of the hour lou would come to her aid in a matter of minutes if asked the possibility of coincidence existed as remote as it seemed to her at that moment some street skel some addict could have broken into the apartment looking to heist what wasnt nailed down blues whining irritated her she wished hed make like a dog and go flush the intruder instead of skulking behind her like a frightened child she cleared lamoias bedroom bath and closet first moving around and through the doorjambs nervously in the jerky fashion to which she was trained shed not been in this part of the loft yet and she tried not to pay any attention to the neatness of the room the stack of selfhelp books by the bed the perfectly folded towels on the chair that sat next to the ironing board that was no stranger to where it stood this suite of rooms told her more about the man than five dinners out would she left the master opened and inspected two oversized coat closets again marveling at the level of organization in each and moved through the kitchendiningliving space glancing toward the front door and making sure it remained shut with only two more hallway closets one of them a narrow linen closet and an unlikely hiding place the guest bath and the guest bedroom to go she picked up the pace less nervous less anxious than only minutes earlier blue had stopped whining leaving her side in the kitchen to go lap at a bowl of water his tongue slapped at the surface his collar chimed on the bowls edge she moved closer to this the final room to inspect and clear im armed she repeated for the benefit of hearing herself speak her voice carrying little of the urgency or authority it had only minutes before a part of her felt as if she were playacting that the role of tough cop was ill suited for her she understood and lived with the fact that she was far more feminine than most women on the force being one of the girls required a toughness of attitude that shed never acquired she was more woman than cop more psychologist than cop regardless of title rank or training hovering at the door to lamoias guest bedroom the beretta beginning to weigh a hundred pounds at the end of her quivering arms she thought herself a poor example of the woman cop these seeds of selfdoubt sprouted within her and she found herself distracted rather than pitchperfect tautnerved rather than ready for combat a movement or a soundshe wasnt sure whichtripped an internal alarm someone was just outside the loft she jumped into the guest room leveled her weapon and saw no one she quickly locked the window checked under the bed under the desk and then hurried to the front door grabbing her keys a moment later she and blue were descending the apartment buildings stairs in a flurry of footwork matthews suddenly wanting a confrontation wanting closure she had taken a flashlight of lamoias from its plastic wall bracket on the way out but found it clunky and awkward to hold in an overunder fashion with the handgun as she descended to ground level she eased open the buildings stairwell back door buffeted by the wind the waters edge was a couple of steel warehouses away theyd be gone soon enough condos in their place she didnt want blue getting loose so she sneaked out the door without him immediately winning a complaint of incessant barking from the other side the fire door clicked shut behind her to reenter the building shed need to reach the front door her back pressed to the wet wall her nerves jumpy in the rain and dark she swung the light and weapon around in what to others might have appeared to be a random haphazard motion but to her was a methodical sweep of the area she walked up and over a low stack of shipping pallets the wood creaking beneath her she knew that the fire escape outside her westfacing window would terminate around the corner on the west wall a part of her didnt want to confirm that its ladder was down but that was how she found it a moment later and the discovery pumped enough adrenaline into her to run a marathon her vision blurred by the wind and rain she cast the light about looking for him searching for him prying the light into dark shadow in hopes of revealing him she caught her finger on the trigger and an eagerness in her heart this was blood lust something shed read about something others had told her about in sessions but unlike anything shed experienced she wanted the excuse she was ready to use the excusea bad shooting or not she found herself preparing to do the unthinkable that thought made her recall prair and suddenly in the midst of the wind and rain and the provocative urge to eliminate ferrell walker from the face of gods earth a pinprick of light formed at the end of what seemed a very long tunnel she pushed these thoughts aside where they belonged but the thought process had begun it churned away inside her running in her subconscious like a computer virus just waiting to spring up when least expected the overhead lights down by the warehouses flickered once a warning of a faulty wire the water level reached through her clothes and undergarments to her skin invoking a chill wet or not she continued around the perimeter of the enormous building aiming the flashlight as much overheaddirectly into the rainas anywhere else hoping to catch movement on the fire escape fear proved itself as insidious as ever infiltrating her steely resolve suddenly she wanted nothing more than to be back in the loft locked up safe and sound the idea of shooting walker seemed far less urgent than that of finding dry shelter and warmth if anything she felt bare and exposed the penetrating cold wet rainwater making her feel far more vulnerable than she had only minutes before you motherfucker she shouted up toward the sky not knowing who had said that nor where it had come from her arms shook the flashlight dimmed smothered by the curtain of water shed been dragged out here against her better judgment against her true will manipulated in a way that felt both invasive and repugnant in an effort to end it shed resorted to his rules his game and this proved the most offensive of all far away she heard blues hysterical barking beyond that the dull grind of a jets turbines and the low grumble of a ships engine or thunder again she debated calling for backup but she knew damn well that those who cried wolf quickly found themselves out of the pack she reentered the apartment building lacking confidence one circling of the building carried with it a lingering doubt about who she was and what she was after she retrieved blue from the stairwell and climbed the stairs a sodden dispirited shell of her former self whoever had entered the apartment had beaten her and she resented the hell out of it if theyd taken anything theyd stolen a part of her as well the lights in lamoias apartment flickered and she cursed under her breath she didnt need any more drama at the moment she wanted nothing more than to be locked up nice and tight warm dry safe and sound soaking wet she patrolled the loft yet another time inspecting every corner every closet resolved that she was indeed alone and protected behind a series of deadbolt locks she doublechecked the window in her guest room worked a chain to lower a bamboo shade closed the door placing a ladderback chair against the knob and undressed quickly getting out of the wet clothes she pulled on a tshirt and a pair of underwear and the familiar sweatpants and ran a brush through her hair before crossing the kitchen and boiling water for tea reinforced with the hot chamomile she talked to blue about nothing at all found him a dog biscuit and fed it to him from a stool at the kitchen bar after that he sat at attention by that stool unflinchingly devoted to her she hated herself for wishing lamoia would return home sooner than later she didnt want to go to bed without him being in the apartment without relating her harrowing story of finding wet shoe prints down the center of his living room without garnering some tiny amount of sympathy for what shed been through never mind that it was her fault in the first place staring over the brim of her teacup at the apartment and its appointments she immediately saw what was wrong then nothing nothing was out of place not one thing at least that she could see if a common thief one would expect a drawer or two left hanging open a tv or dvd player gone missing her hand hovered over the phone she could call lamoia and ask how long he thought hed be better yet she could find some clever way to determine his schedule and let him know someone had prowled his apartmentthat was certain to bring him home in a matter of minutes but if lou boldt had put him on an assignment and she subsequently pulled him off that assignment there would be hell to pay lou was clearly jealous of their closeness as it wasmisplaced jealousy as far as she was concerned aggravating that wound hardly made sense furthermore boldts efforts were aimed at bringing walker in for questioning she had no desire to hinder those efforts she glanced toward the guest bedroom and thought better of it she didnt want to fall asleep there was a tv in lamoias bedroom the size of texas she thought she might invite herself to surf for a movieanything to fill the time anything but sleep working the room lamoia got himself into more jams than a jar of peanut butter he had a penchant for it and why they always always seemed to involve womenattractive womenwas beyond him except to say that some guys were just lucky cindy martin would have immediately won lamoias attention even if she hadnt been identified in phone company local usage details or luds as the person maryann walker had called at pm on the night of her death the last call placed that day from lanny neals apartment lamoia had read and reread the interview sheet on her a cap detective name louis gilgau had spent nearly an hour interviewing her one of about ten such interviews lamoia now had the job to reinterview because boldt had ordered him to do sostill convinced that walkers offer to help with hebringer and randolf made him of prime importance to that investigation as well as to his sisters murder lamoia would have noticed her not because of her chest a substantial example of high breasts on a long waist not because of the farmgirl innocence of her face nor the faraway stare across the relatively empty barroom but instead because of her fashion sense martin was one of those women who continues to dress the same and wear her hair the same as she had in high school she still looked the same age as a result if lamoia were to pick a pinup girl from a catalog hed be hard pressed to do better than cindy martina buxom farmgirl blonde with hands like a man and eyes with the intensity of an assassin hey there lamoia said pulling himself up onto a bar stool and checking out the deerskin jacket in the bars mirror to make sure it hung right hi youre cindy youre the cop that called she said about ferrell walker he reminded like i told the other guy i only dated him a couple of times dated lamoia asked he didnt remember reading a thing about that how could gilgau leave that out i thought the connection was maryann was yeah sure but you dated ferrell not for long nothing serious im trying to find him so you said she met eyes with him hers a cool grayblue that he was sure could look frightening if she were mad at you they could make you feel other things too you dated him recently two years ago he understood then why gilgau would have discounted the importance that was ferrell walker the fisherman the ferrell walker before the fall brought on by his fathers death and his sisters deserting the family business he asked a week a month a couple months or what he couldnt see this girl with someone so unworthy sympathy fucks were one thinghed had a few himselfbut sympathy relationships or what she answered cute he said not meaning it she left him tending to a bearded customer in need of another pilsner lamoia thought about a drink but it was seriously offlimits so were pills though hed transferred the two hed stolen from matthews into his clean pair of jeans and there they remained in a coin pocket only the thickness of denim from his enjoyment when she returned she said off and on he was fishing then so it wasnt exactly steady between us it was fun because we did things with maryann thats all but it kind of lacked chemistry you know she leaned into him with that twin pair of headlightsher eyes and the ones in the sweaterand induced enough electricity to fry a pacemaker he understood the sign behind the bar then that warned of the health risks associated with the use of microwaves probably guys dropping like flies around there before the sign went up well if it was a lack of chemistry he heard himself say it wasnt any fault of yours mikey liked it he wasnt sure what drove him to say such things but there you are he wasnt sure about a lot of things he didnt lose any sleep over it that other cop called you guys are better in person offduty we get even better where the hell had that come from dont doubt it for a minute she glanced over at the clock im off at twelve less than twenty minutes i was on night duty for all of march these past few days it has been pretty much twentyfourseven its hell on your social life i doubt you suffer too much she said turning to the bottles after a signal for a vodka on the rocks and overexaggerating the effort as she stretched to reach it she caught him looking at her assets in the bars mirror write me a ticket he called out to her not missing a beat you busted me on that one she grinned bit her bottom lip free country she said and me he said im supposed to keep it that way she poured the vodka returned the bottle with a lot less effort and delivered the drink looked like maybe a twodollar tip for a fourdollar drinkmaybe the gymnastics hadnt been for his sake after all woman knew her trade walker claimed to a colleague that lanny neal had gotten maryann jammed up with drugs that he did stuff to her a guy shouldnt do not the good stuff he added sounds like ferrell listen maryann was a big girl with lanny nealyou got the reputation if you know what im saying he could be hell on a woman sure but he was hell with the women too got it she knew what to expect she could have walked you think course she could have except he got under her skin i suppose she leaned forward on the bar again some guys do that women dont tolerate abuse because theyre addicted to the sex he said its because they fear where itll go if they ditch out you believe that shit its in the manual that way he said trying to win back some lost ground he didnt know if he wanted that ground for himself or so he could continue to work her that confusion disturbed him uncharted territory this since his recovery dangerous ground even part of his distraction were the two pills in the coin pocket the other part was looking him in the eye she laughed a good laugh from the gut with her shoulders raked forward youre a piece of work thats what they say she could hardly believe hed said that neither could he ten minutes to twelve he had some decisions to make he said bad luck what happened to her is it true lanny did it were still working that out what do you think me that seemed to floor her under different circumstances no from what ive read about it if shed been wearing more clothes something like this id say it was just plain bad luck wrong place wrong time its a different town than it was ten years ago right youve got to see more of that than the rest of us whole different place but i dont knowunderwear and a tshirt that makes sense for her going to bed like that and if she was going to bed thats lanny so id say youve got the right guy we dont have him lamoia said this confused her but i thought there was just a hearing there was he realized that people close to maryann like cindy martin had stayed up on events once again amazed at the connection the media supplied so theres gonna be another one the paper said maybe not no shit no shit he said depends on what we turn up wheres ferrell fit in top secret he teased making light of it he lied walkers a character witness in all this weve got to make sure we got someone we can trust ferrells okay just okay maybe thats not good enough in ballet you ever been to ballet they say youve lost your point the arch of the foot just cant take it anymore and you lose your point and youre basically finished dancing after the accident maryanns dad im talking about not her ferrell lost his point lost me too lost maryann to neal within a year hed lost everything else their daddy held those kids together fucked up the boat most all the time the fishing pissed them both off drank too much sure but he held them together him drowning like that probably should have seen it coming but it fucked ferrell up worse than maryann father son i suppose go figure never heard that point expression he hadnt heard a great deal of this but he didnt want her necessarily knowing that yeah you dont strike me as the ballet type im adaptable he said winning another smile from her why do i doubt that he says ferrell this is that neal was pretty brutal on maryann put her in the emergency room a couple times i dont know about that the way she told it that stuff happened out on the boat her and ferrell out there trying to keep it going without their dad i wouldnt be so sure about that it wouldnt be the first weve heard about lanny neal and his women he said listen hes no prince lanny has a wicked temper no question about it if lanny was on meth no thank you makes him goddamn crazy that stuff he and maryann were practically married did i notice when she walked funny or couldnt use a bum arm sure i did but im telling you she said it happened out fishing and i believed her not many girls work those boats and those that do dont do it for very long id take a sam adams if you had one he thought about those pills again how easily theyd go down she drew him a draught beer he paid with a five and left a couple bucks on the bar he nursed the beer not really in the mood to drink but wanting to be a paying customer she said let me get stan to fill in behind the bar ill catch up with you over in one of the booths the look she offered him took the darkness out of the dim room ten minutes passed before she joined him she brought him a fish and chips telling him he looked like he could use it she suggested vinegar on the fish ketchup on the fries tell me about this accident lamoia said whats to tell mr walker was a drunk in this business she said glancing around the dark barroom you get so you can spot them believe me growing up i didnt know it but trust me the guy was a fool for peppermint schnapps she shook like a wet dog to show her disdain the stuff makes me want to puke and he died how fell overboard into his own net shit happens what can i tell you and ferrell gets the boat it damn near destroyed him the old mans death him and me we were an item before that but he pulled a humpty dumpty on me and i had to bail just to keep my own head together she got a faraway look tell you the truth when i heard maryann had jumped i believed it except that she couldnt drive over a bridge much less jump from one that family paid their dues a lot was asked of her and ferrell after their mom passed the old man on the boat or in the bar wasnt a damn bit of good to them them so young and all i can see ferrell flipping out over losing her because they were this incredible team the two of them he flipped out right thats what ive heard lamoia had read the newspaper articles on the caseall three of them thered been little mention of walker beyond as surviving kin why do you say that he asked thats the word on the docks missed work got fired hell hes been living on the streets for the better part of the winter living like a pig from what i hear its a shame do you have any idea where i might find him is that what this is about its part of it he said looking across at her whats the other part she asked did he ever bother you anything kinkylooking in your windows that kind of thing ferrell he registered her astonishment you think he ever followed maryann and neal around thats another story tell me that story im just saying yeah he hassled maryann about seeing lanny sure he did what brother wouldnt hassled how listen he got down and out right busted dead broke and he hit up maryann for money from time to time i know that because she told me and she helped him out when she could sure she did but he got to be a pain in the ass coming around lannys place at all hours trying to get maryann back on the boat but she just wasnt cut out for it you know all those years shed done it because if she didnt her father would beat the crap out of her stupid drunk first chance to blow it off she took it but it screwed ferrell in the process and he kept trying to get her to come back so he resented neal she leveled a look onto him that let him know what an understatement that was hello a different picture of walker was emerging and lamoia wasnt entirely comfortable with it he knew that matthews needed to hear the bit about the fathers death and the repercussions on both his kids ferrell walker had no doubt carried a lot of the weight of the family given the fathers alcoholism and hed cracked under the weight once the father was gone which wasnt the first time that story had been told he thought the loss of the father was a button matthews could push cindy martin fiddled with her hair an awful color of yellow bought from a box lamoia saw the change the discussion had brought on her you all right lamoia asked yeah no not really you think i messed him up dumping him sounds more like his family messed him up to me you dont like the food hed picked at it but hadnt eaten much not that hungry is all its good very good he stuffed a bite in too greasy she checked her watch my shift is over so it is you want to continue this someplace less smoky where do you have in mind he met eyes with her he was hitting on her and he didnt know why he felt like an asshole he didnt have to sleep with her he told himself he didnt have to fall into that pattern times like this he felt programmed he thought about the pills again they were part of the program they helped him relax to be himself ive got some pictures of maryann that kind of thing if theyd help the father he was thinking of a trigger for matthews to use he was thinking of that sweater lying on the floor and this woman along with it might have im not sure ive got wheels he said im only a couple blocks she said he nodded knowing he shouldnt some habits were hard to break the wind drove the lines against the aluminum and steel down on the docks as lamoia walked the three blocks with her twice he reached down into the coin pocket and touched the two capsules he could dryswallow them a dozen thoughts churned inside himimages of a bloated oldmanwalker coming up with his net the meds would slow down all thought would kill the pain brought on by the wind he knew if he took the pills hed sleep with her two wrongs did make a right when meds were involved if he wanted to sleep with a woman hed sleep with herso why was matthews at the forefront of his thoughts an adolescent urge to prove himself independent of that thought arose inside him if he drank enough on top of the pills he might not remember much wouldnt be the first time he could have all the sex he wanted he reminded himself he wasnt tied to anyone her place was the top floor of a former twostory saltbox when she turned to unlock the door at the top of a set of stairs added when the floors had been divided into apartments lamoia slipped the pills out of the pocket glanced down at them in the palm of his hand and then tossed them into the tall grass he apologized to her told her he couldnt stay had to get back hed hurt her by accepting and then refusing they both pretended otherwise she said she hoped he hadnt gotten the wrong idea he kissed hera good solid kiss one that shed rememberand said how he wasnt supposed to mix business with pleasure and how he could lose his job over it it was a lame excuse but she allowed it to go unchallenged talking about ferrell she said as lamoia turned his back to leave hes a fisherman dont forget meaning he found himself looking off the stairs trying to see where hed tossed the pills he caught himself reconsidering a chance to lie down with this woman god how he needed it theyre patient she said they fish three four five days and may not catch a thing and then go right back out there and try again hes been doing that all his life youve never met a guy as patient as a commercial fisherman theyre used to waiting for what they want whats walker want he asked she shook her head other than having maryann back i dont know not good news for daphne matthews he and she had expected it but hearing it out of this womans mouth made it all the more real for him youve been a big help could have helped more she said trying one last time youve got someone dont you did he have he thought she might be trying to salvage her own pride so he said yeah you have that look she said that comment worried him the whole way home hatred of the father matthews came awake to the sound of the doors dead bolts turning shed fallen asleep for a few minutes on lamoias king bed the widescreen tv halfway through pollock a movie shed been stunned to find in lamoias dvd collection to rent it was one thing to own it she hit the wrong button on the remote sending the volume higher instead of turning off the tv at least she was sitting up by the time lamoia appeared in the doorway you didnt happen to walk rehab he asked howd it go she asked lamoia shook his head discouraged she wanted to explain herselfher being found on his bedfelt she needed to explain even though hed invited her to treat the place as her own i thought a movie might help with sleep she stood up tugged at her tshirt selfconsciously crossed her arms because she wasnt wearing a bra and felt awkward about it and yes to blue the walk you all right no she said shaking her hair and hanging her head she felt so weak for having reacted the way she had i think someone got into the apartment john what i left a window open i think his face tightened but he managed to say okay its not okay its my fault and im sorry it doesnt mean the floor was wet she said stopping him because the window was open he suggested no out here she pointed prints maybe mine maybe not if not they got there while i was out with blue i think she felt awful in spite of his attempts to smooth this over i think you should check whatever valuables you have i havent touched anything and the place wasnt tossed nothing like that not much to take he said but she could see him struggling with his frustration he made light of checking a couple drawers his underwear was there he said his socks she wanted to hug him see why you want me back at my place not true he made a point of looking into the living space walker would nathan prair know where you live the question rattled lamoia you think could neal or walker know where you live if either of them had followed us sure they could but prair your and my addresses are accessible to our fellow brothers in blue not to the public and whats his motive lamoia asked hes looking for your laundry or something cute she said special ops tied prair up for a while after he blew the surveillance the timings off i dont see him good for this and what about neal she asked it makes a little more sense in some ways he might think we have files on the case might have seen me enter alone and wanted to teach me a lesson never underestimate the power of guilt john he grimaced my using taught me all i need to know still working on it for that matter i dont need the oneohone it gets big enough you lash out neal could be there about now wants to put this back onto us something like that yeah im fishing john are you a mind reader too he asked he sat her down and together they shared toast and cream cheese while lamoia explained most of his interview with cindy martin he stuck to the highlights she said so the kids shared a hatred of the father and when the father died there wasnt as much to share maryann gets her act together probably feeling free for the first time in her life little brother ferrell doesnt fare as well feels abandoned maryanns been mother and sister all in one pretty big void to fill if that goes away all of a sudden and hes chosen you to fill it thats not what i meant she said tell me im wrong he said they ate another piece of toast each she took hers with honey and a second cup of tea after which she said second night in a row im whipped he wouldnt let her clean up she returned a moment later with the drop gun and taser returning them you can keep them he said she left them on the counter it was incredibly good of you to do that for me john id do anything for you matthews you know that the seriousness of his statement hung between them she knew if she simply walked away to her room it would put him in a bad place so instead she crossed closing to within inches of him she took another step and reached around him and they hugged his body was all lean muscle besides the physical warmth between them there was a current that hummed her chest tingled as did her pubis stepping away she turned quickly and said good night hoping he wouldnt see that her nipples had gone rigid beneath the t there were too many lines that could be crossed here she needed to get back to the houseboat despite her having no desire to do so she asked what about iding the latents from that lair lou found what about searching every known part of the underground there is walker has to be hiding down there right tomorrows another day he said if there was anything to know wed know it he smiled good night sweet dreams she answered he mumbled something to himself she was glad she didnt hear it ten minutes later she prepared for bed by shutting the office door and slipping off the sweatpants she climbed under the duvet the comfort of that bed about as welcome as anything shed ever experienced blue scratched at the door and she got up to crack it open so he could come and go a moment later she was back under the covers thinking that lifes little pleasures were also often the biggest maybe hed bought pollock because of the theme of alcoholism and depressiona part of his rehabilitation maybe just because of the performances she wasnt sure why this was where her mind focused on its way down toward sleep she rolled over slid her arm under the pillow and she gasped jumped away and rolled out of bed in the process john she called out without thinking he was there in about five steps shirtless in a pair of gray athletic briefs the legs of the underwear longer than tightywhities she remained on the floor her t hiked up above her navel her bikinicut panties showing a lot more than shed ever want seen but neither of them was checking the other out their attention was fixed instead on the guest bed her overreaction had tossed the pillow to the side lying on the bedsheet was the cause of all this a key a skeleton key the sheet remained slightly damp where a hand had touched it what the hell lamoia came closer matthews sat up tugging the t lower but it wouldnt go low enough looks like walker kept his promise she said her voice catching hebringer and randolf you think wed better call lou a tight leash i cant tell you absolutely it was him no matthews wore a blue fleece jacket of lamoias zipped up tightly and the same pair of gray sweatpants her hair was back in a clip weve upgraded the bol to an all points boldt said watching bernie lofgrins sid team process lamoias loft lamoia huffed at that boldt glared at him sergeant you have something to contribute no sir shed never felt this kind of tension between the two gentlemen she said letting them both know how stupid they were being lamoia said give me an ert unit and the rest of the night and ill have him in the box by your second cup of tea sarge its not how we play this she said turning them both to face her he kept his end of the bargain she indicated the key now labeled in a plastic evidence bag so we keep ours by putting neal into a lineup the truck driver lamoia said you think hes worthless matthews but we keep our end of it if we treat him like an informant then we dont lie to him boldt completed for her nodding but hes not an informant lamoia protested hes a goddamned screwball with a bunch of nuts loose matthews did not care for that evaluation and let him know with a harsh look boldt said we chase down this key we set up the lineup we keep you under close watch he told matthews its not about me she said im the messenger thats all maybe an ear maybe he thinks he can talk to me lamoia snapped at her and maybe he thinks youre the second coming of maryann and he wants to ride off into the sunset with you or on you for that matter thats uncalled for she said how do we know he wasnt giving the sister a hump out on the boat after dear old dad croaked and along comes neal stealing all the fun we dont she answered honestly whats with the father boldt asked effectively ignored by the pair how do we know those fishing accidents werent the younger brother playing a little rough with sis we dont she felt right on the edge of yelling at him i rest my case lamoia said boldt repeated we work the key we run the lineup tomorrow and we keep a tight leash on you anyone have a problem with that hell be watching public safety she announced to see if we bring neal in for the lineup to see if i keep my end of this its a means to an end okay if we bring neal in for this lineup and we play the surveillance right walker will come to us we wont have to go looking for him she added we chum the waters and the fish will come to us lamoia settled himself with a deep breath okay with you boldt asked his sergeant whatever is that a yes or a no boldt asked lamoia nodded and met eyes with matthews in something of a staring contest boldt asked her are you okay here or would you like to transfer to a hotel his tone of voice leaned heavily on the second option she raised her eyebrows passing the question along to lamoia who said ill hold off on the ert until we see if this lineup baits him when bernies guys are out of here shell get some sleep were cool here she exchanged glances with boldt his eyes were distant and cold and she felt shed betrayed him in some unspoken way he went home to a wife and kids but if she wanted to sleep down the hall from a fellow police officer that was somehow out of bounds resentment built up behind her eyes and she stopped herself from saying anything okay boldt said somewhat awkwardly shes staying he took the key and paused at the apartment door get a fresh battery in that wire pack and make sure youre wearing it in the morning she nodded feeling oddly on the edge of tears that hed think to make sure she was constantly being looked after thanks lou she called after him either boldt didnt hear her or didnt choose to answer the difference between the two kept her up most of the rest of the night the lineup you look awful boldt said the next day and just think matthews replied saying sarcastically ive had such a stressfree night neals public defender had agreed to and arranged for his clients appearance in the lineup the man looked properly surprised to see two police lieutenants awaiting them out on the third avenue sidewalk it had been matthewss idea to intercept attorney and client outside the front door to public safety buying time for walkerif he was out thereto register that matthews had followed through with her promise of the lineup it also bought special ops the opportunity to locate walker during his surveillance of the building the radio clipped to boldts belt was supposed to keep them informed of any progress in this endeavor instead it was boldts cell phone that rang as he answered it matthews attempted both to keep them all outside and to buy boldt some privacy by asking neal what he knew about maryanns relationship with her brother following the fathers drowning you dont have to answer that the attorney advised his client neal told her the old man was a bastard to both of them the kid fell apart granted fucked up everything lost everything but hell if it made any sense he shoulda been out partying he leaned on maryann she suggested fucker fell apart im telling you you supported her helping out her brother or you got in the way of that the attorney repeated his caution this time more sternly and neal took his advice electing to zip it boldt ended the call saying to matthews labs got that thing for me the way he cocked his head she knew he meant the report on the lair in the undergroundafter years of their working together she could read him this waybut hed said it so that neal might think he meant the report on neals car a report they already had and werent terribly thrilled with he said ill walk you up then ive got to handle this other thing she looked down at his waist to that radio and the attorney caught this whats going on he asked whats with the radio just staying in touch boldt said the attorney made a point of looking at the cell phone cradled in boldts left hand clearly sensing there was more to this yeah well lets reach out and touch someone inside shall we weve all got places to be the police lineupa few detectives a janitor and lanny neal each holding a number and looking through bright lights at a pane of oneway glasswent about as expected with the truck driver brought in by lamoia picking out a special assaults detective as the man he saw throw maryann walker off the aurora bridge that it was about two weeks later now didnt help his memory any nor did the fact it had been raining that night and as dark as a cows stomach with the lineup completed the four surveillance personnel assigned to keep watch on the immediate area for walker maintained their positions for a few minutes longer in hopes that neals reemergence onto the street might trigger an elvis sighting as one of them put it trying to reach boldt in his office but missing him matthews took twenty minutes of lost time to walk a letter of appeal addressed to social services the block and a half over to the king county courthouse in hopes that mahoney could read it and advise her on its legality her request to social services was for that agency to approve her personally assuming a temporary guardianship of margaret last name to be determined if successful she hoped to shepherd the girl through the birth of the baby attempting to eventually place her in a statesponsored program for teen mothers a long shot she went through with it anyway explaining her situation and leaving the letter with mahoney she was determined to help this girl come hell or high water news that margaret had taken a room south of the safe did little to make matthews feel betterthat room had to be paid for the neighborhood was lousy the employment opportunities for neardeliverydate pregnant teens seemed slim intervention seemed the best way to protect the mother and child returning from the courthouse matthews tried her best not to think about walker out there watching for her or the surveillance team assigned to look for himall of this focus on herbut instead to remain focused on margaret and someone elses needs eradicating walker from her thoughts proved a little like trying to talk oneself into falling asleep only the idea of rescuing margaret provided the necessary distraction it surprised her to spot boldts back as he entered a seattles best coffee just north of public safety shed been under the impression hed been down with bernie lofgrin looking at the prelim on the underground lair that meeting was either over or yet to come and she decided to go ask which in case she could join him for it she paused alone at the corner waiting for the pedestrian light you ruined my life the deep male voice came from behind her and the sound of it nearly dropped her to her knees she saw herself stabbed and bleeding out on the street corner traffic passing by oblivious she thought of the lavaliere microphone shed clipped to her bra that same morning the fact that somewhere someone had just listened to her appeal to mahoney for margarets rescue she tried to speak to raise the alarm but as he took her shoulders and spun her around no words came out she raised her arms defensively expecting a blow a wound she saw the mans face recognized it even but it wasnt whom shed expected and her brain malfunctioned because of this it was the guy whod stopped to help her outside safeco field theyd brought him in for questioning mr hollie she sputtered take your hands off me but he grabbed her wrist as she reached for her purse and he bruised her in his grip my john lennon moment she thought wondering if a handgun was next marveling at the irony that her focus for the past several days had been incorrectly on ferrell walker what did i ever do to you she heard the emotion in his voice strangely on the edge of tears and welcomed itselfpity was easier to work with than angerbelieving she had a decent chance at salvaging the situation in the back of her brain a little voice reminded her that boldt would by now be hearing over his radio that she was in need of backup that hed be coming out of that coffee shop any moment another part of her realized that shed wanted to be rescued for years that this was part of the attraction to lamoia and then the next thought that rattled through her brain at that moment was that she was in fact attracted to lamoia and this dumbfounded her her mouth went dry her head throbbed she looked around for help this isnt the place she said dryly if she could keep him talking if she could buy time she might diffuse his purpose whatever it was the terror she felt at that moment was the culmination of all the pentup fear associated with walker i stopped to help you you ungrateful bitch the change in tone alarmed her youre angry the absolute wrong thing to say she knew it the moment it left her lips angry is that what i am it made the evening news the morning paper my name i lost my job my neighbors dumped their trash at my door he stepped back arms dangling limply at his side angry she tracked his right hand as it moved slowly into the pocket of the trench coat then movement to her right boldt oblivious to traffic his weapon drawn a car braked narrowly avoiding hitting him movement shifted into an eerie slow motion an awkward street ballet choreographed for a mugging gone south she knew well enough that no matter how fast one reacts the blade or the bullet always reaches the victim unexpectedly fast she also knew that percent of mugging victims reacted defensively and afraid matthews said you dont want to do this then she lowered her right shoulder and charged into him struggling to get her purse open at the same time boldt shouted something about hands over your head though it existed only ephemerally for hera drone in the buzz behind her the purse slipped off her shoulder falling to the sidewalk its contents lost from all around her a convergence of special assignment officers she felt them running toward her heard the chaos over the handheld radios she leaned her weight into the center of hollies chest just below his sternum and drove into the unforgiving stone edifice of public safety knocking the wind out of him she would not be a victim she would not succumb to the fear she screamed with the move part aggression part reaction backed off the pressure and then slammed into his chest a second time a bone cracked beneath her effort hollie groaned as he gasped and sank to the sidewalk she lifted her knee into his crotch as he went downsharply like a move in step aerobics boldt pulled her away and tackled her covering her just as two undercover officers arrived he lay on top of her his face filled with rage she witnessed boldts thought process as he realized she was all right and took appraisal of hollie he rolled off her and came to his knees hollies hand was yanked out of his coat pocket on its way to a handcuff a piece of paper rose like a bird fluttered and returned to earth not a gun after all but his eviction notice the weapon she had feared was nothing but a piece of paper boldt was walking her around to the front of the building when her cell phone rang from within her purse hed offered to have her join him at the lab for lofgrins report on the underground but she didnt feel up to it she wanted her office a cup of tea her phones callerid displayed pay phone hello she answered pressing the phone to her ear i wouldnt have let anything happen to you you know that dont you her throat constricted the voice was too breathy to identify purposefully difficult to identify she thought she stopped abruptly and boldt clearly sensed the dread that washed through her pay phone walker she mouthed looking in all directions at once she mouthed the word pay phone again and held up her fingers one two two boldt grabbed for his own phone speeddialed a number and turned away from matthews so he wouldnt be overheard boldt i need the location of pay phone one twentytwo onetwotwo ill hold the breathless voice continued in her ear tell your friend they dont need to worry about you youre in good hands who is this she asked calmly i wont let anything happen to you the phone went dead she spotted a pair of pay phones down on third but boldt pointed in the opposite direction up to the corner of fourth avenue there he said still waiting for identification from dispatch matthews followed his outstretched arm to where a man hung up a pay phone receiver and stepped away from the open booth oh my god boldt gasped as the mans face could be seen it was lanny neal he turned his back on them and disappeared at a leisurely pace around fourth avenue boldt took a step in that direction but matthews snagged him by the arm what lou its neal she agreed it had looked like him he had my cell phone number do we really think so are we sure wheres the foul she added slipping into lamoias vernacular little pieces of him rubbing off on hershed have to watch that boldt broke loose of her grip theres no crime lou its a phone call is all besides that guyif it was nealhung up too late my guy had already disconnected we dont know that boldt argued he stopped two paces into the street his ear pressed to the phone his head spun around sharply and she thought he was looking at her but more likely he was receiving confusing directions he then turned back and crossed the hill toward that empty pay phone at a near run which corner she heard him say into the phone give me the compass point north south what i think it was walker she said blurting it out keeping up as they crossed through traffic psychologically it fits perfectly for walker was he even listening to her she wondered he called over his shoulder youre telling me that neal being at a pay phone is coincidence the word so distasteful to him barely came off his lips he kept the phone pressed to his ear it was walker she repeated this time more convincingly the protective role fits him perfectly its the last logical step lou before but she cut herself off slipped through two parked cars and joined him on the opposite sidewalk she didnt want him hearing what she was thinking before what boldt climbed the hill leaning toward the far street corner like blue straining at his leash she didnt answer he glared at her traffic noise and a ferrys horn filled the resulting silence what boldt barked angrily into the phone he caught matthewss attention and shook a pointed finger at the street corner diagonally across from them based on the neal lookalikeor had it been lanny neal she wonderedtheyd crossed to the wrong set of phones boldt snagged the comradio and rattled off the coordinates of the pay phone suspect spotted on southeast corner of fourth and columbia pursue and detain with the streetlight green and the resulting traffic which included a tall delivery truck they hadnt spotted walker but that was boldt she thoughthe trusted the system more than any other cop a pair of patrol cars and three plainclothed officers converged on the street corner seemingly out of thin air over the rooftops of vehicles ferrell walker was seen running three steps before throwing his hands over his head and leaning up to the chainlink fence of a construction site pedestrians collected like bluebottle flies on a corpse abduction boldt said supplying the word matthews had avoided they met eyes matthews found it impossible to speak boxed in she betrayed me walker said to lamoia across the interrogation table in the box where have you been lamoia asked flippantly shes a woman walker get used to it the edge of the table carried the regimented brown larvae of cigarette burns despite the no smoking sign on the wall a cassette machine ran two tapes recording simultaneously two yellow pads two pencils dressed in an orange county jail jumpsuit walker looked older and in a bad way she and boldt observed this initial exchange from the other side of the oneway glass in the narrow dark closet that served as the observation booth boldt explained apologetically how he had to take the meeting with lofgrin that skeleton key came back clean he told her but hes got the prelim on the underground for mei was due down there a half hour agoand hes got this set of highlevel meetings later on that he cant beg out of john can handle it lou hes one of the best were fine she didnt take her eyes off walker were the bestyou and i he said but it sounded to her more like he was testing her even fishing for a compliment interrogations im talking about she knew perfectly well what he was talking about jealousy belied his intentions she broke her attention off the box for the first time met eyes with boldt and said again were fine here boldt nodded though in such a reserved fashion he might as well have shook his head no instead were running both audio and video lou you wont miss a thing he would miss it of course but she couldnt bring herself to care were holding him overnight boldt said i think it could be a mistake she said he threatened you yes but listen a teakettle is one kind of threat lou all that boiling water inside but you spill it out and thats a different kind of hot we tip this guy over we dont know whats going to happen again she wondered who was doing the talking her eyes left walker and settled on the other guy across from him it was time she took a hotel room she felt discouraged even sad walker consumed by grief boldt by jealousy she with her fearand lamoia with his resolute calm she envied him that and hoped her face didnt reveal her thoughts its harassment we can make that stick for twentyfour hours which gives us time to pursue a court order to get his clothes down to sid you dont really think hes the one living in the lair do you you honestly think the hairs and fibers on his clothes are going to come back for that for chen they entered into a staring contest neither about to back down she said softly i know you think youre helping lou and i love you for it but not this guy not this way he never broke the eye contact well he said hesitantly i guess im out of here then bye she said lifting her hand in a half wave her full attention back on that room she heard him leave and felt relief and wondered what was going on between them was she using him thriving on his confusion over her and lamoia if so to what end lets get down to brass tacks she heard lamoia say his voice made nasal by the small speaker she thought it impossible but walker looked another ten years older all of a sudden probably the result of the tube lightinginkwells beneath both eyes a pasty bluish tone to facial skin stretched by a selfimposed starvation he hardly moved in the chair and when he spoke it was with a controlled calm that troubled her leaving her wondering what theyd gotten themselves into who was running whom my father used to say that walker said he directed himself to the pane of glass that inside the box was a large mirror is she listening are you there daphne hey lamoia fired off trying to win walkers attention but failing im so disappointed in you walker said she felt her stomach turn he seemed to know exactly where she was standing she moved to her left his eyes seemed to follow it was an uncanny display of empathetic behavior tell me about the skeleton key lamoia said walker continued to stare at the mirrorat her hey lamoia reprimanded for a second time im talking to you he stood and came around the table walkers head jerked up to intercept the man you lay a finger on me and this is in the hands of the lawyers it stopped lamoia like hed hit an invisible shield youve been watching too much court tv uhhuh walker said fixated on the mirror again in all my free time at the country club a comedian lamoia asked thats me walker answered he spoke more loudly tell him daphne her part of the deal was putting neal into that lineup your part was the key but a key needs a door i dont know anything about any key walker saiddeliberately unconvincingly bending to look past lamoia who attempted to block the mans view of the mirror but im sure youll figure it out he looked up into lamoias eyes you dont need my help with everything do you i dont need your help with anything lamoia snapped youve got that turned around friend the deal was to put neal away he gets put away maybe you find that door it could work the other way lamoia proposed could it you think walker asked its a twoway street is it walker let the animal loose then he bared his teeth his eyes rolling white into the back of his head his neck a fan of tight wires from jaw to collarbone we had a deal he screamed actually driving lamoia back a step his raw voice distorted the observation booths small speaker spittle dripped down his chin he wiped it off on his shirtsleeve he had never taken his eyes off matthews reconnected now by lamoias movement lamoia said we get this thing right without you and youre buried nice choice of words detective tell him daphne youre a fucking freak show lamoia said approaching walker once again he leaned in closely and said you leave her out of this walker its me youve got to worry about keeping his eyes directly on her not on lamoia walker said she wants out of this shes out of this simple as pie maryann wanted out and look what happened to her he found lamoia again back on track a sail filling with wind look what neal did to her lamoia said the church has doors that take skeleton keys the church at the shelter were checking that entire section of underground as we speak he repeated we solve it without you walker interrupted and im buried yeah i got that the first time he threw open his arms bury me detective at least charge me do something other than just harassing me would you please ask her what she wants ask her what comes next she knows detective do you i dont think you have a clue he stood out of his chair and pointed but she does is it over daphne is it to lamoia shes living with you now you ask her lamoia shoved the man down hard returning him to his chair he leaned into the mans ear and whispered softly enough to avoid the recorder you ever set foot in my place again einstein and ill rip you a new asshole and make you eat your own shit he stepped back walker blanched his lips wet with saliva his eyes watery and hard well see he said yes we will lamoia said you ask her walker said she knows what comes next magoo heres what weve got so far said dr bernie lofgrin a squat balding man with eyes so magnified by his gogglesized glasses that they looked more like hardboiled eggs cut in half when he got excited he was a favorite among the spd detectives his nickname an appropriate magoo as the civilian director of sid lofgrin had worked cases with boldt for more than a decade his forensics lab supplying the technical pieces of the puzzle so necessary to an investigation and the subsequent prosecution an arrest might come from information supplied by a snitch or a witness but convictions came from evidence supplied by the lab where some detectives worked their contacts their informants their resources boldt chose to rebuild the life of the victim just before death and to rely upon the physical evidence to tell the real story of what had happened every investigator did this to some degree but boldt had made his own science of it and as such had formed both a partnership and a deep friendship with lofgrin both jazz aficionados the currency of their exchanged favors was rare recordings or treasured masterpieces building ones collection was as important as growing ones ira boldts collection of more than ten thousand lps dwarfed that of lofgrin or doc dixon and as he was typically the one in need of favors at the office his cassette recorder was the one that was more active lofgrin loved to hear himself talk he was meant more for the university than the laboratory we patched together a full set of latents from the one hundred and thirtyseven lifts we developed down there you can be fairly confident that a high percentage of those are all from the same individual more to come there was no apparent effort to keep the place wiped down he continued your resident wasnt thinking hed have visitors and yes were running the latents through the state database and were passing them on to the nationals as well he recited if this guys ever been printed were going to know about it his stained smile revealed hed taken up smoking again the smoking concerned boldt lofgrins heart suffered inside a nervous agitated body sid had failed to locate the suspects escape route out of the underground leaving more questions than answers did we check the prints against ferrell walker lofgrin interrupted i read my emails lou the answer is yes matthews got walker to roll some prints for us if he was ever in that lair were never going to prove it the prints arent his lofgrin gained energy when boldt took notes so sometimes boldt scribbled things into his notebook just to appear active as was the case now boldt said at this point it wouldnt surprise me if this guy walker goes down for several of our open cases the more we look at him the more it looks that wayto me to lamoia even daffy when an investigator pushed the lab in one direction it tended to prejudice and speed up results but boldtwho rarely used such ployscouldnt be sure if lofgrin had even heard him i wont bother you with the home and garden tour but im telling you the prints arent his it was pure oxygen in those tanks as you suspected its your job to find out where he stole them could they be onehalf of an oxyacetylene rig boldt asked welding absolutely as in construction sites are you going somewhere with this lofgrin asked our hotel peeper the construction site lofgrin nodded slowly ahso he said boldts scribbling was for real as he made a note to check all recent downtown construction sites for reports of stolen oxygen when things began to come together on a case an investigator could feel the momentum shift his way it brought on an almost childish giddiness sometimesa visceral high that was one of those things you lived for the way a marathon runner knew when hed hit his stride and the training was finally paying off the big mo was in this lab with him and boldt took it for a ride go he encouraged hairs and fibers workup lofgrin said aiming his distorted eyes toward boldt i caution that this is all prelim but we did lift seventeen black hairs from a fivegallon tub of wastewater presumably where this guy washed up head hairs we also ran all the clothing we found into the scrape room and collected a sizeable amount of fiber evidence initial examination of the black head hairs was conducted both macroscopically and microscopically cell structure confirms theyre from an asian we picked up chromosomes on the sheath material from one sample that confirms its male hair this particular asian male had smoked pot within the last month that shouldnt be too hard to confirm for your mr chen should it boldts pen went to work weve asked dixie for comparison head hair samples from chen if we get a good probability and i think we will then well perform strshort tandem repeatdna analysis its quick and reliable and cheaper than the old rfpl i could have something for you by tomorrow or the next day boldt mentally assembled the pieces in all likelihood chen had had physical contact with whomever had been in residence at the underground hideout this in turn implied the obvious he asked blood evidence youre a pushy son of a bitch you know that phenolphthalein test was positive and check out the luminol he handed boldt a color photo that showed blobs of blue where the luminol had reacted with any residual blood in the converted storage room a special fluorescent light was used to highlight the luminol the pattern suggested footprints these were developed by the doorway boldt asked we fluoresced the whole room but yes this photo was shot near the door the blood had been washed with soap and water or maybe something a little stronger he presented another photo also revealing luminol stains on the lip of a container again this is the same wastewater plastic tub boldt said he washed his hands of the blood and some hair came off in the process lofgrin nodded if you were a woman id kiss you id file for harassment lofgrin handed boldt yet another photo this time showing a pair of workmans coveralls also photographed in the dark under the illumination of fluorescent black light the discoloring indicated blood splatter like a volley of cascading tears oh god boldt muttered yes exactly jackson pollock this isnt before boldt could ask lofgrin answered this was also washed but in a heavy detergent no way to type it no chance for dna could be the guy butchered an elk or a couple missing women boldt said lofgrin said he wears size tenandahalf shoes about six feet tall hair color brown but its dyedfrom a sandy blond hes on a strong dose of doxycycline lofgrin was probably not describing ferrell walker boldt realized dyed hair nathan prair perhapsalthough that also felt like a stretch are you telling me we found a script bottle down there are you holding out on me bernie do you happen to have a name from that prescription no prescription no bottle either his hair the dyed hair the predominant hair sample found down there in that room lofgrin answered revealed the doxycycline you are what you ingest most of it goes into your hair hes fighting an infection boldt said the use of hair coloring bothered the detective in him women sure but a man using hair coloring suggested more than vanity to a copif the occupant of that room had changed his looks the possibility existed that hed done so in an effort to outrun a criminal record boldts pen wrote down excon escapee are we done here boldt asked anxious to work the evidence what do you think it was lofgrins way to hold some cherry for the end of such prelims the hair coloring and doxycycline had seemed the punctuation mark to boldtthe exclamation pointbut the lack of lofgrins proudasapeacock imsmarterthanyou superior attitude had left him thinking there might be more out in the hallways as we were looking for his escape route we came across some recent bus ticket stubs i entered through the bus tunnel emergency route bernie we already know he had access boldt added and you knew that too because its how your guys got in there so whats going on lofgrin appreciated being challenged or boldt wouldnt have been so aggressive friendships within the department were both a curse and a blessing lofgrin dug around on the lab bench and produced an evidence bag that contained a rectangular piece of papera receipt or stub atm receipt seatel boldt knew that seatel was the bank on the corner the basement of which hed toured with the maintenance man youre interested in the date boldt snatched the bag from lofgrin his chest tight he pressed the plastic of the bag against the receipt trying to read the date he fumbled and dropped the bag lofgrin spoke as boldt collected the bag off the floor one of my guysmichael yeihis sisters a teller at seatel over in capitol hill the account comes back a sixtyyearold woman named veronica shepherd i doubt seriously ms shepherd is living below third avenue boldt had the bag in hand again he pressed and the date printed on the receipt came into focus it was a date emblazoned in boldts memory the date susan hebringer had gone missing boldt experienced both a pang of hurt and one of exhilaration simultaneously cash machines boldt said hoarsely his voice choked with emotion hed found the connection between the tourists whod been peeped and the two missing women the common denominator is cash machines he was out the door before he had a chance to witness lofgrins selfsatisfied grin boldt doubleparked the departmentissue crown vic its emergency flashers going on the steep incline outside seatel he approached the corner entrance to the bank at a run but stopped abruptly at sight of the small lighted sign atm any investigator worth his salt questioned himself when the facts became known you wondered why and how something so obvious now had seemed so insignificant then how the brain could overlook something so important so glaring it was a small glassedin rooma glorified booththat fronted columbia street and contained two atm machines side by side a wall clock and a small blue shelf with pens attached to chains mounted to the doorjamb an electronic credit card reader provided restricted access for the sake of security admitting only legitimate cardholders boldt pressed his face to the glass cupping his eyes littered across the floor at the foot of both machines he saw several paper receipts their size and shape now familiar to him of all things he didnt own an atm cardhe still cashed checks at the teller windowand therefore couldnt gain access he caused a brief moment of alarm inside the bank as he pushed to the front of a small line polite but determined to gain admittance to that room now that hed seen the room he could also picture susan hebringer inside it her purse slung over her arm her bank card slipping into a slot on one of the two machines already planning his next move boldt intended to pull whatever favors necessary to gain immediate access to hebringers and randolfs bank records it seemed inconceivable to him that both women might have used their atm cards on the dates they disappeared without him knowing about it he felt like a burst dam unable to contain himself spilling out a flood of anger and confusion his people had run the financials on both victimshe knew this absolutely so where had the mistake been how could they have missed this a nervous bank officer swiped a card through the outdoor reader boldt entered a warm room that smelled bitter initially he dismissed the bank officer but then quickly changed his mind and asked him to stand outside and prevent anyone from coming in and disturbing him boldt then studied the room including the two wallmounted cash machines their small screens glowing with a welcome message he noted the alarmed exit door in the corner leading into the buildinga fire code requirement he collected himself slowing his breathing trying to get beyond the emotion of the moment he focused on those two machines and tried to put susan hebringer into this room the imagined scene then played before his eyes blackandwhite and jittery he saw her from the back dressed in the clothes that shed been described wearing by both her husband and coworkers on the day of her disappearance he saw her remove her atm card from her purse look up as she heard a man come through that door through which she herself had just entered would she have said hello he thought not shed gone about her business but who a street punk wanting the cash a welldressed man in a suitsomeone shed never suspect of the foul play that was to come a bank officer a deputy sheriff he took a step closer to the machines but stopped as he felt something stuck to the bottom of his shoe he picked the receipt off his shoe sole knowing then how one could find its way into the underground and immediately lifted his eyes to the alarmed exit door he recalled the steel exit door in the hallway on his earlier tour it sounds an alarm the maintenance man had warned he got the bank officer to open it for him let me guess boldt said as the man searched a cluttered key ring for the proper key youbank officers that isand your security guards both have keys to these alarmed doors who else housecleaning no the man cowered slightly swinging the door open for boldt it led to the hallway as expected maintenance boldt asked another logic jump struck him that should have come earlier the oxygen tanks the maintenance mans horrible wheezing boldt remembered the name because sarah had a friend with a similar last name vanderhorst his own internal alarm was going now he saw a listless hebringer being dragged through this same door leaning over her vanderhorst wore a set of coveralls soon to be bloodied yes maintenance too the man confirmed boldt entered the hallway and looked right recalling the stairs that led down into the banks basement the maintenance man vanderhorst had told him the exit door went out to the street he had failed to mention the atm machines on the way out vanderhorst had played dumb about the existence of access to the underground dyed hair a doxycycline prescription for his clogged lungs im declaring this a crime scene boldt informed a surprised bank officer stand back and keep your hands in your pockets lieu shouldnt we be watching the greyhound station or something bobbie gaynes occupied the crown vics passenger seat boldt said we are watching the bus and the ferries and the trains and the northern border crossing with canada rental car agencies clear down to tacoma have a fax of his bank id the last few hours had been his busiest in recent memory he felt incredibly good whats the problem bobbie but why here she asked still frustrated with him vanderhorst called in sick today that should tell us something right he split were wasting time here the crown vic pointed downhill and away from the corner office building occupied by the seatel bank boldt had both the rearview and driver door mirrors aimed with a view of the cornerone set for his sitting height the other for slouching boldts silence bothered her so explain to me what good it is watching the bank it closes for the weekend in ten minutes and by my figuring that means hes another ten minutes farther away why do people kill bobbie she sighed letting him know she wasnt up to his quizzes his schooling her it grew old after awhile for love and money she made her voice sound like a schoolkid reciting her math tables for country and revenge she added into the mix outright annoyed now she added for the smell of blood or the scent of a perfume or because god or their dog told them to and they forgot to take their pill that day we got lucky is all boldt said sometimes you get lucky lucky she asked exasperated hes halfway to miami or vegas or tijuana by now how is that lucky a crackle came over both boldts dashmounted police radio and the handheld resting in his lap a male voice said calmly we have joy wildhorse is headed out the north stairs of the bus station no fucking way gaynes mumbled wildhorse is i only had a minute to come up with a handle vanderhorst is wildhorse she said too obvious he asked peering intently out the windshield now she said youre telling me you put six cruisers and including us ten plainclothes dicks out on the streets and you were counting on luck the first part of that luck is that we discovered that lair yesterday on a thursday the second and much more important half is that today friday happens to be seatels biweekly payday payday she whispered almost worshiping him now whos going to pass up a twoweek paycheck he wasnt about to quit i knew hed be back when they told me hed called in sick this morning i mean why bother otherwise his fouroneone all invented no such address no such phone the security firm is going to fry if they ran a background check it was pitiful typical she said big macs inside mackenzies posing as a customer we had to play it that way vanderhorst knows the layout knows the normal personnel including security and the tellers we add someone to that mix and hell sniff it out so but boldt interrupted heads up boldt had his own image of per vanderhorst both from the tour of the bank basement and from the mans security id photo neither matched up perfectly well with the lean lanky unhealthy silhouette of the man reflected in the mirror gaynes asked do we have the confirm yet on the cash cards never taking his eyes off the approaching suspect boldt said we now know that neither hebringer nor randolf received any cash from those machines what were trying to determine is whether or not either of their cards ever logged on for the two days in question they can do that she asked supposedly any attempt even a canceled session registers with the system he nabbed them before they ever got their money she suggested whos going to think anything of some guy in blue coveralls wearing a security tag on his chest pocket hes sweeping up the room so what they use their card to enter turn toward one of the machines and take his broomstick to the back of the head hes got them through that emergency exit door before theyre even half conscious but its a glass room lieu its a welllit glass room guys like vanderhorst they thrive on that moment just ask matthews for those few seconds hes dragging the body toward the door hes as high as hes ever been you creep me out sometimes lieu no not me bobbie its them boldt motioned her down and slouched himself she scootched down and reached for her door handle we grab him on the way out or back up big mac or what vanderhorst paused ever so briefly in front of the bank and gave the block a onceover he failed to make anything of the steam cleaning panel van across the street the homeless guy with his guitar case open playing a horrible rendition of this land is your land or the tall black woman walking the german shepherd who was himself a member of the k unit what the hell gaynes asked eyeing the mirror he just convinced himself its safe that motherfuckers got some loose screws lieutenant boldt hoisted the radios handset all units we play this exactly as i laid it out in situation affirm came the voice of dennis schaefer from the steam cleaning van schaefer a special ops dispatcher on the force had the combined role of playbyplay sports broadcaster and team captain it still left boldt the coach he plugged an earpiece jack into the radio and filled his right ear with its ear bud the moment vanderhorst entered the bank boldt and gaynes headed directly to the atm room where boldt swiped a borrowed card admitting them he felt unusually warm as they passed through what was typically the alarmed exit door without a sound hed been advised that it would take vanderhorst between three and ten minutes to both retrieve and cash his paycheck at the teller window boldt was told he could count on the maintenance man standing at the counter for that length of time mackenzie at a standup check writing desk would alert dispatch if actual events inside the bank varied from this boldt had assigned one uniformed officer to stand guard on the other side of the loose panel discovered in the bus tunnels emergency exit he had another four uniforms at possible streetlevel exits suggested by professor babcock he had radio cars forming a perimeter the safe money said to pick up vanderhorst the moment they had him confined it was not like boldt to play chances but thats what he had in mind and gaynes had clearly sensed this if it went south on him the review board would rule that hed allowed personal pressures to influence his decision making to dictate actions taken to cloud his judgment they would be right of course though hed vehemently deny it susan hebringer ran this operation by proxy once vanderhorst was officially under arrest statistics said that their chances of ever finding his victims were greatly reduced sometimes perps rolled over in interrogation but with nothing but circumstantial evidencean atm receipt and some compromised blood evidence with no clear way yet to connect the atm room to the underground and more important to show vanderhorsts knowledge of that connection boldt could foresee vanderhorst walking out of public safety a free man he and gaynes reached the banks secondfloor offices winded he knocked on a door marked private and was welcomed a moment later by an attractive young woman in a smart gray suit and beyond her two men in private security garb manning a bank of five blackandwhite television monitors all of which were hardwired to hidden cameras each screen offered a variety of looks at various parts of the bank including the main lobby the atm anteroom and the downstairs hallway through which they had just passed gaynes asked boldt are you telling me we already have him on camera abducting these women twentyfourhour loops are reused after seventytwo hours boldt explained in whispered disappointment long since erased yeah she said gesturing toward the bank of monitors well weve got him now vanderhorst stood at a teller window to the right of the large room his back to the camera detective frank mackenzie maintained his position at the check writing counter close to the main doors and the only exit to the streets boldts plan revolved around mackenzies ability to deliberately slip up while attempting to act the part of undercover cop mackenzie a big tree trunk of a man with seventeen years on the force had been selected for this role in part because of his legendary reputation as a thespian in the summers he took time off to join the ashland oregon theater troupe responsible for that citys shakespeare festival as a lieutenant and team leader boldts responsibility was to make the most of his assets the screens lacked any sound and so the commotion that followed on the banks main floor played out on the one television screen silently making the action all the more eerie and disconnected boldt listened to spd dispatch in his right ear mentally dialing it into the background can we hold on number four please boldt asked as he and gaynes stepped closer she whispered id rather be in the movie than watching it stay tuned we may be yet boldt informed her first we see how smart vanderhorst is he lifted the handheld tripped the talk button and issued the order he knew hed be held responsible for okay lets do it affirm dispatcher dennis schaefers reply passed thinly through boldts earpiece mackenzie was ordered to lay the bait the rest of the team was put on high alert like most operations after several hours of waiting the realtime event was likely to play out in a matter of seconds or at the most a few minutes for those few precious moments disparate players several city blocks away from each other had to move think coordinate and act in harmony anything less and vanderhorst was likely to escape denny schaefer was the stage manager but lou boldt was the playwright and as such he listened and watched carefully on the small screen frank mackenzie unplugged his earpiece from his radio and then fiddled with a knob turning up the volume the message from dispatch suspect is in the building played over boldts radio at the same time it did big macsas planned the message spilled into the bank lobby turning heads this was it boldt leaned in and watched vanderhorst along with everyone else in the lobby overheard mackenzies radio the suspect cocked his head slightly in that direction but he did not overreact his left hand pocketed the cash from his paycheck mackenzie did a convincing job of playing the buffoon he dropped the radio turned the volume back down and tried to look like nothing had happened he then took a couple obvious steps toward the entrance clearly planting himself to block the main doors a colorful sign there advertised the benefits of home equity loans vanderhorst abandoned the teller window and walked incredibly calmly boldt noted toward the employees only door that led into the back hallway but vanderhorst stopped at that door studying mackenzie who had his back turned boldt spoke loudly into the crowded security room open the door vanderhorst on the screen vanderhorst continued to look like he was weighing his options through that door now vanderhorst disobeyed taking several steps toward mackenzie and the banks main entrance were losing him boldt shouted into his handheld denny schaefer calmly instructed mackenzie phase two big mac on the screen mackenzie spun on his heels looked in the direction of vanderhorst and reached inside his sport jacket revealing his holster and weapon crack the whip vanderhorst turned shoved a key into the side door and hurried through okay an elated boldt shouted much too loudly for the small room lets do it like we talked about the guards busied themselves throwing switches and the monitors displayed new views the back hall the atm room the stairs to the basement and several angles of the basement itself go go go boldt shouted at the screen like an armchair quarterback into the radios microphone he shouted more pressure more pressure as vanderhorst paused in the hallway outside the door that led into the atm room boldt didnt want that door an option dispatch barked another order and although the monitors had no sound boldt knew that mackenzie was now pounding on that hallway door vanderhorst reacted in a mechanical nervous way looking first in that direction and then taking off down the hall and into the stairs leading to the basement yes boldt shouted excitedly he grabbed gaynes by the arm get ready to run you first the basement copy she said moving toward the security rooms door behind them the image of vanderhorst moved one monitor to the next as if he were jumping from screen to screen as he reached the last with the flip of a switch the monitors displayed several different views of the basement special ops had added these cameras at boldts request gaynes understood boldts plan then for the first time youre stinging him into showing us the way into the underground she said we hope he answered with that as if instructed vanderhorst moved quickly across three of the screens and used a master switch to lower the elevator boldt mumbled not possible i checked that elevator myself and but he interrupted himself as vanderhorst boarded the elevator stepped inside andafter a brief but unexpected monitor glitch that left vanderhorst offcamera momentarilykeyed open a back panel on the elevator car intended for emergency evacuation oh shit boldt barked a police lieutenant who took pride in rarely swearing vanderhorst stepped through and pulled the elevators panel closed behind him keys boldt shouted at the security men as if rehearsed which it was not one of the guards tossed him an enormous ring of keys saying the small silver one does the panel the green dot does the elevator override susan hebringer had been pulled through that panel patricia randolf before her boldt could see it play out as if watching one of the monitors boldt and gaynes took off at run boldt shouting instructions into a handheld that he knew would lose contact once he was underground contact lost repeat wildhorse contact lost dispatch copied boldt shouted we want him alive people for gods sake lets take him alive into the dark boldt and gaynes descended the stairs two at a time reaching the basement only seconds after theyd left the security room at the most vanderhorst had a half minute lead on them boldt keyed the elevator open then tossed the keys to gaynes who was first into the car she keyed open the back panel as boldt stepped through sixty seconds boldt said checking his watch they climbed through the open hole descending a ladder of rebar that protruded from the chambers concrete wall the space between the shafts wall and the car was narrow gaynes descended effortlessly while boldt had to flatten himself his jacket hanging up on the cars mechanics the thick air smelled heavily of grease and electricity gaynes switched on a maglite well before she reached the bottom rung making the short leap to the shafts dirt floor boldt followed immediately behind her lieu the maglites beam revealed the inside of a castiron coal chute door about two feet square a false wall of bricks had been stacked to create an illusion from the underground side of an enclosed coal chute gaynes kicked down the dry stack pushed the iron door open further and squeezed through boldt followed again straining to get his girth through the small space boldt heard a crackle in his earpiece and the broken voice of denny schaefer as a few radio waves managed to briefly penetrate the depths he couldnt understand a word that was said they were on their own they stood in one of the dark underground hallways vaguely familiar from the previous foray into the underground city block boldt used sign language to direct gaynes indicating that they would split up she would take this hallway boldt would move south and search for another gaynes acknowledged boldts fists came together they could reunite at the far end of the underground space boldt got his flashlight lit ninety seconds had elapsed since theyd lost vanderhorst they heard a crash in the distancewood and then glass too far away to discern someone running boldt took off into the dark through a huge empty room he found a second hallway and turned left his mind searching for explanations for that noise certainly vanderhorst if their man would know this city block of the underground intimately an area the size of several football fields so what or who had made that noiseand was it worth following boldt slopped through mud and debris believing that by then gaynes would be passing close to the lair she would take a few seconds to inspect it in that time boldt found himself at the end of the hall he took the door to the right into and through a former barbershop the beam of light catching his own reflection in the dusty mirrors still intact he jumped back from his own reflected image stumbled over a barber chair and fell down the chair noisily spinning on rusted joints boldt clambered to his feet dodged debris on his way out yet another door and found himself in a section of underground sidewalk he hadnt seen on his earlier exploration the sidewalk was caved in ahead choked with earth and stone reminding him how fragile an environment this was he took the first doorway to his left that he encountered working his way judiciously through a room filled with discarded washing machines and tooling equipment that had to go back forty years through this door he reached another short hallway and up ahead a tangle of yellow police tape he paused here aware this had been what hed heard only moments beforevanderhorst had been tripped up by one of their yellow tapes blood beat loudly in his ears his mouth dry his body damp with sweat he thought of his promises to liz to stay behind the desk of his kids and their bright faces but then in his minds eye he saw susan hebringers unconscious body being dragged down this hallway a face now attached to the man dragging her and he inched forward following the unmistakable sound an uneven scrapingsomething draggingthrough a door to his right he followed that sound careful of his own footfalls hes limping vanderhorst had hurt himself in the fall caused by the crime scene tape boldt moved more quickly seizing the opportunity aware all of a sudden of footfalls approaching rapidly from his left gaynes he cupped the flashlight this was the horror house in the amusement park where goblins and witches and skeletons jumped out at you boldt braced himself for surprise his nerves electric with anticipation he crossed through to a smaller room fully covering the flashlights lens with his fingers and issuing darkness he could smell the man nowthe sour human fear hes close he heard the whoosh to his left and credited his sensitive hearing with sparing him the blow as he ducked a piece of lumber cut just above his head and that promise to liz loomed all the more clearly he slipped his fingers off the flashlight and the beam swiped the side of vanderhorsts face like the slice of a sword boldt saw fear and determination he saw what susan hebringer would have seen as shed come awake in captivity the timber caught boldt in the gut on its return boldt bent over and fell back but kicked out mightily as he went down connecting with the side of the mans knee and causing vanderhorst to cry out as he careened into a shelf of rusted paint cans and spilled them in a waterfall of tin to the floor vanderhorst clawed and picked his way through the debris to the far end of the room delivered a chair through what remained of a window and was following through himself when boldt got a hand on him he pulled the man back so that vanderhorsts head and shoulders struck the floor boldt swung a paint can and struck the man in the head the lid popped off a thick red sludge melting down the side of vanderhorsts face and shoulder looking like fresh blood his right foot on the mans throat boldt sighted down the barrel of his handgun the flashlight catching the whites of complacent eyes the sudden calm in those eyes went straight to boldts stomach vanderhorst held the wire handle of a paint can gripped firmly in his left hand ready to strike boldt said do it his breath shallow and quick do us all a favor gaynes caught up to them breathless easy lieu boldt backed off removing his foot from the mans throat vanderhorst released the cans wire handle slowly closed his eyes and said i want a lawyer a slippery slope matthews heard the key in the lock saw blue run to paw the door and set down the glass of wine her heart fluttered in her chest and she thought herself a teenager as she crossed the room blue started licking his hand the moment it showed lamoia looking exhausted shut and locked the heavy door hi honey im home his making light of it like that caught matthews short and stopped her just prior to offering herself for a hug what the hell had she been thinking whats with the radio car he asked shedding the deerskin jacket and playing with blue lous idea weve got walker an overnight room in the grand hotel good riddance we should make the reservation permanent you ask me hes working through this she didnt want to even think about business she wanted to enjoy his company order some takeout get as far away from police business as possible it wasnt to be lamoia said bobbie socks and the sarge arrested a bank maintenance guy for hebringer and randolf yes he called she said he wants me in on the first round of interrogation but the lawyers are into it pretty thick and it isnt going to happen until tomorrow same thing i heard he said kind of shoots my theory on walker it kind of does what he asked no i told you so lou was hoping for a court order to process walkers clothing he got it they lifted some blood theyre testing whether its fish or human some fibers they want to run against a pile of shit they collected in the hideaway it wasnt walkers she said lou knows that he wants to jam walker up just to keep him off the streets fine with me lamoia noticed the open bottle of wine selfmedicating she said thinking it funny until her brain caught up with her mouth sorry about that do i look like i have a problem with it they spent a half hour on the couch lamoia nursing a beer matthews working on the bottle of merlot shed already promised to repay him blue settled in at their feet looking like a rug that breathed i think i should go at him she said walker are you kidding we need his help with the key were trying the underground the sarge messengered a polaroid over to an archaeologist at the u somethingll break she said somebodys got to bring him up to speed on email attachments hes got his own ways of doing things he sounded mad at her and she wondered how she deserved this the dog jumped to his feet and began to whine rehab needs a walk he said toeing the dogs fur with his right foot its weird you call him that she said lamoia took it wrong so im weird what of it is something wrong john yeah somethings wrong me being here have i overstayed my welcome why had she said that she felt herself blush what no its me my stuff he said he stood and the dog rallied come on you idiot he petted blues head would i be in the way she asked you still dont have it figured out do you matthews probably not youre not in the way okay she fought back a flicker of anger at herself at him she wasnt sure he turned toward the couch looking away momentarily what you said just now selfmedicating was stupid she interrupted he had sadder eyes than blue listen matthews i stole two caps from your bathroom on my last visit i tucked them away in my pocket and i walked around with them there for days and i never said a thing to you to boldt at the meetings nothing somehow this scared her more than walker had her words caught in her throat did you take them no i tossed them but i was this close to taking them he said i stole from you and i didnt tell you i lied to myself that tossing them made it fine but it didnt make it fine it sucks what an asshole i am the worst of it is that i havent stopped thinking about them i keep thinking how stupid it was to toss them you tossed them john thats the point listen matthews this is as much about you as it is about those caps i understand that she said do you i dont think so you dont know the half of it indicating blue she said i think hed rather we continue this outside lamoia found a slight grin she thought thats better they moved toward the front door the three of them he hooked her arm and said the guys in the cruiser out front theyll see us you know theyre gonna talk if we walk arminarm so they talk theyre already going to talk its not like weve done anything he said no its not she agreed his words hung in the air on the way out they passed the cruiser and lamoia waved well he said to matthews i guess its all downhill from here downhill but a slippery slope she thought blue found a hydrant and watered it down matthews knew she would sleep alone that night but catching herself even thinking about this had her wondering what she was getting herself into the door she loved it like this she lamoia and boldt as a team descending the public safety fire stairs so fast she could hardly keep up whats going on she asked rounding a landing and continuing down with them boldt had nearly everyone on caps in the offices on a saturday sid was on its way in special ops had been placed on call everyone awaited orders knowing this was the moment for the hebringerrandolf case shed been told to leave her office and rendezvous with them on the stairs she was to have a coat with her which she did boldt had this amazing charisma that instilled energy in everyone around him an uncanny leadership quality that accounted for the uncompromising devotion of his squads to where even a wiseass like lamoia stayed reined in under his command were holding vanderhorst under the state terrorism act based on his having oxygen tanks in his possession any one of which could cause a massive explosion together theyre more like a small nuke for a big man he moved fluidly the railing slipping through his left hand used more as a guide than a support but we released walker lamoia asked clearly voicing a complaint whats with that the bloodstains on his clothing are corruptedsome fish some human but none of its going to tell us anything specific no matter what tests we run the fiber workup failed to connect him to the lair which is understandable since its clearly vanderhorsts lair but cant we hold him on something lamoia said trying to keep boldt focused on his own complaint about walker what if he still has it in for our friend here at the next landing boldt looked back at him you tell me what we hold him on and ill be the first to consider it obstruction we cant prove it boldt returned lamoia pressed then lets at least keep matthews on a wire no way she said two floors to go it seemed impossible but boldt was moving even faster nowtaking three stairs at a time she didnt have that reach both men moved ahead of her but only briefly she took two stairs but outran them and quickly caught up boldt said consider it done daffy youll wear the wire whenever youre out of this building lou she protested it wasnt up for discussion boldt changed subjects i got babcock a photo of that skeleton key which she subsequently determined was late nineteenth early twentieth centuryat least twenty years past the construction of the section of the city thats currently beneath the church twenty years she asked not following what this determined construction spread uphill after the great fire as in columbia and third lamoia asked granted boldt said finally reaching the buildings garage level any lock could have been put in any door at any time but if were playing percentages then that lock is more likely from this area of townright where were standing for that matter than down the hill toward pio square and thats where were headed she asked across the street each level of the underground is over a hundred thousand square feet thats three football fields or so at this point sid has been through ninety percent or more of that level where we found vanderhorsts lair and so far no sign of hebringer or randolf he held the door for them we put a pair of ks into that space about an hour ago each scented for one of the missing they led us straight back to the elevator shaft a drain vanderhorst had sealed it with black plastic so the smell couldnt escape he put them down a drain lamoia asked in one piece boldt held up the skeleton key still in the evidence bag the drain leads down to yet another level of underground he said thats why the jackets were going to be the first inside and im betting its chilly down there it felt damn near freezing to her she wasnt sure if that was the actual temperature or her own heightened anxiety over what they expected to find but the coat didnt help and that was her first big clue preparing to lower themselves through the open storm drain at the bottom of the elevator shaft itself now lit by halogen lights running off extension cords lowered from the banks basement boldt passed out latex gloves and shared a tube of mentholatum to smear above the lip to help mask the smell the rituals of homicide came painfully all three knew that odor and it aint dead rats as lamoia had put it squeezing through the open drain into a dark damp space in which the stench was far more concentrated felt to matthews like willfully entering a portal into hell she interviewed them she counseled them she analyzed them she predicted them and she evaluated them but she would still never fully understand why human beings treated their own species with such willful disdain disrespect and distemper the going was relatively dry underfoot for all of boldts rapid descent in public safety he moved down this hallway at a snails pacemindful of every footfall stepping this way and that and indicating for the two others to follow in his exact footsteps the protector and keeper of evidence in all its possible forms ancient gaslight fixtures held to the crumbling red brick walls this subterranean area had either been stables or cold storage back in the days of the yukon gold rush when seattle rose from a tiny fishing village to a commercial metropolis nearly overnight in those days when a nickel or dime would buy a man a dinner each and every prospector was dropping nearly two thousand dollars to be supplied for a year in the northern province as twelve months of provisions were mandated by the government before anyone would be allowed aboard a ship heading north basements like this ran full of beef jerky oats sugar and salt cattle and swine horses and mules now it was empty space behind locked doors and it was in front of one of those doors that boldt stopped having nearly walked past it his nose turning him around as well as a keen eye that picked up the drizzle of key oil staining the wood beneath the wrought iron of a keyhole three flashlights found that keyhole at once it was a heavy wooden door that hung on hinges pounded flat by the muscle of a blacksmith no one enters until we get a good look boldt told them he broke open the evidence baggie that contained the key left by the tooth fairy beneath matthewss pillow boldt inserted the large skeleton key into the lock he met eyes with matthews in the dim light she thought she saw his lips barely moving and she wondered if he was prayingbeyond reason it seemed to herthat susan hebringer had been spared the key turned with a loud click of the tumblers for matthews his turning that key was to expose a part of the human condition that would kill off yet another fraction of the optimism she maintained that mankind could and would someday work through its problems not likely she thought finding herself only able to moan as she witnessed the scene before them the sterile light from the flashlight revealed the corpses of two women they were still partially clothed but their breasts and pubic symphyses were exposed they both hung by their wrists from nylon strapping secured to large iron rings mounted to the rock wall massive yellow and brown bruises cried out from their chests rib cages and swollen faces their legs had been bent back at the knees ribbons of silver duct tape binding their ankles to their thighs so they could neither kick nor fight their attackers intentions to repeatedly rape them evidence suggested he had kept them alive there was packaged food discarded on the floor some of which had spilled down their clothes or adhered to their skin he had revisited them a fact that would contribute to the profile matthews would later build he had kept them awake used them up one at a time until replacing them became necessary he had kept them on the wall like trophies strung up like marlins matthews quoted i remember walker saying that walker not vanderhorst this revelation clearly stole boldts attention briefly from the bodies walker had supplied the key as well but this was vanderhorsts sceneboldt said so in a whisper he added the atm connection was vanderhorsts not walkers oh god no they heard a gurgle and splat behind them babcock the university professor had somehow talked her way down here heads would roll but in the meantime they had her vomit to deal with help her out boldt instructed matthews refusing to move himself refusing to break his train of concentration she understood the importance of everything boldt took in now before he steeled himself to the sight and smell before the sid techies stuck little paper flags around the room making it into a parade route now before any other living person except one the killer experienced this horror for what it truly was the crime scene offered insight into the events that had taken place here insights that could prove invaluable to the prosecution of per vanderhorst boldts latex gloved fingers slipped out his notepad and she watched as he began to sketch john he said the camera lamoia had brought along the departments pocketsized digital camera as well as a handful of evidence bags what the hells going on here babcock moaned shhh matthews attempted to console the woman hes working the scene double team for several hours boldt and his team managed to keep their discovery confidential avoiding the inevitable media stampede that promised both to steal their focus and to give vanderhorsts defense attorney information the pas office didnt want him having knowing that even on a saturday such a news blackout wouldnt last forever boldt had asked lofgrin to pick his two most trusted sid technicians to work the site boldt had also tasked his information technology squad to work the national crime information centers database for like crimes and they had already produced results three of the seven pages he now carried were crime scene photographs gleaned from an advanced search on the ncic database filling out a detailed database query that included such information as the use of duct tape the sustaining of the victims life the blood type of the secretor semen had been collected from both hebringer and randolf and was currently being dnatyped the age and specifics of the two victims sidit had matched the hebringerrandolf murders to three other similar unsolved cases these results once the product of weeks months or even years of interstate detective work had been accomplished in less than forty minutes so far so good boldt put to matthews when asked how things were going though that may be about to change she indicated the door to the interrogation room on the other side of which sat per vanderhorst waiting you cant honestly think that walker was any part of these murders following the trip into the underground shed changed into a pair of blue jeans that she normally reserved for weekends and tucked in at the waist a white oversized tailored shirt belonging to lamoia she had the shirts starched sleeves and cuffs rolled up on her forearms nearly to her elbows walker delivered the key that puts him in this like it or not theres an explanation for that she said not that ive heard there isnt so vanderhorst will explain it to us now she said hed better no matter what walker faces obstruction charges at the very least he knew about that death chamber if vanderhorst doesnt sort it out for us im going to tie them both up in this lou thats preposterous and you know it walker stumbled onto this in the underground nothing more the various sections of underground dont connect daffy youll need a better explanation than that maybe they do somehow and we just havent found it yet reading his wristwatch boldt signaled the end of the discussion telling her in twentyfive minutes tim peterson from the us attorneys office is going to be arriving here to meet with mahoney and tony shapiro shapiro theres a report he took the case pro bono as of about an hour ago thats why i said i think things may change if shapiro has taken the case then its going to be a media circus the guy lives for it worse hell sew vanderhorsts lips shut and feed him through a straw she understood then that this hurried effort to interrogate vanderhorst resulted from boldts hand being forcedthey were about to lose their suspect to the wheels of television justice the time frame of twentyfive minutes seemed laughabletypically barely enough time to get a couple cups of coffee into the box win a confession in that amount of time lou she said listen the pd must not like shapiros grandstanding any more than we do or he wouldnt have advised his client to sit down with us im not sure who to fear more shapiro or the feds petersons a good guy and i know he thinks hes helping us by putting out the possibility of extradition to a death penalty state but all it really means is well lose vanderhorst and i just dont like that idea so its a fullcourt press she said another lamoiaism boldts expression registered complaint something like that he said about to throw the door open he said in a whisper in any case its show time with the outofstate crime scene photos in hand boldt stepped into homicides conference room athe largest of three such roomsmatthews close on his heels she gently shut the door initially neither of them acknowledged vanderhorsts presence on the far side of the small table instead they moved chairs around boldt took off his sport coat and hung it on the back of a chair like a man ready to spend the rest of the day here and matthews switched off her cell phone and took a seat alongside boldtthe combined impression that of two people digging in vanderhorst transferred from lockup wore the humiliating orange jumpsuit issued by county jail manacles on his ankles and a waist harness that secured the chain of his handcuffs to where his hands were free to move but their motion limited boldt started the doublecassette tape recorder introduced himself and matthews and naming the suspect stated that vanderhorst had requested counsel had met with counsel several times over the past twentyfour hours and that counsel had been notified of this interview and was expected any minute boldt carefully placed the seven pages facedown in front of vanderhorst and like a vegas card dealer then rolled three of them over as deliberately and dramatically as possible with no time to waste he had to forgo the usual warmup of introducing the suspect to the roles that would be played of the small talk that often began such an interrogation in an effort to establish a rapport there was no time for a rapport this was to be the emotional equivalent of slapping the man around stabbing each in succession with a determined index finger boldt said fort worth little rock santa fe the victims hung from walls their ankles taped to their thighs with duct tape their garments torn their chests and crotches exposed boldt had hoped for the power of shock value he saw no response he yielded to matthews who said you remember each of these as if it happened yesterday dont you per is it all right that i call you per she asked rhetorically not allowing him to respond the way the air smelled just before you abducted them that incredible rush as you overpowered them vanderhorst looked up from the photos met eyes with matthews she felt nothing from him disappointed she pressed on oh yes she said i know how it felt for you the suspect lowered his head but more out of boredom she thought no remorse no excitement no fear or trepidation this in turn filled her with curiosity for she had expected at the very least a sense of surprise from him she felt the clock running ticking off the minutes and wished boldt hadnt told her about the arrival of the attorneys boldt figured the photos had to have surprised the man regardless of his outward appearance he followed this with what he hoped would be another surprise sliding the evidence bag containing the skeleton key across the table vanderhorst looked up the first seams of terror breaking his cool facade been looking for that boldt asked the mans eyes tightened never seen it before they had him talking matthews leaned back in the steel chair boldt said we found them the suspect cocked his head like blue when he heard an errant noise matthews experienced a shudder of cold she glanced up at the rooms air vent then back to the suspect boldt leaned across the table and rolled over the next photographsfirst randolf then hebringer five women in four states in the last eighteen months the best chance you have is to get ahead of this vanderhorst once it breaks there isnt a juror you can draw who hasnt heard something about itjudges too for that matter no matter what jurors and judges claim about their remaining objective it just isnt possible the smart money says you preempt all that by getting in front of it ive never seen any of them vanderhorst claimed never seen that key either is that right boldt said then you wouldnt have any interest in seeing the videotape of you entering that elevator car of you keying the back panel and disappearing into that shaft that video confirms you had both the necessary knowledge and access to move the bodies once youd abducted them in front of the atms his intention was to keep stacking evidence on him one surprise after another you think we wont find physical evidence that those two women made that trip you were in a hurry vanderhorst of course theres evidence and the more we collect the less agreeable we are to listening to your side of this hed leave matthews to sort out or to exploit the mans guilt and what she believed would prove to be his relief at having been caught and stopped vanderhorst studied the final two blank pages in the line of seven but made no attempt to turn them over feeling the time pressure matthews saw no choice but to go for the jugular she said this is the last time youll see any of these you understand that dont you that its over his brow furrowed she considered any and all responses victories she caught a flicker from boldts sideways glancehe saw it too what do you feel with it being over she asked relief anger vanderhorsts attention remained on the final two sheets of paper that remained facedown she thought she saw him shrug his shoulders but it might have been nothing more than him trying to get comfortable an impossibility in these chairs does it feel good that its over she thought for sure hed nodded you tried but you couldnt stop yourself she made it a statement quickly adapting to the asocial personality she believed in front of her you left each city not because you were afraid of being caught but because you thought the change of scenery might allow you to stop boldt signaled her to notice the tape recorder he wanted vanderhorsts answers spoken onto tape you can talk to us she said calmly a part of her disliked playing so deceptively sweet to killers like vanderhorst she owed it to the victims to show more disgust and abhorrence with the nature of the crimes a part of her enjoyed the game the challenge of tricking the criminal mind into unraveling exploiting the guilt when present the sense of remorse if any the art of deception here was feigning empathy and understanding in the pursuit of truth and discovery she too had victims the perpetrators of these crimes who allowed themselves to open up to her and admit those things they had protected so carefully its not like what you think he said she felt a wave of relaxation just hearing him speak help us out here i dont know anything about any of this we might surprise you she said maybe we know more about it than you think i dont think so he said matthews knew there were no voices in vanderhorsts head no whispered messages from god to kill she wasnt dealing with a display of a socalled psychopath but with a man suffering from antisocial personality disorderapda person so distanced from his fellow human beings and a sense of right and wrong that he committed these acts with little understanding of the consequences the time had come to prove herself to convince vanderhorst she knew more about him than he knew about himself and she thought just maybe she did you watched women in their hotel rooms she said knowing him much better already in their apartments and condominiums undressing bathing you imagined yourself in there with them leading a normal life a part of their lives vanderhorst cringed shifting in the chair nervously he studied her intently and she stood up to it not to be undermined boldt regarded her with a pale face and nervous expression a knock on the door gave them all a moments pause a uniformed woman officer entered and handed matthews a pink telephone memo she said i wouldnt have bothered you but the girl apparently sounded pretty bad and said it was urgent the message read problems with the baby please come im above marios it was signed margaret matthews thanked the officer folded up the message and tucked it away in her jeans pocket disappointed in herself for briefly abandoning the teen but knowing the time line of the interrogation had to take precedence with the door shut again she confidently told vanderhorst you followed themsome of themhoping they might notice you might speak to you so much of your life youve spent just wanting to be noticed and yet it terrifies you when a woman actually notices you doesnt it she knew by his squirming that she had him pegged he looked both shellshocked and curious just right susan hebringer you peeped her and then surprise she showed up at the atm and you had to have her randolf that was what a look she gave you the way she said hello to you tell me knowing that at some point he would attempt to tune her out she quickly continued you were caught between those two worlds werent you perwanting the attention yet not wanting it his eyes held on to hers all the more tightly stay with me she silently encouraged what were their crimes per for what did you punish them did they say hello to you ask you the time of day or was it simply a look they gave youa look you took as an invitation its only women that confuse you isnt it the men you can handle lieutenant boldt comes by the bank and you have no problem talking to him do you but a woman am i confusing you now youre feeling anger toward me arent you i can sense that per its all around me that anger because you know what im going to say next you know who im going to mention dont you his eyes went increasingly wider increasingly whiter and you dont want her mentioned do you you want her left out of this her dark hair her sending you mixed signals what was it she did to you to deserve this she asked touching the second of the crime scene photographs criticize you no matter what you did dress you up like a little girl and show you off to her friends and laugh at you take baths with you showers when you were old enough to respond to thatto herin ways you didnt want to respond but couldnt help responding she laughed at youat itdidnt she she thought it was funny cute didnt she but it wasnt funny not at all it was humiliating it was awful for you her laughing like that or maybe it was her walking around in panties and underwear showing way too much to a boy your age maybe thats why you like looking through windows now or was it her slipping in beside you on those cold nights or the ones with thunder and lightning or was it that shed had a little too much to drink and wanted the company the same way you want company now vanderhorst didnt answer with words but she had his face in a sweat boldt looked as if he wanted to stop her or wanted to leave the room himself but he sat calmly beside her his pencil taking down notes on a legal pad as if writing a grocery list she addressed vanderhorst and said you never wanted any of it did you per never volunteered for any of it she teased you in front of her friends in front of your friends she cut you off from everyone around you you brought a friend home she made a fool of you and you you loved her all the more for it loved her like nothing else in this world and this proved the most confusing of all his rheumy eyes seemed ready to spill tears he was no criminal animal but a poor pathetic creature whod lost sight of the outofbounds markers she felt boldts precious minutes slipping past later she said when you were olderwhat fourteen fifteen she was still coming into your room at night only now for things unimaginable to you a year or two before now you ran didnt you you hid first the closet but she found you then the bathroom but she found you with each statement she looked for any unintended response on his parta shortening of breath a twitch to his eyes a dilation of his pupils using these as her signposts and finally the basement she said knowing in advance she would score a direct hit indeed he looked away and to the floor wearing his shame the one place she never did find you tell me im wrong per tell me you didnt unscrew the lights down there and hide in the dark because you knew she was afraid of the dark and that shed never find you she based this on the discovery of the underground lair the location of that hideout was no accident thats where you feel the safest isnt it in the dark alone your back pushed up against a cold wall she worked from her own experience in the shelter the musty smellits almost like perfume to you you brought them down there and you did those things to themthose things she did to youand then you felt bad about it didnt you then you wanted to keep them alive if you could in the dark locked in the room there when you needed them it hadnt been about torturing his victims but trying to save them his mistake had been hanging them from the wallhed unintentionally crucified them she suspected that if she could travel back in time to his mothers apartment she would find jesus on the cross in nearly every room shed read about extreme cases of apd the per vanderhorsts of this world shed just never interviewed one she wondered how any of this could bring a sense of excitement of fulfillment for her and yet it did she said its easier now that its over isnt it theres nothing to hide any longer in point of fact they knew almost nothing it was far from clear if they had enough evidence to convict vanderhorst the dna blood evidence and the semen collected from the corpses might put him away but without that evidence firmly in hand and it was still a day or two away she knew that boldt needed a confession boldt said youre about to be traded back and forth like a pro ball player vanderhorst texas uses lethal injection you know that right capital murder equals capital punishment in that state and you killed a woman in fort worth and you need to think about that the us attorneys office has the authority to move your trial to texas and theyll argue for that because theyre going to want you on death row this attorney general is tough on crimeyou understand that right but theyre basically good guys better guys than youd think they wont take you away from us if we have a better case to make against you here you see how this works he added or maybe it doesnt workthe system not all that well but its what weve got at the moment and youre square in the middle of it worry crept into the mans eyes whats it going to take boldt asked matthews in a familiar game to them i think he knows matthews replied you see where this leaves you boldt asked him matthews said to vanderhorst you and i both know youre of sound mind fit to stand trial thats not an out for you per well run the usual tests of course but youre going to pass them the decision you need to make now before you lose the chance is who is going to control your destiny if you want it in the hands of the feds thats up to you boldt said youre curious about those last two photographs arent you vanderhorst eyed him suspiciously go ahead take a look boldt said vanderhorst didnt move a muscle curious about how we got the key ill bet vanderhorst narrowed his eyes both angry and unnerved and matthews saw the opening boldt had given her she said we thought youd worked them alone per the atm machines the basement of the bank that was one of our mistakesone of the things that took us so long to catch youthis idea you were smart enough to plan this on your own she leaned across the tablevanderhorst reared backward overreacting and nearly went overand rolled the second to last sheet revealing ferrell walkers head shot from central booking this is the man who gave us the key to that room he says that he planned it allthat it was his brainsbut that you did the actual killing i dont even know this guy vanderhorst said he says you do he gave us the key to that room boldt repeated he stole it the key matthews asked thats right vanderhorst said dipping his toes into the confessional waters stole it from where boldt asked vanderhorst continued to sweat profusely he viewed boldt with suspicion but didnt recoil into himself as matthews feared she repeated hes claiming hes the brain behind this a confused vanderhorst pointed to the first three images on the table then who did these i suppose this guy did these as well millicent etheredge tanya wallace anita baylock hes lying to you their suspect had just stated the names of the other three victims names that had not been mentioned in this room there were explanations a good defense attorney could use including the absurd amount of press most such cases received but the context of his answer combined with the determination in his voice would go a long way toward convicting per vanderhorst youre saying he wasnt part of this matthews suggested its bullshit vanderhorst said he described them as strung up like fish hed been inside that room he stole the key my key she wanted so badly to look over at lou and celebrate their victory with him but she dared not send such a signal they needed as much out of him as possible boldt said that key has been missing how long a while now im not all that great with time howd you get in there after that i didnt vanderhorst said and coughed not after i lost that key most of the locks down there any skeleton key will work but not that room thats why i used it he answered their puzzled expressions listen i hid the key so it couldnt be found on me is that right boldt said that was your idea matthews said hid it on a nail down the hall this storage room and then one day it vanishesand thats the last i gone down there he said to boldt id been planning on leaving way before you ever showed up believe me but they owed you money he said nearly six hundred bucks vanderhorst said as if a kings ransom as if it had been worth getting caught with that kind of money on the line his desperate eyes tracked between his two interrogators why are you both looking at me like that whatd i say six hundred bucks is six hundred bucks whos going to walk away from six hundred bucks makes sense to me boldt said vanderhorst rolled the last photo over for himself it was an mes head shot of billy chen he stared at the photo for a long time in complete silence wrong place wrong time is that right boldt said skeptically ask him you had him in that room we can prove it vanderhorst looked dazed to hear that he shrugged his shoulders some guy shows up uninvited you show him the welcome mat you knocked him out and then made it look like a drowning so says you convince me im wrong vanderhorst looked up at boldt with bored droopy eyes a sharp knock on the door caused matthews to jump for a moment shed been in the underground with vanderhorst the knock was followed by a woman in police uniform lieutenant she said addressing boldt theyre here anthony shapiro pushed past her all five foot three of him he wore a dark blue silk suit worth a month of boldts salary he said to vanderhorst were all done here mr vanderhorst dont say another word he glanced at boldt with fiery eyes shame on you lieutenant and on the weekend no less he noticed the tape recorder then the hubs still moving he vaguely acknowledged matthews two lieutenants in the same interrogation roomthis particular team of boldt and matthewsseemed to finally register with him tell me you kept your mouth shut sir he said to his client who the hell are you vanderhorst said shapiro hung his head and sighed okay he said to boldt tell me how bad it is boldt smiled his first smile in many long weeks it was as much as he needed to say without a prair as boldt and matthews had sat down with vanderhorst lamoia hung up the phone his hand trembling noticeably a housefly landed on the fabric wall of his office cubicle and he watched it lovingly clean itself rubbing its arms together like a card dealer warming his hands before the big game as a detective he chased facts one to the next the cliched analogy of following crumbs so appropriate to him at a time like this nathan prairs longawaited written report lay on his desk a poorly crafted summary of the deputy sheriff having given maryann walker a speeding ticket a week prior to her death as well as his written alibi for the night maryann walker had been killeda night tour during which by his own admission hed taken what cops called lost time a break during the critical hour of pm to am lamoia called upstairs to matthews to share the vital information hed just gotten from the manager of the airport mcdonalds hoping she might either make the interview with him or at least monitor his progress he felt disappointment when her voice mail picked up with time of the essenceprair rotated offduty soonlamoia made his journey without her on his way across town he called janise meyer of spds it unit and asked the impossible of her janise didnt know the word he was counting on that he had gps technology to thank for his ability to locate prair the king county sheriffs office tracked every vehicle out on patrol lamoia requested the mans physical location or assignment rather than asking kcso dispatch to radio the deputy or send a text message over the patrol cars mobile data terminal as an spd officer lamoia lacked any authority whatsoever to order prair in for review but he saw nothing wrong with paying the deputy a visit with a tape recorder in his pocket with the blessing of the pas office and the knowledge that car was currently between madison and marion moving south on broadwaydoing bus route duty that was easy to predictlamoia parked the jetta outside a frame shop on broadway walked over to the bus stop and kept watch for the patrol car he spotted it a few minutes later started the tape recording and stepped out into the street sticking his thumb out like a hitchhiker he wanted this encounter as casual and light as possible prair pulled the cruiser to the side of the road unlocked the master lock and lamoia climbed in what the fuck the deputy said rolling the car with a green light lamoia heard the master lock engage and experienced the first twinges of unease i dont owe you this lamoia began im not even sure why im bothering with it prair glanced hotly at his passenger straightened his head and said nothing for several more blocks yeah yeah lamoia answered so ill say it again what the fuck the fuck is this the mickey ds you used as your alibi the night maryann walker went off the aurora bridge had a fire in the deepfat fryer that night he watched the horror register on prairs face sfd logged the call as nine fiftyfour pm had responded by tenohseven pm they closed the joint down for the rest of that night and part of the next morning meaning that when you went off the clock the place wasnt open the whish of wet tires on roadway broadway stayed pretty busy at all hours shit weve got to follow up anything like this an alibi a witness whateverand you know that prairyou dumb shit the least you could have done is check out your own alibi fuck off another five blocks ticked off slipping by the windows in a blur of wet colors college kids peopled this section of broadway lamoia was amazed at how much younger they looked each year prair finally said softly there was no way i could make this thing right with any of you and you know why because you come to the table prejudiced against me oh give it a rest if id told you the way it was i could have lost my badge a distinct possibility youre making jokes out of this me and popeye i yam what i yam fuck you why do you think im here nate if i wanted to arrest you id have turned it over to ii or the brass or the pas office should i be wanting to arrest you for this murder nathan or should i be hearing your side of this first never mind that hed already spoken to hill that hill would have already called the prosecuting attorney by now never mind that if theyd hauled him into the box prair would have invoked his right to a guild attorney and clammed up lamoia hoped like hell that by doing this in the comfort and safety of prairs patrol car by offering him a preemptive second chance the man might overlook the condition of the quicksand where they now treaded so far so good prair turned off his route down the hill toward the city and pulled over in front of the egyptians marquee engine running he looked over at lamoia who could see the tension behind the mans eyes belying his attempt at a cool demeanor lamoia found himself eyeing the passenger door handle prair said she and me we got into it a little lamoia felt restless all of a sudden who was the one cornered and who was the one planning to surprise prair was a burly fuck lamoia didnt want to find himself tangling with him prair continued she and me well lets just say wed had a cup of coffee together and she was a pretty messedup kid are you telling me you were jumping maryann walker lamoia asked still trying to make it sound like a lockerroom shower discussion no no prair said his confidence allowing a smarmy grin to occupy his face a fucking cup of joe is all you sure im sure prair answered but i was interested okay and she was interested im telling you you of all people know what im talking about sure i do lamoia felt a little sick of himself it happens to all of us on the job it does lamoia said trying to force a fraternal grin onto a face that felt slightly frozen and all im saying maybe i got a little carried away with this one so sue me she was a looker sexy as all hell and as vulnerable as they come all this sobbing over this wifebeating bastard she was shacking up with and me im thinking ill come swinging on the vine through the window and catch her dangerous dan backhanding her and im good for getting laid anytime i want itam i right right as rain lamoia said feeling the acid in his stomach exactly prair said finding a rhythm in the patter so what was i supposed to tell you guysthat i was using my lost time to loiter outside that turdballs apartment that night debating how to rescue a damsel in distress how fucking sick does that make me look but you see what i was thinking sure i do my line of thought clear as a bell shes having problems with the guy i take care of the guy simple as pie lamoia said might have thought of it myself you pull these peaches over and they spill their guts to you im telling you i mean the honey pot is yours one look in their eyes and you know the ones that are so highstrung theyre about to rip the ones that like the uniform regardless whos inside the ones that are going to blow you off you can tell right absolutely its like a fucking dating service so you were there that night lamoia pressed wondering how far he could push this the thought occurred to him to escape from the car while he still had both legs both arms then he saw that bloated body floating facedown in the black water and he stayed put i hung around out back yeah fifteen twenty minutes this is gospel okay truth told id been there a couple nights before looking for an opening i got a little hung up on this one prair gripped the wheel tightly the power steering mechanism under the hood cried out loudly if he moved the wheel even an inch prair didnt seem to hear this if were gonna sort this out lamoia said we gotta have all the cards prair nodded hed started the processhe knew there was a logical conclusion to it okay so that particular night that saturday night im doing a driveby as theyre coming back to his place what time is this little after ten im thinking ill let her see the cruiser catch up alongside them at a light surprised the shit out of her i want to tell you but at least she knew i was there now she knew there was help available if she needed it i hang out in the cruiser the back of his place ten fortyfive maybe eleven oclock she climbs out onto the fire escape and lights up a cancer stick im thinking shes signaling me right so i get out of the car i got my juices goingim thinking its show time but as im coming around the cruiser all of a sudden she turns around up there and i see shes on the phone the fucking phone then like seconds later i see this guy climbing the fire escape toward her and now i got my piece out who the fuck is this hes got to have been hanging around just like i have fuck if the creep doesnt wave to her on his way up and she waves back he sits down a couple steps below herlike at crotch level right and the two of them start chatting it up and im out of there you saw this guy saw how not like that no fucking way hes a phantom is all but me im gone the rendezvous shes having aint with me so im the fuck out of there just wanna make sure they dont make the cruiser on the way out and they dont so im good he paused good until shes found fucking bobbing for apples tuesday night and me im right in the middle of it he faced lamoia can i pick em or what lamoia let some skepticism show thats the way you want to call this thats the way it went down lamoia swear to god but think about it what was i supposed to do there was no way i mean no way i was going to detail any of this to you guys up there on that bridge you fucking kidding me he mimicked himself hey by the way lamoia i was scouting this peach the other night watching her smoke a cancer in her fucking panties on the fire escape what the fuck is that about then later what was i supposed to say by the way i may have forgotten to mention wouldnt have been too cool no shit and these girls im already down in the books on that you know that something like this gets out he looked over at lamoia the pall of realization taking hold you understand john use of the first name did not come easy for prair this cannot get out as the extent of his confession began to sink in for prair lamoia calculated the time needed to escape the front seatthe doors were power locked necessitating several steps i mean in terms of helping you out thats been bugging me sure it has ive got a duty to help out and i know my duty prair was talking to himself now and that bothered lamoia all the more i should have said something early on okay im good with that but you can see my side of it of course i can it didnt sound convincing even to him something like this and im done im running a cash booth in a mall parking garage give me a fucking break theres definitely room to work this right lamoia said you give anyone your source on this and im fucked you can see that right oh yeah lamoia said were good on that how good let me get something straight lamoia said you saw this other guy the one on the fire escape but not any kind of good look i got the hell out of there i told you prair paused considering this youre thinking it was the brother this creep bothering daphne lamoia said nothing he didnt like hearing prair calling matthews by her first name he felt incredibly protective at that moment prair said im good with saying i saw him if thats what you need if that would help your present situation if maybe you and i could do a little business here maybe you see clear to get around directly involving me in this did this clown hear himself lamoia wondered he was dealing with a pathological liar a man whod say anything to a woman to get himself laid anything to a fellow cop to keep his record clean lamoia said my opinion nate youve got some issues here need working out issues prair agreed nodding slightly thats what im trying to tell you were gonna want to go over this again lamoia said not officially were not no fucking way you can forget about it you call me in and im making like sergeant shultz youre gonna see my guild reps ugly ass me ill be swigging tall boys over at the cock and bull lamoias right hand found the door lock buttonhe kept the move as subtle as possible for him the air heated up a few hundred degrees he popped the button the loud click like a muted gunshot you know nate shit like this works out for the best you bring me in and ive got me a bad case of laryngitis spd and kcso were talking apples and oranges here lamoia reminded one hand doesnt always wash the other we put you down as an informer and we can block your identity it didnt work like that but a guy like prair thought he knew more about detective work than he actually did a cell phone rang lamoia reached for his only to realize it was prairs ringing the cop answered the phone the fuck you say his eyes tracked to lamoia and for a moment the detective believed he might be the topic of discussion had sheila hill jumped the gun with her phone calls had prair just been alerted he was under investigation for something that showed in one of his ticket books nearly two years earlier maybe you will maybe you wont he said he ended the call studied lamoia out of the side of his eyes as if about to say something he then looked out the windshield at the appealing skyline lamoia wished he could have enjoyed the moment prair said were all done here cool i gotta roll lamoia felt the relief loosen his muscles and allow him to move for a moment hed been frozen in the seat well work this through nate no sweat just remember what i told you ill scratch your back if you scratch mine but if you turn dick tracy on me my memorys gone to shit got it lamoia said managing to open the car door and connect with the security of the sidewalk he fingered the lump of the tape recorder in his coat pocket you want me to drop you its on the way im good lamoia said whatever lamoia slammed the door shut his left thumb turned off the tape recorder as prair pulled into traffic it was raining but like everyone else in this city lamoia didnt feel it a little over twenty minutes later having headed directly back to public safety and winded from hurrying down the hall lamoia knocked on the offices open door expecting to see matthews behind her desk ironically matthews understood prair better than anyoneshed freak when she heard what he had on tape his shoulders slouched in disappointment and he turned to the secretary pool matthews have a meeting or something where can i find her lost time the closest of the secretaries answered glancing up to the grid on the wall what are you talking about he said his voice noticeably louder lost time sergeant shes on a wire shes under surveillance he said though he wasnt sure he didnt want her out there unprotected the snotty secretary answered so how hard can it be to find her she mumbled under her breath something about his being a detective after all and the woman next to her grinned with the comment lamoia said sternly make some calls and find her im on my cell phone he started off at a walk and broke into a run as he avoided the elevator and took to the stairs he had her mobile number ringing in his ear by the time he reached the fifth floor her voice mail answered what was with that he called special ops dispatch from his office cubicle theyd heard nothing about matthews leaving the building you check the ladies room the dispatcher asked lamoia mumbled back at the man incoherent she wasnt in the bathroomhe knew this in his gut something someone had drawn her out of the building and lamoia was bound and determined to find out what was going on hed find boldt hed page the dayshift squad detectives to call him back hed check with the lab the mes anyone else he could think of hed broken into a clammy sweat his eyes stung his palms were damp what the hell was happening to him lost time in addition to the pink telephone memo that had inappropriately interrupted the interrogation of vanderhorst matthews found a voice mail on her cell phone as well miss matthews margarets warbling voice was itself enough to make matthews feel sick im ive screwed up pretty bad real bad you said to call so so im calling no address no phone number matthews dug around in her jeans pocket and came up with the folded memo thank god she thought glad shed saved it there wasnt any address to speak of only the notation above marios she pulled out the phone book and started thumbing through the yellow pages shed never felt right about margarets mention of a place to stay a roof overhead was one thing but the baby needed prenatal care square meals doctor visits a flophouse above a pizza parlor was it a crack house a cum shop a shooting gallery she found it finally in the white pages marios pizza time to move she felt awful for having been out of touch with the girl and especially for being unavailable for the past sixty minutes with these girls every minute counted on the street a life could change in a matter of seconds lost time she informed the civilian administrative assistant who managed the seventhfloor secretary pooland whereas the expression meant the time clock stopped for lowerrank personnel for lieutenants and above it meant their offices would be vacant their phones picked up by voice mail the assistant slid a thumbworn inout marker on a wall poster that tracked such things and returned to her typing matthewss hand hovered over the phone on this assistants desk as she debated calling boldt two floors down the vanderhorst interrogation had gone wellbetter than expectedthe two of them finding a mutually inclusive rhythm that to boldt must have felt like a pair of musicians trading riffs she owed him a report and knew he wouldnt fancy her ducking out of the house until that homework was turned in there was a series of psych tests to schedule outside experts would have to be consulted to either support or challenge her professional evaluation each of these efforts required reports be written as well the complications of multijurisdictional warrants caused by a fourstate killing spree would consume over half the detectives on cap a good deal of sids resources and virtually all of her own time for the next several weeks one man and his crimes would put a piece of spd at a virtual standstill she tried lamoia instead the phone switching through to voice mail on the first ring meaning he was either on the line or out of the office she hadnt seen him since breakfasthis showing up at the loft with blue on his heels and a bag of hot sesame bagels under his arm she left him a message that she was running an errand to help margaret she left the name of the pizza shop in sodo her final attempt on the phone found bobbie gaynes at her desk would you mind taking an hour of lost time as a favor she asked name it lieutenant take a ride with me i could use some backup a young girl from the shelterpregnant out to herejust left me a message that she and the baby are in trouble shes shacked up above this pizza joint and im thinking if shes got a room then theres a pimp or a dealer involvedyou know what these girls get into she added two of us thats better odds she smiled trying to win gaynes over if this grew into anything more than a quick favor lou would turn it into a surveillance ops give me five minutes ill meet you in the garage driving south of the safe a few minutes later gaynes asked anything more i should know lieutenant matthews briefly explained her relationship with margaret she said i promised lou id stay on the wire but honestly i dont want dispatch monitoring this conversation because i also made a promise to the girl weeks ago that id respond as a woman not as a cop those things only throw a signal about a hundred yards lieutenant no way dispatch will monitor yes matthews said so ill listen in from the car and provide backup as necessary yes exactly no problem gaynes said traffic thinned past the two sports stadiums the neighborhoods slowly deteriorating into a docklands warehouse district as directed gaynes parked two blocks away from the pizza joint she would drop matthews off here and then move into position closer to the shop a minute later so i lie low unless theres trouble gaynes asked if you need me you want a code word matthews had considered something like this but thought better of it no ill just scream for help gaynes grinned got it her academy training and past experience caused matthews to take a few extra minutes to scout the immediate area fully circling the block that included marios pizza on the last leg of this patrol she spotted the chrome bumper and black trunk of a car parked down a narrow alley less than a block from marios she held closely to a wall of an abandoned building edging near enough to read the black decal numbering on the left of the bumper kcso she gasped aloud then for the sake of the lavaliere microphone clipped beneath her shirt she said bobbie ive got nathan prairs patrol car in sight one block south on the west side of the street down an alley im going to take a closer look stand by she crossed the street able to see through the cars back windshield as she approached the car stood empty her heart pounding she slipped into the shadows of the alley alongside the car and peered into both the front and back seats ready for prair to jump out and surprise her officer she called out to no answer had margaret been involved with prair all along had she notified prair asking for help after failing to reach matthews had some contact of prairs at spd leaked the teens cry for help inspiring attempted heroics on prairs part aimed once again at impressing matthews a dozen thoughts circled inside her and matthews nearly swooned briefly offbalance reaching out to steady herself bobbie she said again speaking aloud into the cold air for the sake of the small microphone clipped to her bra call kcso and request no you had better make that insist that you speak with prair when you reach him find out what the hell his patrol car is doing a block from marios pizza then call me back on the cell ill leave the cell on until i hear from you she crossed the street with a forced stifflegged stride a renewed enthusiasm to get to the bottom of this she resented the idea of margaret being used as bait to get to herif thats what was going on nathan prair had stepped way out of bounds then again she didnt know what was going onand that confusion made her all the more determined to find out a good shooting lamoia spotted janise meyer from a concrete bench within a few yards of the plaza fountain across from westlake center his heart pounding with the possibility of what she carried she wore an anklelength khaki trench coat the waist belt not fastened but tied like a robe brown flats with bare brown ankles hair the color of midnight with matching eyebrows and lashes green eyes that screamed improbably of an irishman somewhere in her african american heritage thick lips that curled into a provocative smile that hed liked from the first time hed met her she adopted that same smirk now as she sat down on the bench next to him a leather briefcase on her lap so why the cloak and dagger cowboy youre smuggling out confidential paperwork there janise printouts of confidential paperwork she reminded passing the half ream of paper to him i could have emailed them to you for christs sake it would have saved me walking the six blocks over here true story lamoia leafed through them it had been a while since hed ridden patrol it took him a moment to orient himself to the small formscitations for everything from speeding to parking violations our emails are watched right he asked the pro listen if i get in trouble for this i wanted it on my head not yours she accepted the closest coffee lifting it out of his lap she sipped through the small hole in the lid savoring it he remembered that about hershe treated a cup of coffee like it was an elixir treated a lot of things that way come to think about it a pair of teenaged boys raced by on skateboards testing new moves she said i dont know why you want thishim going over to sheriffs and all but thats what you got she informed him metro used to archive the traffic cites on microfiche now its all digitized lamoia flipped pages while janise enjoyed the coffee she said out of the side of her mouth doublecheck stub number thirtyfive mn seven thirtytwo in trying to convert lamoia to a love of jazz boldt had once told him that good music was as much about what was left outwhat wasnt thereas the notes one heard a true connoisseur of music learned to listen for what was missing to lamoia that advice had been an oxymoron until the moment he turned to the citation janise had mentioned prairs citation records from two years earlier were missing an entry for mn youre shitting me he let slip the copy of mn the next in sequence carried ghostly images familiar to any cop whod ever used a carbonless ticket bookthe ballpoint pen impression from the missing carbon of had carried through to the result of forgetting to insert a divider ahead of the next record the same thing happened to lamoia with his checkbook it took a moment for his eyes to decipher one entry from the next the fainter impressions slowly began to stand out in his minds eye a minute later an excited lamoia was on his cell phone to the department of licensing reciting a tag number to a bored bureaucrat on the other end i need it asap he said janise meyer pulled the coffee away from her lips and said damn cowboy you get any more worked up you gonna blow a valve or something lamoia made eyes at her not wanting to speak with the open line she said whats so special about a missing citation other than its against regs to tear one from a book the woman on the phone calmly read the name of the owner of the vehicle back to him lamoia thanked her and disconnected the call dana eaton he said his brain locked on the name on hearing the name janise spilled the coffee down her front and wiped it away quickly cursing him the dana eaton there wasnt a cop on spd that didnt know that namea name beaten into the entire population by a media feeding frenzy janise yanked the pages out of lamoias lap and flipped back and forth checking the dates of the traffic citations immediately before and after the one that was missing cant be right she said this is like two months before the shooting it took a moment to sink in are you telling me he knew that woman lamoia couldnt get a word out hed sensed it all along only now could he actually prove it hadnt been a good shooting after all nathan prair was going to jail five minutesfrom prosperity marioif there even was a mariohad found some cheap real estate that still remained in striking distance for delivery downtown the building looked older than god the neighborhood no stranger to police patrols was a favorite for gang activity a warehouse and light industrial region in decay over a decade since software had overcome hardware in the bid for the local economy brick and broken asphalt played host to the rusted carcasses of stripped cars five minutes from prosperity marios had a takeout counter two cooks four runners a pair of enormous ovens and alternative rock playing at dangerous decibels over shredded speakers the rastafarian currently engaged with a phone order lifted a finger indicating hed be right with her hanging up he barked across the small room to a skinny woman in her late teens the girl wore too many earrings to count the wannabeagangsta white boy next to her his arms covered in the purple lace of spiderwebs and barbedwire tattoos his hands in disposable glovesthank god seeded a pie with sliced mushrooms she let her shield wallet fall open displaying her creds is there a pregnant girl upstairs could be the rastafarian answered he hadnt had time to study her shield so he impressed her when he said whats a lieutenant doing on the street you the landlord not hardly manager is all you the apartment police this was a game to him margaret matthews said her name is margaret is that right im here to give her a leg up i just bet you are when was the last time city health stopped by for an inspection room two he said its on the left what about the deputy sheriff who his cars around the block so hes getting a hummer from one of the charmers in the hood whats new she studied his face and found herself believing him in her mind prair had to be hooked up with margarets situationeither as a friend or the enemy she wasnt eager to run into him he was good at staying hidden and out of the way and she kept that in mind as well whos in the other rooms up there she asked he eyed her suspiciously she said who am i going to run into in the hall theres no one going to throw shots at you if thats what you mean thats what i mean she produced a twenty from her purse and placed it on the counter she said hold the anchovies and made the guy smile lousy teeth she made it forty total anyone up there with margaret i dont even know that shes up there lady within the realm of possibility she suggested listen they think i dont know but therere three of them sharing whats barely big enough for one young girls matthews withdrew her gun from the purse and chambered a round it all came down to a show of power on the streets you were either a player or not she understood the psychology though lacked some of the courage she said i dont need anyone crashing my party should i give you a minute to let anyone know or what people are in and out of there all the time lieutenant the way he emphasized her rank she knew hed made her for the desk jockey she was he said you do what you gotta do the stairway entrance to the apartments was outside the takeout door and to the left she glanced across the street to where gaynes had parked the car in theory gaynes was making every attempt to raise prair matthews bootlegged her weapon on the way up the dingy and dirty stairwell choking on the smell of urine in situations like thistenement bustsit was surprise that cost cops their lives reaction time proved longer than the thought process twelveyearolds with water pistols took a bullet the upstairs hallway was empty and dimly lit either her man downstairs had cleared the area or shed gotten lucky the gun felt an inappropriate way to greet margaret but it wouldnt feel right in the handbag either she let it fall to her side and knocked margaret its me she announced either that registered or not she wasnt calling out any more details she heard footsteps approaching the door and found herself relieved that margaret could walk was not prone on the bed delivering the baby prematurely for this had been her most recent thought contractions margaret about to give birth just a minute the sound of the girls voice filled matthews with gratitude she resolved not to abandon her to stay with her until whatever was the problem was fully resolved she heard a pair of locks come off the door she felt herself grip the handgun more tightly and braced herself for bloodshot eyes jaundiced skin the girls water having brokenwhatever terror she next confronted the apartment door came open shed been crying her face blotchy her nose running her cheeks silver with tears she wore torn leggings a loose dress from goodwill she trembled head to toe with fever her forehead beaded with perspiration or maybe it was toxic shock or a reaction to some drug shed taken the girl could not bring herself to look at matthews eyes downcast embarrassed matthews thought a combination of horror sympathy and righteous indignation charged her system and again she promised to see this through hebringer and randolf were deadthey could wait awhile this girl still had a chance its okay matthews said the door fell fully open she peeked through the crack before stepping inside the room was empty you did the right thing in calling me i dont know about that the sad cheerless room was barely bigger than a bathroom stall soiled sheets covered a thin mattress on a steelframed bed if three women lived here they shared that bed nearly on top of each other a corner sink housed a faucet that dripped a teardrop of green patina below the toilet had to be down the hall a wooden closet bar sat across the corner diagonally holding a handful of empty wire hangers the rooms only window looked barely big enough for egress the room smelled of girls of mildew and of sweat all overpowered by the nauseating aroma of tomato sauce and something burning margaret sat down paralyzed on the edge of the bed she began crying again im so sorry she moaned repeating it over and over matthews secured the weapon and stored it in her purse she eased down alongside of the girl matthews said well its good to see youve got a roof over your head matthews heard footsteps out in the hall draw closer she experienced a jolt of heat like hormones gone bad margaret looked up struggled to sober up her eyes clearly fixing onto matthews as she whispered hoarsely he said hed kill the baby who but in that instance matthews felt her eyes refocus on a tiny hole freshly drilled through the rooms side wall the plasters white dust had settled on the floor like a tiny pile of snow she rotated her head toward the door unlocked she realized the oversight too late shed answered her own question a fisherman the department had hung her out as bait for walker but hed baited her instead despite her earlier planning for this possibility the minute or two with margaret had pushed all that aside ferrell walker came through the door catching matthews flatfooted and a beat behind she grabbed for her purse but his knife severed the leather strap and it fell to the floor where he kicked it away the knife was familiar the curved blade a deceptive dull gray from hours of hand sharpening suddenly the door was shut and margaret in his grip the knife held below her bulging belly whos the friend in the ford he asked the first words out of his mouth he leaned forward cheek to cheek with margaret she betrayed you he said just like she betrayed me he met eyes with matthews as he took margaret in a choke hold the knife suddenly at her belly if he used it shed come open like a piece of ripe fruit they have me under surveillance she said rule number one never lie in a hostage situation for the sake of bobbie gaynes monitoring her every word she added hastily put the knife down ferrell he backed up to the window and glanced furtively outside shit call her off below him no doubt gaynes was already on the move how do i do that ferrell matthews asked stalling she pointed to the door should i go out you call her off he tightened his grip on margaret pulling the knife lower my purse my cell phone matthews said walker eyed the purse on the floor back to matthews the door to the room out the window she was thinking that peepers dont kill and that walker was clearly a peeper from the underground a person satisfied with phone harassment a griefstricken lost soul whod lost his way only then did she notice what looked like fresh blood on the mans sneakers and the bottoms of his pants only then did she realize shed played this wrong he said so we give them something to keep them busy with that he dragged the knife across margarets belly muffling her cry with his left hand and let her sag to the floor in a pool of the impossible matthews screamed out and charged but took the butt end of the knife in the forehead and her lights dimmed as she struggled up to consciousness she felt him pulling on her arms dragging her across the floor margarets crimson cry huddled beneath the window the fingers of her right hand dancing like a typists in an erratic bloodless twitch you son of a bitch she groaned as she threw up just outside the door walker pulled her to her feet and pushed her she stumbled forward down the hall leading the way shell bleed out she said trusting gaynes to hear wheres this hallway lead again for the sake of the microphones he pressed the point of the knife into her back and she felt it cut through her skin whats that blood on your clothes she asked did you harm lanny neal she hoped to hell gaynes was getting this her vision blurred but she tried to keep watch for the detective tried to prepare to make a move that would allow a shot with his next shove walker encountered the bulge of metal hardware taped to her back his arm suddenly came around her throat as he tore the device loose wires and all and smashed it under his right heel the shirt of lamoias that she wore ripped from her armpit to her waist this was not the ferrell walker she had ever expected the psychologist in her looked for the telltales shed missed the source of the violence he displayed twice now hed mentioned her betrayal of him hed made that connection between maryann and herboth leaving him for someone else lamoia in her case a spark of dread filled her as she realized shed warned lamoia and boldt of this very eventher abduction so here it was nothing like shed imagined it he pushed her again and she wobbled forward on unsteady legs they were two steps down the slanting staircase when a winded gaynes rounded the landing without hesitation as if hed practiced this a hundred times he let go of matthews shoving her off balance so that she tumbled down the stairs knocking into gaynes like a bowling ball chasing a pin gaynes twohanding her weapon during her ascent aimed the gun low and swiveled to avoid matthews but went down hard walker showing no interest in the gun kicked it away and then smashed his foot down on the detectives wrists first the right then the left he dropped a knee squarely onto her chest seized her by the hair and smashed her skull down onto the flooring rendering her unconscious this was a man who could pin a squirming fourhundredpound halibut he dragged matthews by the arms until she scrambled to walk under her own power her legs riddled with splinters he led her to and through a door that opened up on the back side of the building where a kid in a white apron smeared with tomato sauce leaned against the brick smoking a joint that apron reminded matthews of the first time shed met ferrell walker it seemed like a year ago now hopefully she thought not a lifetime ago get the fuck out of here walker said making no attempt to disguise his holding matthews captive the kid mumbled fuck off as he snubbed the joint and rolled to his right turning his back on them a street assault was nothing new to him walker stopped her at the corner peering out into the mostly deserted street a pair of delivery trucks lumbered past he slipped the bloodied knife away with the expertise of a swordsman held her firmly by the arm and said you stay close or i feed you to the crabs he fought with her as he led her across the street in regaining her feet in being set into motion she awoke from the stupor brought on by margarets evisceration it was one thing to respond to crime quite another to witness it this act of his catching her squarely in the crosshairs she understood in those few hurried moments of crossing the street of heading down yet another litterstrewn alley that her very survival depended on her ability to quickly and accurately pinpoint walkers mindset the motivations and factors that had turned him from a benign mourner into an unpredictable homicidal killer some trigger had been thrown and she believed her continued existence turned on her ability to identify it expose it and manipulate it to her advantage as if hearing her internal thoughts he turned to her halfway down the alley and said with wild eyes dont worry youre going to like this that made her worry all the more they stopped in front of a steelplate manhole marked swdseattle water department walker retrieved a crude tool fashioned from bent rebar that hed hidden behind a pile of soggy cardboard boxes the reinforcing rod was bent like a giant meat hook he instructed matthews to sit down on the pavement and she obeyed ill prepared to try to outrun the man he slipped the hook end of the bent rod through a ventilation hole in the manhole cover and hoisted the heavy lid it came off the exposed hole with a rattle of metal as he did so she used the cover of the noise to reach behind her grope down her backside and tear loose the small tag inside her panties she let it fall onto the pavement leave them crumbs she thought her cops mind beginning to separate from her personal emotions a flicker of light swept through the looming darkness that seemed to overwhelm her at that moment she was letting him win without intending it she said to him we found the room ferrell the bodies we know all about it she saw disappointment crease his faceshed guessed the contents of the gift before allowing him to unwrap it for her he told her to get to her feet he pointed down the black hole in the pavement ladies first he said circling the drain the early reports of the situation were sketchy at best and boldt tried not to overreact his tendency when hearing one officer was down and another missing was to assume the best while preparing for the worst the job rarely involved much good news and hed developed a fairly thick skin but one learned not to creatively interpret a simple radio code that this call involved members of his own unitone a protegeand friend the other his friend and former loverproved the exception to the rule he fell to pieces with the news monitoring the tense radio traffic he determined that ambulances were headed to the scene reports included a womanquite possibly a civilianbadly cut and bleeding out the pit in his stomach grew to nausea as he caught himself hoping that the vic was a civilian a line he had no right to cross he rushed down the hall to the mens room the nausea escalating to where he felt his stomach preparing to void in all his years on the job hed never vomited over an earful of radio traffic he put out the fire with a dose of cold water to the face and it worked the nausea receded into a world of anger and frustration what the hell had daphne been thinking shed skipped out of public safety without notifying special ops in a gust of ill temper he slammed his palms down onto the sink with such force that he knocked the entire fixture off the wall water sprayed from broken pipes boldt jumped back as the ceramic sink broke into several chunks that echoed as a small explosion detective gerald millhouse rushed into the room fearing hed be calling the bomb squad shit boss id thought wed lost you boldt moved back and away from the encroaching flood of water on the tile floor he heard millhouse and knew well enough he should respond but instead he found himself locked into a trance as he watched that floor water coil in waves as it formed an evertightening spiral and slipped down the floor drain inevitably you overlook the obvious he thought recalling the cliched line lectured to all rookie detectives it was a boldt version of murphys law that hed seen in action more times than he liked lieutenant it was millhouse again trying to win his attention boldt flushed crimson with embarrassment not over his having broken a sink but for having overlooked the simple law of gravity his instruction to millhouse was oblique for his mind was working too quickly to form a perfect sentence dr sandra babcock archaeology department at the u he racked his brain for the name of the bus tunnel maintenance man couldnt find it then there it was and a chuck iberson over at wsdot third avenue bus tunnel maintenance find them both and get them over here to the pioneer square station asap no tears millhouse lowered his voice and said tentatively but boss you heard about matthews and gaynes right youll be chalking tires if those two arent in that bus tunnel in ten minutes boldt replied matteroffactly millhouse fled the mens room in a panic boldt fought to keep emotion out of the decisionmaking process fought the urge to fly down the fire stairs climb into the crown vic and race to the crime scene he put the victims first and one of them was missing an extremely important one the water collected on the floor kept circling the drain policespeak for all hope being lost but boldt knew he wasnt lost at allhed just found the missing piece to the puzzle darkness my old friend the spacean old tunnel of some sortwas wet dark and cramped they had reached it fairly quickly by following a city storm sewer north a good several blocks walker had removed a large grate mounted in the side of the storm sewer and pushed her through matthews now walked hunched over stepping sometimes through gooey mud sometimes ankledeep in extremely cold water it smelled of earth and loam and vaguely of the sea she paid little or no attention at all to the slimy objects in her path which to her spoke volumes of the more pressing need to find a way out of this situation for normally she would have reeled at the tangled contact with cobwebs and the awful sensation of the disgusting unseen objects sucking past her bare ankles walker remained behind her egging her on with sharp jabs of his fingers in the small of her back the first few of which she had thought were the knife she had long since lost all sense of direction his small flashlight provided the only lightit amounted to her shifting shadow stretching long and thin on the tunnels earthen walls somewhere behind and above them lay margaret with her abdomen sliced open and gaynes unconscious a bythebook detective gaynes would have called in a requesting backup before she moved on the building by now matthews could assume that backup was already on the scene lou would have been consulted john would have been informed a controlled but professional panic was sweeping through public safety and she was the focus of it all she had to stall walker in order to buy herself time she had to get to the surface she possessed the facilities to accomplish both goals as long as she kept herself collected and focused the mind tended to jump almost randomly from one thought to another in such situationsthe professional in her was very much aware of this she needed focus she needed clear linear thought the floor of the tunnel dried to packed earththey were on dirt now at first she thought the crunching beneath her feet was gravel or rock she encountered areas like this every twenty yards or so there was no predicting when or how much then she realized it was crushing under her footfalls not merely shifting as gravel might the dirt floor suddenly sparkled to life a thousand jewels and she realized they were walking atop broken glassbroken bottles to be more accuratethe smugglers tunnel with no idea where she was headed she nonetheless knew where she was and this tiny seed of knowledge strengthened her emboldened her to begin the task of breaking him down piece by piece this is kind of fun she said strongly gathering in her strength and forcing it out her lungs when the flashlight flickered away from her she dropped a gold stud earring onto the dirt floor another crumb she hoped walker stumbled behind her and she mentally marked one down in her column the first of such marks hopefully not the last the tag lamoia stared at the rear bumper of kcso patrol car the phalanx of police and emergency vehicles only a block behind him the pregnant girl was critical gaynes was conscious but in extreme pain and was being carted off to emergency at that moment he might have believed nathan prair had abducted matthews except for gaynes having told him it was walker now he came to believe the obvious that prair had either responded to the same cry for help from the girl that matthews had received or that hed intercepted the the spd radio call for backup and had responded in hopes of rescuing matthews himself over my dead body lamoia heard himself say aloud he searched the car and found it locked he searched the alley and found nothing but trash a few needles and the rotting carcass of a dead cat the buildings off this alley were secure as well the more he studied the situation the more he believed prair had simply stashed the car here so it might avoid being seen he had wanted to buy himself a head start and that pissed off lamoia all the more it would be just like prair to observe something like this going down only to realize too late that hed better do something lamoia left the alley returning into the street and carefully searched the block back toward marios pizza and the tenement that housed it now off to his left lamoia knew special ops co chatwin to be a neanderthal incapable of thinking outside the box matthews in all her prescience had nailed this on the head chatwin had his ert troops and a traffic helicopter searching the surface streetsan urban commando exercise he was both familiar with and comfortable in exercising lamoias brief plea to designate a unit to search for an access to the underground had left him snubbed what you think this is fucking disneyland sergeant the kidnapper has an established history of subterranean access lamoia tried his best to make this sound official but he couldnt maintain his composure once chatwin dismissed the suggestion lamoia said with all due respect hes a fucking troglodyte sir weve got him directly linked to at least two different areas of the underground beneath the city what the tourist place chatwin asked and lamoia realized that any attempt at an explanation was not worth the wind youre looking in the wrong place he tried one final time process of elimination sergeant ill entertain your suggestion but we work this my way first yes sir im co he reminded a little miffed by lamoias tone yes sir if you want to be of help get in your car and log in with dispatch we could use you i dont want to be of help sir checking the street carefully now lamoia wanted to avoid another encounter with chatwin at all costs he held to his own another alley up ahead caught his attention the ert guys had rushed through this area like a tornado theyd been looking for an abductor and hostage lamoia was looking for something else entirely access to an escape route walker might have used matthews had labeled the man an organized personality and that was good enough for him shed foreseen her own abduction who was he going to trust he intended to work the scene methodically as hed been trained to do by boldt one of the best in the business he rounded the corner into that next alley wondering all of a sudden where the hell boldt was matthews as a hostage and the sarge nowhere to be seen the guy would have to be either locked up or dead to be kept from this crime scene his eyes lighted on that white fabric tab from fifteen yards away the glare of his penlight illuminating the improbable color in a world of mud brown and ash gray perfect pure white it called out as if it had yelled at him he headed to it like a bloodhoundthe thought of which made him wonder if the k unit had been called up he bent and retrieved it victorias secret size medium there was no sound no night air no sirens no radio squawks no movement in his universe only his trembling fingers and that white fabric tag clasped so tightly debating whether or not to call for backup he looked quickly around for something with which to lift that manhole cover she had made it plain to him that if she went missing she trusted him to do what was right chatwin seemed certain to bungle this putting matthews at risk backup could wait until he knew the full situation victorias secret he would tease her about that when he found her and he would find her he told himself he had to it was the only way he knew john lamoia always got the girl another level whered all the water go boldt asked iberson and babcock she wore blue jeans a brown sweater and rubber boots iberson was dressed for the ball game in tennis shoes khakis and a red thin shell that zipped down the front the two looked back at him blankly a double dragon swept past them lifting dust and sand and grit in its wake the bus tunnels oddly sterile mercury vapor lighting turned everyones skin a bluish green boldt said the water main all that water enough to drown a man so whered it go whered it end up he said to babcock it was damp but not flooded in that lower level iberson answered i told you it came out our wall vents some of it sure but all of it boldt asked enough to shut us down iberson reminded babcock understood him what prompted this she asked he wasnt interested in such chitchat we have an officer wounded anothers missing a girl a young woman is in critical condition and probably wont make it im up against a clock here the guy im after got hold of that key on that lower level that suggests access that we dont know about the water from that broken main it went somewhere and not just here into this tunnel most of it had to have gone down to that lower levelthats just physics so what happened to it it should have been a swimming pool down there babcock lost a shade she nodded youre right of course youre right is anybody going to fill me in an irritated iberson asked boldt had left iberson behind focusing now only on the academic but where another level a sewer system an aquifer he had trouble getting the words out the bubble in his chest from matthews missing too big to swallow away he picked up a flicker in her eyes what he asked she shook her head anything he stressed hes got our officer underground somewhere id guarantee you that rumors is all she said her throat dry her words raspy boldt nodded furiously ill take rumors there are old references to a smugglers tunnel supposedly it connected speakeasies and the hotels to the waterfront during prohibition dug by the chinese controlled by the chinese mafia in those days said the historian the international district he thought of mama lu the very woman who had set him on this quest in the first place matthews had gone missing within a stones throw of the id connecting this place to the id im just saying its possible not probable not even likely boldt yanked out his cell phone and then shouted at iberson ive got to get topside ive got to make a phone call iberson flagged down the next bus that approached boldt and babcock hit the surface streets less than two minutes later the offering the low tunnel bent around a turn a good deal of the wooden posts and beamsold railroad ties in all probabilitybadly rotted matthews struggled to fight off the fear that wanted to own her walker stopped her instructing her to stand out of his way they hadnt traveled terribly far the going slow she watched as his fading flashlight caught the edge of a large hole in the earthen wall walker stepped up to it and peered inside and she came away with the sense that it was familiar to him she couldnt see into that hole but she prayed silently that he wasnt going to make her go through it it looked like one of those places a person never came out of it failed to give her any sense of hope that it might lead to an escape route walker turned and faced her shining the light first onto her then directing it onto himself enabling her to see him in a childish tone that sent shivers through her he said its important to me you know how much i care ferrell he shushed her and said to understand the extent to which im prepared to go to help you you found the room its why his voice tapered off she worried he couldnt hold a thought that the synapses might be misfiring in his brain either as a result of stress or some organic malfunction that shed failed to identify in the course of her contact with him that facetoface contact had in fact been precious little why what she asked well its the purpose of all this he explained so if weve already accomplished that purpose ferrell maybe we should head up topside together its way beyond that now isnt it he tried to smile but his unwilling face would only pinch further into a snarl come look its for you no thank you come look his hand went to the butt of the knife and matthews felt herself moving as if on the ends of marionette strings id like to go back up to the street now she said pressing for his cooperation in a period where he acted at least somewhat conciliatory toward her he positioned her in front of that dark hole in the wall it looked as if a course of water had ripped loose this rent some years before the sickening smile he managed should have forewarned her he turned slowly training that yellow light with him sitting on a natural throne carved out of the mud like some kind of shrine was a decapitated corpse of a man in a brown uniform matthews cried out loudly and jumped back as the flashlight caught up to the head of nathan prair that sat in his own lap his big hands coddling it for you walker said he was bothering you right i saw you two outside the shelter that night we were supposed to meet i saw you push him him grab you his voice trailed off as he realized she was upset with this not pleased as hed intended you were upset with him walker had been watching her outside the shelter on the night theyd agreed to meetthe night nathan prair had arrived unexpectedly a result no doubt of a phone call or message from walker himself she realized he must have followed her back to lamoiasprobably knowing about the loft alreadymust have gone through that window to leave the key as shed taken blue for a walk hed been playing her all along like a fisherman with a prize catch her vision zoomed in on the faint edge of that light in a staccato way that brought everything closer to her in a series of jerky movements prairs service pistol was still snapped into the holster on his work belt now just to the right of his ear next to it an unmarked black can of pepper spray next to that a maglite walker who had shown no interest in gayness weapon had clearly ignored prairs as well it took every ounce of strength and composure she could summon but she stepped forward toward the shrine i was upset with him she said youre right about that she made a point of making contact with walker and allowing a smile to grace her lips you did this for me walker nodded but his eyes ticked back and forth distrustfully as he sought out hers and she wondered which walker had come out to play the one with the boyish crush on her or the knifewielding woman killer she edged yet another step closer to both walker and that hole wondering if she could bring herself to dive in there with that severed head reach the gun and still have enough time to present it as a threat the air tasted metallic and smelled putrid i wanted to help walker said its not what i expected i love surprises he said gooseflesh chased up her arms and down her spine she said do you oh good with that she recoiled wound up and then leaned forward driving her weight into the shove that lifted walker off his feet and sent him flying she dived to her left into that hole slipped and scrambled up the muddy slope facedown next to prairs severed head as she fumbled with the holsters snap grabbed hold of the weapon racked the slide to chamber a round thumbed the safety off and rolled walker was on his feet at the mouth of the hole as she squeezed the trigger click the trigger then stuck she frantically tried to clear the jammed round as walker took hold of her ankles and pulled dropping her flat onto her back prairs head rolled off of his lap and up onto her chest and she threw it aside screaming she felt the weight of the gun then and she knew its magazine was missing walker had emptied the gun walker had baited her yet again he clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth shaming her someones been a bad girl he said she lunged for the can of pepper spray in prairs belt empty walker called out she threw the weapon at him but he deflected it ive never liked guns he said i feel much safer with this he held the curved gray blade between them bloodstained and mudcovered matthews took a moment to regain her breath she had disassociated from him a conscious effort on her part that now would not come without consequences he had tested her and she had been suckered into it and she had failed it changes everything he said sadly you know that dont you there were no words for her only a pounding heart a dry tongue and the chills that came with the knowledge of what she had done she chastised herself for that decisionshed allowed the emotion of fear to overcome any hope of rationally negotiating her way out had she been outside of this observing it she could have identified the victims bad decision making at every turn but from inside her own cloistered fear she felt only punishment for her will to survive and the internal strength to act upon it on your feet anna he said not hearing his own slip metaphorically she saw light at the end of the tunnel then she realized it was for real there was light up ahead were going to go join your friends he said hebringer and randolf the only two friends she could think of were going to get to know each other she needed some way to attempt to rekindle rapport even if she played into his fantasy that she was none other than his sister she searched wildly for a nickname a sister might have used for a younger brother at some point in their long relationship she settled on the first nickname to pop into her head literally a stab in the dark i already know you ferris wheel walker snapped his head toward her he stared at her until she felt him looking through her not at her her head ached but she kept it up you think anna didnt know that you watched her and lanny neal of course she did ferris wheel he shoved her she staggered back but did not fall nathan prairs head sideways in the mud now watched them matthews said is that what caused the split between you your watching he shoved her again and this time she went down hard in the mud face first on all fours her right hand hit a piece of glass and cut the smell that kicked up was putrid and sickening he trained the light down onto her but by the time he did shed picked the sizeable piece of curved glass out of her palm and had transferred it to her left hand now curled around it she rubbed her bleeding hand on her pants and walker noticed the wound shit he said the child that didnt mean to hurt the family pet up ahead theres this wall well rest there clean that up she gained a few yards on him she wasnt going to run away but she wanted some physical space in which to clear her mind regain herself she recalled all that lamoia had told her about the interview with the barmaid walkers former girlfriend the trouble began after your father died didnt it the pain in her hand lessened she decided she had to keep talking free association whatever came out of her mouth just keep talking it was just the two of you on the boat after that so what pretty close quarters for a man and a woman it wasnt like that no her mind worked furiously through several sets of possibilities shed try them all if she had to you think youre the first guy to ever watch his sister give me a break condescending maryann would have dominated their relationship she sorted out several planes of thought on which to operate areas of possible vulnerability for him she had him talkingthat was the important step she didnt want to lose that for anything until now the mud had disgusted her but as it came to cover her to own her she felt in a primitive state capable of almost anything prepared to strike shut up about her he said no i dont think so she fired back he moved her down the tunnel the mud walls weeped in places if she sneezed hard the ceiling was coming down why do you think you picked me ferrell ill tell you why because i listen because i made sense from the very first time we spoke it was at the docks do you remember of course i remember you liked the way i looked sure they all do ferrell she wanted to make him as small as she could for both their sakes but more important you liked what i said she didnt remember what shed said not exactly but she knew something had initiated the transference and she felt determined to unlock that key you knew i could help you didnt you she asked its why you havent given up on me oh but i have he said chilling her no you havent he raised the knife blade in the dim light and spun it back and forth so that it threw light across her face margarets blood had dried onto that knife got me all figured out do you it flashed again maybe not he said maybe the fuck not she stood her ground plan two you picked me for a reason ferrell because you told me to i told you to what at the morgue he said you told me there was no one else in the room you said to put maryann where you were and i did that and when you spoke i heard her voice just like you said i would you were right im not anna ferrell am i look at me listen to me closely your sister is dead going for that gun just now he said that was impressive that was something anna would have done she felt his eyes encompassing her it was a mistake but it was ballsy how do you think seeing that knife makes me feel how would anna feel you think i want to get to know you when youre holding that knife threatening me with that knife you said you already know me he reminded she didnt want to think of him as smart didnt want him focusing on her attempt to escape deciding to challenge him yet again in an attempt to keep him offbalance you didnt find that sweatshirt did you ferrell i missed that didnt i dont know what youre talking about but he most certainly did maryanns sweatshirt she said you didnt find that sweatshirt you already knew where it was what his voice betrayed him he sheathed the knife taking time to draw its blade clean on his jeans this victory instilled her with a sense of courage you knew where neal hid his car key enough of this youd been with them that night hed misplaced the other key a birthday wasnt it i said enough how did you get her to just sit there while you backed over her ferrell he screamed shut your mouth and she knew shed scored a direct hit up ahead well rest a minute she said wanting it to sound like it was her idea to take control away from him she was starting to understand that walkers transference had gone beyond what shed previously imagined hed not only transferred his feelings for maryann onto her but hed transferred his own guilt onto lanny neal in the form of blame she heard his breathingquick shallow intakesand realized theyd switched roles she had him back on his heels now and didnt want to stop you cant replace her ferrell not with me not with anybody you cant change what has happened as much as youd like to and repeating what youve doneits what you have in mind isnt it that wont help anything itll just make it worse the pain im talking about i know all about the pain itll be much much worse she defiantly and purposely turned her back on him before he had a chance to recover from that she marched forward toward the resting place hed told her about you betrayed me she heard from behind her and she knew this was about maryann not herself she worked with something neal had told them saying over her shoulder you begged her for money to go back out on the boat with you its not what she wanted she wanted a life what did you expect ferrell i sav ed her walker said she owed me she stopped turned saved her from lanny neal from herself she purposely hesitated wanting this next thought to sink in or from you that part of you that thought about her in ways that brothers arent supposed to think about their sisters walker stepped close enough that she could smell his familiar stench from him he said as agitated as shed ever seen him i saved her from him his eyes darted to the left and she knew he regretted having revealed whatever it was hed just revealed without meaning to matthews gasped aloud shed missed the catalyst all along it had been right there in front of herpractically handed to her by lamoiaand shed moved right past it now the pieces fell into place for her like a row of dominoes tumbling over in perfect succession now it finally all made sense the discovery charging her with a renewed strength and sense of purpose she had him he was all hers she said the drowning it wasnt an accident walkers face tightened a mass of pain and she expected tears from his eyes but he proved far stronger far more resilient than shed expected hed already processed some of this and that brought matthews back to his confrontation with maryann raising the knife between them he said accidents happen chasing a cry the first scream turned lamoia in the right direction prior to that hed been following the city storm sewer out toward elliott bay but that cry a womans cry spun him on his heels and he rapidly retraced his steps his cell phone immediately in hand when the phone proved useless its signal blocked by his depth underground he debated climbing back up the chimney of concrete to the manhole through which hed comehe was passing by this exact same spot againdebated enlisting the support of special ops but recalling her request to avoid tying up her rescue in departmentdictated procedures something she had somehow foreseen he passed beneath the manhole entrance ignoring it determined to follow the sound of her voice before he lost it and her with it heading in this direction his flashlight picked up two pairs of muddy shoe prints that a few minutes later led to a woven metal grate in the wall of the storm sewers concrete tube he pulled on the grate and it came free in his hand he stuffed the small flashlight into his mouth like a cigar and used both arms to set the grate aside so he could climb through the muddy tracks continued on the other sidea low horizontal shaft that reminded him of a mining tunnel the thing looked ancient and then his mind seized upon what he was looking at he knew next to nothing about storm sewers and tunnels and yet the detective in him believed that in all probability this was the smugglers tunnel the minister had mentioned a voice shouting came from far away down the tunnelbarely audible this voice was male ferrell walker lamoias chest tightened painfully he trained the maglite into the dark he ducked through the hole and stepped inside that tunnel it smelled familiarlike death he thought im coming he whispered under his breath already moving quickly into the dark a matter of trust in all his visits to mama lu boldt could remember seeing her out of that rattan throne only twice surprised once again by how short she was not small he thought but short i appreciate this great lady he said he and babcock mama lu and her two trained polar bears in the black garb stood behind the butchers meat counter where a crippled stairway led down into the glare of overhead bare bulbs the korean grocery smelled of fresh ginger and exotic spices korean talk radio played from a nasalsounding am radio behind the cash register at the other end of the room this been family secret many generations mr both we understand you i know i trust yes but woman mama lu no know youve nothing to worry about babcock said i give you my word boldt said knowing the commitment that statement represented police no know this nobody know boldt said understood only because this friend of yours matthews boldt said i do this only for you for her you good man mr both you clear billy chens good name he didnt want to have a twentyminute discussion about it but he knew her ways well eat a meal together he said well celebrate she grinned across lipsticksmeared teeth but later she knew him better than he thought yes later show them she said to the larger of her bodyguards to boldt she said saved my life three times this secret maybe save your friend too boldt nodded a frog caught in his throat thank you he said he ducked his head and the three descended the cramped stairs to the storage room below this is old babcock informed him excitedly well before the bodyguard pulled on the gray boards of builtin pantry shelves opening and revealing a narrow passageway into darkness this is it boldt nodded to the big man and led the way through to the damp smells and pitchdark lets hope so he heard himself say seeing double sitting on a damp ledge in total darkness walker having turned off the flashlight to save batteries matthews adjusted the broken piece of bottle glass in her left hand to make the laceration count she would need a good deal of pressure and this made her realize she needed her own hand protected or she might let go of the glass as it also cut into her walker turned the light back on surprising her and took her right hand in his examining her cut its not so bad he said he pulled a soiled rag out of a back pocketshe didnt want to think where it might have beenand he stuffed it into the hand to stem the bleeding without knowing it hed just passed her a shield for her piece of glass she tried to understand his patience why wasnt he in a hurry did he fail to realize that half the citys police department was by now out looking for her or was it simply that he trusted these tunnelsvirtually untraveled by all but the homeless for the past hundred yearsto protect him from discovery or was it something much worse that he wanted to put off what he had in mind for her for as long as possible hostage negotiators never pushed the abductor into making hasty decisions walkers obvious patience came to her as a blessing he might know the tunnels beneath the city but she knew the tunnels of the human mind consumed in total darkness once again she prepared to move the chunk of glass to her right hand how did it start the idea of him having an accident leave it thats not something that comes out of nowhere that builds over time what was it he criticized you thought hed taught you to be a better fisherman than you were something like that you dont know anything but isnt that why were here were here because i wanted you here he said were here because i helped you and i wanted to show you she cut him off no you wanted to test me and you failed the test im here because i understand you ferrell she got the glass set in her right palm take a good long look at your reasons because thats why im here it was your decision not mine and you need to face this she allowed the resulting silence to settle around them like listening for animals in the woods was it maryann she asked in a whisper something he did to maryann the flashlight popped back to life he scooted away from her and she resented not having taken a swipe at him while shed had the chance something you saw him doing to her something you heard him doing to her what out on the boat where you couldnt escape it where she couldnt escape it no indignant rage no shouting protestations ferrell walker looked over sadly in the dull yellow of the weak light and she knew shed scored a hit lets go he said waving her up where to she would need that flashlight of his after she cut him if she lost it to the mud without the flashlight shed be lost down here forever banging into the mud walls and rotting timbers what youre feeling ferrell it isnt something you can escape through a few tunnels hurting me is only going to make it worse you betrayed me he said far too calmly too sadly you both betrayed me you want to talk about both of us answer me this how would maryann have felt if youd put her in this same situation dragging her through the mud and for what to play some game of yours thats supposed to justify what you did to your father would she have played along ferrell they moved in the same direction heads ducked beneath the sagging timbers she guessed north back toward the heart of downtown the shelter that room where vanderhorst had hung the bodies where you saved her didnt you shut up saved her from him and i dont mean lanny neal you dont know anything about it dont i he would drink himself blind wouldnt he criticize your handling of the boat of the fish when all along it was his incompetence that hurt the catch his not yours and then maryann grew up developed into a beautiful young woman and the three of you out on the boat he took advantage of that didnt he advantage of her drunk as he was and you on the other side of a bulkhead were made to listen to the whole demeaning thing and the next morning that dead look in her eyes and you with a rage youve never felt but hes a big ornery man and you arent about to cross him you even suggest something and he hits you upside the head you both carried bruises you and maryann didnt you badges of honor those bruises how long did it go on ferrell months years she paused realizing hed stopped several paces behind her his small light aimed down at his feet head hung in defeat shed scored another direct hit she capitalized on it taking a step back toward him careful to conceal her weapon someone had to do something to stop it you only did what was necessary she hesitated this the most dangerous ground of all the only reason it tore you up inside ferrell the reason it wouldnt go away kept coming back to haunt you is because youre a good person the bad people dont feel anything but you felt bad for what youd done despite the fact it helped her despite the fact you saved her amid the silence a steady drip of water somewhere off in the dark and of all the ungrateful things the minute you save her she leaves you she wanted me to tell them came the mans voice faintly matthews felt both victory and dread she had assumed maryanns act of betrayal had been moving in with lanny neal now she knew shed had the catalyst wrong keep moving you cant outrun this you can run me over you can throw me from a bridge its still going to be inside your head it just happened he said accidents happen you backed over her ferrell that doesnt just happen thats going to stay in your head until we get rid of it there is no we not anymore there isnt theres two of us here ferrell look at me touch me if you want im still here she wanted to lure him closer the piece of glass begged this was the momentwhen shed filled his head with enough images to slow his reaction time but her knees wouldnt obey no more talking he said were all done talking she wanted to help you too she said that was the connection between maryann and her not looks not tone of voice or sexual fantasies maryann had wanted to help him andaccidents happenhed killed her for it she matthews had been his chance to try again and once she understood hed killed his father and sister shed demand what maryann did turn yourself in ferrell let us help you keep moving no she stood her ground defiantly she would not be willingly marched off to her death maryann had clearly run this boys life either directly or indirectly until hed killed her she had to succeed where maryann had finally failed i can help you ferrell i can make it go away but we both have to see it for what it was tell me about the accidents share it with me please she added no longer feeling the same blood lust she didnt want to kill him wound him escape yes but she felt him as much a victim as herself you dont need the knife she said im not going anywhere am i she indicated the tunnels tight confines the truth was she wanted him confinedan easier target this cramped tunnel was perfect for her needs a thought occurred to her and she found herself with no desire to analyze it to preconsider its every possible angle its every possible argument in that fraction of a second where she elected to speak her mind rather than preprocess the thought she spoke it the moment it came to her you could have had me any number of times if you intended to abduct me why now walker waved the knife walk no do it here right here right now she threw her arms open the chunk of glass still gripped in his handkerchief its not about betrayal she answered knowing perfectly well it was but wanting to steer him away from this dont kid yourself its about power control and ill tell you something you won that game with me for a while i gave into that sure i did i played along youre wasting yourself on this anna he said everythings decided save your breath her teeth chattered the son repeats the fathers sins he wanted her on a boat with him he wanted the past back he wanted what his father had had the present the future were no good to him any longer im daphne ferrell i am not maryann maryann is dead were going to spend time together again thats all that matters i can help you out of this she pleaded i can make your father whatever happened out on the boat go away you dont believe that now because you think youve tried everything but its true im your passport out of those nightmares you dont sleep do you ferrell you cant you dont eat muchi can see that just by looking at you he still owns you ferrell i can make him go away i can make it right again thatll never happen he stepped even closer now walk the batteries were dying and her chance of escape along with them if she was going to use that piece of glass on him it had to be soon then tell me about the other accidentmaryanns accident he said you like everything neat and tidy shipshape but it doesnt always work out that way were going to have plenty of time to talk daphne he actually smiled theres light at the end of the tunnel youll see more likely a boat at the end of the tunnel something hed scouted already steal the boat make for the open sea fishermen could stay weeks even months at sea the thought paralyzed her theyll never find me closing the distance ill never find her lamoia thought to himself as he faced a bend in the tunnel its floor covered in a sloppy mud that made tracking difficult if not impossible for all he knew the prints he was following were sixty years old but then the moment he had this thought he spotted a cluster of prints up ahead like a group of pigs had stirred the mud he caught his foot at the very last second his heel connecting with the packed dirt toe about to rock forwarda sense of dread like a soldier about to step on a land mine he moved his foot cautiously and trained his light into the chips of broken glass where a tiny piece of gold sparkled back at him a second later he stood holding her earring im right behind you he caught himself thinking hang tough as he closed the distance toward that disturbed area of tunnel floor he picked up the enormous wash to his left a hole cut out of the wall another tunnel he wondered an exit back up to the surface or into another storm sewer he slipped his pistol out of its holster beneath the deerskin and quickly chambered a round im armed he called out but only loud enough to carry a few yards he contained the flashlight beneath the pistol took three long strides and extending both the weapon and the light lit up the hole jesus christ his stomach turned in shock at the sight of the headless deputy it took him a moment to even locate the head lying on its side and identify it as prairs he caught himself thinking as both a cop and a psychologist this too surprised him escalation walker had sacrificed prair for herthis he knew with all certainty killing the man would have been one thing decapitation signaled a quantum shift a different paradigm he checked the cell phone reception yet another timestill nothing he tried the phones radio function dead as well standing perfectly still as he was he picked up the faint sound of voices like an insect in a dark room he couldnt clearly identify its direction he took a step forward then back he turned around trying a different ear he left prair behind him back in that hole good riddance north he had it now then it faded again and he couldnt be sure if hed had it at all but yes there a womans voice no question about it closer than he thought he moved quickly toward that sound staying to the edge of the narrow tunnel and out of the slop in its center moving as quietly as possible it was all he could do to contain himself to keep from shouting out her name unzipping the truth the consumptive darkness played tricks on her equilibrium making her dizzy walker directed her down to her hands and knees and they crawled under a pair of pipes that bisected the tunnel as she stood he pushed her forward and held her to the muddy floor he shined the yellow light into her eyes she fell he said thats all it was an accident an accident she asked you ran her over ferrell help me through that still straddling her his eyes went distant and he shook his head violently in doing so he gave her the opening she needed but she didnt take itcouldnt take it she needed the answers he spoke so fast so softly that she could hardly keep up she pushed me shouldnt have done that went off the fire escape thought she was dead down there had to mov e her the car that key the back axle you had to move her she repeated directing his focus for her own gain that makes sense i backed it up to get her she was dead and there she was sitting up like that all of a sudden his voice trailed off and she knew he was completely consumed in the memory shed say i pushed her but it wasnt like that i told her to get away from me but she wouldnt she smelled of him of it like the boat matthews allowed walker lowered his head and looked out the top of his eyes at her he nodded when i saw her sitting up like that i knew what i had to do all this she said softly everything youve told me its all understandable she left out any discussion of nathan prair let me help younot like maryann had planned not like that at all the flashlight dimmed it had only minutes left to attempt an escape in the dark was unthinkable instinctively she shifted the grip of her right hand exposing the glass and its razorsharp edge she pushed up to one elbow it had to be now she wanted tears in his eyes his vision blurred she needed to work him like a lump of clay she loved you very much ferrell no matter what happened between her and neal it never came close to what you gave her she wanted to help you because she loved you why else would she have kept trying the way she did his face tightened and you loved her too didnt you walkers shoulders shook no one knows how much he said hoarsely the jaundice of the flashlight painted him in a milky light as he flexed his legs to stand that was the distraction shed waited for her left hand stole the flashlight from his right a look of astonishment overcoming him with her right hand she pulled the curving piece of glass from collarbone to navel like trying to open a stuck zipper locked in disbelief as much as physical shock walker looked down at the wound as if it belonged to someone else in doing so he unintentionally protected his throat as her second effort failed the glass cut his neck below his ear but only superficially walker reared back stumbled fell to one arm and then lifted himself to standing he screamed like a wild animal matthews struggled to her feet and ran the light blinking on and off in her hand to her astonishment she heard him clomping along right behind her echo when boldt heard the scream it came so faintly that he might have mistaken it for something from the street far overhead had it not been for his musical ears had it not been for his heightened senses caused by being confined in a damp earthen grave you hear that he asked babcock no what behind us boldt said turning and aiming his flashlight past her she turned to look back as well as if they might see something more than earth and rotten timbers were going in the wrong direction but the city the underground it has to be this way were going the wrong way he said pushing past her and starting off in the opposite direction babcock stood her ground allowing him to pass youre making a mistake boldt called back to her its mine to make with that she hurried to catch up to him running below graves lamoia had a cops eye a cops nose and a cops instincts but he had the heart of a man and when the faint voices hed been following stopped abruptlyone now clearly a womanshe feared hed lost her he abandoned his effort at stealth charging up the tunnel at a reckless speed given his hunched posture no witticism filled his head longing to escape his lips no wisecrack he was briefly all muscle adrenaline and determination feelings for others often reveal themselves in strange ways it took a tunnel the stench of death and dying voices to illuminate his hearts unwilling truth her life was precious she was to be saved at all costs the tunnel looked ready to come down in places the centuryold railroad ties bulging under the weight and pressure of a city built atop them he passed through sections of warmth and then cold of foul odors followed by none at all graves were dug shallower than this he was running below graves a wall of pipes up ahead briefly appeared to seal off passage and he thought to have come all this way only to find it blocked but as he approached the light revealed the illusionthere was plenty of room to duck beneath the lowest tucking himself through this space lamoia heard a screama mans screama scream that was the result of physical pain not anger and then the wet slop of running not one person but two the detective ascertained not toward him but away from himself he wondered had walker seen the beam of his flashlight heard his approach or was it more likely matthews running away from walker as that scream hed just heard might suggest he broke into a sprint tempted to call out but afraid of giving himself away when his halogen bulb caught the bloodred rag and the jagged piece of glass it contained he didnt cringe but warmed with hope was walker clever enough for that he thought not had walker severed a head with a piece of glass he thought not shed tricked him goddamn itshed tricked him rotten luck a fantail of the faint yellow light indicated either a sharp turn up ahead or the tunnels dead end her mind stuck on that thought dead end had walker ever intended to kill her or only to present her with the body of nathan prair as his peace offering had she brought all this upon herself by going for prairs gun her next thought was that walker cut badly and desperate had purposefully allowed her to charge ahead because he knew she was boxing herself in at once the flashlight failed shaking it did nothing to revive it she worked off the last image shed seen now fading off her retina like a projectors bulb going dim a pile of debris a few yards ahead and to her right walker too had slowed the moment the light died probably suspecting a trap she eased ahead hands stretched in front of her slowly the absolute black lost a tiny amount of its edge a faint amount of light was coming from somewhere up aheadnot yet enough to see by but enough to give her hope she knelt and felt around and formed her fingers around a brick holding it tightly she turned and pressed her back against the cold mud wall alongside what she felt to be the post of a rotting crumbling vertical railroad tie no means of death frightened her more than the idea of being buried alive she tried to slow her breath to hear better but the blood pounding in her ears blotted out all sound she could imagine him approaching but could not see him or sense him her eyes adjusted further and she could make out the silhouette of the post she hid against light meant air air meant the surface accidentally leaning some weight against the post caused a chunk to break loose it fell to the floor and with it some dirt rained down from the tunnel roof walker lunged out of the total darkness misled by the faint light and stabbed his fishing knife into the soft post dirt and debris cascaded down on both of them as matthews cried out and jumped back her feet catching on another pile of debris she went down hard falling backward her hands groping to cushion the fall her head striking yet another post a large chunk of mud fell into her lap followed by a volley of rocks walker staggered toward her seen only as a looming shapea dark mass she swung the brick at his head with the force of a tennis serve but it impacted his shoulder as he too tripped over that pile of debris she swung again and clipped him squarely in the ear and separated a piece of his scalp fuck he shouted his reaction time much faster than seemed possible as the knife flashed in the darkness and she felt her left forearm burn he cut her again higher on the arm he staggered forward and she delivered the brick again but his eyes had adjusted and he careened out of the way falling against the wall smashing into another post with enough force to dislodge it an overhead beam cracked loudly spraying splinters and chunks of wood it swung down toward the wall as if hinged and slammed into walker knocking him back and pinning him half standing he fought to get it off him as matthews heard ita sound she understood before its effects were felt she took two steps backward but was stopped by sight of a flashlight beam it appeared out of the darkness well beyond walker who broke the fallen beam and shoved it to the side matthews john she burst into tears at the sound of his voice she yelled a warning only seconds before the ceiling caved in earth and wood and rock like water from a burst dam she dived back rolled came to her feet and scrambled away the ceiling disintegrating looking back she lost sight of lamoia and his light as the earthen roof rained down she screamed again for him but the world came down as if a dump truck had dropped its load from above the fantail of light shed seen ahead was suddenly a beam and then a spotlight and then the sky as the collapsing tunnel ripped open a section of street or alley as fast as she could scramble the debris filled in around her and under her it briefly overcame her winning the race covering her burying her she dug out frantically gasping for air struggling for purchase then suddenly lifted by a giant wave of moving earth she climbed slipped and ripped her way toward the crest of the wave as it broke and settled reversing its direction sucking her back down matthews clawed out and grabbed hold a moment later finding herself dangling clinging to a buried pipe and a lattice of tangled wires air lights behind her below her was nothing but dirt and mud and asphalt and wires and broken pipe all formed in a giant v pointing down from where shed come no other voices no other sign of life a dog in sand boldt and babcock reached the back end of the cavein only minutes after it had happened his radio miraculously sparking back to life seconds before a plume of dust billowed down the tunnel and briefly overcame them dispatch called a general alarm over the radio that an officer was down buried in a cavein an address was called out babcock reading a gps in hand said to boldt thats us then from somewhere ahead they heard the sound of rock against rock someone was digging believing matthews buried boldt dived into the pile and started tossing anything large enough to grab babcock called him off condemned him for nearly burying them as well and instructed him to carefully remove the larger debris and only from the tunnels very edgeto stay below the cover of an overhead beam whenever possible by directing him in a controlled and determined manner she saved john lamoias life when they reached him lamoia was frantically digging in the wrong directioninto the collapse boldt seized his legs and pulled lamoia gasped for air retched and coughed dazed and disoriented he would not stop diggingas frantic as a dog on a beach again boldt pulled at the mans legs finally stopping him john daffy he shouted i saw her lamoia said returning to his chaotic digging saw her he turned his mudcaked face toward boldt and shouted manically help me as he once again clawed into the pile pathetic in his determination over the radio a male voice shield ninetwenty is tenfortyfivea en route to harborview boldt heard it acondition of patient is good lamoia heard this too and finally stopped digging boldt held the man by the ankles in an attempt to drag him out of there they met eyes in the light of babcocks flashlight something communicated between them as it can only communicate between two men who love the same woman ninetwenty lamoia breathed the white of his teeth showing behind a smile her yeah boldt said i heard faint hope as two male nurses rushed matthews through emergency into a curtained stall where blueclad physicians awaited her matthews asked was there a girl a pregnant girl one of them aimed a small light into her eyes and pulled at her forehead stretching and lifting her eyelids she blinked furiously youre in harborview medical centers emergency room a mans voice reported calmly she took the doc by his surgical scrubs and pulled his face down to hers a girl a knife wound pregnant the doctor separated himself barked a few orders for injections and then checked with his nurse a gentleeyed black woman this nurse shook her head gravely at the doctor while eyeing matthews she didnt make it im sorry the baby matthews asked someone pricked her skin with a needle she winced the clear plastic tubing of an iv rig was quickly untangled a fluid dripped followed by a warm wave of relaxation and peace a sedative the feeling threatened to consume her were going to stitch you up she heard the doctor say weve given you something to help with pain the baby she whispered at the nurse the nurse leaned into her her face suddenly much more gentle they were going to try to deliver the baby postmortem she could barely keep her eyes open sleep pulled her down but she managed to reach out and find the nurses hand the woman leaned in closely matthews said lamoia police officer is he okay the woman looked at her with soft eyes rest she said peacefully no drugs matthews said its just something to relax you not me she complained hoarsely trying to sit up but failing the nurse eased her back down cowboy no drugs he cant have drugs he she couldnt get another word out her tongue an uncooperative slug a deep purple light fanned in at the edges of her eyes stealing away the nurse and finally the overly bright light above the bed just before the goo dragged her down for good she thought she heard the nurse say something but it blended into a dream and she lost all track of it winning the yes i owe you lamoia called out from behind the roar of his kitchen blender and a batch of lamoias originalrecipe margaritas blue patrolled the kitchen floor licking up spills lamoia drizzled tequila through an open hole in the lid a plate of raw salt awaited to his left damn right you do she wore a sling on her left arm some bandages he couldnt see she sat on a padded stool at his kitchen counter even her bottom was sore he wore a series of serious bruises on his face and arms like medals of honor he caught her looking you could kiss them to make them better are we flirting she asked not wanting to be in the houseboat where walker had watched her so closely shed been living as lamoias houseguest for the past week as friends but on this night romance simmered beneath the surface and both felt it he delivered the drinks get over it delicious she said sampling the concoction more where that came from indeed he raised his glass to forgetting she knew he meant well by such a toast but it only served to remind her of all the forgetting she had yet to do ferrell walker wouldnt be forgottenat least not by a legal system hungry to prosecute him the man had months years of waiting to dofirst in the hospital then a prison in the eastern part of the state his rescue from the debris of the cavein had come nearly twenty minutes after lamoias his oxygenstarved brain had failed to recover following resuscitation the guards called him a drooler lamoia called him pitiful matthews called him a casualty she wouldnt soon forget margaret either or the little baby girl the doctors had saved postmortem inquiries had been made margarets mother and stepfather her only living family had refused the child an honors memorial service had been held that same afternoon for deputy sheriff nathan prair neither matthews nor lamoia had attended she sloshed the tangy ice around her mouth taking a big gulp i could have about five of these now thats more like it lamoia said you want to get me drunk john it was your idea not mine besides youre not exactly drinking alone here in case you hadnt noticed he considered this have i ever seen you drunk matthews i dont think so you see thats another thing about you youre always in such total controlof you and everyone around you she drank too fast and froze her throat lamoia brought the mixers pitcher over and refilled her glass halfway he fully topped off his own more please when he failed to accommodate her she reached for the pitcher with her good hand but lamoia caught her gently by her wrist lamoia said no more for you you dont get any excuses excuses for what she asked bewildered by his refusal for a moment the room held perfectly stillthe ferries out on the bay stopped moving the rivulets of margarita froze on the side of the mixerthe only sound in the room the steady thumping of blues tail against one of the stools and the high octane drumming in her ears he reached over took hold of her shirt and carefully drew her to him she reached out for balance with her good hand as he planted his lips onto hers and drew the wind out of her drew her eyelids down her head spinning her toes dancing in her shoes she felt everything inside tense like shed grabbed hold of a live wire and then her muscles melted into a steadily increasing warmth that rose into her chest and flooded her thighs her free hand laced into his curly hair and she kissed him back his bar stool nearly went over she wanted to get naked she wanted him inside her right here on the kitchen counter he whispered no excuses for that you make a mean margarita practice makes perfect in all sorts of things where had that come from she added i may be a little rusty you dont feel rusty his hand was inside the back of her shirt her head tingled no excuses she said none she whispered listen john either we stop right now or we dont it sounded stupid once she heard it replay in her head whatever happens happens he said still kissing her and we give it the best chance it has no excuses no fear she said whoda thought theres a lot you dont know about me matthews i imagine so she added what are the chances you might call me by my first name romeo none he opened his arms and embraced her peace and excitement washed through her take me to bed she whispered into his ear mind reader she sputtered a nervous laugh he grabbed her hand easing off the stool and into his arms she said softly what are we doing living whats so wrong with that old friends the great lady inhabited the same wicker throne a twinkle to her dark eyes that nearly hid behind the mass of flesh as she smiled at boldt dumpling soup crispy beef with pea pods eggfried rice with gulf shrimp you like mr both tasty better than ever he said why eyes so sad you clear up billy chen he make no mistake on job prove again what great friend you are to an old lady friendships are complicated you helped me out too you got woman problem mama lu made it a statement with no room for argument ive got a wonderful wife i love and terrific kids great lady you still got woman problem she said he laughed aloud he thought it might have been the first time hed ever laughed in her company and he wondered if it was bad form he apologized excusing himself just in case you apologizing for laughing you got it bad who is she its a he and she he admitted again she clucked her tongue only a fool suffers another mans pleasure he considered this nodded and said and sometimes a fool has to hear things from a friend to get it right she smacked her lips and picked at her teeth and for a moment he feared she might take out her teeth this monster of flesh trained her dark beady eyes onto him and he withered beneath her gaze he wasnt sure how it had happened but he had a relationship with this woman people change mr both maybe laws dont change but people do not good confuse the two he heard himself admit to her i love them both separately its together im having a hard time there you go again face like a dog she said studying him from the far side of a loaded pair of chopsticks she waited a long time before speaking not a grain of rice fell from her grip she said hearts of gold never break bend sure gold soft but never break she ate the rice and spoke through the food you have good heart mr both heart of gold when he left a half hour later boldt kissed her hand it was the first time hed touched the woman and she clearly appreciated the gesture back in the crown vic he put on a chieftains tape and cranked the volume a plaintive irish ballad sung by van morrison have i told you lately that i love you van the man crooned and boldt hummed along swept up by his emotions he had memories of liz in his head not daphne and this felt absolutely right to him he burped and thought mama lu would have appreciated that more than a kiss on the hand he drove home his thumb keeping the songs slow rhythm on the steering wheel the melody rose from his throat to his lips as he formed the lyrics and began singing loudly he couldnt wait to get home lifes no picnic the houseboat stood empty its hardwood floor gleaming clean because daphne matthews was not the kind of person to sell a house and leave it dirty john had known this moment would hurt and hed offered to join her but shed made this pilgrimage alone she couldnt leave without tears and shed wanted to be alone to suffer them in private so much of her adult life had passed through these doors even if limited in terms of years shed both found herself here and lost herself hereseveral times if she were being honestand parting came hard the lump in her throat practically stopped her from breathing it had been more than a house a homethis place had been a friend that had suffered her complaints her joys and two failed engagements they knew each other yet she didnt want to live the next chapter here her cell phone ranga new numberand she fished it from her purse checking the callerid before she answered it seeing the number on the screen filled her with purpose and joy she felt especially glad that it wasnt john calling hed kept his word about giving her this time here she hardly recognized the guy anymore what on earth was she getting herself into she answered the callerid having alerted her that it was her attorney quick hellos a brief amount of small talk bursting with curiosity matthews asked did you speak with the judge i did has he made a determination there are waiting periods but the relatives declined custody theyd been through this so many times it seemed so simple to matthews why did the courts get involved and make it so complicated she had butterflies she wanted an answer she knew she might lose john if this came to pass and that worried her a part of her questioned the wisdom in losing the one thing currently working in her life she was happy for the first time in a long long time yes but a

to catch his reflection in the silver of the windshield boldt had crossed forty a few years backtinges of gray gave a hint of it he was in the best physical shape of his professional career thanks to weight watchersa renewed interest in tennisand a regimen of situps and pushups in front of cnn each morning he scratched at his tieseeing that he was wearing some of his dinnera familiar habitand hit

winter three to five months of it depending on el nino or el ninaboldt couldnt keep straight which was which beneath twin sliding glass windows on the butt endthe once white house trailer carried a brokenchrome script that boldt reassembled in his head to read everhome it had come to rest in a patch of weedy lawn that needed cutting and was accessed by a poured cement pathbroken and heaved like calving icebergs the emergency vehicles included a crime scene unit van a king county sheriff patrol carand an ambulance with its hood up technically the scene was the seattle police departmentsand therefore boldtsbut danny foremans career had landed him first in the sheriffs departmentthen spdand now bcibureau of criminal investigationwhat some states called the investigative arm of the state police boldt wasnt going to start pawing the dirt in a turf war danny foreman was well likedboth despite and because of his unorthodox approach to law enforcement to his detriment and to his favor he played it solo whenever possible it had won him accolades and gotten him into trouble the job was as much politics as it was raw talentand foreman lacked political skillswhich to boldt explained their mutual respect foreman lay on a stretcher inside a thicket of blackberry bushes that grabbed at boldts pant legs a balloonlike device had been inserted into dannys mouth a woman squeezed the bag while monitoring her sports watch foreman looked wiry and older than the early fifties boldt knew him to be tired and beaten down his nap was graying now and cut shortand a pattern of black moles spread beneath both eyeslending him the masklike look of a raccoon could it possibly have been as long as all that boldt was quickly caught up to date by a deputy sheriff and a paramedicboth interrupting each other to finish the others sentence the deputy sheriff knew the name boldt and acted like a teenager in front of a rock startrying to impress while fawning at the same time boldt had enough headlines to fill a scrapbook but wasnt inclined to keep one he had the highest case clearance per average in the history of the seattle police department he had rumors to defeat and stories to live up toand none of it mattered a damn to himwhich only served to provoke more of the same foreman had apparently been hit by a projectile stun gun and subsequent to thatthese people all spoke the same wayand though boldt was probably supposed to as wellhed never taken up the languagethe subject was administered a dose of an unknown drug with behavioral characteristics not dissimilar to those of rohypnol the date rape drug of choicealternately known as roofiesruffiesrocherriband ropeproduced sedationmuscle relaxationand amnesia in the victimmore commonly a coed found later with her panties down than a cop on a stakeout the ambulance on the scene was having engine troubleand though a second ambulance had been dispatchedefforts were being made to get this one started boldts chest tightened with anticipation as he learned that the combination of the medication and the stun gun had resulted in respiratory depression foreman had nearly stopped breathing hed been unconscious for almost fifteen minutes look what the dog drug in a blinking foreman said suddenlyhis voice slurred behind the drug his coming conscious sent the paramedic into high gear shouting out numbers like a sports announcer you took a stun dart boldt said then they roped you feel like jello no bonesdiscounting the one i got for emmamy nurse here keep it in your pantsdanny the woman saidgrinning or ill search my bag for the hemostats emma and i went to high school together we went to the same high school emma corrected for boldts sake only agent foreman graduated twentyeight years ahead of my class always technicalities with you foreman said we met outside of work emma further explained to foreman she saidand here i am with my hand on your heart wish our situations were reversed its the medication loosening his tongue emma said next thing hell be proposing good part ishe wont remember any of this seriously boldt asked doubtful hell sleep soonand when he wakes hell have lost most of the last few hours good god bullshit foreman said im as clear as day starting when behind him boldt heard the ambulances engine rev and a handful of halfassed cheers ive got a vague recollection of thinking a dog had bit me or a bee stung me thats about it a stakeout boldt inquired a solo stakeout budget cuts meaning you willor will notshare the identity of whoever it was you were watching in that trailer ill need a kiss before i can answer that foreman added from hernot you fat chance the medic said as they strapped foreman into the stretcherboldt collected more bits and pieces foreman had gone offradio while on duty which had eventually caused his own people to go looking for him bci had called king county sheriffasking for a bolbe on lookout a patrol unit had found foremans cara brand new cadillac escaladewhich had eventually led to discovering foreman out cold in the bushes boldt was told the house trailer held a good deal of blood evidence while the emts loaded foreman into the ambulance boldt conducted a quick examination of the trailer a tubeframe lawn chair in the center of the small living room looked to be the origin of most of the blood the scarlet stairs radiated out like the spokes of a wheel dirty dishes filled the sink and the television was ontuned to a rerun of con air the gloved forensics guy told boldt the only thing theyd touched was the mute button on the remote the volume was deafening boldt filed this away as important information several pizza boxes were stacked on the counterthe cardboard oilstainedindicating age in the back bedrooma room about eight by ten feethe took in the unmade bed and clothes on the floor we seem to be missing a body boldt said kcso csu was stenciled across the back of the mans white paper coverallsthe crime scene unit of the king county sheriffs office boldt repeateddo we have a body the man turned around he wore plastic safety glasses over a pinched face were told we have an earlier id made on the possible victim by the surveillance team one peter hayes male caucasian thirtyfour our guy claims hayes was observed inside this structure earlier this evening boldt experienced a small stab of anxiety he knew the nameyet couldnt place it another unpleasant reminder of his being on the other side of forty your guyor bcis guy are you talking about agent foreman we are we do bcis forensics the technician clarified boldt had forgotten about the arrangement between bci and the sheriffs office spd had their own lab and field personnel the ambulance driver wouldnt let boldt ride alongso he followed in the crown vic once at the hospitalwhile they awaited processingboldt found himself a sugarandcream tea and joined foreman in the emergency room no one seemed in any great hurry to help a pro job by the look of it boldt said sounds like it whos peter hayes and why is his name so familiar to me its a case were working we are you sure about thatdanny because i may have squirreled things for you therewithout meaning to i called your lieu on the way over here he said theyd assigned csu to your assault he didnt know anything about any stakeoutanything about a bloody trailer you put csu into that trailer when they showed updannydidnt you this is before you lost your breath and went unconscious isnt that right hayes was paroled from geiger four days ago two years in mediumtwo in minimum and someone wanted him more than you did whys that seventeen million reasons the light finally went off in boldts head hes the guy thats right a wire fraud case involving lizs banksix or seven years earlier seventeen million intercepted electronically not a penny recovered a christmas party boldt said hows that i met the guyhayesat a christmas party for lizs bank sparks firing on top of sparks you were with us at the time i was in my fifth year with fraud yeah before darlenes illness before everything like eighteenhour shifts for me it was wire fraudright fucking black hole is what it was police used the term to define an unsolvable case we collared hayesby luck mostly we never recovered the software he usedand we never found the money more importantwe never uncovered whose money it was we knew it was headed offshorebut it never got there that means someone had seventeen million bucks he was willing to lose rather than identify himself thats what interested us boldt considered this and offered unsolicited advice a cop pulling an unauthorized stakeout on a guy who helped steal seventeen million dollars is going to get asked some questions danny foreman said nothing more of the case came back to boldt it had been a bad time for him and liz he remembered that especially so we put the bloodbath in the trailer down to the rightful owners of the seventeen mil coming after hayes boldt speculated foreman changed the subject we couldnt prove the money ever left the bank bank figured it got deposited into some brokerage accountpapered over by hayes still inside the banks system therebut not there a real whiz kidour peter hayes a real wunderkind he said with the animosity of a scorned investigator boldt knew the feeling he was twentytwo at the timeand the bank had basically given him control over anything with a chip inside it they even called him that chip his nickname did you write this up the stakeout boldt brought it back to the here and now no one in bci gives a shit about a cold case like this ask around i guarantee you this isnt anywhere on spds radar either tell me youre not pulling a lone rangerbecause you know thats how this is going to play do i want the money yes for me personally come on this is about closing a black holenothing more and you think thats how its going to play boldt repeated what the hell were you thinking we connect the dots on thislouits going to prove me out we youre investigating my assaultright spd is in on this now it almost sounded as if foreman had planned it that way he wouldnt put it past him you took a dive in order to get a fiveyearold embezzlement case reopened its not like that part of boldt wanted to congratulate the man if this were the case any cop taking a hiteven a lone rangerwas certain to awaken the sleeping giant of the spd bureaucracy the other part of him didnt want to give foreman that kind of credit didnt want to see a friend misuse the systemdidnt want to believe the assault had been anything but a surprise to danny foreman most of allhe didnt want to think that danny had caused that bloodbath inside the trailer and then done damage to himself in order to cover it up rememberlouthis was lizs bank still isright tell me they dont want their money back or maybe you dont remember i promise you liz remembers boldt felt stung by the commentand he wasnt sure why he remembered plenty just seeing foremans face and hearing his voice triggered any number of memories the cancer ward at university darlene foremans funeral a wake for her while liz healed and grew stronger a growing distance between them as foreman stopped calling and stopped returning calls what the hell happened to us boldt asked liz lived foreman answered as if hed been waiting to say this for years and perhaps he had resentment envy hang any name on it you wantthats what happened and im supposed to tell you im sorrybut im not i still cant bear the thought of being around you two throws me right back into all my shit seeing you nowits a good thingdont get me wrong but not with her not the two of you not together i feel cheatedlouand my guess is itll never go away you want me to pass this off to someone boldt wanted nothing to do with the casenothing to do with old wounds like these it isnt like that id offer lamoia but hes tied up in a seminar two weeks of counterterrorism heaven help the enemy nah my guysll take care of this inhouse i realize it falls within city limitsbut cut us some slack and well save you the paperwork that doesnt sit right with me youre saying you dont want me to open this up was foreman playing him taking it away so that boldt would reach all the harder for it and why was he suckering into it its open nowisnt it i know how you are leave it be lou be a pal and pass it off to my guys it still felt like an attempt at reverse psychology the paperwork finally came through and foreman was officially admitted an xray orderly arrived to escort foreman to the photo booth boldt stayed seated in the uncomfortable chaira threeweekold copy of people magazine dogeared in the plexiglas rackstephen king looking at him sideways boldt called outill wait and see if you need a ride home foreman trundled offhis walk giving away the lingering effect of the drugs boldt felt a knot in his throatstill stunned that friendship could go so far wrongguilty for getting all the breaks while danny foreman had gotten none he hunkered down for a long waitthinking to call liz so she didnt wait up liz lived boldt heard the words echo around in his head like it was some kind of crime
