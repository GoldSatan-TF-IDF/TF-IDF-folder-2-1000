alex scarrow time riders chapter atlantic ocean anyone left here on deck e cried liam oconnor his voiceechoed down the narrow passageway bouncing off the metal walls anyone downhere it was silent save for the muffled cries and clatter of hasty footsteps coming from the deckabove and the deep mournful creak of the ships hull stressing and stretching as thebow end of the ship slowly dipped below the oceans surface liam braced himself against the gradually steepening angle of the floor holding on to thedoorframe of the cabin beside him the chief stewards instructions had been clear to ensure every cabin at this end of the deck was empty before coming up and joininghim he wasnt sure he wanted to the screaming and wailing of women and children that hecould hear coming down the stairwell from above sounded shrill and terrifying at least hereon deck e amid the secondclass cabins there was an eerie sense of peace not quite silentthough far away he could hear a deep rumble and knew it was the sound of the freezing oceancascading into the stricken ship roaring through open bulkheads gradually pulling herdown last call he cried out again a few minutes ago he had roused a young mother and her daughter cowering in one of the cabinswearing their life jackets the woman was paralysed with fear trembling onher bed with her daughter wrapped in her arms liam ushered them out and led them to thestairs to deck d the little girl had quickly kissed his cheek and wished him luck as theyparted on the stairwell as if unlike her confused mother she understood theywere all doomed he could feel the angle of the floor increasing beneath his unsteady feet from the top ofthe passage he heard the crash of crockery tumbling from shelves in the stewardsroom shell be going under soon liam uttered a quick whispered prayer and craned his neck into one last cabin empty a loud groan rippled through the floor it vibrated like the song of a giant whale hefelt it more than heard it his eyes were drawn to something flashing past the cabinssmall porthole he saw nothing but darkness then the fleeting quicksilver flutter of bubblesracing past deck es below the water line sod this he muttered im done here he stepped back out into the passageway and saw at the end a ripple of water only an inch ortwo deep gently lapping up along the carpeted floor towards him oh no the lower end of the passage was his only way out you stayed too long liam you fool you stayed too long he realized now the girl and her mother had been his fateful warning to get out he shouldhave left with them the icecold water met his feet trickled into his shoes and rolled effortlessly past him hetook several steps forward wading deeper into the water feeling its freezing embrace aroundhis ankles his shins his knees up ahead round the bend at the end of the passage was thestairwell he shouldve been climbing five minutes ago he pressedforward whimpering with agony as the icy water rose round his waist and soaked through hiswhite stewards tunic his breath puffed past chattering teeth in clouds of vapour as hestruggled forward ah jjayzzzusss an holy mary i ddontwant to drown he hissed his voice no longer the recently broken timbre of asixteenyearold but the strangled whimper of a frightened child it was getting too deep to wade now ahead of him where the passage turned right for thestairwell the water had reached the wall lights causing them to spark and flicker the stairwells probably flooded he realized that round the corner the water had to be lapping the ceiling and at least oneflight of the stairs would be completely submerged by now his only way out would be to holdhis breath and hope it would last long enough for him to fumble his way up that first flightto the landing ah jjjayzus his blue lips trembled at thethought of floundering in the darkness beneath the surface losing his way feelingthe growing desperation and then finally sucking churning seawater into his lungs it was then he heard it the sound of movement from behind him chapter atlantic ocean he turned to look up the passageway and saw a man standing ankledeep in the waterholding on to a wall rail to prevent himself tumbling down the passage towards him liam oconnor were sstuck liam replied theres no theresno way out his voice sounded shrill liam oconnor the man said again his voice calm what i know who you are lad whuh we need to the man smiled listen liam he looked at his watch you have justunder two minutes left to live the man looked around at the vanillacoloured metalbulkheads of deck e this ships spine will snap in about ninety secondsshell break two thirds of the way along the bow end the larger section the bit youand i are in will sink first like a stone the stern will bob for another minute andfollow us down one and a half miles to the bottom of the ocean ah pplease no no no no liam whimpered realizing that he was crying as we sink the water pressure will quickly mount the hull will buckle under it theair pressure will burst your eardrums the rivets in these walls hesaid running his hand over a row of them will fire out of the bulkheads like bulletsthis passage will instantly fill with water and youll be crushed before you can drownthats at least a small mercy oh jayzus no hhelp us youll die liam the man smiled again and that makes you perfect pperfect the man took several steps forward wading waistdeep into the water towards liam tell me do you want to live what is ththere another wway out the lights in the passageway flickered out in unison then a moment later came back on sixty seconds until she buckles liam not long now is ththere another wway out of if you come with me liam he said holding out a hand there is anotherway youll live an invisible life youll exist as a phantom never quite in thisworld of ours never able to make new friends never able to find love the mansoftened that with a sympathetic smile youll learn about things that well that can ultimately lead to madness if you let itmess with your mind some people choose death i wwant to live i must warn you im not offering you your life liam im offering you a way out thats all liam grabbed hold of the candelabra of a flickering wall light and pulled himself backwardsup the slanting passage his feet finding the floor once more a shuddering groan rippledaround them deafening shes dying liam the titanics back is goingto break in just a few seconds if you believe in god you might wish to joinhim now if you stay here i assure you itll all be over very quickly foryou drowning it was liams worst nightmare for as farback as he could remember hed never learned to swim because of his terrible fear ofwater liam looked up at the man looking at his face for the first time deep sad eyes surroundedby wrinkles of age and then a thought occurred to him are you are yyou an aangel he smiled no im just an old man his hand remained steadyoutstretched towards liam id understand if you chose to stay and die noteveryone decides they want to come liam felt a shudder the floor beneath his feet convulsed and the air around them was filledwith the shriek of tearing sheet metal the pop of unbuckling seams as deck after deck abovethem began to give way one after the other here it is liam weve arrived at decision time liam pulled himself forward up out of the water desperately reaching out for the oldmans proffered hand if there was time if his mind wasnt in a free fall ofpanic he might have wondered who this man was and how exactly he intended to save them bothinstead right now he could think only one thing i dont want to die i dont want to die the lights suddenly winked out leaving them in complete darkness liam flailed with his arm blindly wheres your hand please i dont wantto drown his fingers brushed the old mans the old man caught it and held on say goodbye to your life liam he shouted above the thunderous din of the shipsplitting in two the last sensation that liam was aware of was the vibrating metal floor ofthe passageway beneath his feet giving way and falling falling through darkness chapter new york falling falling falling liam jerked awake his legs kicking out his eyes still clamped shut he felt with his hands material dry and warm covering him it was quiet almost silent except for the softrustle of breathing next to him and a distant muted rumble somewhere far above him he knewthat he was mysteriously somewhere else that much wasobvious he was on a bed or a cot he opened his eyes to see an arched ceiling of crumbling bricksabove him whitewashed long ago with paint that was now flaking off like dandruff from thetop of the arched ceiling a single flickering light bulb dangled from a dusty flex ofcable he lifted himself up on to his elbows he was in a brick alcove somewhere underground perhaps beyond the pool of light comingfrom the bulb above a damp concrete floor spread out from the alcove into darkness where am i he sat up feeling groggy and lightheaded and found himself looking across a gap of threefeet at a bunk bed in the lower bunk he could see a girl a few years older than him stirringin an uneasy sleep he guessed she might be eighteen perhaps nineteen more a young womanthan a girl her eyes rolled beneath the lids her voice whimpered pathetically her legstwitched and kicked making the bunk squeak and rattle with every lurched movement where the hell am i he silently asked himself again chapter somewhere above america maddy carter reached round awkwardly and hit the flush button the toilet hissedwith a vicious suction and for a moment she wondered whether a person unlucky enough toaccidentally snag the button while still sitting on the seat might be sucked down the ubendand blasted out at forty thousand feet to free fall amid a shower of turds nice thought maddy cleaned herself up as best she could within the cramped confines of the toilet cubicleshe stared down at the last of the vomit swirling round the toilet basin and down the holefeeling better now that the aeroplane meal was out rather than still churning in her gut she wiped her mouth dry with the back of her hand and checked in the mirror for any telltaleblobs of puke caught in her hair a tall gawky palefaced girl stared back at her nerdyfreckles she hated so much dappled across her cheeks beneath the frames of her glasses herstrawberryblonde hair dangled lifelessly to her skinny shoulders on which hung a drab greytshirt with the microsoft logo stitched on the front yeah one hundred per cent geek thats what you aremaddy a geekette something of an oddity a female into messing around with circuit boardstrickingup her pc hacking her iphone to give her free internet access a girlgeek agirlgeek who got the screaming terrors everytime she boarded a plane she unlocked the door popped it open and stepped out her eyes glanced up the central aisleof the plane at a sea of headrests and the bobbing forms of several hundred heads she felt a hand on her shoulder and spun round to see an old man standing beside the bank oftoilet cubicles uh what she said removing small hissing headphones from her ears youre madelaine carter from boston booked into seat twentynine d she stared at him bemused what you want to see my ticket or im afraid youve got only a few minutes left to live she felt her stomach lurch getting ready to eject another torrent of halfdigested food aphrase like a few minutes left to live was the last thing a nervous flyer likeher needed to hear right now it ranked alongside words like terrorist andbomb as something one should never utter on a packed passenger planemidflight the old man had the harried look of someone running late to catch a train in a few minutes everyone on this plane will be dead she figured there were only two types of person who might say something like that a completewhacko in need of medication or oh my god she whispered you youre not atterrorist no im here to rescue you madelaine he spoke quietly then cast aglance at the sea of heads either side of the aisle but only you imafraid she shook her head what who i uh her mouth wasflapping pointlessly theres not much time he looked at a wristwatch in about ninetyseconds a small explosive charge will detonate midway along the right side ofthe plane the explosion will knock a hole through the fuselage the plane will instantlydecompress and roll into a steep dive twenty seconds later the starboard wing will sheer offfilling the inside of the plane with aviation fuel which will ignite he sighedthe impact with the woodland below thirtyseven seconds later will kill those whohavent already been incinerated maddy felt the blood drain from her face im sorry he added but im afraid no one will survivethis uh this is this is some kind of sick joke right no joke he continued you alone have achoice you can choose to live hes serious and something about him told her hewasnt on meds she found herself gasping instinctively reaching for her inhalernninety sseconds a bomb goes off less than that now not a whacko then oh god its your bbomb what do you want fromus no its not mine and im not a terrorist i just happen to know thisplane will be destroyed by a device a terrorist group will claim responsibility for ittomorrow morning is there ttime could wwe find the bomb and throw itoff she asked her voice raised in panic shed said the b alittle too loud and it had carried forward several heads up the aisle turned quickly to lookback at her he shook his head even if there was time i cant change events i cantchange history this plane has to go down oh god she whimpered the only thing i can do is take you off before it does she looked up the plane more heads were turning she could hear a rising ripple of voicesand the word bomb as a whispered tidal wave rolled from seat row to seatrow if you take my hand he said offering it to heryoull live and in return ill ask for your help or you can stay you getto choose madelaine maddy realized there were tears of panic rolling down her cheeks the man seemed sane seemedcalm seemed deadly serious and yet how could anyone betaken off this plane midflight i know you dont believe in god he said ive read yourfile i know youre an atheist so i wont try to tell you im an angel iknow you have a fear of heights that youre not great on planes either i know yourfavourite drink is dr pepper i know you have a recurring nightmare about falling from ayellowpainted tree house i know so many more things about you she frowned how how do you know ththat he looked down at his watch you have thirty seconds left a stewardess was now striding down the aisle towards them her eyes widened with concern i know youre an avid reader of science fiction madelaine so perhapsitll be easier for you to understand if i tell you im from thefuture her mouth opened and closed but but thats impossible time travel will become possible in about forty years time his handextended towards her she looked down at it uncertainly twenty seconds madelaine take my hand she looked up at his lined face why why why you she nodded you fit the skill profile exactly she swallowed nervously felt her breathing becoming laboured and erratic confusedpanicstricken unable to think of a useful next question we need you he said looking at his watch fifteenseconds its time to decide whwho are yyou i or i should say we are the people who fixbroken things now take my hand madelaine take it now instinctively she stretched out towards him a stewardess pulled up a few feet short of them excuse me she cut insomeone has reported the pair of you loudly using the b word bomb she whispered the word quietly im sorrybut you just cant use language like that on a passenger plane the old man looked up at her and smiled sadly no im the one whos sorry maam i truly am maddy looked at him this is for real he nodded and we have to leave right now ok she uttered grasping his extended hand tightly the stewardess tipped her head on one side curiously her forehead furrowed her lips pursedshe was about to ask how they planned to leave the plane exactly then the world suddenly was a blinding white and maddy snapped her eyes shut chapter new york she was screaming at least thats what she thought the sound was it mighthave been her it might have been the sound of a wing tearing itself from the plane it might even have been the stewardess she wasnt sure a terrifying dropping sensation dropping away into darkness nooooo she found herself crying with a voice that sounded like the raggeddeathsqueal of a slaughtered pig she lurched suddenly and violently oh jayzuschristalmighty a male voice beside her gasped maddys eyes opened wide and locked on to a flickering light bulb dangling from a brickceiling then on to the rusty springs of a grubby bunk bed directly above her finally to herright her eyes drifted to the smooth face of a young man sitting on a scruffy metalframedbed across from her dressed in what looked like a waiters uniform jayzuschristalmighty you made me jump there he uttered one secondyou were sleeping all peaceful the next youre up like a screaminbanshee maddy felt her breath rattling like a startled moth caught in a wire cage wheezing shelooked down and saw she was still clasping her inhaler just as she had been a moment agoaboard the plane she took a long pull on it and then managed to find enough air in her lungsto sit up slowly im dead i must be dead the young man managed a weak and awkward smile me too i think they looked at each other for a moment i wonder he said do you think that this is heaven she finished his question no such thing if thereis then it looks a bit rubbish to me the bunk bed in which she was lyingcreaked with movement from above maddy looked up at the springs and mattress is there somebody else up there liam nodded yeah a young darkskinned girl shes asleep her names saleena a voice called out of the darkness they both jerked round to look out into the gloom beyond the light thrown down from the barebulb they heard footsteps on the hard concrete floor and then faintly at first they saw a manemerge from the darkness carrying a tray coffee asked the old man oh my god gasped maddy recognizing the face liams jaw dropped you youre the man on deck e thats right he replied calmly my namesfoster he joined them setting the tray of chipped mugs and a carton of doughnuts on the floorbetween the beds he sat on the bed next to liam and youre madelaine carter and youre liam oconnor henodded towards the top bunk the girl up theres sal vikram shes onlyyoung thirteen the poor girl will be terrified when she comes to here he handedliam and maddy a mug of coffee you could both probably do with a littlepickmeup mr foster is it asked liam he smiled foster mr foster im not fussed mr foster where are we maddy nodded i should be dead theres no way youcouldve got me off that plane no way foster turned to her time travel remember she narrowed her eyes but thats impossible no its not he shook his head unfortunately whats time travel asked liam maddy cocked her head at him youre kidding me right go easy on the lad said foster hes from they didnthave much in the way of scifi shows and comics back then she turned back to liam looking more closely at his clothes not a waiter but aships steward she spotted white star lines stitched on abreast pocket youre serious very added foster liam here was aboard the titanic her mouth flopped open what liam looked confused whyre you staring at me likethat he asked her because liam said foster youre from ireland a hundred yearsago the old man laughed and shes from new york the year liams dark eyebrows lifted in unison and saleena vikram up there on the top bunk shes from mumbai india theyear foster offered a grin that made his old face crinkle like greaseproofpaper and as for me well he smiled lets say icome from neverneverland maddy leaned forward oh my god come on when the twentysecond century furtheron his smile told her nothing do they have spaceships in your time has mankind colonized the solar system has warpdrive been invented yet he held a hand up to shush her another time perhaps right now there are moreimportant things to attend to before either of them could reply they heard a stirring from the bunk bedabove them shes coming round said foster shell be even moredisorientated more frightened than either of you maddy slurped a hot mouthful of coffee from the mug in her hands i seriously doubtthat the girls murmuring turned to a frightened whimpering that quickly intensified fosterstood up and leaned over the top bunk shhh its ok saleena he cooed reassuringly itsall over youre safe now the girls mewling voice became a sudden shrill shriek as her eyes snapped open and shesat stiffly upright on the bunk foster held her narrow shoulders firmly saleena he spoke quickly and softlyyoure safe no one can hurt you here its over the girls breath came in short stuttering gasps her eyes thickly rimmed with darkeyeliner widened behind a drooping black fringe that slanted across her narrow face theydarted from one thing to another for the moment it seemed making sense of absolutelynothing its over saleena said foster again youre safenow her gaze settled on the old man she flicked her fringe away from an almost ashen face hercoffeecoloured skin was drained to an almost corpselike grey liam stood up and peered over the edge of the bunk cocking a bemused eyebrow at her strangeappearance a dark hooded top with some scruffy wording splashed in neon orange across itthin drainpipe jeans ripped and patched with patches on top of patches and boots that lookedtwo sizes too big for her laced up past her ankles and a small stud pierced her upperlip uh he did a double take before extending a hand in greeting mynames liam oconnor pleased to give her a moment liam said foster just amoment her extraction was particularly traumatic is it you her voice was small shaken uncertain the man theman in the flames thats right he smiled warmly its me saleena sal she replied sal only my mum and dad call mesaleena sal then he said helping her up she swung her legs over the side of thebunk and silently studied the other two a boy dressed like a hotel porter and a lankhairedteenage girl with glasses hey said maddy welcome to weirdsville just give her a bit of room there let her catch her breath you got an odd accent so you have said liam curiously to sal thats rich snorted maddy coming from you shes from a city called mumbai in india liam youd know it asbombay but she speaks english so she does well duh said maddy rolling her eyes they all do its abilingual nation chapter new york the coffee was gone and one last unwanted doughnut sat in the box weve been did you say recruitedmaddy repeated yes thats right youre working for the agency now liam leaned forward uh mr foster sir what exactly is theagency let me go through everything i need to say first then you can all ask as manyquestions as you like itll be much quicker if we do this my way they nodded foster pointed out at the darkness beyond the alcove i left the other lights off inhere so you wouldnt see it all this place the equipment and beoverwhelmed by it right now lets just pretend theres only this little brickarchway that light bulb the four of us and these beds and thats whereill start he took a deep breath time travel exists boys and girls he left that statement hanging in the air for a few moments before continuing a theoretical physics paper demonstrating the possibility was written in thefirst successful prototype machine was constructed in he sighed now thatweve opened that can of worms we cant close it he studied them with deep stern eyes hidden between furrowed eyebrows andsallow cheeks etched with crisscrossing wrinkles mankind was never meant to dabble with time never butnow that we know how to somebody needs to make sure that nobody actually does so and if some fool does go back in time then its someones jobto fix the damage caused as quickly as possible there was a faint tremor in his rasping oldmans voice time travel is a terrifying weapon far more powerful than anything ever beforeconceived he said grimly mankind just isnt ready for that kind ofknowledge were like children casually playing toss and catch with an atombomb liam cocked his head questioningly whats an atom b ill explain later replied foster which brings me to you threeand this place he said gesturing at the darkness beyond the pool of light thefact is there are too few of us timeriders groups like us dotted around the worlddotted through time watching and waiting patiently watching for what asked maddy for a shift a shift he nodded it starts as something ever so slight almost unnoticeable to the eye youcatch it then when its just a ripple you have to because before you know it itbecomes a tidal wave it becomes unstoppable uncontrollable and then were all trulyscrewed sals eyes had been lost in the darkness still far away but she turned to look atfoster what is a shift a shift is the result of time being disturbed foster pursed his lips in thought for a moment ok think of it like this time is like a still pool or a bath have you ever tried stepping into a bath without creating a ripple its impossible isntit the three of them nodded as the bulb above them flickered and fizzed ever so slightly in the same way its impossible to step through into the past without creatinga ripple but the problem is the ripple spreads and grows from the point at which someonesteps in from that we get a tidal wave that increases in size and destroys everything in itsway to replace it with a new world a universe that might havebeen liam shook his head not sure i understand i get it said sal if you change the past a little youll changethe present a lot foster nodded thats exactly right sal the light dimmed for a moment then winked on and off foster looked up at it irritatedthe bulbs worked loose again he stood and carefully covering his hands with the sleeve of his jumper twisted the bulbthe flickering stopped we need to rewire this place but there never seems to be enoughtime maddy looked around where are we it looks like some skanky old railwayarch foster smiled thats pretty much what it is its actually a the light dimmed and flickered once more and his eyes suddenly widened oh no the others looked up at his face all of a sudden a shade paler whats up asked maddy its here he whispered a shift asked liam no he shook his head worse chapter new york fosters eyes remained on the fizzing and flickering light bulbits draining the energy i thought it was the damned light bulb on the fritzstupid of me he hissed whats draining the energy asked maddy the strained tone in fosters lowered voice unsettled the others i thought the thing had gone what thing asked liam foster turned to him raising a finger to his lips to hush them a seeker it shouldve faded by now it musthave been leeching power somehow just enough to keep it alive the old man reached up with one hand and found a switch on the brick wall he snapped it offand instantly the bulb winked out leaving them in complete darkness sals small voice cut the silence softly er its dark shhh its all right foster whispered were going to sittight for a little while as long as were still well be just fine a long silence stretched out disturbed only by the sound of their ragged breathing thenliam saw something faint moving in the darkness the slightest glow barely an outlineof something a seeker foster uttered quietly its very weak now onits last legs maddy stirred it looks like a ghost we dont know what they are exactly replied foster but every nowand then when you open a time portal its possible to attract one accidentallytrap one of them and bring it back with you the undulating outline pulsed and flickered like a loose cluster of fireflies embers dancingabove a campfire thats what happened here the last team fosters whisperquietened to nothing the last team what asked maddy i must have brought one back with me the last mission i took into thepast he replied i went out for some food came back a few hourslater he paused for a moment considering how to continue what was leftof them wasnt very nice to look at liam heard maddys breath hitch theyre pure energy but they can take physical formif theyre charged up enough its not good when that happens the pale blue cloud drifted across the darkness in front of them a spectral form like a lostspirit in a graveyard a wisp of morning mist in a deep dark wood but this ones grown weak i thought it had gone faded away to nothinghe shook his head with disbelief i was cleaning up the mess looking up your files onthe computer preparing to send myself into the past to find you and bring you back and allthat time the thing was lurking here in this place quietly watching me the shape stopped moving it hovered just a few yards away a dull pulsating glow that infleeting moments seemed to find a shape that reminded liam of mythical creatures acentaur a unicorn a dragon before becoming a pale cloud once more id say its too weak to take a physical form its dying butwere best just keeping back for now does that thing know were here asked maddy perhaps liam licked his dry lips anxiously where did it come from another dimension foster replied another dimension overlaying oursperhaps attracted to the energy of a time portal like a moth is to light these things areanother reason we should never have messed with time to begin with the entity moved again this time drifting ponderously towards them er its getting closer whispered sal yes i do believe it is but were safe right mr foster asked liamyou said its too weak to hurt us fosters silence in the pitch black was less than comforting we should leave he finally replied weve got over thirty hoursbefore we need to return before the archs time bubble resets i cant see thisthing surviving that much longer time bubble ill explain outside everyone grab a hand theres a mess of things inhere to get tangled in i need to lead us out liam maddy and sal reached out and fumbled in the dark each finding desperate probing handsand grasping them tightly whose hand have i got asked foster squeezing as he asked uh mine replied liam you holding someone elses mine i think whispered maddy and ive gotsals good lets move slowly and quietly foster clambered to his feet and liam felt a gentle pull he followed his eyes remaining onthe pale cloud a few yards away it was hesitant now still finding curious fleeting outlinesand just as quickly abandoning them liam felt his feet catch on something snaking across the floor and steppedgingerly over it fearful of tripping and making a noise behind him he heard maddy and saltreading lightly through the pitch black foster led the way stealthily until finally liam sensed they hadarrived at a wall the doors here somewhere hissed foster he heard the old man patting the crumbling brick wall with his palms and then the rattle ofknuckles on something metal found it liam turned to look over his shoulder the seeker was little more than a faint blotch in thedarkness foster cursed under his breath with the power off ill need to crank theshutterdoor open by hand will it take long asked sal quietly not too long good because i think its moving our way she looked at the othersoh my god can you hear it itswhispering liam cocked his head as he studied the faint bluish blur he couldnt hear anything butfoster working the crank handle no but youre right about it coming thisway the manual winch was squealing like it needed oil badly while the metal shutter rattlednoisily in its frame as it inched slowly upwards he felt a draught of cool outside air on his legs and saw a crack of pale light at the bottomof the shutter shes right its definitely coming closer foster said maddyurgently can you do that any faster the shutter clunked and rattled up noisily the sliver of light coming from outside wideningmuch too slowly there thats enough to duck through he uttered winded from theexertion ladies first offered liam he turned to look back over his shoulder almostinstantly regretting his chivalry the seeker was making fast progressgliding towards them almost upon them now no more than a dozen feet away theamorphous cloud of scintillating particles seemed to rear up as it drew across the floorforming the momentary outline of some kind of face an angelic childlike face a littlegirl then the face decayed into some kind of nightmarish creature with empty eyesockets and an elongated jaw liam wondered whether this thing was as spent as foster hadclaimed or whether it was still capable of doing harm under you go liam said foster tapping his shoulder quicklynow liam dropped down and squeezed under the shutter door joining the girls outside fosteremerged a moment later and with far less difficulty using the handle outside worked theshutter down again it rattled against the ground just as a faint tendril of blue light hadbegun to feel its way out through the gap its weakened enough that it wont get through he said with asmile he took a deep breath and grinned apologetically sorry about that now thenhe continued turning to gesture at the world around them with both hands welcome toyour new home liam turned from the corrugated metal shutter daubed with messy paint that he wouldlater find out was called graffiti to witness a giantsuspended iron bridge right above him crossing the glistening waters of a wide river towardsa glowing metropolis set against the blood red of an evening sky he was stunned by a millionlights glowing and buzzing flickering and changing colour beautifully reflected in the calmwater in front of them oh jayzusnmary thats thats his voice faltered at the sight of the futuristic scene oh jahulla i know that utteredsal its new york at least how it used to be thats right said foster lets go get something to eat iknow a great burger place just over the bridge chapter new york half an hour later the four of them were sitting in a window booth perched on tallstools around a table and tucking into double cheeseburgers and fries liams initial reaction to the plate of food had been one of bemusement the frieslooked like no potatoes hed ever encountered before and the burger bun waxy andbrown reminded him oddly of varnished wood the savoury smell wafting up howeversoon overcame him and warily watching the others hungrily tucking in he followed suit as he clumsily manhandled the wellstacked cheeseburger into his mouth his eyes were on theintersection outside the pulsing lights of a billboard the busy throng of pedestrians carsthat looked as sleek as dew drops the neon glow from lamp posts and a sky barely visibleabove the tower blocks filled with the winking red and green lights of planes crisscrossingthe night sky it looks so different now said sal justlike mumbai my dad brought me here on a business trip once it was depressing theroads empty and so many buildings like dark and empty foster nodded the year you come from sal new york was already adying city people moved out whole neighbourhoods were left deserted and began falling intodecay maddy finished a mouthful of burger it doesnt look that different to methough thats because right now were in only a few yearsbefore your time foster replied the global economic crash had onlyreally just started liam turned from the window to look wideeyed at foster i cant believe this isalmost a hundred years in my future for you liam yes for maddy its just nine years ago for salits eleven years before she was even born he sipped a mouthful of cold frothybeer from a tall glass this is where you as a team will be stationed the archwayunder the bridge is your base of operations your fieldoffice maddy looked at him are there other field offices he wiped his mouth and nodded but youll never meet them or communicate withthem why not he picked at the fries on his plate its just the way it is sal chugged a mouthful of dr pepper i still dont get why were herewhat exactly you want us for you are police sort of foster repliedhere to police time to stop trespassers from the futurechanging things in the past the agency is top secret it really isnt supposed toexist so we dont have a proper job title but inside the agency we call ourselvestimeriders timeriders foster hunched forward and stroked his chin thoughtfully look think of time as a river a river that always flows downhill well we canride up it or down it ride time timeride just like being in a river boat with a paddle wecan go against the flow and your job will be looking for other people on the river goingagainst the flow when they have no business to youll look for them find themterminate them and tidy up whatever damage theyve done howre we going to do that asked maddy well ill be training you of course foster smiledtiredly as quickly as i can we need this field office to be operational again as soonas is possible sal looked up from her food the team before us what were they like fosters smile faded a little like you once i suppose the old manlooked away guiltily to gaze out of the window he chewed on his lips for a momentyoung inexperienced and frightened at first and ultimately veryunlucky that thing really killed them he nodded seekers are rare and normally we do a density scan before pulling someoneback from a mission that last time we didnt and fosters wordsfaded into an uncomfortable silence so liam cut in when do we start this training youmentioned foster turned to them now he sipped his beer again took a deep breath i think we should start with a littlebit of a history lesson the history of time travel chapter new york dr paul kramer looked out at the dark streets of the city the boardedupbuildings the discarded vehicles left rusting down the backstreets every so often theircoach passed a pedestrian a small scruffy corner shop a light glowing through a grimywindow new york was a rundown relic of the thriving city it had once been there were whole blocksthat were now little more than deserted shells populated by feral packs of dogs andpigeons the coach was heading down central park west off broadway kramer had seen films made sixtyyears ago that showed these streets full of life and colour and hope now it was a dismal andgrey place a city dying piece by piece block by block the coach slowed down as it passed a police precinct building the windows protected by metalgrilles no need to drive too cautiously karl said kramer youll makethe police suspicious karl haas driving picked up the speed a little kramer twisted in his seat and looked back down the coach his men two dozen of them satquietly in their seats lost in thought pensive all of them fighting fit wearing combatfatigues ready for their mission the aisle between both rows of seats wasclogged with their kit crates and canvas carrybags full of weapons he smiled proudly good men arent they paul were nearly there he said to karl karl nodded and then barked out to the men behind them make ready they stirred immediately and he could hear the rattle of firearms being racked and readied touse they were all experienced many of them exmilitary all of them firmly committedto kramers plan none of them married or leaving children behind a oneway trip away from this dying world clogged with nine billion people most ofthem starving what kramer was offering these young men was hopea chance to change things for the better in the thigh pocket of kramers combat pants was the one little thing that was going tomake that possible for them a black notebook karl turned a corner on to th street the intersection was busier than normal with a fewpedestrians hunched over and miserable shuffling their way home ahead of them was the grandbuilding itself the american museum of natural history like so many others it wasboarded up covered in pigeon droppings and mostly dark waiting in vain for better days kramer felt his heart sink at the sight of its onceproud entrance now darkened with urbangrime and defaced with graffiti this oncegreat nation deserved better this city deservedbetter the museum was a pitiful reminder of a grand time when manhattan really was the centreof the world he could cry honestly he really could chapter new york it began with theory a paper written in by a talented chinesemathematics graduate called edward chan said foster according to him on paperat least it was possible to bend space and time in such a way as to create a hole but it took another fifteen years and someone else toconstruct a prototype that sort of worked the mans name was roald waldstein a quitebrilliant amateur physicist there were all manner of huge corporations and military research teams working day andnight to be the ones to make the first time machine but it was waldstein working in littlemore than a garage who managed to overcome the practical difficulties of turning the theoryinto a functioning device it was waldstein one man on his own who beat corporations andgovernments to the prize maddy laughed the billionaires of tomorrow always seem to start out in garagesdont they foster shook his head eager to continue the story goes that he tested his ownmachine went back to somewhere in the past however he returned acompletely changed man why he claimed he saw something on his trip that scaredhim what waldstein never told anyone what he saw but whatever it was itconvinced him that his work on developing a working time machine was dangerous he becameobsessed with preventing any further work on time travel over the years roald waldsteinbecame rich from other inventions became an influential voice and campaigned very publicly toensure this technology died maddy slurped her dr pepper and obviously it wasnt halted obviously so what happened asked liam chapter new york karl parked the coach outside the rear of the museum where the loading bay andtrade entrances were the men clambered off silently efficiently weapons slung over theirshoulders crates and kit bags carried between them kramer helped one of his men with a canvas sack full of ammo clips it was heavy enough toensure his arms were aching by the time they carefully placed it on the ramp leading up to themuseums shuttered loading bay he looked around quickly the cover of night and sparse lighting from a sputtering arc light almost certainly meant noone had spotted them yet yet soon enough though thered be armed police descending upon them karl a lean and muscular exmarine in his thirties approached him once upon a timehed been technical sergeant karl haas that wasbefore the army spat him out surplus to requirements karl was kramerssecondincommand while dr paul kramer might be the brains the visionary it was karl to whom the men would turn once the fightingstarted dr kramer sir yes karl youre absolutely certain its here he couldnt blame the man for asking once they broke into the museumand sealed themselves inside there wasnt going to be any turning back kramer patted his shoulder its here my friend trust me they worked the loadingbay door open with a sledgehammer smashing the locking bar andpushing the heavy aluminium doors in almost immediately a bell began to ring somewhere insidethe dark cavernous building its ok said kramer there are only a few security guardsinside he looked over his shoulder at the night sky and the distant glow of a policehoverjet sluggishly patrolling the dead skyline of manhattan the police on the otherhand will be with us soon im sure we should get everything inside as quickly aspossible karl nodded yes sir he said and turned smartly away he helped drag in the crates and bags of equipment once everything was inside they pushedthe loadingbay doors closed the area stacked with wooden packing crates flickered to lifein the dazzling strobing light of a welding torch sealing the service door shut make sure thats properly secured ordered kramer he turned to haaskarl take a dozen men and round up the security staff bring them to me the man nodded and headed towards the doors to the museums galleries quickly pickingsome men to go with him kramer felt the item in his pocket his small notebook he silently prayed that hewasnt making a horrendous mistake you know its hidden here paul so many reasons why he could be wrong maybe it wasnt down in the basement of themuseum but instead in some other building maybe the code was copied downincorrectly maybe he really did destroy it have faith in your instincts paul if hed got it wrong though they were going to be nothing more than a couple of dozenangry idealists trapped in a dusty old building full of priceless museum exhibits boxed awayin the hope of better times he guessed the armed police might be wary of using heavycalibre or incendiary weapons forfear of damaging the nations irreplaceable heirlooms but theyd be coming inone way or another and thered be gunfire theyll shoot first and worry about the chipped potterylater chapter new york waldstein destroyed his machine he smashed it up as well as burning allhis notes and files fifteen years of hard work destroyed because he suspected timetravel would ultimately harm this world wow gasped maddy thats a bit over the top isnt itits like deleting all the code for a game just to kill one bug sal looked up from her food so far barely touched so why did he want to make a timemachine in the first place his wife and son died in he made no secret of what was driving him to go back intime to save them no to see them one last time to say goodbye to themwaldstein knew he couldnt save them he couldnt alter history but he could at least tell them he loved them both momentsbefore their lives were to end liam shook his head slowly thats a tough one so it is to have the chance tosave those you love yet not do it because thats the right thing to do foster nodded yes waldstein was a very principled man did he manage to see them when he went back asked sal no one knows if he was successful he never spoke about it he returned as imentioned a very changed man immediately afterwards destroying all his work he began acampaign for all research in time technology to be halted his desperatewarnings that the world could be destroyed by time travel began to find an audience and inearly an international law was passed strictly forbidding the development of thetechnology waldstein became a recluse after that rarely seen in public but content that hiscampaign had put an end to time travel foster sighed but of course it didnt he finished his beer it was obvious that every major corporation every countryevery tinpot dictator anybody with the money the resources andmanpower was secretly working on their own time machinewaldstein had shown it was possible and that was enough so in direct violation of the international law this agency was set up quietlysecretly working on their very own machines let me guess interrupted maddy to go back in time to killwaldstein foster shook his head no just as waldstein couldnt save his family so theagency cant go back in time to prevent him from making his machine history cannot be violated it cannot be changed thats thetidal wave i mentioned a while back remember they nodded you see time can cope with very small changes history can sort of heal itself of very very minor alterations because theres amomentum to events a momentum to history its as if history wants to go a certain route but said foster with a cautionary glance up atthem but a more significant change for example going back in time and talkingwaldstein out of building his machine or even killing him well something like thatwould be enough of a change to cause a tidal wave he looked out of the window at the busy street aglow with neon lightspilling down from a billboard advertising nike sportswear the agency was set up to be ready for what they knew was coming future timetravellers those whod want to change the past and rewrite the present terrorists religious fanatics megalomaniacs the criminally insane anyway hepushed his stool back and stood up thats enough of the history lessonfor now i think its time i took you three outside and showed you a little of the worldout there the time and place in which youre going to be based particularly youliam he smiled youll need to play a little catchup if you want tofamiliarize yourself with the world of maddy shrugged it doesnt look so different just as busy noisy smelly as oh but this is a very different new york saidfoster maddy looked out of the window not really i see the same ol sameol out there adverts for burger king and mcdonalds nike and adidas yellowcabs and guys trying to sell cheap aa batteries that dont work i think id better show you something maddy i think itll mean a lotmore to you than sal and liam chapter new york kramer studied the museums six security guards rounded up by haas and hismen without so much as a shot fired they stared fearfully back at him eyes darting anxiouslydown at the weapon slung over his shoulder a couple of them were tousledhaired andblearyeyed as if theyd been roused from sleep kramer shook his head pityingly great security guards my name is dr paul kramer its very simple gentlemen we want the major medianetworks assembled outside and i want to do an interview with them which will be broadcastacross the nations networks live we also want a hoverjet landed on the roof of themuseum in which we intend to leave untouched when our work here is done if we dont get what we want we will destroy the museum and all ofits incredibly valuable and irreplaceable contents kramer smiled there i said it was pretty simple the security guards stared at him dumbstruck now he continued we will be letting one of you go to take our demandsout to the police who im sure are already on their way by now the rest imafraid will be required to stay here with us as our hostages one of the guards cleared his throat the government wont negotiate withterrorists you must know that we shall see there are too many valuable national heirlooms in thisbuilding even in these godforsaken times people starving people living in shantytowns across this country theres still a pride in our heritage our grand pastthe people will lynch the authorities if this place ends up burning to the groundkramer shrugged almost apologetically im pretty sure theyllnegotiate the guards face stiffened youd reallydestroy this place oh yes kramer smiled sadly im afraid i most definitelywould he took a step towards the security guard whats yourname malone bradley malone kramer appraised the portly guard silently in the distance they could hear the whupwhupwhup of police hoverjets already approaching and the wailingsirens of ground response units converging well bradley i like that you spoke up i really do you seem to have more balls thanthe others so why dont we let you be the one to go out andgive the police our demands you make sure you tell them that were prepared to wait twohours for things to be arranged not a minute more iftheyre late this whole place will go up like a roman candle bradley malone nodded and if they try something dumb like ooh i dont know asurprise assault theyll be very sorry as im sure youve noticed my menand i are armed to the teeth and while im more of a desk man myself karl here andhis boys have quite an impressive amount of combat experience between them malone nodded once more ill be sure to tell them good well its been a pleasure talking with you bradley kramer noddedto one of his men send him out the front entrance he watched them go then turned to haas karl have the other guards taken into the basement well hold them down thereand lets get our kit down there too no time to waste the clocks tickingnow yes sir the men moved quickly and efficiently hustling the hostages through double doors labelledwith a fading sign to storage basement staff access only therest of them began to lift their crates and canvas sacks of equipment after them bangingclumsily through the swing doors and grunting with effort as they hefted them down concretesteps to the basement the sound of the hoverjets and sirens had grown louder and through the metal grilles thatcovered the buildings grand front windows he could see the blue flash of police lightsapart from a couple of his men stationed by the windows keeping an eye on the policeassembling outside weapons unslung and ready to fire kramer stood alone in the dim interiorof the museum of natural historys main hall that should keep everyone busy enough for now he muttered quietly chapter new york foster pointed up at the new york skyline do you see something there thatshouldnt be there maddy gasped oh my god the twin towers thats right said foster the world trade center she looked at him does this mean historys changed already that they wont be destroyed by terrorists the old man shook his head sadly sorry no history remains unaltered remainsin this case regrettably as it should be oh man her eyes moistened id forgotten how beautiful theylooked all lit up at night like that the agency picked this time and this place for a very good reason fostercontinued todays date is the tenth of september tomorrow is theeleventh sal looked up at him her eyes widened suddenly registering something nineeleven she said i remember we studied that inschool thats going to happen tomorrow foster nodded liam looked from one face to another bemused nineeleven whats that whats going to happen nineeleven is how people refer to the terrible thing thatwill happen tomorrow morning liam foster gestured up at the glowing skyscrapers towering above manhattans cityscape likesentinels tomorrow at eight fortyfive am precisely a plane fullof people will be deliberately crashed by terrorists into the side of the north tower andabout eighteen minutes later another will be crashed into the side of the south tower by tenthirty am both towers will have collapsed in on themselves and about three thousand peoplewill have lost their lives liam looked at maddy and noticed the glistening trail of tears running down her cheeks foster took a deep breath many people in new york lost someone they loved someonethey knew the nation was traumatized tomorrow liam this will feel like a very differentcity he placed a comforting hand on maddys arm im sorry i knowfrom our computer records that you lost family in there she nodded a cousin julian he was cool she could have told the others howshed had a childhood crush on him how hed made her laugh till she criedwhenever he came to visit hed run the computer network for one of the banks juliandied along with three thousand others died and left them nothing to bury i know this is painful for you continued foster but for practicalpurposes this is an ideal location for an agency field office why she asked wiping her cheeks dry why does it have to behere why now foster paused for a moment thinking how best to explain the archway you awoke in the field office exists in a time bubble of fortyeighthours two days monday tenth and tuesday the eleventh of september come midnight ontuesday it automatically resets back to the beginning of monday you as a team will livewithin that time bubble you will live those two days over and over again whilst for the restof the world those two days will come and go but why does it have to be these two days askedmaddy i remember that day i was nine my mom and dad both cried thewhole day that tuesday why then because everyones attention will be on what happened no one will ever noticethe comings and goings from that little archway beneath the bridge no one will ever remember foster glanced at liam this young man dressed in astewards uniform wandering around the night before your existence here will neveraffect time never contaminate time youll never beremembered by anyone all anyone will ever recall of today and tomorrow will be the horrendousimages of the planes striking the towers the towers coming down the dustclogged streetsthe griefstricken survivors emerging from the smoke he shrugged im sorry but its how we stay unnoticed madelaineits how we keep the agency a secret its how we keep from contaminating timeourselves she nodded silently new tears beginning to fill her eyes he rested a hand on her arm im truly sorry do you remember the daybefore she shook her head he smiled the day before the monday really was beautiful a warm and sunny daycentral park filled with tourists and new yorkers enjoying the warmth without a care in theworld take comfort in that madelaine at the end of every grim tuesday because for you theworld resets and that monday waits to happen once more maddy wondered if that meant she might one day catch sight of julian striding to work in hissmart office clothes be able to talk to him again warn him not to turn up for work no no i guess i cant she shook the temptingnotion from her head knowing that it would come back again to taunt her foster glanced at his watch its been a few hours now the seeker should havefaded away liam swallowed anxiously youre sure of that mrfoster yes it was already dying when we left i left everything powered off even that lightswitch itll have faded away by now we should head back theres much for thethree of you to learn and learn quickly maddy drew her eyes from the towers and studied foster intently why therush and why us asked sal why you its simple all three of you have the specific skills we need now wehave you though i need to train you for the work at hand foster took a moment to consider what to say next and ill not lie toyou its going to be dangerous he looked at them sombrely i lostthe last team because of a silly mistake a simple stupid mistake they should have scannedbefore pulling me back they didnt so this time the trainings going to be morethorough all three of you will need to work hard youll need to understand how timeworks know what youre doing or he paused looking away or what asked sal or youll end up like the last team they stood in silence watching the busy street listening to the bustle of cabs thethumping bass of a passing sound system the distant squawl of a police siren bouncing offskyscraper walls of glass and steel mr foster liam said after a while what if we dont want to do this the old man offered them a sad pitying smile then theres only one place youcan go back where i found you for you liam back on deck e just as that poor brokenship starts its descent to the bottom of the atlantic ocean liam shuddered involuntarily at the thought im sorry its not much of a choice is it not really muttered liam he spread his hands im afraid thats the way it is maddy shook her head well theres no way im going back on to a planethats about to crash and burn if you decide to stay cautioned foster theres no leaving ifyou decide to stay youre in for good until we die in the service of this agency he nodded sombrely the three of them regarded the old man in stony silence right he said we should probably head back theres one moremember of the team i want to introduce you to liam cocked his head someone like us not exactly no chapter new york its down here somewhere in the dark paul cantyou feel destiny tugging at your sleeve he didnt what he felt were the eyes of karl and his men upon him anxiouslyimpatiently watching him thumbing through his little black notebook through the open door leading on to the stairwell up to the main hall he could hear themuted echo of a loudhailer coming from outside apparently they already had a negotiator outfront trying to establish contact if he wasnt so preoccupied down here it would havebeen fun to be upstairs in the museums main hall watching the growing circus buildingup out there sir karl prompted under his breath theres only half an hourleft of your deadline they will surely come in soon if they think negotiation isntgetting them anywhere i know he replied looking down at the pages of his scrawled handwritingitll take just a moment karl looked around the basement it was filled to the high ceiling with crate after woodencrate of varying shapes and sizes each stamped with a unique catalogue number there werehundreds no thousands of them stacked down here on long rows of metal brackets andwoodenslat shelving kramer looked up and noticed the concern on karls face karl these boxes are all categorized it may appear random but theywere very careful when they closed down the museum to store the exhibits by department bysubdepartment by genus by species kramer waved the black book in front of haas he wanted to be able to locate iteasily quickly not have to sift through a thousand wooden cases kramer lookedaround well find exactly where its located he added theanswers in this little notebook trust me kramer flicked through a few pages finally running his finger down a page filled with fadinghandwriting and here it is crm threezeronine onefivesixseventwozerofiveone karl haas turned to inspect the nearest crates but kramer grabbed his arm we dont have the time to check every box we canwork out where to start looking from the number how crm is the prefix code for the scientific exhibits threezeronine is thepalaeontology department kramer turned round and approached the huddled securityguards tell me gentlemen where are the dinosaur exhibits stored they shook their heads nervously one of them a frail old snowyhaired man who looked tenyears past retirement age nodded towards a nearby wall ththeres a chart just ththere kramer smiled ah yes i see thank you he stepped over tore it off the wall and examined it quickly right its downthere i think he pointed along an aisle that faded away into darkness he pulled atorch out of his backpack and switched it on heading at a swift trot into the narrowpassageway flanked on either side by shelves laden with wooden and cardboard boxes of allshapes and sizes after a minute he stopped and checked the code stamp on the box nearest himtwozeroseven were getting closer he whispered to himself and set offagain at a trot footsteps behind him he turned to see karl his torch a swinging beam of light lancing out in front of himsir can i help kramer stopped yes get the men to bring the portagen down this way as soon as welocate this thing well need that generator cranked and ready to go yes sir kramer continued into the darkness a while further then once more drew up and checked thecatalogue stamp on a nearby box threezerosix he wheezed winded by the exertion geology very close now he walked swiftly panning his torch across boxes that were increasing in size from smallshoeboxes to crates that could fit an armchair and even larger ones in which one might fit asmall car or even a dinosaur he grinned this was it palaeontology its got to be somewhere here kramer checked his watch they had about twenty minutes left until the deadline hedgiven expired there was no guarantee the police were going to hold back until then ofcourse but he suspected they probably would and then stall a while longer after thatfinetuning their plans to storm the museum and take down the terrorists inside with theminimum amount of damage to the nations treasures he swung his torch from one box to the next quickly scanning the catalogue numbers getting close he clambered up on to the lowest crate and swiped the beam of his torch across the onesstacked on the shelf above come on come on he found himself hissing where thehell is it his eyes darted from one number to the next its got to be heresomewhere it is have faith as if in answer to a prayer his torch spilled across a crm number he quickly swung thetorch back and read the next four digits one five six seven he looked down at his notebook crm he looked up at the crate again and his lean face creased with relief that the old manwaldstein had been smart enough not to smash up his machine as hed publiclyclaimed but instead to have secretly arranged to hide it down here while the museum wasbeing mothballed there didnt i say have faith kramer nodded his instinct always seemed spot on chapter new york liam looked unhappily at the graffitisprayed metal shutter are you certainits safe to go back in there mr foster the old man nodded assuredly we left nothing on in the arch that the seeker couldleach from no power for six hours itll have faded to nothing by now he grabbed the bottom of the metal shutter liam crank the manual winch at the sidethere would you slowly creaking noisily they winched it up and found themselves staring into the ominouspitchblack interior of the archway from above the arch a deep rumble made the girls and liam jump train from manhattan to brooklyn chuckled foster runs over thewilliamsburg bridge above come on therell be no spooks in here now the old man stepped inside out of the litterstrewn backstreet and disappeared into thethick darkness maddy nodded at liam you first he managed a wavering smile there was me thinking ladiesfirst not in a million freaking years she replied they heard a switch being thrown inside somewhere and immediately several flickeringfluorescent lights dangling on dusty flex suspended from the archwaysceiling winked to life bathing a damp cold floor inside with a pale unwelcoming glare maddy made a face thats our field office the floor was an uneven cold concrete stained with oil gouged scarred and pitted from alifetime of previous tenants across the floor she could see loops of thick cable running fromone side of the archway to the other inside she guessed it was just about big enough to parktwo singledecker buses tightly beside each other along the left wall a bank of computer monitors haphazardly filled a grubby workbench a fewyards along from it in the corner she could see a large perspex cylinder filled with liquidlike some kind of giant test tube the back wall was laced with entwined drooping cables hitched up off the floor on hooks andrunning towards a hole in the wall through which they disappeared beside the hole was asliding door of corrugated metal she presumed that led to another room on the right she noticed the little brick alcove theyd awoken in several hours agobeside the alcove was a wooden kitchen table and a scattering of mismatched chairs a coupleof armchairs were arranged over a threadbare throw rug another alcove contained an electricstove a kettle a microwave and a skankylooking sink beyond that an open door led on to anuninviting toilet it reminded maddy of her older brothers grubby shared flat in boston all it neededwas a floor kneedeep in dirty laundry and discarded pizza boxes its a mess said maddy foster stepped over a rats nest of network cables gaffertaped to the floor its your home he said come on in they stepped gingerly inside sal scooped her fringe out of her eyes and surveyed hersurroundings with a barely concealed expression of distaste on her face can we decorate she asked foster laughed by all means a few more cushions posters and throw rugs wontdo any harm sal he pointed would you hit that switchthere she turned round and looked at the wall beside her this one thats right she did so and with a cranking whir the metal shutter wound down behind them clatteringnoisily as it hit the bottom while the three of them stood motionless trying to find something to like about their newsurroundings foster strode across the floor stepping carefully over snaking cables towardsthe metal sliding door on the back wall what is all this stuff mr foster asked liam pointing towards the computermonitors on the workbench and the large cylindrical water tank all in good time liam first im going to acquaint you with the fourth memberof your team he reached for a handle slid back a locking bolt and pushed the doornoisily aside sal maddy and liam stepped cautiously towards foster looking through the opening into thedark space beyond come on nothings going to bite you he said waving them overyour other team members in here so er whys our teammate hiding alone in a dark closet askedmaddy suspiciously hes not some kind of weird albino freak is he hes foster hesitated well perhaps the best thing is forme to just introduce you follow me he took a step into the darkness sal swallowed nervously as she heard hisshoes clacking across the hard floor inside we normally keep the lighting very low in here the invitro candidates are verysensitive to bright lights especially the smallest ones just a second they heard foster moving around fiddling with something in the darkness then very gentlya couple of wall lights began to glow red softly with that they could just make out half adozen tall cylinders in front of them each about eight feet tall as the soft crimson glowfrom the lights above increased maddy decided to lead the way in she could see tall cylinders of clear perspex inside each she could just about make out somedark solid mass so uh whats in those tubes ill give you a little more light foster spoke in the gloom they heardhim flick a switch and then in the bottom of each cylinder an orange spotlight winked onilluminating the contents oh my god she recoiled thats utterly gross each cylinder contained what looked like a watery tomato soup in which floated a gooeysediment and strands of soft tissue that dangled and wafted like snot in a toilet bowl in themiddle of the murky stew of the nearest tube floated something small and pale and curled up onitself strands of umbilical tissue connected to it so that it looked like a pale larva caughtin a glistening web of entrails thats a thats a human foetus isnt it said maddystepping towards it and peering closely through the glass liam and sal joined her prenatal phase that one is in pregrowth stasis itll remain like that untilwe need it here he said standing by the next tube along we have one that is approximately one third of the way through the growthcycle they looked into the murky water of the second tube to see what appeared to be a boy ofeleven or twelve years of age hairless naked and tucked into a similar foetal curl like thefoetus umbilical cords connected to it and curled down to the bottom and up to the top of thecylinder liam found himself recoiling at the sight horrified disgusted and curious at the sametime thats not a real boy in there isit no its an artificial foster said grown from engineered humangenetic data liam shrugged the word genetic meant absolutely nothing to him but he wasreassured by fosters answer that he wasnt looking at a real child floating like a pickled egg in a vinegar jar he leaned closer to get abetter look at the still form of the boy and then its eyes suddenly snapped open chapter new york oh jayzus liam blurted as he and the girls lurched backwards inhorror its ok said foster its ok its not going to leapout and get you all three of them gathered their breath sal giggled nervously maddy shook her headoh my god its like something out of aliens they watched in silent fascination as the boys eyes slowly swivelled round to look atthem through the murky fluid i think its seen us said maddy yes replied foster its seeing us but theres nointelligence there the bodys motor responses are handled by a small organic brain atthis stage it has the brain capacity of a mouse real cognitive processing in otherwords thinking thats incorporated later whentheyre nearly full term the boys mouth opened and closed silently is it trying to talk whispered sal no thats just a reflex action liam watched the cloudy liquid drift in and out of the boys open mouth how canit breathe oxygenated liquid solution its breathing the liquid into its lungs just likewe breathe air liam shuddered at the thought of that but that must feel just likedrowning foster nodded i suppose it would feel like that if you were unused to it but thisunit has known no different the boy in the tube cocked his head jahulla gasped sal leaping back did you see that maddy stepped closer to the glass tube are you sure its not youknow thinking foster nodded trust me there isnt enough brain matter in there to think yes its awake and looking at us but its notwondering who we are she shook her head it looks just like a normal little boy that doesnt seemright to me come on said foster were here to meet yourcolleague with some difficulty he managed to drag them away from the boy in the tube past a couple oftubes covered over with a tarpaulin whats in there asked liam foster shook his head misgrowths ill need to flush them sometime misgrowths ones that didnt turn out quite right it happens from time to time sal started to lift the canvas and peek under before foster stepped forward and pulled thetarpaulin back down probably best if you dont looksal inside these tubes is the stuff of nightmares oh muttered sal here said foster this is your colleague he pointed towards thelast tube like the others it was full of murky organic soup but this time through thefloating clouds of debris they could see a fully grown man gosh uttered maddy itsfreaking well built she nodded liam studied the creature inside he was easily six maybe seven feet tallbroad shouldered every part of his stocky frame wrapped with welldefined bulky musclesliam was reminded of a book by a woman called mary shelley the story was about a monsterraised from the dead by a mad old man called frankenstein it looks like some kind of superhero whispered sal in awe uh it looks very strong so it does said liam warily guessing how muchdamage just one of those huge hands could do are you sure itll behave itselfmr foster the old man laughed oh dont worry liam you couldnt hope for a morereliable colleague does this one have the brain of a mouse too yes but it also has a silicon neural net processor unit and a waferplex data storageunit inserted into its cranium liam looked at foster bemused by the gobbledegook a sillycon newwhat a computer in its head cut in sal liam none the wiser turned to sal a what she sighed and cocked a dark eyebrow you really are from arentyou its a machine that lets the unit store information liam said fosterlots and lots of it in that skull is a small block of circuitry that we can fit morefacts into than a hundred libraries full of books liams jaw dropped hows that possible foster waved a dismissive hand thatll have to come another time the historyof computers is another whole subject and one we dont have time for right nowhe stepped towards a panel on the side of the tube this units been full term for a while now waiting its turn so lets not keep itwaiting any longer eh stand well back this stuff really smells he punched a button the bottom of the perspex tube swivelled open releasing a flood tide ofthe thick liquid on to the floor it splattered and spread a large viscous steamingpool of gunk that smelled appalling like meat gone bad the creature inside flopped outthrough the bottom on to the floor loose and lifeless like a large twist of boiledtagliatelle its dead said sal no its booting up replied fostergive it a moment they watched in silence as the warm foulsmelling liquid steamed on the floor liam notedwith some relief that it was draining away through a grille in the middle of the floor then the naked form twitched maddy and sal gasped thats a good boy whispered foster come on now the muscles flexed and rippled down its back as it slowly stirred to life after a few groggyseconds it pulled itself up on bulging arms as thick as any normal persons thighsuntil it kneeled on its hands and knees the creatures gaze slowly drew up from the floor and rested on them liam could see in the things grey eyes the twinkling of something that looked like anawakening intelligence the clone opened its mouth and vomited out a river of thick pink goothat splattered on to the floor maddy made a face ewww sal curled her lip oh thats totally jahully gross has it just been sick asked liam no its emptying the liquid out of its lungs it gurgled for a moment the sort of sound a contented baby might make aftera feed finally its mouth struggled slowly to form what appeared to be a clumsy and awkwardversion of a friendly smile baa gagah bub glah it uttered chapter new york kramer finished erecting the wire cage tightening the last of the bolts holding ittogether before standing back to look at it this is it asked haas this really is the first ever timemachine kramer nodded admiring it silently it was little more than a metal grille box the size of a shower cubicle sitting beside iton the floor was something that looked like a copper kettle and next to it a modest palmtopcomputer a few feet away their portable generator chugged noisily feeding a steady supply ofpower to waldsteins machine the displacement energy field is fed into the wire cage said kramerits only big enough for us to go through one at a time its going to takeus longer than i thought to get where were going karl haas looked at his watch the deadline passed half an hour ago sir the policesurely wont wait much longer kramer nodded i know we should get started he kneeled down beside thepalmtop and started to tap the touchscreen with a stylus it will be cold where were going karl the men will need to pull out theirwinter tunics ill warn them should i call through the his question was interrupted by the sound of a muffled thud kramer looked at him sharply whats that theyre coming in karl straightened up ill have the menfall back from the main hall we can hold them on the stairwell to the basement its agood chokepoint whatever you think best just buy me as much time as you can karl nodded and turned on his heel running down the dark aisle and already on the radio tohis men upstairs kramer looked back at the screen and tapped in the timestamp a very specific time a veryspecific place he turned to two men standing nearby max stefan we must start by sending the equipment through first allright both men nodded and began dragging their boxes and canvas sacks into the cage karl haas reached the top of the basement stairs and stared out through the opendouble doors into the museums dark main hall he thumbed his radio rudy pieter whats your status the earpiece crackled a reply theyre inside the building they sent tear gasand flashbangs down the left wing and theyre moving our way pull back to the main hall and hold them there for as long as you can weresetting up a defensive position on the basement stairwell copy that karl squinted into the darkness of the main hall and realized despite the slithers of blueflashing lights stealing in through the boardedover windows it was still too dark ok gentlemen he spoke quietly into his radio throat mic itsshow time everyone go to nightvision he reached up to the unit strapped around his crewcut head and flipped thenightsight hud down over his left eye moments later he heard the first percussive rattle of a firearm echoing around the emptyhalls he turned to the man kneeling on the stairs beside him you ready for a fightsaul the soldier nodded even managed an edgy grin yes sir the men lifted in one last sack of equipment and closed the door to the wirecage stand clear said kramer he looked down at the palmtops small glowing screen ok then he saidcrossing his fingers behind his back he turned to max and stefan this is where we getto see if this old machine actually works he tapped an icon on the screen purge immediately sparks spurted from the wire cage showering on to the equipment inside for amoment kramer worried the canvas sacks might smoulder and catch fire causing the ammo clipsinside to explode but the display of fireworks was shortlived as the last glowing embers cascaded down herealized the cage was already empty he looked at his two men wide eyed and grinning likefools he laughed and so it does with no time to savour the moment he ordered them to load up the cage again as he reset thetransmission program on the palmtop at the back of kramers mind although he realized now wasnt the time tovoice it aloud was in what condition were those things arriving at their destinationintact or in pieces he could visualize too easily himself arriving in the past and only living long enough to see his body had been contorted into a steamingpile of insideout organs he licked his lips anxiously youre not chickening out now are you paul chapter new york karl listened to the radio traffic coming in from his men from their quick burstsof distorted crosstalk it sounded as if they were doing a good job of keeping the policearmedresponse teams tied down both flanking teams had called in at least a dozen killsbetween them the police were getting chewedup out there from the snatched exchanges he couldhear over his earpiece but already two of his men were dead rudy had gone down early took several rounds in the chest aden one in the head dead before he hit the ground his men were buying time all right but they couldnt afford to lose too many theycouldnt afford to lose any if truth be told there wereonly two dozen of them twentyfour men not exactly an army hardly enough to conquerhistory he tapped his throat mic all units fall back to the basement stairwell immediatelykeep your heads down i dont want any more casualties doing our bloody best karl one of them called back he recognizedpieters voice one of the other men laughed over the radio comms the intensity of chattering gunfire increased momentarily as both teams laid down suppressingfire before hastily abandoning their positions to fall back to the mainhall karl turned to saul ready theyll need covering fire kramer watched the fourth cageful of equipment vanish amid a shower of sparks hejust prayed to god that their invaluable equipment and his men were all going to end up in thesame spot rather than scattered throughout history he looked around most of the kit had gone through so now he said we need to start sending people max pulled his arcticcamouflage jacket from his backpack ill go firstsir good man max he zipped up his jacket unslung his pulse rifle and offered kramer a crisp clipped salutebefore stepping confidently into the cage you ready yes sir ready to change history sir kramer nodded to change it to the way it should havebeen thats right sir kramer saluted the man he felt selfconscious making the gesture having never been themilitary type but it seemed like the right thing to do ill see you onthe other side with the others max ill see you too sir kramer hit the purge icon the last of karls flanking men raced across the main hall towards where heand saul were holding position in the open doorway to the stairwell moments later several gas canisters rattled across the dusty marble floor of the hall andinstantly spewed clouds of acrid smoke karls men squeezed past him gasping and winded from theirsprint therere loads of em said someone itscrawlin with em out there down the stairs karl shouted and set up a defence position below atthe basement entrance go go the men trampled downstairs their heavy boots and equipment packs jangling noisily karl aimed down the barrel of his automatic his nightsight hud of little use through thebillowing smoke he fired off a dozen rounds into it more in the hope of forcing their headsdown than in hitting a target the kill zone was too wide here for just the two of them to hold theyd be betterwithdrawing with the others and holding the stairwell at the bottom the police would beforced to bunch up on the stairs a much better kill zone go saul go sir down to the basement go saul followed the other men down leaving him alone in the doorway karl pulled threemanualfuse antipersonnel grenades from his belt and set fuse times a minute apart he tossedthe first out into the hall dropped the second at the top of the stairwell and turned roundto scramble down the first two flights of stairs where he placed the third grenade he raced down the third flight of stairs to the bottom of the stairwell hold your fire he called out in the dim light as he descendedits me its karl hold your fire his voice echoed off thehard breezeblock walls his men were waiting eighteen of them tucked behind a barricade of boxes and crates hastilybuilt across the open doorway leading to the museums vast storagebasement excellent work he said slapping the shoulder of the nearest man as heclambered over to join them theres a threeminute spread of grenades up therewhich should slow them down he looked around at his men how many did we lose another two said saul dexter and schwartz his face tightened not good karl what about them asked one of his men nodding at the museumssecurity guards huddled together a few yards away beside another stack of crates andboxes do we kill them he asked karl bit his lip in thought for a moment they were no threat old men frightened menhed let them go up the stairs but the chances were theyd be gunned down themoment they stepped out into the main hall all right joseph tell them they should go find a quiet corner and hide wait untilthe gunfight is over ok oh and tell them to make sure they call out to the police first before they show themselves theyll be triggertwitchy joseph grinned and nodded he obviously shared the same opinion of the dunderheadsupstairs amateurs big boots big guns and no brains the first charge went off in the hall with a dull thump karl put a hand to his earpiece and nodded he turned to his men ross pieterstefan joseph head down there he said gesturing towards a narrow passageway betweentwo tall storage racks on their left kramer is down there he has the machine runningnow and is sending us back one at a time you four are first the men nodded and headed into the passage the second charge went off at the top of the stairs louder rubble anddebris rattled down the steps this is it karl he told himself thelast holding position chapter new york kramer sent the man through and reset the coordinates for the next as the rattleof gunfire echoed down the passageway from the distant stairwell he had lost count of howmany of them hed put through perhaps a dozen maybe fourteen karl had radioed through a few minutes ago they were down to the last five men holdingposition at the bottom of the stairs another man had gone down saul woundedbadly things were getting tight by the sound of it he tapped his throat mic karl you need to come now haass voice crackled back over the radio someones got to hold themhere sir if we all turn and run theyll be on to us inseconds kramer cursed karl was right someone was going to have to be left behind to buy enough timefor the last two or three to be sent through and for kramer to sabotage the machine so theycouldnt be followed already theyd lost five good men to have to leave one ortwo behind to hold them off wasnt what he wanted to hear dammit he hissed if hed managed to find the machine sooner assemble it just a little morequickly or if the police had taken a few more minutes to get organized before stormingthe museum they could have all been through into the past without any bloodshed without a single casualty ill hold them wheezed saul karl looked down at him the front of his grey and white arcticcamouflage tunic was almostentirely black with his own blood several unaimed shots sprayed over the top of thestairs handrail had found him thudded into his chest and knocked him off his feet theyoung lad was spraying thick gouts of blood with each laboured breath a lung or both hadbeen hit karl didnt need a medic to tell him that the rest of this young mans life wasnow going to be measured in mere minutes perhaps even seconds saul i you have to go sir the young man forced a ragged smile you have togo change this world for a better one kramers one karl nodded well do it saul you better he gasped a thick curl of congealed blood leaking from the side ofhis mouth go now he whispered ill give you aslong as i can karl nodded saul was fading fast he looked at the remaining men and gestured with a wellpractised hand the signal for them tobreak cover and pull back to join kramer as they did so karl emptied a complete clip on tothe stairs sparks and sprayed chips of concrete danced amid plumes of dust the armed policegetting ready to storm the last flight of stairs backed off ducking their heads from theheavy fire the clip empty he looked down at saul quickly and squeezed his shoulder perhapswell see each other in another time saul grinned then began firing at the stairwell with short economic burststhat would conserve his ammo and hopefully buy his comrades the precious time they needed karl turned and ran after his men hearing their pounding footsteps ahead of him kramer reset the machine once more the last of the men with him had gone throughand now he was waiting for haas and whoever else was with him he could hear footsteps and in the distance short staccato bursts of gunfire hurry he called out out of the darkness two men emerged ronan and sigi quick he said ushering the first of them into the wire cagewheres karl coming just behind us sir all right good he activated the machine sparks showered and the darkness flickered alive with strobinglight as ronan vanished sigi stepped in just as karls pounding footsteps could beheard kramer quickly reset and activated the machine the gunfire down the aisle suddenly ceased damn theyre in karl appeared theyre through he called out i know i know hurry up and get in he said holding open the door of the wirecage karl drew up and looked at him who will send youthrough dont worry ill manage karl he hesitated no one gets left behind your words remember kramer offered him a smile no one left behind i promise ill be right behindyou my friend kramer closed the door on him ill see you there karl he replied with a salute yes sir ill have the men ready tomove out kramer nodded good see you in a minute he activated the machine once more the dark area of the storage basement lit up throwing the wooden fascias ofstacked crates into stark relief for a fleeting moment as the sparks showered to the floor it occurred to him that thecontents of some of the crates and boxes down here in this dusty basement were about to bechanged history recent history the last hundred years to be precise was soon goingto be drastically rewritten no bad thing history as it stood had led mankind here to this dark poisoned overcrowdedexhausted world no bad thing at all over the noise of the portable generator he heard the thud of combat boots on hard concreteechoing down the passageway swiftly and voices calling out the police were coming and fasthe could see the dancing beams of their torches swinging from side to side in thedistance he kneeled down beside the palmtop and set the coordinates one last time taking a deepbreath he set a fivesecond delay on the command then hit the purge icon quickly he stepped inside the cage pulled a grenade from his pack pulled the pin and placedit on the floor outside the cage he shut the door and closed his eyes hoping that themachine would have finished sending him into the past before the grenade detonated come on he cracked open his eyes and winced at the sudden blinding shower of sparks cascading aroundhim through the wire of the cage he thought he saw the approaching shapes of several armed police swiftly dropping to one knee and raising their guns to fire athim come on come on come on it would be the cruellest turn of fate for one of their bullets to find him a microsecondbefore he left this world for good kramer clamped his eyes shut expecting any second torecoil from the impact of several lethal highspread largecalibre rounds or to be blown topieces by the grenade on the floor just outside the cage then he felt it a sensation like falling as if the floor of the cage beneath his feethad been suddenly whipped away like the trapdoor of a hangmans scaffold chapter new york umm that things a complete monghead said salstudying the figure from the perspex tube pityingly maddy regarded the creature with something approaching motherly sympathy are you sureits meant to be like that dont worry said foster the onboard computer is preloaded witha basic program of artificial intelligence its adaptive learning code itll pickthings up quickly enough youll see the most important thing right now is that itimprints you people on its mind particularly youliam he frowned what do you mean by imprints think of it as being a bit like a chick hatching from an egg and deciding the firstthing it sees is its mother to ensure the learning code embeds more efficiently let it bondwith you first liam go on go say hello liam looked uncertainly at foster go on its perfectly safe he turned to look at the large musclebound form on the ground and imagined this thing couldquite easily rip his arms out of their sockets and beat him over the head with them if itdecided that might be a fun thing to do warily liam took several steps forward grimacing as his shoes slipped on the drying smellygunk on the floor he kneeled down beside the giant and studied it more closely glaf bug drah it gurgled in a deep voice thatseemed to rumble up from its chest the creature was entirely bald not a single hair on itsmuscular body its skin pale almost milkwhite liam offered the pitiful creature a friendlysmile hello there ehoh it mimicked my name is liam he said pointing at himself meliam leeehammm it repeated as it climbed to its feet and stretched out both bighands curiously towards liams face he swallowed nervously as the things largehands cupped his face this things going to crush my head like a ripe melon with hands still wet from the sticky fluid it curiously stroked liams cheekleeaaamm liam he corrected liiaam and you are liam turned to foster does it have aname foster shrugged you can decide on the name you want to give it try not to think ofsomething too stupid though the names got to last sal suddenly giggled at the sight of the things genitalia maddy turned to the old man foster maybe the first thing we should do is give itsomething to wear i mean sals only thirteen and im well i justdont want to be looking at that right now no im sorry patrick is acompletely dumb name for him said maddy she sipped her coffee as she studied thelarge muscular form across the floor while foster finished putting some clothes on himthere was a stupid kids toon called spongebobsquarepants that had a dumb starfish character called patrick liam shrugged his shoulders i had a big bruiser of a cousin called patrick the nameseemed to fit maddy smiled ive got the perfect name for him they looked at her expectantly and her grin widened arnold you know after the terminator guy liam looked confused arnie arnold schwarzenegger she continued sal looked surprised do you mean schwarzenegger the fortyfifth president of theunited states maddy gawped at her youve got to be kidding president of course i remember now sal continued we studied him in americanhistory they amended their constitution to allow him to be a presidential candidate born ineurope somewhere wasnt he maddy nodded he started out life playing some kind of robot in a scifi movie once didnthe what was the movie called duh maddy rolled her eyes theterminator oh yeah said sal that was it i love those terminator movies they were so coolmaddy ran her eyes over his hulking form and nodded approvingly at her suggestionarnie was the perfect name liam was about to ask what they were both talking about terminators toons sighfies spongebobs the girls might as well have beentalking in mongolian as far as he was concerned there was this funny bit in terminator maddycontinued when the hero this kid called john connor introduces the terminator robotto this other guy as his uncle bob uncle bob cut in liam bob thats a good name nice andsimple sal nodded thoughtfully yes he looks like a bob maddy stared at them you dont want to call him arnie they shook their heads sounds like a daft name so it does said liam maddys shoulders sagged all right then bob it is nice and simple at least it should be easy enough for dumbnuts overthere to say liam looked across at foster and the large clone the clone was dressed now in a crumpledblue boiler suit and foster led him across by the hand like a child to join the otherssitting around the table here we are foster sat him down beside liam the armchairs tiredsprings creaked under his immense weight the basic speech software should have fullyinstalled by now give it a go and talk to him liam looked up at the large hulking clone sitting beside him uh hello again the thing nodded and replied slowly in a deep voice that rumbled through the archway almostas loudly as one of the trains that routinely rattled over the bridge above themhello liam foster leaned forward and spoke slowly his full name is liam oconnor let meintroduce these other two this is madelaine carter and this is saleena vikram but sheprefers the name sal hello madelaine hello sal and you said liam pointing a finger towards him we are going to callyou bob his emotionless face considered that in silence for a moment then finally with a sincerenod he announced solemnly to them all i am bob foster smiled encouragingly excellent the names registered in his memorythats all the introductions done so what happens next mr foster you all get a good nights rest its been a long day for all of youtomorrow were going to be very busy doing what asked sal training of course chapter new york monday i think i found this exercise book in the archway the front pages are all pulled out soi guess someone from the previous team was using it before me im going to use it asa diary maybe thats what they were using it for too who knows so its weird like a dream like a strange movie no school to go to no busystreets thick with rickshaws and mumbai smog no having to wear an antichoke airmask when istep out no mum and dad jahulla its so weird the other two seem to be coping with this freakiness better maddy and liam i think i likethem both maddy is eighteen shes really ubersmarts with technical things shetold me that she was a computer programmer back in she worked on computer games for ajob for a hobby she says she liked hacking things its kind ofstrange though shes sort of from the same time as my parents she even likessome of the same oldfashioned music as them and yet shes just a few years olderthan me thats just so weird and liam how totalweird sixteen years old or a hundred and five years old whenyou realize he was born in that makes him a really really old manbut hes still cute i like that hes from an oldyfashioned time when peopledressed all smart in clothes with lots of buttons and said how do you do i feel so odd i miss my parents i miss our high apartment i miss the tops of skyscraperspoking out of the street smog i even miss watching the elektrabollywood show with mumeven though the song and dance routines are totally jahully embarrassing but im sort of excited too im here in new york in the times before thingsturned bad before the global warmup the overcrowded cities the food rationing theterror bombs in the north the oil shortages and all that nasty stuff and its like so strange to think that in india right now my dad is about the sameage as me a fourteenyearold boy living in mumbai and mums twelve and lives up indelhi and they wont even meet each other for another ten years i miss them though sometimes when the others arent around i cry but idont let them see that so far ive kept cool foster is taking me out of the field office this morning to begin my training as theteams observer i really dont understand yet what anobserver does but im sure i will do very soon ok sal said foster this is monday morning monday thetenth of september the day before disaster strikes he looked around at times squarethe very centre of new york the bustling heart of the city it was just after am andth avenue was teeming with life think of today as normal new york this is how it should look you understand sal nodded youre the teams observer sal the observer is like the nose of a dog there to detect the very first scent of a reality shift in the timeline because someone went and changed something in the past thats right she gestured around at times square busy and noisy with earlymorning traffic buthow am i going to know when something is different here he nodded then thoughtfully stroked his chin perhaps i should explain why you inparticular were recruited whats so special about you that might help to explainthings she shrugged perhaps it might there was nothing she considered particularly special about herself she preferred black clothes instead of thebright neon polysilks all the other bollyboppers liked to wear she preferred darkhead rockmusic instead of boomtastic street hop she preferred her own company and a good puzzleebookrather than hanging around some grimy street corner with a load of stupid dittoheads chokingbehind their masks on street poison our archived records of zeroed in on you as an ideal candidate for recruitmentfor two reasons sal firstly we knew exactly when and where youwere going to die which made it possible to locate and extract you sal nodded silently she understood that now but secondly you were a mumbai regional unders champion for pikodu pikodu was a picturebased puzzle game it involved spotting repeated patterns in largecleverly designed grids of random images sal nodded she was a champion sort of until she got bored of it it was a fad acraze that came in from japan for a few years it seemed everyone was intoplaying pikodu training on their nintendo flexiboy on the trainin the bath on the toilet the point is sal it means we knew youd make a perfect observer your abilityto spot tiny details quickly to notice things that others would easily miss to seepatterns in chaos that makes you the perfect candidate his hand swept out across the busy square youll witness this morning scene over and over itll always be the sameand youll become familiar with it youll learn that fosterglanced at his watch then pointed across the square at a young mother whod stoppedpushing her buggy to pick up a soft toy tossed out by her child at exactly tenfourteen am the woman wearing red jeans over there will have to stop on a pedestriancrossing to retrieve a teddy bear for her baby foster looked around that those two old men wearing smart suits will stop outside the mcdonalds andlight up cigarettes sal made a face ewww is that legal to smoke she nodded staring with wideeyed amazement at both men as they casually sucked in then blewout clouds of blue smoke foster laughed gently yes sal it is still he pointed to a giant billboardhigh up the front of a building youll know that on this particular day themovie shrek is showing he pointed to another billboardthat the movie the planet of the apes is openingsoon and another that tommy hilfiger shirts are the height offashion sal curled her lips in disgust and realized that they really loved their naff clothes back in he turned back to look down at her your eyes will register all these tiny detailsyour mind will remember them he said quietly his eyes lockedintently on hers and then one day soon youll know instantly whensomethings different a shift his face creased with an approving smile thats right sal a shift thevery first sign that something has been changed in the past she looked around and realized that in a way it was a bit like a very large game ofpikodu youll see this before either of the others will because wellthats your special talent sal because i once was a finalist in a jahully old puzzle competition yes he laughed because you once were a finalist in a jahully old competition and because every monday you will come out ofthe archway and take a walk across the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to manhattan in thisglorious sunshine and youll get to know this day like no other person in theworld did the team before us have an observer foster hesitated a moment before answering yes they did every team does tell me about him or was it a her the smile slowly faded from his face she she didnt really have muchtime to learn her job before he sighed before we accidentallytrapped that seeker she looked at him sombrely will there be other seekers he shook his head no because well always be more careful in futureits not a mistake i plan to repeat where did it come from he hesitated a moment before answering another dimension he turned to herits the dimension you travel through when you ridetime that sounds well it doesnt sound safe its chaosspace were merely travelling throughit instantaneously you wouldnt really want to hangaround there she sensed there was a lot more he could tell her about it but for nowhe seemed keen to change the subject come on his face brightened lets see some more of the city didyou visit central park when your dad took you to new york she thought about that for a moment she remembered a large open area in the middle ofmanhattan in which rusting vehicles were stacked one on top of the other a giant automobilejunkyard is it the place where all the old cars were dumped when the oil ran out foster nodded sadly yes but back in now its still abeautiful park with grass and trees and a lovely lake would you like to go seeit she smiled and nodded id like that chapter new york youre kidding me right my job is an an analyst foster nodded she looked at him her eyebrows arched with disbelief youre telling meive been plucked from a falling aeroplane and sent back in time to join a teamof of time cops and my job ends up being exactly what iused to do foster shrugged its not exactly thesame she looked at the row of computer monitors on the bench in front of hergreat this computer is a cellbased tetragig mainframe carefully transported back from thefuture and painstakingly assembled by our first team which means maddy right now in newyork youre looking at the most powerful computer system in the whole world andguess what he grinned its all yours to playwith maddy reached one hand out and stroked the slim casing of the computer on the benchmine huh yours ok i guess that isnt so bad then we know from our files foster continued that you worked for acomputergames company you worked as a programmer on a hugely successful online roleplayinggame called second world maddy clucked modestly i guess it was quite popular you were listed in the credits as the database debugger among other things she replied irritably i also wrote the code for abunch of decent ai combat stuff and coded some of the coolest parts of the user interface butdid i get credited pffft did i heck foster nodded but its the database work the debugging that makes you soincredibly valuable because because maddy its detective work isnt it finding that tiny piece ofcomputer code thats causing a computer game to crash or behave in an unpredictableway i suppose foster nodded towards sal youll be working closely with sal maddy turned to see her sitting on the far side of the arch at the wooden table with liam andbob they both seemed to be teaching the lumbering oaf how to hold a knife and fork as the observer shell be the first line of defence foster had explained sals role as observer it seemed a tall order to her that a younggirls eyes would be better than a computer at identifying a shift when she observes something that has altered itll be your lateral thinkingyour programmers mind combined with the power of this system linked into the web andcountless historical databases around the world to zero in on where and when history has actually beenchanged maddy shook her head how am i freakin well going to figure out stuff likethat i was crud at history in high school im not sure im the right person to youll do just fine he cut in you dont need to know a lotof history you just need a logical mind and a little common sense i havefaith in you maddy youll be this teams leader the teams strategist leader youre the leader arentyou fosters voice lowered ever so slightly as if he was sharing with her something hedidnt want the others to know im not going to be here forevereventually the three of you and bob will be operating on your own what where are you going i thats not important the point is im here to get you ready as ateam to be able to function on your own he looked at her and your team willbe looking to you for leadership she glanced across at the others both giggling as bobs large hands fumbled awkwardlywith the knife and fork me a leader up until now shed considered herself more of a loner happy to work in isolation withlines of code as her only company having those two and that big ape rely onher was bad enough but having the history of mankind in herhands as well she shook her head youve got the wrong person foster she repliedi cant do this the old man reached for the keyboard and mouse on the bench ignoring her let me showyou just how powerful this computer system is did you know its linked into every database in the world from this keyboard you can if you wantto hack into any other connected computer through any firewallor encrypted security system uh yeah right you want to see whats in the president of americas email inbox rightnow maddys jaw dropped you can foster chuckled shall we go and take a look at the words of wisdom george bush hasbeen tapping out this morning hmm chapter bavarian woods germany falling falling falling dr paul kramer opened his eyes and immediately winced in the brightness he screwed his eyesshut its ok a voice spoke softly kramer tried again easing them open carefully the first thing he registered was snow adeep blanket of it mostly smooth with one or two tracks of footprints and grooves whereheavy things had been dragged squatting beside him was a familiar face karl just take a moment sir theres a minute of disorientation dizzinessitll pass kramer took a deep breath and puffed out a thick cloud in front of himself there were toomany questions he needed answered for him to wait tell me we have arrived at the righttime it appears to be snow for april would seem right the right location karl nodded the woods outside obersalzberg the equipment is right here it was a little scattered but the men have located everything thatcame through and hidden it in the woods the men all came through karls hesitation was enough kramer looked up at him hooding hiseyes against the last faint glow of the dusk sky karl tomas and ethan didnt make it kramer struggled up on to his legs and looked around at the men all were kitted out in theirarcticcamouflage jackets backpacks and webbing strapped on each held ready astateoftheart m pulse rifle on their heads they wore kevlar helmets complete withfolddown nightscope and heatsensor eyehuds an impressive sight that stirred in him a warmsense of pride but so few of them he counted just seventeen what happened to tomas and ethan karl was reluctant to reply karl please his secondincommand nodded reluctantly i will show you he stepped through his men across kneedeep snow that crunched beneath each step kramerfollowed him pulling out his arctic jacket putting it on and zipping it up karl led him into a thick copse of pine trees branches drooping heavily laden withsnow it appears something malfunctioned during their trip said karl as they pushedthrough some branches dislodging a small cascade of powder snow mercifully neitherof them lived for very long he continued stepping to one side to reveal their bodiesthey lasted no more than a couple of minutes he added sombrely kramer stared at the twisted tangle of limbs and organs it was unrecognizable ashuman or more to the point two humans instead it looked like some grotesquecreature an insane god might construct from the parts left over from creation a pathetically corrupted thing with too many arms and legs and internal organsemerging into the open through distorted and bubbled skin that looked like melted plastic onehead melded to the end of what looked like an impossibly long arm kramer recognized asethan he spotted the face of tomas emerging from a mass of flesh that could only be describedas this things pelvis my god was all he could whisper they were still alive when you foundthem karl nodded grim faced kramer felt his stomach loosen but he refused to vomit or retch in front of karl the manneeded to see a confident and strong leader not someone who doubled over at the firstunpleasant sight we knew this might happen said kramer that waldsteins prototypemight be prone to error put a brave face on it paul kramer he commanded himself we were lucky to lose only two men karl only two yes sir well therell be no more time travelling now were done with thatwere where we want to be karl nodded and managed a weak smile germany fifteenth of april kramer nodded at the crest of a nearbyhill now bathed in the cool silver glow of moonlight destiny is waiting for us upthere karl karl grinned eagerly we will succeed wont we kramer nodded yes we will chapter new york maddy looked at foster incredulously were going to do what i said this morning were going to deliberatelychange history liam sal and maddy stared at him in silence over their bowls of rice krispies bob sittingbetween sal and liam observed them and foster thoughtfully liam said foster todays going to be your first trip back intothe past you and bob are both going together bobs thick lips managed a clumsy illpractised smile that looked more like a camelchewing is good his deep voice rumbled and you asked liam yes im coming along too where are we going the old man raised a finger ahah now thats a secret the point of thisexercise will be to test maddy and sals ability to find out exactly where wevegone and what we might have changed but said liam looking confused but i thought were not allowed to change history you know at all bob nodded slowly changing history is bad its what we call a testbed location foster replied we use thislittle piece of history to test out new teams all the time dont worry well bechanging something for a short period of time only then putting things backexactly as they were how long will you be gone asked sal will it be dangerous foster smiled not at all and well actually be in the past for a very shorttime ive set the computer up to automatically open the return window so all you twohave to do is watch history and work out where weve gone liam looked across the archway towards the large perspex cylinder full of water andwere going to be climbing into that oh yes im afraid so foster leaned forward and placed a hand on liams shoulder dont worrywell warm it up a bit im not that keen on jumping into a test tube of freezingwater either liam removed the last items of his clothing leaving him wearing a pair of grubbyunderpants he realized hed been wearing for far too long you better not be peeking he heard maddy laugh from the other side of the archway where she was sitting at thebreakfast table whats to see stop being an idiot liam and get in snapped foster liam quickly scampered up a rung ladder swung his legs over the side of the tube and intothe water he lowered himself down and found himself facing bob and foster both treadingwater well now this is fun he said sarcastically holding on to the side of thecylinder nervously why is this fun liam oconnor asked bob earnestly liam shrugged its not every day i climb into a large fish bowl with be quiet and listen foster interrupted i set the computer to send us back in time automatically we wont need maddy to set anycoordinates this time but normally she would be in charge of coordinating this wholeprocess liam nodded glancing at her faint foggy form through the scuffed milky plastic of thecylinder he wasnt sure how confident he was going to feel being zapped through historythe first time she had her fingers on the buttons for this exercise neither of the girls know where were being sent wellbe there for no more than an hour then the computer will automatically bring us back i havedownloaded the relevant history data into the support units hard drive into bobs brain yes into bobs brain liam looked at the muscular giant treading water beside him howd you get theinformation in wireless its transmitted foster turned to look at the muscular giantwhat time are we heading back to bob twentysecond of november and where dallas texas america good how much time left before the displacement field activates bob fiftyeight seconds until launch all right then said foster any questions mr foster why exactly are we in our underwear and floating in a pool ofwater contamination protocol we take as little as we can back with us thats whythe water is a neutral buoyancy solution so that when the portal activates were touching absolutely nothing were floating the water and usalone will go back in time nothing else i see twenty seconds until launch said bob when we count down from five liam i want you to take a deep breath and submergeyourself completely said foster liam swallowed nervously the thought of letting go of the edge of the tube and allowinghimself to sink beneath the surface sent his heart thundering uhh mr foster i suppose nows not a good time to mention i never actuallylearned to swim i uh i never i know foster sighed relax youll get used to it liam looked unhappily at the water but i ill sink if i let go sinklike a bloody stone so i will i dont worry you just need to hold your breath for ten twenty seconds anditll all be over my head my head actually actually beneath thewater yes head beneath the water what if what if im not actually completelyunder would that sort of do mr foster if i could just keep my face no you need to be entirely within the water every bit of you the field scanner willdetect if part of you is poking out and the launch will abort for safety reasons and and ill be very annoyed and well have to try again oh

the side liam nothing to it information five seconds until launch no seriously mr foster i i really bob said foster pull liam under the clone reached out a big hand and a second later liam found himselfbeneath the surface with a mouthful of water floundering and thrashing in a blind panic sals mobile phone vibrated she pulled it out of her pocket and grimaced at the sight of the oldfashioned handset anugly slab of shiny black plastic with the letters nokia stencilled at the top nothinglike the cool earbud v mobile she used to own back in shefelt embarrassed pulling this museum piece out of her pocket and selfconscious holding it upto her ear until it occurred to her that everyone elses mobile phones in lookedequally embarrassing she thumbed a button hello its maddy they went into the past about a minute ago where are younow sal looked around she was on broadway heading north just passing the intersection withwest st street im approaching times square i think yeah i see it upahead so you uh you see anything weird yet she shrugged not really its just like it looked last time i walked over heresame sunny day same people same traffic hmm replied maddy not really sure what im meant

sitting here like an idiot looking at a bank of monitors you oksal it was a busy monday morning with the morning rush over and the commuters all tucked away intheir highrise offices it was mainly clusters of tourists families and groups of friendstaking in the sights of the big apple sal sighed some company wouldve been nice last time shedstrolled this route a couple of bubbledays ago bob had been sentalong with her to get some more experience at passing as human with his lumbering sevenfootframe beside her every inch racked with bulging muscle shed felt somewhat moreselfassured accompanied by her own pet superhero bodyguard i guess im ok chapter dallas texas liam landed heavily amid a tumbling cascade of water splashing noisily as if abath tub had been emptied from the top of a short ladder he looked up and saw foster on one side and bob on the other both on their hands and kneesin a large puddle that spread out swiftly he looked around he could see vehicles parked on atarmac area they looked less modern more angular than the cars he was used to seeing everyday in new york bob was the first to his feet he held out a hand each to liam and foster i help you he rumbled liam grabbed the hand and pulled himself up we need clothes quickly said foster before we attract any attention toourselves between a pickup truck and a dustylooking car there was a double door with a sign on it book depository trade entrance only in there said foster is a locker room well find some clotheson pegs you sure foster grinned ive done this training trip a few times now what if there are people in there asked liam his hands hoveringselfconsciously to cover his soaking underpants there arent theyre all at the front of the buildingtrying to get a glimpse of the presidents limousine itll be arriving in a fewminutes foster led the way across the parking area and pushed through the double doors inside outof the bright morning sunlight it was dim and smelled fusty from the stacks of schooltextbooks littering the floor in untidy piles to your right said foster they turned into a room lined with employee lockers and pegs on the wall opposite at the endwas a lostproperty box stuffed with odds and sods left over the years between them theyfound enough items of clothing to dress all three of them although the only items thatcame close to fitting bob were a pair of sandals which his large toes drooped over the endof and a set of scruffy navy blue overalls we look like three tramps said liam perfect said foster no onell think twice about us mr foster said liam quietly whats about to happen foster turned to the support unit tell liam bob mentally extracted the relevant file from his recently installed databaseinformation in precisely five minutes thirtytwo seconds the thirtyfifth presidentof the united states of america john f kennedy will suffer a pointfortyone calibreprojectile impact to the throat and a second to the top of the cranium ejectingapproximately twentyfive per cent of his brain tissue the mans killed foster looked at him have a guess and what were going to stop thishappening foster shrugged more like delay it newyork sal looked around times square this was probably the eleventh or twelfth timeshed taken a walk up from brooklyn across the williamsburg bridge along broadway tothe hub of the city teeming with endless life there were so many things to observe in thisplace so much going on she honestly didnt understand how she was supposed toremember every little detail here how she was supposed to know exactly what should happen inthis thoroughfare from moment to moment at this time of day her eyes scanned the major billboards there was a giant display of a jolly green ogre andthe title shrek above his head and another board with some hairyblue monster and a little green balllike creature beside him entitled monsters inc further along she saw a poster for the stage performance of somethingcalled mamma mia then with something that felt like a reassuring stroke of deja vu sal spotted theyoung mother in the red jeans pushing a buggy before her across a pedestrian crossing oh thats right shellhave to stop and pick up a soft toy a moment later she did bending down irritably for it in the middle of the crossing andhanding it back to a pair of chubby hands reaching out desperately from the buggysseat that was a weird sensation she smiled wow she muttered pleased with herself i just predicted thefuture dallastexas up these stairs one more flight to go foster wheezed liam looked across the stairwell through an open office door he could see desks andbookshelves and filing cabinets left deserted crowded around every front window was a crushof office ladies in floral print dresses sporting beehive hairdos eagerly peering out what are we heading up these stairs for foster was too winded to answer bob would you the support unit nodded obediently information on the sixth floor of this buildingis a man called lee harvey oswald he will shoot at the thirtyfifth president of the unitedstates of america in precisely one minute and twentyseven seconds now one minute andtwentysix seconds uh thanks bob said liam the thing managed a cumbersome approximation of a smile you are welcome liamoconnor as they reached the top of the stairs foster slowed down and put a finger to his lips hepointed through an open door into what appeared to be a storage room this is it he whispered through here on the left is a row of windowslooking down on to dealey plaza oswald right now has his gun resting on the sill of thesecond window along in about thirty seconds thirtynine seconds precisely bob cut in bob be quiet bob nodded meekly in about thirty seconds the presidents car will swing round a corner and intoview the car will approach this building and when its virtually beneath him oswaldwill fire the first shot as it passes but this first shot fostercontinued quietly were actually going to prevent follow me foster walked through the door into the storeroom liam and bob following cautiously theystepped between stacks of school textbooks precariously piled on top of each other coated ina fine layer of dust liam glimpsed between teetering piles the hairy tuft of the top of a head framed by a tallwindow he turned to foster and foster nodded thats him they stepped across the floor quietly until they were standing over him excuse me said foster lee harvey oswald spun round his eyes widened at the sight of three tramps calmly watchinghim one huge and muscular one looked very old and the third was little more than a boy his mouth flapped open the muscular man wrenched the rifle from his hands lee harvey oswald said the old man calmly youd better startrunning run as fast as you can he said offering the slightest sympathetic smilei suggest you head home who who are you foster smiled hmm lets see oh i know he said grinningwere the cia anyway youd better get going or my man here willtoss you out of the window head first oswald nodded uncertainly as he got to his feet looking bob up and down he pushed past themand disappeared out of the storage room casting one last frightened and puzzled glance atthem as he descended the first flight of stairs three steps at a time time violation cautioned bob flatly this timeline has now beenaltered liam shook his head but but have we not just done the thingwere never meant to do foster nodded correct as we speak time is already shifting rippling forwardthrough the years the decades are adjusting themselves making room for a new reality thatpresident kennedy survived today the old man looked out of the window and watched the opentop limousine escorted by a stringof motorbike cops sweep sedately up the street towards an overpass and a grassyhill chapter new york sal was beginning to feel a little foolish now standing at the intersection ofbroadway and west th street watching the world go by a sweet old woman had stopped onlymoments ago to ask whether shed lost her mommy and daddy and needed to be taken to apoliceman very embarrassing im thirteen for jahullassake she was about to head for somewhere a little less busy to stand away from the steady flow ofpedestrians when she felt it a passing moment of dizziness disorientation as if theworld was a giant tablecloth and someone somewhere had just given the corner a very gentletug she reached out for a litter bin to steady herself then recovering her balance hereyes registered something very subtly different about times square long before her braindid something was different her eyes flickered around the busy triangular convergence of streets thick withmondaymorning traffic what is it she whispered what is it then her shifting scrutiny rested on something that hadnt been there before anew thing above the entrance to the primetime cinema the billboard that had been announcingthe arrival of planet of the apes had instead been replaced by alarge flickering screen showing some kind of news programme there was textat the bottom cnn mission update day she watched a grainy image of several men in crumpled orange boiler suits holding clipboardsand chatting amicably within the cramped confines of some sort of capsule subtitles tickertaped on to the screen cmdr jerry hammond and crewcelebrate anton puchovs thirtyfifth birthday sal noticed that few if any of the pedestrians on the pavement around her seemedparticularly interested in the broadcast as if it was something commonplace old newsfor them the image of the men manoeuvring awkwardly in the cramped interior changed to a picture of arustcoloured sphere floating against an inkblack backdrop a new tickertape subtitleappeared mission to mars days to mars orbit cnn warmly wishes anton a happy birthday oh my she gasped and pulled the mobile phone out of her pocket the phone buzzed in maddys hand sal did you feel it the dizziness i felt sort of nauseous about a minute ago thought it was my asthma she saidglancing down at her inhaler i think i think that was a that was it maddy sat up what you mean a shift sal hesitated yeah theres something else what on the big screen here what theres a rocket on its way to mars i think maddy nearly splashed some coffee on to the keyboard you serious im watching it right now on cnn maddy looked up at the row of monitors in front of her at first glance none of them appearedto be showing anything out of the ordinary one showed fox news and some dull political storythe second was tuned into msnbc and a weatherman promising a warm sunny day tomorrow the nextwas tapped into the stock exchange another showed bbc news and was running a story aboutthe spice girls forthcoming world tour and the tickets selling out within anhour oh my god she wheezed suddenly short of breath didnt they split up in the nineties but here they were promoting their seventh album youre right somethings changed sal she felt the burden of responsibility beginning to settle on her shoulders rememberingfosters quiet pep talk that it was down to her to pull the strings together to makesense of the data to locate the source of the change maddy thatsyour job to find where the shift is coming from she looked at the wall of screens in front of her and wondered where exactly she was supposedto make a start thanks sal ill call you back she said quickly and snapped her phoneshut she tapped the keyboard and pulled up the cnn news feed and there it was a grainyimage of the crew inside some cramped vehicle broadcast from god knows how many hundreds ofthousands of miles away and a computer graphic showing how far theyd gone and howmuch further theyd yet to go a mission to mars thats got to be the biggest changehere bigger than a freaking spice girls tour she muttered she did a google search on the mars mission quickly reading the results before her not forthe first time in recent days her jaw slackened and dropped open there was an enormous space programme inoperation cooperatively funded by the chinese the russians and america a small scientificoutpost existed on the moon a cartwheel space station hung in geostationaryorbit of earth a number of supply shuttles had already been landed on mars ahead of the menen route there the world this world seemedobsessed with space exploration driven to reach out toneighbouring planets she dug deeper into the history of the programme archived newspaper articles from described a conference of nations discussing thefunding of a permanent lunar outpost to build an orbiting missionplatform for future projects further afield she found even older newspaper articles dating from the s a meeting of minds betweenthe russian premier brezhnev and nasas goodwill ambassador john f kennedy kennedy she looked at the name again not that kennedy the one whogot shot the president her history wasnt great but shed seen enough movies and read enough books tobe certain the guy died back in the sixties sometime she saw kennedys name suddenly flash up on the cnn tickertape feed a moment later anold man appeared on the screen a very old man frail and snowyhaired no way she whispered thats not him is it expresident and goodwill ambassador john kennedy extends hiscongratulations and best wishes to the mars crew maddy stared at the old man on the screen hang on you should be dead shesaid you shouldve died ages ago but when she was almost certain it had happened sometime in the sixties she vaguelyrecalled old news footage of an opentopped car his wife wearing a pink dress in the backseat and kennedy in a suit sitting beside her both of them waving to crowds gathered at theroadside where was that when was that she remembered seeing old news footage from a shaky handheld cinecamera the presidents head snaps forward suddenly then backtheres a puff of blood the man slumps the woman his wife panics shesscreaming whats left of kennedys head is cradled in her lap the woman looksaround desperately for help men in dark suits clamber aboard the car it speeds up thecrowd on the roadside look confused some are ducking to the ground some are screaming likethe lady in pink some seem to be crying the name of the place where this happened came to her out of the blue dallas texas she uttered she typed a search phrase into google kennedy dallas assassination the search returned only one link that featured all three words it was from a newspaperarticle dated november it was an article about a suspected aborted attempt onthe presidents life she clicked the link and a newspaper article appeared onscreen a calibre rifle found abandoned on the sixth floor of the school bookdepository overlooking dealey plaza the man suspected of owning the gun a mr lee oswaldwas later arrested at his home he claimed to have made plans to kill the president duringhis visit to dallas but said he changed his mind at the very last moment the story isfurther complicated by sightings of three strangers in the same building at the time the presidents motorcade was passing who staff described asbeing dressed like vagrants and were certain had no reason to be inthere maddy slapped the bench and yelped yes she knew exactly where and when foster and the others had gone back to found you she screamed triumphantly dallas texas the three of them watched the presidents car slowly roll past them and uptowards the overpass in the distance information time contamination is increasing announced bob in a calmemotionless voice mission priority correct time violation liam looked at bob um how are we going to do that recommendation kill john f kennedy what gasped liam weve got to killthe man now foster shook his head not this time liam relax bobs deep voice chimed again with an increasingly insistent tonerecommendation kill john f kennedy immediately the old man watched the car drift slowly away from them therell be timesliam he said wistfully that youll wish time could be changed thatthings down river in the future could be made better thantheyve turned out but liam replied puzzled we just didchange things didnt we foster nodded yes but on this occasion history corrects itself after about thirtyseconds it does liam cocked his head how they heard the distant crack of a rifle one shot followed quickly by another liam leaned forward poking his head out of the window he craned his neck to look down theroad as the vehicle swung left and headed beneath the underpass he saw a fading plume ofsmoke coming from a wooden picket fence at the top of a grassy slope the presidentslimousine swerved he saw the lady in the back seat the lady in pink scrambling over theseat to cradle her husbands head in this training scenario weve let history veer off track for less than aminute foster sighed sadly but on this occasion history does quitesuccessfully manage to correct itself he turned to liam many people believedit was oswald on his own who killed kennedy but there were othermen hired contract killers ready to fire in case he missed or chickened out at the lastmoment information time violation has been corrected bob announced formallymission priority return without causing further contamination liam watched the chaotic scene down below the panic among the gathered crowd thepresidents bodyguards clustering around the car was he a good man a good president foster shrugged if hed been given more time from what ive read inhistory books perhaps he might have been a greatpresident liam nodded pity yes information extraction window approaching said bob closing his eyes andretrieving data from his embedded computer in exactly fiftynine seconds were going to leave now said foster soon every building alongthis road will be crawling with police and federal agents bob hesaid turning to the support unit place the gun on the floor he did so the old man led them away from the window of the sixth floor so how do we get back mr foster asked liam any second now nine seconds to be precise offered bob liam looked about but couldnt see any large cylinders of water for them to climbinto then all of a sudden he felt a puff of displaced air on his face a yard ahead of himhe could just about make out a shimmering circular outline automated return window is now activated said bob say goodbye to liam liam looked around at the storage room the dusty stacks of school books and heard thetearful commotion of womens voices coming from the floor below goodbye he uttered obediently and then followed the other two into theshimmering air holding his nose and his breath as he stepped forward new york liam felt that horrendous familiar falling sensation worse still he anticipatedfinding himself floundering around submerged underwater but instead he found himself standing in the middle of their field office his feet on hardcold concrete uh i thought we he blurted foster slapped his back gently we go out wet we come back dry ill explainwhy some other time liam spotted the girls sitting at the breakfast table both holding red andwhite cans of a fizzy sugary drink called dr pepper that they seemed to like drinking copiousamounts of spontaneously they clinked their cans together and cheered the return of theboys we know exactly where you went fellas shouted maddy being the pair ofcomplete freakin geniuses we are foster spread his hands and she grinned triumphantly so how was dallas well done he smiled im guessing you interfered in some way with the assassination of john fkennedy you saved him maybe but then you must have put it all right again her facedropped a little unfortunately id have liked us to have a mission to mars onthe go sal cocked her head curiously you managed to stop an assassination attempt and thenmade it happen again and also found some really disgusting clothes to wear andyou did all that in just under an hour foster opened his mouth to answer an hour cut in liam weve not been gone that long have we tenminutes at the most maybe foster chuckled time travel isnt symmetricalliam i could send you to one time location and arrange a return window for fifty years lateras far as youd be concerned fifty years would have passed a whole lifetime andyet to someone standing here youd have disappeared as a young lad and returned againjust moments later as an old man liam shook his head and grinned jayzus this timeriding thing is making my headhurt so it is chapter bavarian woods germany kramer watched karl with admiration the man was a professional soldier had servedwith some of the worlds elite special forces and thereafter been a highly recommendedand highly paid mercenary in the troubled world of there was plenty of work for menlike him karl had been one of the first to be won over by kramers dream of a better worldhed spoken on kramers behalf to other mercenaries he knew and trusted men heknew who also longed for a better place a better time the world theyd left behind was a place that was dying choked by pollution strangledby dwindling resources a world horrendously overpopulated and ultimately doomed who wouldnt want to leave that behind it had been easy for karl to recruit two dozen men he could trust for this mission everysingle man hed approached had been ready to jump at the chance of leaving thetwentyfirst century for a chance to rewrite the twentieth century and good men they wereall of them very experienced very disciplined they all spoke at least two languagesenglish being their shared language most of these men quietly stepping through the snowywoods with wellpractised stealth were german some were dutch a few were norwegian a coupleof them british but only seventeen of them now kramer shook his head we lost seven men just getting here suddenly up ahead karl silently raised his hand and made a fist the men understood thesignal and squatted down amid the snowcovered foliage in their mottled white and greyarcticcamouflage tunics and waiting perfectly still they were almost undetectable in thedark karl turned round and beckoned kramer forward he crunched lightly across the snow andsquatted down beside him karl pointed through the trees ahead is that it sir kramer craned his neck to get a better look up a winding track he could make out a couple ofsandbagged machinegun posts either side of a gravel track and a sentry hut bathed in thelight of twin floodlights this is it karl he smiled this is it hitlers winterretreat der kehlsteinhaus the eagles nest it does notappear that heavily guarded its up this one road perched on the side of a steep hill said kramerthe building itself is defended by several dozen of hitlers personal bodyguardsthe leibstandartess a little further up the hillside only a few hundred yardsaway is an ss garrison housing four or five hundred of them he turned to karlthey will happily die to defend their leader your men will have to be very fast karlthe moment the first shot is fired the alarm will be raised and the garrisonalerted karl looked back at his men perfectly still in the snow weapons ready and waiting for anorder they were expertly trained and well equipped with modern weapons and nightscopes he smiled my men will get to him dont worry kramer wished he shared the mans confidence just seventeen of them if karls men were unable tocomplete their objective before the regimentstrength ss garrison descended upon thefuhrers retreat then it would be all over seventeen against five hundred even with the advantage of combat technology from he wondered for a moment if he wasasking too much of these men chapter new york why have you brought us here asked maddy looking around theentrance hall of the museum of natural history it was crowded mostly it seemed to her withjapanese tourists because madelaine this building these exhibits are what were allabout he gestured with his hand at the giant skeletal frame of a brachiosaurus loomingover them and all but filling the grand entrance hall this is the history that was meant to be this is thehistory that you just like the other field teams are tasked withdefending his eyes drifted down from the giant skull above to rest on them madelaine the analyst sal the observer liam theoperative and bob the support unit youre a team now and everybodyalive today and alive tomorrow is depending on you to keep an eyeon the time this museum records how history is and itcannot be allowed to change fosters voice carried a little further across the grand hall than perhaps hedintended but since no one else here seemed to speak english maddy thought it probablydidnt matter too much so this afternoon i want you to explore the museum to reach out and really feel the history youre defending ill leave you to makeyour own way around and then well meet back here in the entrance hall at fivesharp they nodded in silence then im taking you guys out to the best ribs and burger place i know acelebration think of it as a sort of graduation party liam found the display of dinosaurs breathtaking and was unable to tear himselfaway from the giant skeletons and the animatronic dioramas he was soon left alone as thegirls and bob wandered off to view the other exhibits before he knew it several hours had passed and he decided to make his way back to theentrance hall to await the others he watched the busy area full of snapping cameras and quietly whispered familyconversations overexcited children and mewling babies not for the first time he felt a warmglow of gratitude to foster for plucking him from the bowels of the stricken titanic saving him from the worst possible death he couldimagine in the last dozen or so days hed lost track of how long theyd been here he realized he was the luckiest person born in the nineteenthcentury for the things hed been privileged to see almost a hundred years intohis future and all the amazing things he was yet to see hegrinned like a fool like a child promised every christmas present he could wish for his gaze drifted across to a milling crowd beside the large entrance doors people seemed tobe hesitating there on their way out curious he crossed the hall on a podium a large leatherbound book lay open beneath the glow of a brass reading lampbeside it an old security guard with a ruddy face topped with thick bushy eyebrows and an oddheartshaped mole poking out from one of them stood to attention guest book growled the guard noticing liams curious gaze feel free to sign and add a comment if you wish sir he addedreluctantly and keep it clean liam looked down and noticed the scrawled messages of hundreds of visitors so many differentnames so many languages keep it clean the guard cleared his throat i know what you damn teenagers are like liam felt a tap on his shoulder and turned round it was maddy guest book said liam oh yeah i know i came here on a school trip once and left a dirty poemshe giggled the guard scowled disapprovingly his bushy old eyebrows knotted together as if he actuallyrecalled the very words shed written you still archive them maddy asked the guard we do he replied stiffly we keep every guest book down in thebasement weve done that since before the beginning of the last century a hundredyears of comments he said proudly not all of them dirtypoems neither maddy cringed guiltily sorry but the guard was already busy directing a visitor to where the toilets were go on liam why dont you sign it he looked at her uh will i not change history or something i cant see how you would he gingerly picked up the pen attached by a chain to the podium liam oconnor september i loved the dinosaurs alot that it asked maddy he shrugged dont want to push me luck now she shook her head and snorted ah there are theothers liam followed her across the hall casting one last glance back at the book there i left me mark on history if he died tomorrow for whatever reason at least thered be a scribbled line on a pageof a book somewhere that showed hed once existed well done said foster clinking his glass tankard of beer againstliams and maddys and sals glasses of dr pepper bob observed the ritual with a curious expression on his face picking up an empty glass andtapping it against another you all did very well added foster before slurping a large frothy mouthful oficecold beer he wiped his lips and cautiously glancing around at the busy restaurant helowered his voice youve all seen how it works now you all understand the partyou have to play in the team maddy and sal nodded liam shrugged but i didnt actually do very much mr foster no not this time but you will the agency uses the kennedy incident as astandard training mission its a little piece of history that corrects itself but whenyou go back on a proper mission itll be down to you and ofcourse the support unit he looked across at bob studiously examining a steakknife to make things right but how will i know what to do youll know liam because youre a very bright young man quick on yourfeet foster placed a fatherly hand on his shoulder initiativethats what youve got youre a smart lad no amount of training can give aperson that uh thanks what do you think bob the clone looked up from the steak knife mission operative liam oconnoris good there i think he likes you liam smiled thanks bob foster turned to maddy and sal and you two you did very well they grinned both very pleased with themselves but this exercise is just the beginning a waitress arrived with a tray full of plates she prepared to deal them out like playingcards whos havin the rack of ribs liam raised a hand im starving he said the salad sal raised her hand the burgers foster and maddy nodded the waitress looked at bob confused im sorry sir what did youorder bob glanced up at her with his piercing grey eyes i do not eat human food unless itis a necessary mission requirement he explained dryly the waitress cocked her head excuse me oh dont worry about him said foster hes just notallowed to eat on duty she smiled coyly at bob admiring his physique so are you like some kind ofundercover cop then bob turned to liam liam oconnor explain the term copplease liam shrugged and made a face youre asking me a cop explained foster is a slang term for alawenforcement officer i understand bob nodded slowly and closed his eyes iam filing the term for future use the waitress looked from bob to foster bemused you guys aint from around here are you maddy finished chewing her first mouthful of burger oh you can forget about them theyre canadian chapter berghof hitlers winter retreat kramer cowered behind a small oak bureau in the hallway shards of wood stung hisface as a dozen rounds slammed into the far side and sharp slithers splintered off he rattled a stream of curses out under his breath as the corridor filled with the deafeningcrack of machinegun fire at the end of the hallway several ss leibstandarte were dug into covered positions defendingthe double doors to die groehalle the main room of hitlers mountain retreat karl and several of his men returned fire their shots peppering the overturned marble tableahead of them behind which the ss were putting up a valiant defence showers of powderedmarble erupted from the once mirrorsmooth table surface now pockmarked with cracks andbullet craters we have to move karl theyll have reinforcements here any second karl nodded he understood the situation all too well the attack had started out smoothly he and his men had quietly slipped past the machinegunposts either side of the winding road and made their way up the steep rise towardshitlers hillside chalet but the game was up when a guard spotted them at the lastmoment approaching the buildings main entrance hed managed to fire off a singleshot from his gun before dieter had slipped a blade into his throat hitlers handpicked guards had been surprisingly swift to reactbustling their leader to safety behind the thick double doors of the main hall and setting upa defensive position outside it the rest of the ss guard detachment in the building had beenquickly and ruthlessly picked off by karls men it was just these stubborn guards at the end of the hall now the problem was though thattheir attack had been stalled right here and time was rapidly working against them outsidethe chalet a distant klaxon was sounding and the regiment garrisoned nearby was undoubtedlyalready scrambling into their boots and on their way over karls fiveman rearguard covering the front entrance of the chalet had as much chanceof holding their position as theyd had holding the ground floor of the museum they were certain to be quickly overwhelmed kramer was no soldier but he could see that this last hurdle could be the one that finishedthem if they remained in this stalemate a minute or two longer then it was going to be allover the numbers were quickly going to mount against them and having modern pulse rifles andelite training wasnt going to make a blind bit of difference were going to die if we dont take those men he looked across the hallway to where karl was crouched their eyes met the man noddedknowing what kramer was thinking a faint smile slipped across his face as he slapped in afresh cartridge and racked his pulse rifle ready for action the other men around karl took his lead quickly reloading their weapons and then readyingthemselves to burst out into the open and sprint the length of the hallway under fire silently karl mouthed a countdown turning back to his men encouraging them with a finaldevilmaycare grin that told the mercenaries they were going to succeed or die heroes five four three two one they emerged from their covered positions as one laying down a withering barrage ofrapidfire highimpact shots that filled the air around the table with a blizzard of chippedfragments and marble powder they ran forward still firing ten yards five yards kramer followed in their wake he found himself screaming like a banshee karl was the first to reach the overturned table crashing heavily into it he swiftly pokedhis rifle over the top and sprayed the ss guards sheltering behind it point blank with asustained burst until his pulse rifle clacked like a woodpecker exhausted of ammo rudy and sven joined him emptying their clips blindly over the top of the table into thespace behind it then all of a sudden it was as silent as a graveyard the smoke and dust cleared around them and kramer gingerly lifting his head to look over thetop saw the men dead on the floor an unpleasant mash of flayed flesh splintered bone andtattered black ceremonial uniforms in the distance muted through the thick stone walls of the chalet he could hear the rapidtap of gunfire from the front of the building the garrisons here alreadywere out of time karl clambered over the table and aimed a swift hard kick at the oakwood double doors theyrattled heavily and swung inwards karl led the way in as he stepped through a single pistol shot echoed across the grand room and a solitary shardof wood flung off the oak door beside his head rudy stepping in beside him swung his weapon round and emptied half adozen shots into a portly looking wehrmacht general with braids on his shoulders throwing himback across a grand banqueting table covered with maps and scattered typed pages ofintelligence notes and field deployments the general rolled off the side of the table andthudded heavily on to the floor kramer stepped into the room slowly scanning the sweatsoaked faces cowering behindarmchairs and coffee tables generals and field marshals so much gold braiding somany medals pinned to their chests and yet here they were looking very much like aclass of startled children his eyes finally rested on a trembling man in a tancoloured tunicwith a dark fringe drooping over one eye and his distinct toothbrush moustache unmistakably it was the very man they were after hitler was crouching on the floor holding an ineffectivelooking pistol in his shaking handas the sound of the distant gunfight around the berghofs entrance grew more insistentkramer took a step forward adolf hitler he said in fluent german your plans to attack russia inthe next few weeks will result in you losing this war hitlers eyes widened his lips flickered and tensed but he said nothing now if you want to win this war if you want detailed intelligence of what yourenemies are doing right now if you want weapons technology that will make you invincible he nodded back down the hallway at the growing cacophony of approachinggunfire then i suggest you call off those men outside and listen very closely to what i have to tell you chapter new york maddy walked alongside foster as they crossed the williamsburg bridge back over thehudson river to brooklyn in the darkness the lights of the city danced on the watermagically it really is a beautiful city she said foster nodded tonight is special he said i always think of thisevening as the last one of the old new york tomorrow when those two planesarrive itll change they walked in silence for a while watching the others ahead sal and liam seemed to beteasing bob laughing at the stiff unnatural way he talked theres no harm in thatshe supposed bob needed to sound a lot more like a human if he was going to blend inparticularly if he was going to be sent alongside liam on assignments back into the past she noticed the old man was looking a little frailer than he had when hed pulled herout of that plane he rarely seemed to sleep almost every night after theyd alltucked themselves up into their cots she heard the archways door creak open where do you go at night he looked at her she shrugged i hear you sneaking out i walk around brooklyn he smiled i clear my head the fresh air doesme some good she studied him silently for a moment are you ok fostershe asked foster took his time replying youve noticed then he saideventually im not sure what you mean that im dying he said quietly what he looked at her i figured you wouldve worked it out soon enough actually i was just thinking you werent looking too well thatsall he smiled again thats kind of you but in fact im dying veryquickly as it happens whats whats wrong do you need a doctor no it wouldnt help he said shaking his head this is somethingyou need to know maddy he said grasping her forearmyou cant tell the others right now particularly not liam what foster took a deep breath it kills you eventually what does timeriding he replied going into the past it only has a gradualeffect at first so gradual he wont notice to begin with but the more he doesit the further back he goes the greater the harm hell be doing to his body theprocess will gradually corrupt the cells in his body prematurely ageing him she looked at him alarmed yes ageing him at first it wont beapparent but towards the end when the corruption has reached a certain level he willsuddenly age fast a thought occurred to her a question she didnt want to ask but knew she hadto so foster could i ask you you want to know how old i really am she nodded he shook his head sadly and she thought she saw the glisten of a tear nestling in the deepwrinkled fold beneath one eye i was pretty young when i made my first trip and now if i add up all the mondays and tuesdays ive served in that fieldoffice he said running a hand through his fine snowwhite hair i supposeid be about twentyseven now maddy covered her gasp with a hand oh god he managed a wry smile about ten years older than you although inside i still feelyoung ive become an old man he said his voice tapering off with the sound ofregret even bitterness in there somewhere he cant know maddy headded not yet hes not ready but its unfair that he doesnt know what this is doing to hisbody foster raised a finger to his lips even above the noise of traffic rumbling past them overthe busy bridge her voice might just carry enough for him to hear he has no choice madelaine either he does this or he has to return to the titanic at least this way he gets another seven or eight years oflife what if he left what if he decided to walk away right now and never cameback he cant do that it would cause problems this seems she felt her voice thicken this seems sounfair he shrugged sadly life is unfair you make the best of what life deals you maddy inliams case hes been given a few more years of life that he wouldnt havehad otherwise and think of all the incredible things hes going to see in those yearswhat about all the incredible things hes seen already hes ayoung man who was born in and yet just now hes enjoyed a cheeseburger fries andan icecold soda whilst gazing out on twentyfirst century new york what do you think julesverne or h g wells would have given to trade places with liam just for five minutes justfor a glimpse of this world but its not right that he isnt allowed to know she replied perhaps the kinder thing would be to keep this truth from him as long as you possiblycan said foster he looked at her thatll be your call madelaine wheni eventually go and leave you in charge as the team leader itll be your decision how and when you break this to liam she bit her lip unhappily and looked at the others again still giggling and goofing about atbobs expense oh liam poor liam i mean you both sound so wrongsaid sal pulling her hood up over her head real freak show like characters out of anold black and white movie liam scowled what do you mean do i not sound enough like everyone else aroundhere she shook her head and laughed no that funny irish way you talk im from cork thats how we talk there he replieddefensively anyway your indian accent sounds funny to me too sort of likewelsh she laughed bob she said jabbing the support unit lightly in the ribsdo your impersonation of liam you wish me to replicate liam oconnors speech patterns go on bobs eyelids momentarily fluttered and ticked as he retrieved data stored somewhere inhis tiny computer mind oimliam oconnor so oi am and oi come from cork in oirelandso oi do uttered bob with an expressionless face sal giggled perfect argghh dont be taking the mickey like that sal hang onliams eyes narrowed suspiciously youve not been training him to do thathave you she nodded clamping her lips tightly affirmative said bob dryly sal vikram assisted me in replicating yourspeech pattern liam oconnor liam shook his head with a show of goodnatured disgust well at least i dontdress like some sort of carnival street beggar all ripped clothes and messy orange paintsplashed over me front uh sal looked down at the neon logo on her hoodie oh thatits the logo for a rock band esszed rock band bangra rock my parents really hate it think its too western tooamerican oh said liam nodding politely but not really understanding what she wastalking about but its ten times better than american stuff much darker with likehiphop dance loops and screamrap liam frowned hiphopdance loops he looked at her dance ahhh so is it a kind ofmusic were talking about sal looked at him her face half smile half bemusement he shrugged and grinned hey i like music too i like the brass bands marching bandsas well i tell you you can skip merrily along to that so you can and then theresthe folk tunes where i come from would you have heard of the galway racesmolly malone the jolly beggarman she stared at him in silence no i guess not liam shrugged ah well thoseare ditties you can really dance a sweat to and then theres sal listened to him chattering on about the dance halls back in cork secretly delighting inthe fact that he sounded like a walking antique an oldfashioned young gentleman fromanother century all manners and quaint charm and so unlike the boys from her timeshe loved the curious sound of his accent despite teasing him sal smiled what a strange little group we make like some kind of odd family for the first time since shed died since shed been plucked awayfrom the life she knew she felt almost almost happy in astrange way this felt like it could be a new home to her a new life she could get usedto she looked out at the glittering lights of manhattan pleased that their field office washere and now in this time pleased that she was privileged enough to be seeing new yorkcity at its prime before the world started to change the global crash the depression before it all began the long slide downhill the night sky above her was thick with churning clouds bathed in amber light from the citybelow red sky at night shepherds delight it looked like it was going to rain this evening a gentle breeze tossed hair into her eyes and touched the bare skin of her forearms amurmuring breeze that seemed to quietly whisper in her ear a promise of more than just alittle rain a storms coming sal can you feel it yet chapter new york tuesday or im losing count its a tuesday morning the tuesdays i think of as the saddays the mondays are the happy days i hate the tuesdays full of griefthose smoking twin towers the crying and fear that terrifying rumbling as they comedown and the air full of dust and scraps of paper id prefer not to go out into them prefer to stay in the arch but foster saysits important im equally familiar with both versions of new york thebefore and the after its early right now am i always seem to be the first to wake the others areall fast asleep maddy snores in the bunk below liam whimpers like a puppy sal looked up all was still in the archway foster was asleep on an old sofabeside the kitchen alcove stirring restlessly beneath a quilt and bob bob rested inone of the birthing tubes in the back room she wondered what he dreamed about ifanything she closed her diary sat up and pulled on some clothes under her blanket and then climbeddown quietly she grabbed a bin bag full of dirty clothes lying beside the bottom bunk andwalked across to the breakfast table one duty collectively agreed was that every other tuesday would be a good day to take their meagre supply of clothes down to the laundromat in themorning to collect in the evening she checked their small fridge no milk she sighed one of the others had finished the last of it without saying she shook her headand clucked like a mother hen theyd starve if it wasnt for me she decided to stop off at the store on the way back to pick up some halffat milk somebagels and some more rice krispies since liam had discovered a passion for them and seemed todevour bowl after bowl of the stuff she punched the red button and the shutter whirred up quietly rattling and letting in thecool morning air of the city she breathed in deep and looked up at the clear blue sky it wasgoing to start out as a lovely sunny day today as always sal dropped off the laundry with the sweet old chinese lady who worked at the laundromat shewas a chatty old thing whom sal was beginning to get to know well always talking proudly sometimes in broken english sometimes in cantonese about her nephew whom sheannounced with pleasure alway wear spensive smartsoo to go for his work of course it was exactly the same greetingevery time she stepped into the shop as if she was setting eyes on sal for the very firsttime which of course she was but sal decided to politely steer their brief chitchattyconversation in different directions with every visit gradually learning a little bitmore about her and her family each time she headed across the bridge into manhattan enjoying the warm sun and watching the citystreets grow steadily busier the air was thick with smells both pleasant and not so butnothing quite as bad as she remembered in downtown mumbai particularly on the smogheavy days entering manhattans lower east side her nosepicked out the acrid smell of exhaust fumes mixed with the delightful odour of freshly brewedcoffee and ovenbaked bagels billowing from the various coffee shops and fastfood restaurantsshe passed on the way across to broadway and up to times square tuesday starts so well she noted sadly right now in the earlymorning it was as fine a day as one could ask for she looked at her watch am the day would continue to be lovely for another thirteen minutes she sighed sadly then itwould turn into the nightmare of nineeleven she entered the busy nexus of times square andtook a seat on a bench her regular bench beside a litter bin she watched thestopstart traffic at a busy intersection and the pavements filled with people on their way towork men already hot with their jackets over one arm and their ties loosened women in smartsummer blouses and light linen trouser suits am eleven minutes to go the large green face of shrek looking equally bemused and irritated by donkey hung abovethe square as always she studied the movie billboard and the others dotted aroundbeginning to find them all very familiar like bedroom posters long past their time to betaken down and replaced with something else am eight minutes to go a homeless man approached the bench as he always did at am pushing ashopping trolley in front of him piled high with cardboard boxes and an old tarpaulin hesmiled politely at her as he always did before rummaging through the litterbin and finding a halfeaten sausage mcmuffin he sat down beside her his lined and pockmarked face creased with quitepossibly the last smile new york would see today and opened his mouth to say the same thing healways said hey lucky me its still warm he eagerly tucked into his rescuedsandwich sal politely returned his smile im glad she said and she genuinely was she was familiar enough withthe next few hours to know this was the last fleeting moment of contentment left in the day ahomeless tramp chewing gratefully on a discarded sausage in a bun am two minutes to go she looked up at the skyline seeing in the distance the very tops of the two world tradecenter towers glistening like polished silver in the morning light proud structures thatconfidently seemed to reach up to the blue sky and actually touch it and inside somany thousands of people sitting down to start a regular day at work opening their emailinboxes peeling the lid off their starbucks coffee unwrapping their saltbeef and mustardbagels am one minute left the tramp finished his breakfast and sighed with contentment he turned to sal and sucked in his breath to say what he always said at this timegonna be a helluva day aint it yes she nodded it is the tramp got up off the bench and pushed his trolley away from her whistling cheerfully ashe went am now only seconds to go sal hated this final countdown beginning with the distant drone of an engine in the sky andending with cries of disbelief from the pedestrians around her and a moment later the boomand rumble of the planes impact shed sat through this at least a dozen times now and god knows how many more timesshed have to hundreds thousands sal wondered if it wouldget any easier for her counting down those last few seconds she closed her eyes foster probably wouldnt approve of that if he knew but therewere only so many times she could bring herself to watch she could hear the plane now and then she felt it a dizzying sense of losing balance of falling as if just for a momentthe ground beneath her had been whipped away she opened her eyes looked up and gasped at what she saw maddy studied the screens before her steaming mug of coffee in hand blackcoffee because someone had used the last of the milk and not leftany for breakfast and waited for the first tickertape newsflash to report somekind of explosion at the world trade center she checked the clock on the computer it was am it was due the clock display now flickered to indicate am ok its now past due hmm she grunted she looked around for the others liam was drowsily slumpedon his cot reading a national geographic magazine hedfound lying around the archway foster who looked frailer and ill this morning remained fastasleep on his couch bob was still in his tube being nourished intravenously with somehorriblelooking gunk er was the best maddy could come up with right now sal stared dumbstruck at a very different world around her shrek and donkey weregone so were the posters for mamma mia and planet of the apes she noticed some of the more recent buildings looked a littledifferent too but most importantly the twin towers were gone and in their place notquite so high but easily as grand stood a giant marble column from which an enormous redpennant proudly flapped her eyes dropped to street level it looked so much less chaotic fewer billboards adornedthe sides of buildings the shopfronts looked somehow tidier more reserved more upmarketthe streets were far less clogged with vehicles which themselves looked strangelyoldfashioned reminding her of some of the oddlooking automobiles she had once seen in atransport museum the pedestrians many more of them than there were a few moments ago eyed her tatty clothescuriously she looked down and realized her hoodie with esszedsplashed brightly across it the ripped and patched drainpipe jeans stood out in starkcontrast to the sombre and characterless grey suits everywhere and something else virtuallyeveryone was wearing a red armband that featured a white circle and some small black design onit it reminded her of the old war films the bad guys used to wear those redarmbands what were those bad guys called oh yeah nazis she turned to look for the homeless man whod been sitting on the bench beside her buthe was gone along with his supermarket trolley feeling dozens of curious eyes begin to fixon her she got up off the bench and quickly hurried across the busy pavement to the mouth ofa quiet backstreet she pulled out her mobile and dialled the field office the display showed two words no signal confused for a moment she quickly realized she could see no one else talking into a mobilephone either in fact she could see no one even holding one nor any adverts for topup cardsor service providers or deals with free texts nor stalls selling novelty phone coversnothing at all to do with mobile phones maddy looked up at foster the plane impact just didnt happen shesaid and a moment later most of the newsfeed screens went blank she addedpointing to the row of monitors now all synchronously blinking an error message foster looking blearyeyed from being woken and far too pale for her liking noddedthoughtfully over her shoulder were in trouble this looks like a bigshift he said quietly normally they come in waves subtle ones at first thatbring very minor changes then the bigger ones come later if events up the timelinearent corrected one computer screen still seemed to be functioning beneath a prominent red banner with alogo on it were the headlines of the days news what is that queried liam pointing to the logo on the banner reminds me a bit of the nazi swastika she replied but itisnt whats a swastika asked liam foster waved a hand sorry liam ill bring you up to speed laterhe looked more closely at it it looks like a black eel or snake or something bitingits own tail yeah maddy nodded liam spotted something the other two hadnt yet i wonder if you noticed thenews is in two languages he pointed to the lower half of the screen where the sameheadlines had been duplicated in another language german and english said maddy thats all i can see no otherlanguage options foster turned to them and gathered his thoughts ok well it doesnt take agenius to work out that historys been shifted to incorporate a pretty significantalteration er the germans won the secondworld war suggested maddy more than that madelaine it looks like they went and conquered america liam looked at both of their ashen faces that really isnt good isit chapter new york the archways shutter rattled gently as it whirred up all three of them spunround anxiously a pair of doc martens boots and skinny legs quickly reassured them sal cried maddy i was getting worried about you sal stepped in smartly and lowered the shutter its all differentout there she said gasping for breath i ran back all theway i was frightened my phone wasnt working foster turned to maddy yes of course in this new history maybe they donthave things such as telecommunications satellites in orbit or mobilephone masts she added if this is like some nazistyledgovernment maybe theyre not so keen on letting people communicate with each other soeasily thats true he replied hands clasped thoughtfully and this said maddy gesturing at the screen this looks like some kindof online governmentapproved news site he made a face which means we cant entirely trust it as a source ofinformation but its all weve got maddy pointed out he nodded this is true liam beckoned sal over come and sit down he said patting an empty seatbeside the old man let me get you a drink of water or something thank you she panted he reached out and touched her lightly on the shoulder you all right theresal she nodded i was so jahulla it was so frightening its like anotherworld he headed towards the kitchen alcove and ran a glass of water from the tap is there an archive section on this page asked foster maddy moved a cursor across the screen yeah she clicked a button on an infotab historygeschichte the screen paused and flickered before presenting them with a surprisingly limited menu not a lot of info listed here sneered maddy derisively foster studied the meagre list of menu items there click on timeline zeitlinie she did so and a moment later they were presented with the graphic of a time bar with thesignificant events of the last fifty years laid out along it my god look she said pointing at the screen end of warwith china the fuhrers hundredth birthday the first man inspace but look at the beginning of the timeline said foster maddy frowned it starts in why nothing before i dont know she clicked on a button beside the beginning year and was answered with a red warningdialogue box fruhgeschichtenfrugen erfordern korrekte ermachtigung access to earlier history requires authorization maddy shook her head it seems history before that date isout of bounds for everyone it all starts with she checked the historical markerfor that particular year america celebrates joining the greaterreich maddy clicked on the tab and a small article appeared a grainy black and white photo showedsome city street lined with cheering people and a motorcade of vehicles proceeding down itshe read the words aloud september vicepresident truman reluctantly concedes defeat and signs the termsfor an unconditional surrender in the presence of the fuhrers highest rankingfield officer reichsmarschall haas the american nation is now a part of the greater reichthe fuhrer is greeted on the streets of washington by hundreds of thousands ofenthusiastic supporters heartened by his promise to rescue their nation from years of povertyand hardship she shook her head i cant believe that i cantbelieve the american people would roll over and welcome adolfhitler in as their ruler thats just crazy foster nodded well i agree its odd but whether they did or theydidnt history has gone off track wildly off track he turned to liam im sorry lad i feel like im throwing you in at thedeep end we need to send someone back to check things out uh all right replied liam unhappily this time though said foster im afraid this time icant go liam swallowed anxiously im im going back alone no bob will go along with you i er im not sure i im sorry lad but there

yes i did but this time im sorry im going to haveto sit this one out oh we havent another moment to lose he turned to sal revive bobfrom his birthing tube she nodded and headed off to the back room madelaine yes we need to prepare a data download for bob he needs all of this alternative historydownloaded into his brain also he needs to have a complete understanding of the germanlanguage and id download from our onsite files everything we have on hitler thenazi high command the second world war i guess that should do it for now what about me asked liam foster shrugged sorry liam its come sooner than i expected idhoped to take you through a couple more training trips but it looks like weve run outof time oh boy whispered liam foster pointed towards the cylinder youd better start filling up the tube withwater chapter new york liam clung desperately to the side of the perspex tube with both hands unhappilykicking at the warm liquid beneath him bob floated beside him calmly treading water ok liam youre going to be there for two hours exactly weve set thecoordinates for the first of september were sending you to the grounds of thewhite house the presidents washington office all you and bob are going to dois observe ok just observe do you understand liam nodded yyes foster patted his hand relax liam youll do just fine he looked atthe support unit treading water and

laterthats the standard missedrendezvous procedure dont worry bob knows all aboutthat and will keep you on schedule but if we miss all the windows just make sure you dont liam swallowed anxiously but

patted liam on the arm justmake sure you stick to the schedule i ill try me best mr foster so i will i know you will lad foster got to his feet and took the steps down the side of the cylinder on to the concretefloor of the arch ok madelaine begin the launch procedure launching in one minute the displacement machinery attached to the water tube began to hum deeply sal stepped forward staring at their foggy outlines inside the tube good luckliam she called out be careful he let go of the side with one hand and quickly waved ill be all right theresal dont you worry about me now the lights in the arch dimmed and flickered as power diverted to the tube forty seconds to go until launch announced maddy remember liam shouted foster as the hum grew more intenseyoure just going for a look dont getinvolved in anything right you are cried liam his voice rattling nervously thirty seconds fellas liams legs kicked in the water sending cascades of bubbles up the tube the hum ofthe generator increased in volume and pitch twenty seconds maddy called out her voice almost lost in the deafening whirof chargingup machinery ok liam shouted foster time to let go and go under liam nodded sucking in one deep breath after another fifteen seconds come on lad youve got to let go liam nodded still sucking and blowing air hyperventilating his legs thrashing in the waterbeneath him ten seconds come on liam youve got to let go now taking one last gasp of air he did so quickly sinking under the water through the scuffedand foggy plastic foster maddy and sal watched him flail in panic as he sank slowly to thebottom bob ducked down effortlessly beside him and touchingly so sal thought reached out and held liams hand it seemed to calm him just a little three two one with a pop the water and both occupants vanished chapter washington dc they landed amid a small copse of mature cedar trees with a heavy wet splash arghh yelped liam i hate that goldfishbowl thing information the device is called a displacement cylinder said bob crouchingbeside him already alert and assessing their surroundings liam picked himself up and squatted beside the support unit amid the foliage beyond thelowhanging branches out on the welltrimmed acre of lawn in front of the white house hecould see soldiers gathering who are they bobs eyes slowly panned across the scene in front of them the insignia anduniforms indicate that they are a mixture of american marines rangers and airborne hereplied recommendation we must have clothes yes clothes would be really nice bob stood up and announced i shall acquire clothes before disappearingthrough the trees and foliage liam continued watching the soldiers they looked like they had already seen some fightingmany were wounded some being dragged by their colleagues all of them looked exhausted andbattleshocked their grimy faces had defeat written across them he noticed a large olivegreen vehicle with tracks instead of wheels and aturret with what appeared to be a long slender barrel protruding from it it lurched acrossthe grass amid a plume of dark smoke it looked dented and scorched as if it too had seen someaction the vehicle reversed across the lawn kicking up divots of soil and leaving deeptracks in its wake backing up against a large white building the white house to his untrained eye this looked very much like the ragged assemblage of some kind of a laststand around the building perhaps it was all that was left of the united statesarmy blimey he muttered he heard a deep rumble coming from above and glanced up through the leafy branches the skywas overcast thick with grey lowhanging clouds that promised an imminent downpour therumbling was deep so powerful he could feel it vibrate against his chest it was coming fromsomewhere above the clouds the american soldiers like him were watching the sky anxiously all eyes trainedupwards waiting for something to appear liam craned his neck to get a better view whats up there behind him he heard a heavy footfall and turned to see bob holding out clothes and bootsthe owner of these clothes is dead he explained without any trace of emotionhe will not be needing them liam took them and looked at the damp stains of blood you didnt kill someoneto get these clothes for me did you bob shook his head no killing was required liam grimaced at the thought of stepping into another mans clothes on the other handstanding undressed in the middle of a war zone struck him as the worse alternative he pulledthem on as quickly as he could it looks like those soldiers are setting themselves up for alastditch defence correct said bob his eyes smoothly scanning across the lawn and i guess whatevers coming liam looked up again at thedarkening sky from where that deep rumble was issuing is coming from right upthere possibly an airborne weapon system bobs eyes flickered shut ihave data files on the advanced aeroplane prototypes that were being developed by the germansat the end of the second world war they actually used aeroplanes during the the secondworld war affirmative the rumbling grew even louder and liam found himself having to shout to be heard bigones jet propulsion deltawing designs vtol systems replied bob raising hisflattoned voice to compete with the deafening drone from above well that means nothing to me shouted liam what the hell arethose bob cocked his head for a moment i am able to provide detailed schematic blueprintsif i can locate a drawing implement suddenly the tumbling dark clouds above them momentarily spread thin enough for liam to seewhat was approaching bob you see that above them descending through the clouds was a giant dullgrey discshaped vessel easily aquarter of a mile in diameter it almost seemed to fill the sky above the white house as itslowly pushed its way down through the billowing clouds he could now make out dozens ofspinning rotors slung beneath the craft giant propeller blades whisking theair beneath the belly of the enormous disc projecting a powerful downdraught that set thecedar trees around them rustling and swaying liam noticed the emblem hed seen earlier on maddys screens stencilled across ahundred feet of the vehicles immense hull what the hell is that thing he yelled information it appears to be a circular dirigible replied bob he seemed torecognize the bemused and panicked shrug returned by liam as an indication that hehadnt a clue what one of those was it is a discshaped airship areinforced aluminium hull containing many large cells filled with buoyancy gas some of the marines on the lawn frozen into a motionless stupor by the sight raised theirfirearms and began to shoot pointlessly at it a black square slowly appeared in the dark underbelly of the craft then another andanother er now thats not good is it cried liam bob nodded in agreement is not good liam saw something dark emerging from the squares dots that quickly grew in size as a showerof somethings rapidly appeared to be descending towards them a canister the size of a thermos flask thudded into the grass thirty yards from them among agroup of haggardlooking marines the marines backed away from it as it started to spew out ayellow smoke several more canisters landed heavily and started billowing smoke across thelawn tactical smokescreen offered bob the air was soon thick with a mustardcoloured mist through it liam could just about makeout the nearby silhouettes of the american soldiers on the lawn drawing fearfully back acrossthe clipped grass towards the steps and the grand portico at the front of the white house now he could see more dark shapes descending through the mist from above dozens perhaps hundreds of them bigger than the canisters this time they heard something crash heavily through the cedar trees behind them accompanied by ashrill hissing sound they spun round to see a man tangled awkwardly amid thick branches hewore a loose black rubber boiler suit that reminded liam of the bin bags that seemed to lineevery backstreet in new york covering his face was a dark rubber mask with two glass plateswhere the eyes should be his head was kinked at an impossible angle and liam realized theneck had been snapped on the way down through the trees branches twin cylinders strapped to his back continued to discharge highvelocity geysers of gasnoisily which lasted only half a dozen seconds more before finally fizzing to a silence aerosolbased fastdescent system announced bob calmly above them liam could hear that same hiss multiplied through the air as other men in rubbersuits began to land nearby sod this we cant stay here the support unit nodded recommendation it will be tactically correct to go insidethe building known as the white house yeah ok liam said stepping out from the cover of the small copse andon to the open lawn please wait barked bob he stepped across to the body dangling from thebranches and with a hard tug pulled it to the ground he effortlessly flipped the body overand withdrew a weapon from the mans backpack his calm eyes appraised its effectivenessand how to use it within seconds he shouldered the weapon and nodded approvingly rapidfire pulse carbine his grey eyes locked on liams weapontechnology from the middle of the twentyfirst century well thats interesting but can we go now affirmative please follow me liam oconnor liam nodded uh sure all right you go first bob pushed out through the foliage beneath the trees and into the open striding forward withthe carbine held at his hip the yellow murky air was now filled with the sound of hissing canisters and the thud of bootsmaking a heavy landing on the lawn liam could see the smudged outlines of men all aroundthem maskmuffled voices barked orders in german oh im sooo very going to die one of the moving outlines took a step too many towards them and suddenly called out a sharpchallenge bob was frighteningly fast lashing out with the edge of his free hand and chopping atthe mans throat liam heard a dull crack above all the other noise follow said bob chapter washington dc they moved quickly across the lawn until liam realized they were now among theretreating marines backing up the alabaster steps and firing sporadically out into the mist infront of them rapid bursts of fire lanced back at them out of the smoke exploding showers of dust andplaster from the steps and the columns of the palisade a marine standing beside liampinwheeled from the impact of a shot and collapsed to the ground a gaping hole blown out ofhis torso follow said bob again leading liam through the marines returning fire towardsa glasspanelled double door a wounded soldier slouched by the doorway halted theirprogress hey where the hell you two goin were holdin the line righthere goddammit bob calmly twisted his arm and pushed him aside without any apparent effort they steppedthrough the doors and into the white house the carpeted entrance hall was thick with the stretchedout bodies of wounded soldiers onetrembling harried army medic moving among them and tending them with little more thanmercifully lethal shots of morphine ahead was a double doorway leading further into thebuilding and the west wing holding position behind a hastily assembled blockade of furniturewere a dozen more soldiers grim faced and clearly ready to go downdefending their president to the last my god bob uttered liam this is the presidents laststand bob scanned the hall the blockade the marines ready to die correct the president called eisenhower must be in this building what do we do save him bob turned to liam you are the mission operativetactical decisions can only be made by the operative not the support unit what you are in charge liam oconnor i i i dont know what we should do he looked out through the glass doors through the mist he could see little but he couldimagine hundreds more faceless soldiers hidden behind gas masks forming up on the lawn infront of the grand steps and the portico and readying themselves for a final devastatingassault on the building were here to observe thats all here to learn whathappened nothing more well hed already guessed that the american people hadnt politely invited thesenazis to come on over and run their affairs but they needed more details details that wouldhelp them pinpoint the moment further back in the past where history had taken a turn in thisdirection we need to find out how things got like this he turned to bobright correct mission priority one obtain information ok he replied looking around the hall so we need to grab someone andask questions correct liam stepped forward through the dead and the dying to their left was adoorway that led to a communications room he could see soldiers on field radios civilians ontelephones typists and telephonists all making hurried calls situation reports or more thanlikely final messages to loved ones to the right was a room full of desks and filing cabinets it looked less busy liam steppedacross the carpet of bodies into the room some of the smoke from outside had leaked inthrough several shattered windows and the air was tinged with a fine yellow mist he spotted a man in a smart blue suit sitting on the floor between two filing cabinets hisface covered in dust and drycaked blood from a head wound the man stared into space in front of him this is it he muttered his voicecracked and tired its all over theyre coming for us coming toget us to get us liam squatted down in front of him the germans nazis the man didnt seem to hear the question his eyes unfocused we shouldveknown shouldve prepared shouldve realized this was going to happeneventually bob mimicked liams posture and stooped down in front of the man informationrequest please tell us everything about your divergent history timeline bob yes liam let me try first eh he nodded you are the mission operative liam reached a hand out to the man and rested it on his shoulder hello mister the mans eyes focused on him there isnt much time said liam listen to me things canbe changed this isnt how it was meant to be were here to putthis no replied the man shaking his head no youre goddamn right this isnt how it should be they surprised usjust like them japs did back in liam looked at bob questioningly information in the twentieth century the japanese launched a surprise attack on theus naval base at pearl harbor this act effectively brought america into the second world liam held a hand up to hush him tell me whats been happening what where on earth have you been the man asked he shrugged at sea for a long time the nazis launched an assault on the beaches of new england a couple of months agooverwhelmed our atlantic defences like they were nothing took new york inside of a week wemustered everything we had to hold em outside washington but but they crushedour boys swiped em aside their fuhrer offeredterms he snorted our president and his cabinet and chiefs of staff to behanded over as prisoners or theyd come in and get em the man suddenly looked up at bob then back at liam wait you said this isnthow it should be whats going on who are you guys soe secret serviceguys this may sound incredibly strange said liam but you need to believewhat im about to say what the man shook his head what is it were from the future from the year and right now is a bit of historythat shouldnt be happening the mans face hardened this aint a time to play the fool son i he is correct said bob were sort of agents sent from thefuture to gather information on whats going on here said liam we needto find out whats been happening the man stared at them both in silence youre crazy liam shrugged i wish i could show you something to prove what im saying but icant mission parameter we have nothing on us from the future this is an observationonlymission through the shattered windows they heard movement going on outside above the drone comingfrom the sky men barking orders the jangle of equipment belts the cocking of weapons oh jesus were dead men cried the man there are rumours theirfuhrer wants to completely wipe clean americas government the presidentcongress the senate all the toplevel civil servants theyll kill every last personthey find in the white house listen said liam were going to change this were goingto stop this hiffler from doing what the man looked up at him hiffler what the heck you talking about son you talkingbout adolf hitler yes thats it hitler thats the correctname right he looked at bob for confirmation did i say it right correct adolf hitler the fuhrer leader of the nazi party and the thirdreich but that guy hitler died about ten years ago you guysgonna try telling me you dont know that liam and bob stared at each other assessment history diverged at least ten yearsearlier than this time instead of liam spoke under his breath we have to goback another ten years that is correct the man studied them both suspiciously dammit who are you guysreally you secret service guys some kind of special forces or something tell me you gotsome secret plan some kinda super weapon we can use back on em nazisright the sound of gunfire around the front entrance suddenly intensified they are coming now said bob we must leave the portal is due to openin exactly one hour and thirtythree minutes right but we know now that weve got to go back again but further back next time correct the man in the suit reached out and grasped liam have we got something secret hiddenaway some weapon we gonna fight back with bob answered there is nothing in this timeline you and all the people in thisbuilding have a high probability of dying in less than five minutes bob mimickedliams attempt to calm the man and rested a large palm on his trembling shoulderbut be reassured citizen this timeline will be completely eradicated once we havecorrected the time contamination liam shook his head as the hapless man stared at him in bewildered silence yes very reassuring bob the support unit turned to liam we must leave now chapter new york there must be some way to hack past their security and access the rest ofthe online history database said maddy maybe there isnt any more asked foster maybe the rulers of thistime consider history before this date before the conquering of america as irrelevant oneway they could have chosen to keep control of the american people is to delete records oftheir national history maybe even world history maddy shrugged but these are the nazis right surely theyd want to keeprecords of hitlers rise to power the second world war and how in this screweduphistory they actually won it im sure adolf hitler wouldwant all his subjects to know how brilliant he was and how hard a struggle he had as a youngerman and all that ragstoriches rubbish foster sighed it doesnt make sense i dont know why all thatsnot there madelaine i really dont perhaps for these nazis the day they tookcontrol of america is all that counts everything before that was of no importance sal coughed politely and the other two turned to face her maybe she said maybe the hitler guy died and the one who took overfrom him you know didnt like him or something decided to remove hitler from therecords foster nodded sal might be right weve been assuming derfuhrer is hitler maddys eyes widened she looked for a search function on the mainpage and after a minute of trying various buttons labelled in german gave up god these nazis really suck at laying out a web page perhaps in this version of the year the internet is a brandnew thing she gave up on the idea of doing a search on the name hitler instead sheclicked through the various article tabs along the timeline chart scanning eacharticle for the name five minutes later she shook her head no mention at all of adolf its like he never existed but plenty of mentions of der fuhrer theleader added foster maddy ground her teeth with frustration so who exactly isder fuhrer she accessed the computersonsite database a vast encyclopedia of correct history andpulled up files on hitlers high command his inner cabinet the men most likelyto succeed him heinrich himmler hermann goring martin bormann josephgoebbels she turned to foster and sal one of them maybe foster splayed his hands it could be any ofthem sal spoke quietly or perhaps none of them washington dc splinters of plaster erupted around liams head oh god help us he yelped ducking down behind a desk theyre inthe entrance hall the air was thick with the percussive rattle of machinegun fire and the throaty burr of theinvaders pulse rifles bob pointed down to the far end of the room recommendation go to the end and takecover what about you i shall secure tactical advantage whats that supposed to mean bob shoved him please go now he said calmly as bullets from the entrance hallsprayed in through the open door and noisily shredded the typewriter and telephone on the deskthey were crouching behind what about me asked the man in the suit liam half smiled come with us for now but we cant take you back withus jeez ill be happy staying alive just a little while longer you must go now insisted bob liam pulled himself to his feet poked his head round the desk and stole a glance through theopen door into the entrance hall he could see a couple of dozen blacksuited men firing onthe marines blockaded position the staccato chatter of the marines guns waslessening against the incessant snatched purr of the pulse rifles liam realized the germans had whittled down the defenders to one or two marines the fightwas all but over we have to move now he pulled himself out and sprinted down an aisle between two rows of desks away from theopen door and the onesided battle he came up against a woodenpanelled door at the farend the man in the suit was right behind him where does this door lead a hallway if we turn right theres an exterior door that leads us out to therose gardens liam looked back the way theyd come at the far end where theyd been hiding wasthe mustardcoloured mist he could only just make out a dark blob that might have beenbob your friend coming asked the man i hope so the dark shape moved suddenly lunging out from behind the desk and then it was gone throughthe doorway and into the main hall a moment later liam heard a renewed and intense burst ofgunfire pulse rifles he heard cries of alarm and panic muffled voices barking hastycommands in german he heard several loud screams that ended abruptly the sound of aferocious struggle something toppling over and shattering what in the heck is happening back there its bob happening for the briefest moment as he imagined what those powerful arms could do to mere flesh andbone he almost felt sorry for them a moment later emerging through the mist he saw something lunging like a charging bull downthe aisle towards them bob emerged from the smoke his face and chest spattered with bloodnone of which appeared to be his own i have acquired a tactical advantage hands slick with fresh blood he held out a gas mask and a black rubber hoodsuggestion liam oconnor you wear the mask and hood you will appear to be oneof them from distances greater than ten feet what about me asked the man bob regarded him dispassionately you are not a mission priority liam took the hood wet with blood you killed one of them incorrect seven enemy units were killed with just your hands bob looked sternly at both of them there is insufficient time for thisconversation liam noticed several ragged fleshy wounds across bobs hip and waistjayzus bob youve been shot more than once it looks like the wounds will heal in no more than three days the blood is already coagulatingthis is not a priority the support unit then turned swiftly to the man question do you have detailed information on the floor plans of thisstructure the man looked at liam uh i think hes asking if you know of another way out oh yeah its just up ahead bob nodded this is good hey said liam i think ive got a better idea how we might getback across the gardens to those trees please explain now said bob chapter washington dc liam and the man in the suit stepped out through the door into the rose gardentheir hands raised the smokescreen was still relatively thick out here and through thewafting mist he could see squads of soldiers fanning out across the lawn rounding upablebodied prisoners and shooting those marines too wounded to get to their feet inside the building sporadic gunfire could still be heard as the men in dark rubber hoodsand suits moved from one room to another finishing off the last few pockets ofresistance as they stepped through the decorative maze of bushes towards the main lawn liam looked upat the sky and saw that the giant saucer had moved along slowly drifting across towardsdowntown washington dc spraying out occasional jets of black dots from the dark trapdoors inits underbelly squads of men dropped swiftly down to the ground no doubt with key objectivesin mind to hastily secure administrative buildings critical utilities and intersections behind them bob marched stiffly a pulse rifle levelled at their backs the bloodied hood andmask stretched over his thick skull a soldier nearby unhooded and unmasked called out to them across the waisthigh rosebushes bob replied in german what did he say hissed liam out of the side of his mouth i told the man you were being taken for questioning thats very good bob whispered liam almost proudly very goodthinking i am programmed to mimic human traits such as lying and also duplicate shhh save it for later bob muttered liam they walked through the garden and diagonally across the white houses north lawntowards the copse of trees theyd first arrived in liam stared wideeyed at the corpseslittering the ground he had seen only a couple of german bodies but was now staring at noless than a hundred dead marines clearly while theyd been inside many more americansoldiers had bravely converged on the white house in a vain attempt to defend theirpresident the smokescreen had hidden a massacre out here before the building those pulse rifles mowingthem down as they charged pointlessly into the mist to save their commanderinchief he looked for the copse of cedar trees amid the clearing smoke and finally found it hisheart sank as he spotted a platoon of german soldiers resting in and around the small stand ofcedars they had removed their hoods and masks and chatted animatedly many lighting upcigarettes dammit theyre covering our way home way home the man looked askance at him its just a bunch oftrees our exit window will appear there said bob beneath his hood he accessed hisinternal mission clock the window will open in precisely one hour and seventeenminutes and thirtyfour seconds what the flippin heck do we do whimpered liam under his breath i have no tactical suggestions at this moment great he looked around a fresh autumnal breeze was blowing away the last wisps of the smokescreenand he could see that the few prisoners taken alive inside the building were being usheredtowards the centre of the lawn where half a dozen germans were standing in a circle watchingthe defeated dispirited civilians and soldiers already slumped to the ground he felt a cold stab of fear and desperation run down his spine theyll expect bob to herd us over there and once imdumped with the others im going to be stuck as if overhearing his thoughts a german officer his black rubber jumpsuit rolled down andtied round his waist revealing his grey wehrmacht uniform pointed to the prisoners and gavebob an order bob nodded replied and steered them towards the holding area i have been instructed to leave you there the support unit uttered quietlywhat are my orders liam oconnor i really dont know what do you suggest suggestion i can attempt an attack on the soldiers among the trees but i estimate apointfive per cent chance of success in taking and holding the position until our extractionwindow arrives they were running out of time and options the gathered prisoners sat in a cluster only a fewdozen yards away and no matter how slowly the three of them walked towards it thatswhere they were headed suggestion i leave you here and attempt a rescue when the percentage chance ofsuccess exceeds ten per cent liam gritted his teeth no both he and bob would be riddled with rapidfire highcalibre rounds before he could getthem both halfway across the lawn to the trees bob might well be able tosurvive several more shots on target but liam didnt fancy hed surviveone given the ragged wounds hed seen the pulse carbines inflict theres nothing we can do right now bob it looks like were going tomiss this window he hissed out of the side of his mouth and i dontfancy having my head blown off trying to make it how long now in one hour and fifteen minutes precisely but therell be another right correct an hour later and twentyfour hours after that so said liam now just a few yards away from the seated prisoners and thenearest guards leave me here if you see an opportunity to get me take it but forchrissakes dont get us both killed doing it what percentage chance do you authorize me to take liam oconnor i dunno he uttered under his breath just take your bestshot one of the german guards called out something and pointed at liam and the man with him i am being told to leave you here said bob quietly liam thought he detectedthe slightest note of anxiety in the units deep flattoned voice then do it if they take us from here then follow me wait for a chance and getme out of this fix all right mission priority primary duty is to observe and report back what you are not leaving me here bob do youunderstand liam snarled under his breath thats an order a guard stepped forward and roughly grabbed liam by the shoulder be quiet he snapped in accented english join the others liam staggered forward and then slumped to his knees among the group ofprisoners he watched as bob stood perfectly still face still hidden by the mask and hoodand looked helplessly on an officer called out to bob from across the lawn to help with dragging and stacking thebodies for disposal the unit turned hesitantly behind the glass plates of the gas mask a complex computer loaded with ai that was still inthe process of learning still almost childlike was desperately juggling mission prioritiesand variables calculating a million different ways to proceed liam watched the lumbering figure move away oh blimey what kind of a mess am i stuck in now chapter new york how long until the return window madelaine asked foster maddy looked up at a screen were counting down the last two minutesshe replied all right then well find out what the boys have seen and work it out fromthere he smiled thinly the sudden erasure of history before made it almostimpossible to identify exactly when and where things had begun to change and to zero in on that while the wipingout of historical records may well have been on the whim of some insane nazi dictator toappease his ego no doubt it also had the additional effect of completely hiding the tracks ofwhomever had instigated this time shift if thats what some time traveller hadintended then he was being very very clever leaving no trace no tracks nothing forthem to identify the moment theyd arrived in the past very clever maddy interrupted fosters train of thought uhh foster a warningdialogue box has come up he looked at it location point phase interruption abort or continue the computers picking up varying density packets inthe pickup window meaning the computer monitors the area inside the target window for the minute before were due to send back our operatives if theres alot of unexpected movement through it we can assume there are unwary people or perhaps ananimal walking across it if its persistent enough the computer flags awarning what do we do wait and see if it continues he replied pointing to a graphic display on thescreen theres a density packet spike someone or something walked through aboutten seconds ago we arent going to leave them asked sal her voice brittle withworry foster shook his head that wont happen he reassured her if weneed to abort this window well try again in an hour he looked at the display there were no more density spikes it looks like a oneoff he said could easily have been a bird flyingthrough or rubbish blown across it happens quite often sal managed a wan smile ok thirty seconds said maddy we aborting or continuing the display looked flat whatever had passed through didnt look like it was comingback in all likelihood it was liam accidentally stepping in too early the support unit hadprobably advised him to stand clear and now they were both waiting patiently to come home continue said foster maddy clicked the mouse and the dialogue box winked off screen ten seconds sal turned towards the middle of the archways floor ready to welcome them bothback keep well clear sal said foster pointing at a faint circleof yellow chalk on the concrete scuffed and in need of a refresh it marked out the dimensionof the return window you really didnt want to be standing there when it opened five seconds the generator hummed the lights momentarily flickered and dimmed foster looked at thegraphic display expecting to see the graph spike as liam and bob stepped in together but itremained flat come on boys stop messing around and three and two the graph suddenly spiked the lights went out completely as they flickered back on he was about to turn round and give them both a tellingoff forcutting it so fine when he heard sals scream a young man stood there staring at them eyes widened with fear and incomprehension a young soldier perhaps no more than a couple of years older than liam blond hair croppedshort his pale choirboy cheeks smudged with dirt and flecks of dried blood he wore a blackrubber boiler suit rolled down to his waist beneath it was a grey army tunic with oak leaveson the collar and an eagle emblem on the chest his eyes darted from sal to maddy to foster and then to someone elsesdismembered leg and arm lying at his feet amid a scattering of dried leaves twigs and acircular tuft of bloodspattered grass and soil was was istdas he looked down at the severed limbs on the ground oozing blood on to theconcrete floor was geschiehtwo bin ich his mouth fluttered in fear his voice broken shrill like a child suddenly finding himselflost in a crowded mall maddy reacted first she stood up and slowly approached him hands raisedits ok she cooed softly everythings all rightwere not going to hurt you the young man gathered his wits enough to unsling his gun and swivel the barrel down to pointat her halt stehen bleibenwer sind siewo bin ich maddy shook her head i dont i dont do german sorry shesaid offering him a friendly smile keep him talking said foster quietly maddy pointed to herself my name is maddy and you the young german stared silently at her his breath rasping in and out fluttering withfear whats your name she asked in her best motherly voicethis she said pointing to sal this is sal hi said sal smiling sweetly and slowly offering him a small hand toshake he glanced from one girl to the other ich ich bin feldwebel lohaans maddy guessed she was hearing his rank and surname but whats your first name hmm she askedtaking another step forward the young man racked his gun nervously stehenbleiben stay he barked licking his drylips maddy stopped dead and shook her head apologetically sorry ill stay rightwhere i am i wont hurt you he nodded seeming to understand that he took another deep breath you amerikaner she smiled yes this he said and shrugged lacking the words in english to completethe question this place is in america in new york actually the mans eyes widened this newyork she nodded he snorted nervously washington zehn he made a whooshing noise newyork thats right she replied whoosh and now youre right here crazy huh that seemed to be one of the three or four english words he knew he nodded and managed abemused grin ja crazee the generator suddenly hummed the lights winked and a moment later the young soldier thearm leg and most of the tuft of grass and soil were gone what happened i initiated an emergency dump replied foster hes back where hecame from although hes what it doesnt matter now he replied he looked at maddy and salthat that was a german soldier who looked like hed just been sucked outof a fight right off the lawn of the white house no less an invasion he nodded day one of recorded or should i say approvedhistory it would seem begins the day that america was successfully conquered by the germansjust like we were saying oh no whispered maddy then we dropped liam and bob right into themiddle of a battle sals face paled we can get them back though right well try again in an hour but only if we dont see any other odd densitypackets at the last moment i dont want to bring back another nazi or a part of oneif i can help it but if we cant bring him back is that it is he stuck there theres another scheduled for twentyfour hours later and if he misses that too madelaine hes a resourceful lad he has bob with him theyll do justfine where they are and as i said there is a way we cancommunicate with them we can let them know a whereandwhen for another extractionwindow he turned to both the girls whats of more importance to us rightnow is whether there are any more shifts due whether the world has stabilized as it is orwhether itll get worse is there anything we can do all we can do right now is try to work out where history was altered see if we cannarrow things down a bit my guess is something must have happened during the second worldwar something that changed the balance maddy nodded yeah maybe so continued foster what well do is work with what we havewell have to explore the new york out there perhaps therell be clues as to whathappened prior to the invasion of america ok she nodded ok sal she looked at him tears rolling down her pale cheeks poor liam shewhimpered i hope hes all right foster got up tiredly and walked over to her he stooped down in front of herdont worry sal hell be fine with bob right beside himhell be just fine i promise you what now we need more information sal i want you to head out to times square again just finda seat somewhere and observe all you can see if you can pick out any visual cluesanything at all that hints at events prior to and madelaine she nodded we need to trawl their historical database if you can find a way tohack through their security measures perhaps we can learn a bit more and then wellget ready to activate the backup rendezvous he sucked in air through gritted teethhopefully second time round it wont be cluttered with german troopseh chapter washington dc bob observed the hive of activity going on around him his cold eyes locked on andstudied the giant disc floating gracefully above the city and intermittently spewing outtroops he could hear the distant rattle of gunfire the muffled thud of explosions somewhere in the city small pockets of american soldiers were still holding out unawarethat the struggle was all over that their leader president eisenhower had gone downfighting and even now his body was being carried out and laid across the steps in front ofthe building along with the rest of his cabinet and chiefs of staff an officer standing nearby adjusting his tunic and wehrmacht peaked cap no longer encumberedwith a drop suit was hurriedly directing activity on the ground you he pointed at bob you can remove the mask the airsclear bob silently removed the gas mask his hair only a fortnights worth of growthstill just coarse bristles and his hard emotionless face made him look no differentfrom the other stormtroopers around him when weve tidied up the mess out here then you can take a rest theofficer said now get a move on man bobs eyes narrowed as he made a millisecond calculation on whether he should continueto pretend being an enemy unit or sprint a dozen paces across the ruttedgrass and effortlessly rip this mans arms from their sockets attack tactically incorrect at this moment he turned away and reached down for the body of a marine flinging the ragged remains overhis shoulder and carrying it across to where a pile of corpses was slowly growing as he didso bobs inexperienced silicon mind worked on a bigger issue more important than anyimmediate tactical assessments he had a strategic command decision to make tactical options rescue operative liam oconnor return to field office with gatheredintelligence prevent further contamination selfterminate bobs ai routines worked more efficiently with smaller numbers of options oneach branch of its decision tree two or three was the ideal number any larger anarray of choices slowed down the riskassessment processing exponentially he scanned the prisoners clustered together and identified liam crouched miserably among themand looking back at him if bob had had a little more time to become more familiar with humanfacial expressions and muscle tics he might have been able to recognize the mixture of fearanger and betrayal written across the young mans face his eyes suddenly registered a growing commotion among the cedar trees the place where thetime window had been due to open soldiers were gathering round something on the ground something unpleasant enough for one or two of themto double over and dryheave whatever was going on it was becoming too busy to clear the area too busy to consider it aviable extraction point for now at least he decided the option that bestsatisfied the missions parameters was the first option to rescue liam option left liam stuck in the past where he might potentially be tortured and exposedangerously revealing details of the future option to trigger his computer brain to fry itself achieved absolutely nothing useful atthis moment in time he cocked his head option had the highest missionrelevance rating he closed his eyes for a moment option solution assessment await nd extraction window minutestime if success of extracting liam is greater than then proceed else await rd extraction window in hours bob opened his eyes and tossed the corpse hed been carrying on to the pilethe solution was an acceptable one even though it amounted to little more than wait and see he was not going to leave nor was he going to terminatehimself instead he was going to wait for a better opportunity to rescue liam to presentitself but he realized something else had been factored into the decision something to which hecouldnt assign a recognizable label for now he decided to give it the name indefinable factor this indefinable factor wasnt coming from his database orhis ai code it was coming from the small part of his brain that was organic the tiny nub ofwrinkled flesh in his skull linked by a myriad hairthin wires to his onboard siliconwafercell computer and all this indefinable factor could do was whisper avery illogical and impractical message into his logical computer an awkward message that wasbeginning to cause a little confusion amid his carefully ordered ai code liam oconnor is my friend chapter command ship over washington dc oberleutnant ralf hoffman stepped on to the freight platform with two other men whowere hefting a heavy body bag between them they let it down gently and like him looked upin awe at the dark sky above them at the giant grey underbelly of derfuhrers command ship hoffman had been billeted aboard the ship with the men of his unit the rdfallschirmjager assault corps he was familiar with the inside of the air vessel but viewing it from outside the truly immense size of the thing came home to him the freight platform a square alloy plinth large enough to fit one truck at a time slowlybegan to winch upwards beneath them the grounds of the white house and proud boulevards ofwashington dc gradually receded hoffman watched the waning light of the afternoon fade as dusk rapidly toned thesmokesmudged sky over the city there were no street lights on no lights on in any of thebuildings the citys power stations had been taken out in the first wave of theassault only sporadic fires burning here and there illuminated washington dc along with theoccasional stabbing flicker of gunfire in the streets he took a deep breath nerves he was on his way up to das mutterschiff the mothership the nickname his men had for the giant airship more specifically he was on hisway to the upper deck of the mother ship where a long line of broad windows looked out on tothe world below der fuhrers viewing deck hoffman had never been invited up there few men other than the fuhrers highcommand and senior chiefs of staff had it was more than the great mans command andcontrol point it was his campaign home a very special place the platform continued to winch them up with a dull motorized clacking from above he lookedup to see the trapdoor yawning open in the vessels belly all of a sudden floodlights kicked in and powerful columns of light speared down into thegathering twilight panning across the city below hoffman winced and shaded his eyes gazingup just as the damned things had been switched on he was surprised he hadnt beenblinded ralf you may actually meet him its a distinctpossibility prepare yourself the thought sent an unwelcome shudder of fear and excitement down his spine he didntwant to appear foolishly nervous in front of the fuhrer he so wanted to impress the manto appear calm and professional as an officer of the elite fallschirmjager should thetwo men with him on the other hand were grinning like excited children on their way to meetfather christmas you two he snapped irritably you look like fools smarten yourselvesup and stop gurning like a pair of monkeys the men obediently tidied their appearance and stowed their smiles away beneath solemnparadeground faces hoffman looked down at the body bag the order had come directly from thefuhrers senior field officer reichsmarschall haas to hoffmans commandingofficer der fuhrer had asked to inspect this curious bodyfor himself and to ask the men whod seen what happened to explain directly tohim what theyd witnessed the clattering from above had grown much louder he looked up carefully shading his eyes tosee the yawning loading bay was now only twenty or thirty feet above them the freight platform finally jerked to a halt inside the bay where hoffman saw a couple of ssleibstandarte guards standing to attention dressed crisply in ceremonial black for an unhappy moment he thought they were going to take possession of the body bag and sendhoffman and his two men back down but with a perfunctory nod from one of them they beckonedhoffman and the others to follow a stairwell guarded by two more men took them to the upper deck the battleshipgrey wallsthat hoffman and his men had grown used to on the way over living like batterychickens on the lower decks as das mutterschiff sailed gracefullysouth from the conquered area around new york now gave way to dark oak panels thefloor no longer metal grilles but a soft maroon carpet that whispered beneath his muddiedcombat boots ahead of them double doors guarded by two more ss leibstandarte standing to attention oberleutnant hoffman to see the fuhrer announced one of the guardswhod escorted them up from the bay one of the two standing guard announced their arrival into an intercom a moment later ayoung smartly dressed adjutant appeared from a side office ah good he smiled ill see you in hoffman felt his heart pounding in his chest as the young man pushed the double doors openhis first glimpse of the fuhrers grand chamber was almost toomuch for him to bear remember professional calm look good for the fuhrer the adjutant spoke softly with someone before turning round to them come on in he smiled smartly and waved them forward hoffman stepped through the doors his two men behind him lifting the body bag between themhis first impression was of one long wall of broad windows slowly curving around like thestern of an eighteenthcentury tall ship and the brilliant glow of the floodlights outsidepouring in bathing the ornate decorated ceiling of the large room through the glass he couldsee an outline of the dark city and above the turbulent rolling thunderous clouds of theseptember sky framed together like a large oil painting standing behind a generous conference table spread with maps of the east coast of america anddotted with flagged tokens representing the invading german forces stood the fuhrerevery bit as tall slim and charismatic as all the posters and billboards made him out tobe to one side a few feet away stood the reichsmarschall stern faced fit and alert as hisreputation portrayed him it was well known that haas and the fuhrer went back a longway more than a decade it was said theyd first met while serving together during thesecond world war before that time of course there was nothing known about them two very enigmatic men the fuhrer smiled generously at hoffman you led the attack yes mmy fuhrer hoffman stammered awkwardly he waved a dismissive hand and laughed relax oberleutnant i dont biteyou led the assault on the white house yes my fuhrer congratulations a very welldone job hoffmans chest swelled with pride so i believe you have brought something to show me said paulkramer chapter washington dc where wwhere are we going asked liam the rear of the army truck dropped down presenting them with a ramp the german soldiersushered them up waving their guns reeducation camp said the suited man liam and bob had interrogated earlier inthe white house what i heard thats what happened to all the people in new york when the germans tookit thats where everyones headed reeducation camp prison camps thats what they really are thats where wereheaded the man sighed if were lucky liam turned to look at him uh what if were unlucky theyll just take us somewhere quiet and shoot us liam felt his mouth suddenly dry and his skin prickle he looked across the heads of hisfellow prisoners searching once more for any sign of bob if the support unit was going toactually support him hed better get a move on and dosomething in the gathering dusk it was getting harder to pick anything out but he thought he couldjust about detect the distinct outline of a particularly tall and muscular german soldierstanding perfectly still a hundred yards away looking intently back at him bob oh jayzus come on bob get me the hell out of here he whimpered underhis breath the man in the suit looked at him curiously hey kid you and that big friend ofyours you said some weird thing about the future back in the yes liam replied distractedly i dont suppose it matters nowwhere we said we came from he craned his neck to catchsight of bob one last time but the lone figure standing motionless had disappeared god help me a soldier barked irritably at liam to get a move on up the ramp and into the truck grabbinghis arm and pushing him roughly forward do as they say muttered the man beside liam be glad they didntjust shoot us all right here on the lawn liam stepped up and inside finding a wooden bench in the darkness to sit down on it wasdark enough he hoped to ensure the man wouldnt see the twin tracks of tears rollingdown his dirtsmudged cheeks bob watched the last of the prisoners climb aboard and the trucks enginerattle to life billowing out a cloud of exhaust fumes chance of success it made no practical sense to attempt a rescue of liam oconnor now even if his bodycould survive dozens of bullet wounds liams wouldnt he watched as thetruck rolled away across the lawn through a fence and bounced across a pavement and on to thehard tarmac of a broad avenue the highest priority at this moment in time was for him to return to the future with whatlittle intelligence they had managed to gather the missedwindow protocolmeant the field office would try one last scheduled window amid the cedar trees in preciselytwentytwo hours until then bob calculated his best course of action was to find somewhere to lie low andundetected more importantly his body had sustained several bullet wounds around his torsono critical organs had been damaged and the blood had clotted preventing further loss butthe wounds would need cleaning disinfecting and dressing his software informed him thatfailure to do so soon would result in an eightythree per cent chance of a spreading bacterialinfection and eventual systemic failure of his organic body he would die just like a human he walked away from the other soldiers some of whom had begun to glance suspiciously at hisunfamiliar face he strode swiftly across the grounds of the white house passing unnoticedamid the flurry of activity going on appearing in the gathering dusk as if he was justanother trooper given an important errand to perform with all haste chapter command ship above washington dc kramer turned round to look out of his sweeping observation windows down atwashington a dark still city he had expected far stiffer resistance around the capitalwashington dc had fallen in just two days the major battle had taken place just north of thesuburbs on the first day the american tanks the lightly armoured and cumbersome shermanmkiis had been outmanoeuvred and outgunned by their blitz raptor mkvis from the very firstmoment the raptors agile hovercraft weapons platforms had made pitifully short work ofthem their hastily assembled and dugout defences running east to west above the city had beenso easily bypassed the american battle line fell to pieces in the early hours of thismorning the second day of the battle for washington when kramers highly trainedfallschirmjager equipped with gaspropellant landing packs and their recently upgradedpulse rifles had dropped behind the americans crumbling line further panic anddisorder had soon spread among them today had mostly been a moppingup exercise the americans had managed to muster together a few defensive clusters his intelligence corpsinformed him a brigadestrength force of american marines was holding a strong position aroundone of the southern suburbs of the city and there were pockets here andthere within washington dc but the americans had not had enough time to set up anything morethan a shambolic line of battleweary troops around the white house itself kramer shook his head president eisenhowers last stand had been pitiful andundignified hed hoped for a much more dramatic conclusion to the campaign america hadsurrendered with a whimper instead of a bang the complete surprise with which theyd caught the americans had left them scramblingfrom the very beginning it had taken little more than eight weeks from the first massedamphibious assault on the beaches of new england to today it was of course better for the civilians this way better than a long drawnout campaignstretching into the autumn and winter with innocent people dying unnecessarily he genuinelyfelt no ill will towards the people of america in fact his mother had been american a woman born in minneapolis and he himself had once had an american passport hesmiled at the absurd complexity of things his mother sallyanne gardiner allamerican girlwasnt due to be born for another fortyfive years wasnt due to meet and marryhis father boris kramer for another sixtyfive and yet here was her son leader of thegerman nation the european states and now also the united states such is the absurdity of time travel paul eh background details of course known only to the few men he trusted around him karl haas andthe three other men whod come through the time machine and survived to this daystorming hitlers bavarian retreat had proven costly just the five of them left by thetime hitler ordered his men to stand down the people of germany adored kramer their fuhrer the one who led them tovictory the leader whod replaced that confused antisemitic old fool adolf hitlerthey believed him to be german they cared not that there was no record of his childhood no record of a mother or a father no trace of his existence in thisworld until the spring of all they cared was that he had emerged from nowherelike a guardian angel falling from heaven and led them to victory hed united europeunder one proud banner not that idiotic symbol the swastika buta banner of his very own design the uroboros the serpent eating its own tale a symbol of infinity what comes around goes around europe and now america had at last been united the combined muscle he needed toeventually bring the rest of the world to heel and it was going to be a much better world a world where no one starved a world whosepopulation could be responsibly controlled to not exceed what this earth could feed a worldwhose resources would be carefully used and not squandered by disgustingly rich andselfserving politicians a world not poisoned by vehicle exhausts or coal fumes a world notdying because mankind could not control its greed but more importantly it will be your world paul all yours the quiet voice of his ambition made him stir uneasily youve conquered more than any leader in history kramer knew he should be feeling elated proud of what hed achieved so far but hewasnt and the reason for that was lying on the floor in front of him brought up bythe oberleutnant and his two men a hideously deformed thing thatonce might have been a young german soldier but was now a twisted mix of two maybe threeyoung men it lay in front of him in an unzipped body bag kramer had seen something like this only oncebefore over a decade ago in the snowy woods of obersalzberg he remembered hed nearlyvomited then just as he felt like doing now karl squatted down beside the body and inspected it closely thiscould be the result of an incendiary weapon the intense heatcould have fused these poor men together kramer nodded tightlipped stroking his chin it could well be that or the result ofone of their pulse bombs designed to pulverize soft tissue with its shock wave his modernweapon designs had a habit of producing unpleasantlooking casualties like this or it might be something else that voice again he bid it be silent yes karl its a possibility chapter outside washington dc liam looked out of the back of the truck as it rumbled noisily along a road awayfrom dc lined with german troops on patrol civilian refugees herded at gunpoint and pitifullines of beaten american soldiers in their khaki greens many of them wounded im wallace by the way said the man in the suit daniel wallacei work in the white house press corps well he sighed wearily at least idid liam held out a limp hand he wasnt sure what press corps did but heguessed it was to do with newspapers liam oconnor from corkireland wallace nodded youre a long way from home son tell me about it he replied with a lacklustre smile wallace spoke quietly im still puzzled about you and your friend you said youwere wallace looked around at the other prisoners many of them were either inshock or had retired into themselves shutting out this grim reality look why dont we forget what i said liam replied itsnot like it matters now does it im right here in the same boat as everyoneelse what about the man you were with what about him i i swear i saw him take gunshot wounds that that he shouldnthave survived liam said nothing and wallace let it go for now turning to listen to acouple of other prisoners in the back of the truck talking quietly a silverhaired armycolonel and a naval officer were all strung out shellshocked i cant believe two months agothe big story was eisenhower meeting kramer on neutral ground to discuss peace an endto the growing tension between us and them and all the while cut in the navy officer kramer was putting the finalpreparations together for his invasion of america the colonel ran a hand over hisbuzzcut hair we never even saw it coming bill we were just kidding ourselvesthat they wanted peace and would leave us alone liam gazed out of the back of the truck his mind a million miles away my first trip and its already over for me the last few weeks of his life felt like a crazy dream a little over three weeks agohed been a junior steward on the titanic tending to richpampered passengers looking forward to arriving in the land of opportunity america the planhad been to quit his job the moment the ship docked and begin a new life of adventure anddiscovery hed read so much about america and knew this was the place for him thecountry in which he would make his fortune then a chunk of bloody ice at sea had changed everything and with it came foster saving him from the sort of death hed always hadnightmares about drowning the old man had opened an incredible door for him astunning world of the future a world of chrome and glass buildings of neon lights andflashing screens of colour of excitement of movement of technology that seemed out of thisworld but also a world of the past of any time he wished for foster assured him he wouldsee so many wonderful things wonderful moments that in a way nodefinitely he was the luckiest young man alive now here he was stuck what he faced now along with everyone else in this truck was afrightening and uncertain future they were going to be shot and if not then most probablyput to work as prisoners of war some small voice inside tried to reassure him that at least he was alive instead of crushedand rotting fishfood at the bottom of the atlantic ocean it did little to cheer him he wasstuck here there was no way for him to return to that third and final extraction window andwithout any way at all to communicate with foster maddy and sal that was it forhim might as well forget those names he told himself im never going to see them again the truck rattled past a picket fence plastered with photographs of all shapes and sizes thesmiling faces of those missing printed on have you seen themposters placed by worried husbands and wives mothers and fathers along the bottom of thefence were piled posies of flowers fresh and old crosses mementoes teddy bears and dollsit was a shrine to those who had vanished amid the whirlwind carnage of recent weeks several of the other people in the back of the truck watched the fence pass by a painfullyendless display of hope and sadness a woman opposite him sobbed at the sight of it so many dead and missing a soldier in the truck ground his teeth never even stood a goddamn chancegainst them nazis perhaps the only comfort liam considered was that the war had been so short that it wasalready over chapter command ship above washington dc kramer watched the nervous young fallschirmjager officer and his two men leavethe room he had a million and one things to attend to a steady stream of command decisions waiting tobe made not only to do with this recently conquered country but also with affairs of stateback home in europe but his mind was now on this one thing the report hed just heard from the youngofficer the report of a shimmering window of air among the white house trees there had beeneyewitness statements that one man was swallowed by it only to be returned aminute later his body appearing and instantly merging with that of another man who hadaccidentally stepped into the shimmering air these were eyewitness statements made in the immediate aftermath of a battle themens blood was up adrenaline flushing through their veins soldiers after the rush ofcombat have always been prone to seeing things military history is filled with the storiesof soldiers who saw armies of angels coming to their rescue kramer might have dismissed thisas the overexcited rambling of young soldiers except the officer had brought themthis his eyes drifted across the twisted mutated thing in the body bag between them karl looked up at his leader you think this might have been theresult of another time traveller kramer said nothing in response how could someone else travel through time waldsteins carefully hidden prototype had been the onlytime machine international law had come down hard and unanimously and thoroughly closed thedoor on this technology any nation any corporation any individual caught developing it wassubject to the ultimate punishment complete obliteration no warning no arguments nomitigating factors even in the chaotic troubled world of the midtwentyfirst century therewas an accepted understanding that for better or worse time could not be allowed tochange that machine was the only machine wasnt itasked karl paul only karl was allowed that privilege now using his firstname and then only when it was just the two of them yes karl it was the only one by destroying waldsteins prototype behind him kramer had been certain that no one could follow them back in time and their efforts to change theworld for the better be undone but what if there was another machine the thought sent a chill down his neck and someone determined to come back after us if this twisted body on the floor was the result of a time window opening then someone from the future had chosen to zero in on today someone fromthe future was trying to correct history and assumed today september was the dayhistory was changed but it wasnt today history had in fact been changed fifteen years earlier the day kramer and his men had foughttheir way through ss guards to have an audience with hitler the day kramer had explained thathitlers impending attack on russia would be the beginning of theend of his dreams an end that would come four years later in a bunker beneath berlin with abullet in his temple and a cyanide capsule crushed between his teeth kramer looked up from the corpse out through the panoramic viewing windows karl wemust completely erase history what everything before today particularly everything since we arrived in covering our tracks yes but we should present this to the people as a symbolic gesture i dont understand this day will be known as day one a new beginning for allof mankind we will announce that after so many thousand years of bloodstained history countries kings popes emperors fighting each other for land or money or faith thatall war is over no more wars yes karl nodded it would be a popularmessage kramer pointed towards the city skyline through the broad window america was our biggest threat and now its part of our reich wecant be challenged any more were now looking at the chance that every person inthis world can finally be united under one banner the russian and chinese states still remain kramer shrugged their time will come he turned to karl i think now isthe perfect time anyway to make this sort of a sweeping gesture he turned away from the smouldering body glad the young officer and his two men were goneand that he could turn his pale face from the awful sight but karl you and i must never forget that were strangers in this time even though its been fifteen years since we timetravelled we must beever vigilant of covering our tracks i understand by declaring today as the first day of a new era well be wiping the lastfifteen years clean karl leaving absolutely nothing no clues for anybody in the future toclose in on but more than that well erase all of history and why not isntthis also the reason we came back to wipe the slate clean a new beginning a neworder karl nodded i will make an announcement over state television and radio we shall decree a day ofcelebration across all the nations of the greater reich a unity day of unity day it is a good name for itpaul yes yes it is well call it that then as well as this celebrationwell begin a systemic purging of history books documents relics it all has to go itall has to be burned karl nodded yes sir and well tell the people of america that theres nothing to be afraid ofthey will not be enslaved but instead will be invited to join thegermans the french the british and all the other citizens of the greater reich i will have a speech drafted for you said karl thank you old friend this he said pointing at the body on the flooris nothing for us to be alarmed at do you understand wecontrol history now karl you and i its clay in our hands to be mouldedexactly as we want there will be no way for anyone from the future to find our entrypoint if this body was the result of an attempt by somebody to find us karllooked at kramer the fact that they tried today andnot back in the spring of this proves yes kramer smiled that they have no idea what date we went back to originally he patted karl affectionately on the shoulder ithink this shows that were safe yes sir karl crisply saluted i shall see to your speech thank you kramer watched karl go closing the grand double doors behind him and then turned once moreto look out of the panoramic windows will that be enough though erasing history it would be a sensible precautionary measure but kramer still felt a chill of unease halfan hour ago hed been certain that waldsteins prototype had been theworlds one and only time machine is it possible im wrong in the sky he watched a squadron of messerschmitt jetlanders swoop down from a higheraltitude and hover just above the deserted streets below sweeping them with theirsearchlights what was left of the world to conquer would present even less of an obstacle than americahad his reich was now unassailable unbeatable all powerful the remaining countries wouldfall one by one russia and china two large but backward nations were isolated blockaded onall fronts sooner or later he could finish them off and be done with war nonetheless it was an unsettling prospect that someone somewhere out there in the futurecould if they got very lucky find a way to get to him or it might be something far worse paul do you remember what the oldman waldstein once told you kramer cursed glancing at the body he ordered his guards standing outside to take the thingaway and dispose of it hed seen enough bloodshed for one day and there was muchto attend to now that the united states had officially surrendered chapter washington dc it was dark and wet bobs eyes had adjusted hours ago to the dimness downhere in the sewers pallid tendrils of light lanced through the grating in the pavement aboveit was a grey overcast afternoon in washington dc the day after america had been defeated byits invaders the support unit sat motionless on a damp concrete sill his legs dangling in thefoulsmelling water that trickled past from above he could hear the occasional movement of vehicles the tramping of boots andevery now and then the rattledash of distant gunfire over the last twenty hours thousandsof people potential troublemakers those who might try their hand at rallying thepeople senators congressmen judges lawyers journalists had been rounded up andput on convoys of trucks heading out of the city the rest of the citys populationcowered in their homes and could only wonder at what kramer and his invasion force would dowith them all now it was quiet at the moment save for the persistent echo of water dripping from thesewers curved brick ceiling and the languid trickling of stinking sewage bob sat motionless absentmindedly a finger flicked the safety catch of the pulse carbineheld in his hands on and off off and on the metallic click echoing loudly down thesewer waiting patiently counting down on his internal clock bob closed his eyes information final window due in minutes he was only ten minutes from the white house a mile as the crow flies and half thatdistance he could cover underground along the network of sewage tunnels emerging from amanhole along pennsylvania avenue he would have to run the rest of the way in plain view hisblack rubber suit and mask might disguise him for a short few moments but since all the otherenemy soldiers had discarded those and were now wearing their grey wehrmacht uniformshed most probably attract attention the instant he was above ground however if he timed things correctly and was lucky he stood a fair chance of managing tofight his way quickly to the space beneath that copse of cedar trees just as the air began toshimmer and the window appeared yet it was quite probable that his body would suffer too muchcombat damage to recover itself but that was of little importance the small wafer of silicon in his head was all that mattered getting that through the windowand sent back to the future in one piece was the onlyconsideration even if the best he could do was poke his head into the portal as it activatedleaving his headless corpse behind then that would satisfy his primary mission objective thegathered intelligence would be back with the field office precisely where it needed tobe bob stirred it was nearly time for him to make his move but something in his small organic mind urged him to reassess his mission priorities like asmall childs nagging voice a whimpering plea that travelled down thin internalwires dont leave him behind bobs head twitched uneasily as his ai attempted to deal with conflicting assertionsthere was an authoritative emotionless silicon reply to that childs voice mission objective gather and returninformation but there was so little information to relay so very little that theyd managedto gather bob could return to the field office alive or dead and they coulddownload from his head what hed seen and heard but the vast majority of this data wasjust smoke and gunfire there was little theyd learned that could be of use not enoughto fix on a precise point of origin for this time contamination more information was neededmuch more specifically knowledge of the events that had come before this invasion located here in he had a far better chance of uncoveringthe recent past than back in the altered world of his head convulsed anxiously his finger thumbed the safety catch with increasinglydistracted vigour mission parameters require reprioritization the unit was out of his comfort zone now his ai could deal with detailed and speedysituation analysis but decisionmaking was something far betterdealt with by a human mind his onboard memory recalled fosters words from a few daysago and thats the reason the agency sends a humanoperative back as well as the support unit a robot cant make intuitive judgementsliam not nearly as well as a human can the tiny nodule of wrinkled flesh in bobs skull the undeveloped brain understood this all too well it understood help was needed while the hardwired computer codecontinued to argue the case that mission orders were orders to be obeyed at all costs must find him recommendation update mission parameters bobs finger froze his body remained rigid utterly still his internal computerfocused now on one thing alone every microvolt of computing power devoted to one end reordering his mission priorities making a decision mission updated locate and rescue operative liamoconnor chapter new york foster and maddy watched the countdown on the computer screen thirtyseconds he announced maddy nodded she could see the display too and what if they miss this window aswell well deal with that when if itcomes to it maddy looked over her shoulder at the floor an area cleared of cables and detritus with thefaint circle of chalk inscribed in the middle where liam and bob were hopefully going to materialize very soon she was glad foster had sent sal out to sit in timessquare and observe if she was here shed be worrying interrupting agitatingdistracting foster already looked stressed enough as it was without having to constantlyassure her liam and bob were going to be fine and what if they came back liam wounded or worse better that sal was elsewhere right now since they missed the other backups she said something must havehappened to them right we dont know that for sure quite often ive missed a scheduled window ortwo on the missions ive been on said foster the unforeseen happens thats why we have several backups but if they do miss this one he looked at the display ten seconds if they miss this one then we need to communicate a new rendezvous point tothem she looked at him communicate how its complicated ill talk you through that later she let out a breath so its not the end of the world then i thoughtyou know i thought wed lost them forever foster checked the phase interruption indicator no sign of any shifting packets of densitywhere the extraction portal was due to open that was good the soldiers must have gone all right here we go he said the displacement machinery began to hum and the lights in the archway dimmed as all powerdiverted towards it then across the floor from them a large sphere suddenly began toshimmer and through the undulating air maddy thought she could make out the dancing twistingform of tree trunks come on liam whispered maddy move your butt foster swallowed anxiously yes get a move on if they were there they should step through immediately keeping a portal open unnecessarilywasnt wise a window on to chaotic dimensions in which anything could lurk the sooner it was closed the better come on he uttered impatiently the sphere hovered shimmered glowing a soft blue in the flickering dimness of the archwayfoster glanced at the computer screen the portal had been open ten seconds and a red cautionmessage had already begun flashing on the screen i have to close it said foster any longer and we risk attracting aseeker theyre not there no cried maddy let it stay open just a bit theyve failed the rendezvous snapped foster he hit the abort button onthe screen and instantly the sphere vanished the hum of surging powerdiminished and the dimmed flickering ceiling lights grew bright once more dammit foster they might just have been running a bit late theres no running late madelaine youreeither there or youre not the window opens and either they step through or theydont im afraid theres no leaving it open just to wait andsee they sat in silence for a moment staring out across the floor at the chalk circle as ifhoping both liam and bob might still magically appear liam with a guilty expression on hisface for their rather late arrival so ok its not the end of the world then said maddy forcingherself to be businesslike you mentioned something about sending a message foster nodded thats right we need to send them details on a newtimestamp and perhaps we need to pick another location not too far away from thefirst location but somewhere more discreet less busy i think would be better maddy pursed her lips and how exactly will they get this message tachyon transmission he replied ill give you the technicalexplanation later its complicated she shrugged i can wait chapter command ship above washington dc kramer dined alone he wasnt in the mood to celebrate the victory withreichsmarschall karl haas the senior divisional commanders and their aides several dayssince the surrender and despite a few minor skirmishes as several individual us states in thewest fought on bitterly america was now a part of the greater reich his high command was celebrating right now no doubt solemnly toasting their absentfuhrer in smart dress uniforms then sitting down together in the white housesstate hall to discuss the administrative business of running america he trusted karl to keepall those ambitious generals and gauleiters in line he suspected they feared him almost asmuch as they did their fuhrer no tonight he wanted to be alone things were troubling him that body that damned body the unsettling questions itraised despite what karl had said that was no corpse twisted by a mere incendiary grenadehed seen what a time portal could do to a human body once before hed neverforget the twisted flesh organs turned inside out and still somehow managing tofunction for a while someone from the futures after us he muttered to himself he could almost feel that someone probing thepast finding their way slowly towards him stalking him at any moment the air could shimmerbeside the table and an assassin appear a gun raised and ready to execute him it wassomething kramer constantly feared the recurring nightmare had troubled him almost everynight for the last fifteen years awakening in his bed in the dark stillness of nightto see an assassin leaning over him and announcing his immediate execution for travellingthrough time the body that body had made his nightmares athousandfold worse and now he spent every waking hour fearing what might be out there itwas a struggle to keep this torment from karl to keep his composure in front of the man hewondered sometimes if there was an easier way out a soft voice whispered quietly in his head there is a way out for you you know suicide no another way he looked out of the window at a dark city punctuated with sporadic smouldering fires andspeared with the sweeping searching floodlights coming from his command ship think on it his quiet voice the voice that was always there had always been with him as long as hecould remember the voice of ambition daring him on pushing him to do thosethings he wouldnt normally have the resolve to do as a child it had helped him achieveacademic success as a young man driven him to earn a doctorate in quantum physics to becomea research fellow at the waldstein institute it had given him the confidence to finally puttogether his audacious plan to go back into history and make it his you could destroy this world couldnt you paul after allits your world now all yours to do with as you wish thats madness he replied putting down his forksuddenly it clattered noisily on the plate filling his large stately quarters with adiminishing echo madness is it since going through time convincing hitler to accept him into his inner circle and finallybecoming the fuhrer himself the voice had become quiet unneeded by him like a childbrooding sulking but now since that body in fact it seemed to have found anew energy madness is it what would happen if a traveller from the future were toappear right here and put a bullet through your brain kramer closed his eyes the thought had him trembling the answer was obvious this historyhe had worked so hard to create would change and what if a traveller learned the exact time and place that youentered history those woods and killed you there before you met hitler the world would be as it was he replied aloud the future would onceagain be the dark and dying one we left behind thats right a dying world choking on toxic fumes the seaspoisoned people slowly starving in a way it would be kinder to end it now would itnot kinder kramer hadnt thought about the world theyd left behind in a long timeglobal warming had become an uncontrollable force by the icecaps had finally vanishedthe entire african continent was as sunblasted and lifeless as the surface of mars andpeople nine billion of them crowded into the few tolerable regions of the earth left mostof them starving migrants living in dustblown shanty towns outside the few megacities likealmost every other species on earth kramer wondered whether one day mankind would alsoeventually become extinct kinder he said eventually perhaps itwould much kinder he had no appetite for his meal now you trust me paul dont you hed always trusted his inner voice his instinct it had guided him far better in hislife than any tutor or mentor any fatherfigure or friend if you cant trustyour own instinct someone had once told him then youre a lostman dont you see someone or something is out there and it will findyou whatever you do however much you decide to erase history and disguise your tracks itwill eventually find you the body was a warning deep down he knew there was truth in that perhaps hed known that from the moment heand karl had been presented with that cruelly twisted corpse but hed been unable tobring himself to admit it i think you realize now your run of luck has finally come to anend fifteen years he said thats right fifteen years twelve of them as the worldsgreatest ruler and in that time youve achieved so very much but your time hasfinally run out someone has come to get you a time traveller possibly or worse worse youve meddled with time youve crossed dimensionsyouve stepped through chaos itself theres no knowing for sure what seeks youout kramer felt his guts twist with anxiety a churning unease eating away inside an agent of the future could take this world from you with anassassins bullet but it could be far worse something we can never hope tounderstand could come for you could be out there in that dark city rightnow he felt his scalp prickle his skin turn cold but you could prevent that by destroying this world yes paul by destroying this world he pushed his chair back oddly there was some growing comfort in that notion this worldrendered still silent lifeless and unchanging an everlasting monument to the world createdby paul kramer all life ended with a sudden flash instead of the protracted misery thatwould exist in the future and there was a way a doomsday device hed consideredin his idle moments we both knew this might happen one day didnt we perhaps it wasalways going to be your destiny kramer narrowed his eyes almost sensing the inevitable subtle shifting of destiny ahead ofhim future histories adjusting rewriting as he felt his decision being firmly made then it has to be so his voice his instinct seemed appeased by that a fitting end to things paul mankind was always destined to destroyitself its in our nature to destroy all that we create and you will be the one whodoes it isnt that just a little bit like being god chapter new york sal will be all right out there wont she asked maddy foster was scrolling through their history database shell be justfine theyd found her a plain darkblue tshirt and grey jeans they belonged to a member ofthe previous team and were large on her almost swamped her but she stood out far less thanshe did wearing her favourite emo clothes no one will notice a little girl he added shes just a harmlesschild maddy shuddered it looks so grim so grey and ordered outthere she had stepped out with sal briefly to get a glimpse of this alternate new york the citylooked tidy and drab the only colour amid the uniformly monotone towers was the stabs ofbright red from unfurled banners and pennants that dotted the city skyline foster nodded it is grim but for an innocent child just walking around perhapswalking home from school or an errand to a shop its probably a great deal safer rightnow than it would be otherwise what do you mean he looked up from the screens i dont imagine they have a crime problem hmmthis is a fascist state i think its a safe bet that muggersdont get away with a slapped wrist and a behaviour order in this version of newyork maddy nodded i guess not anyway back to business he said i suggest we pick a return windowwithin the vicinity of the white house not too far away but safely beyond any securityperimeter we need to see whether they have a map of washington in this new nazi version thecity may be different sections rebuilt ok so thats the where we need to now consider thewhen i have a suggestion for that we set it for the lastpossible time for their mission bobs maximum mission durati maddy felt it lightheaded as if she was losing her balance the screens went blank and a moment later the fizzing strip light above them winked outleaving them in pitch black what the that was a time shift fosters voice emerged from the dark beside hera big one i felt it as well weve lost power whispered maddy thats not good isit it means that whatever the world is like outside our fieldbubble were no longer able to tap electricity from it foster balledhis fists with frustration in fact the field generators down as well thatmeans theres no fortyeighthour flipback were well and truly stuck in this worlds timeline whatever it is im not sure i like the sound of that we should take a look he said quietly she heard his chair scrape on the concrete come on she stood up her hands spread out in front of her this way she followed his voice across the floor keep coming a moment later her fingers brushed the crumbling brick wall foster cursed under his breath i hate winching this wretched thing up ill give you a hand said maddy she felt her way along the wall untilher fingers brushed the winch box she found a space on the handle beside fosters frailold hand lets get to it then he said quietly they pulled on the handle and it creaked round the shutter door began to crank up slowly andnoisily a faint afternoon light eased into the room pushing back the absolute darkness behindthem looks like another grey day in manhattan laughed maddy skittishly the shutter inched up until it was waist height thatll do madelaine said foster duck down will you and takea look she nodded sure she stooped down and peered outside the backstreet was littered with rubble and twistedspars of rusted metal that looked like they had tumbled down from the bridge above many manyyears ago a tangle of coarse dry weeds emerged through it all and laid claim to the groundnature clawing its way back maddy slid under the shutter and stood up on the other side what do you see she glanced up at the bridge above them the one that had majestically crossed the hudsonriver only moments ago it was now little more than a creaking ruined web of rusted metalstretching across the river in the distance the tall slablike buildings ofthe nazimanhattan shed observed a short while ago as shed let sal out nowlooked like the crumbling stubs of rotten teeth bare skeletons of iron sprang from collapsedruins across the river the sun hung low and heavy like a bloodshot eye peeking throughscudding brown clouds that looked threatening and toxic new york was utterly dead an apocalyptic wasteland something dreadful had happened here it had happened decades ago from the look of the sparseand withered plant life that emerged here and there among the crumbling ruins my god foster its its the end of the world shesaid hearing her own voice catch falter and die in her throat the end of the world chapter new york sal was afraid very afraid she looked up at the dark silent blasted structures around her tall ruins that creaked andgroaned while skeins of dust chased like fleeting ghosts through them times square was no longer times square it was a tomb the crumbling relic of alongdead civilization she couldnt begin to imagine what must have happened thebreeze moaned through open windows a haunting cry like some tormented spirit warning her toleave now and not delay a moment longer she decided that was probably good advice and turned to head back to the field officewondering for a moment if the bridge and the archway beneath it their littlebackstreet was actually still there as she turned she saw something move the faintest flash of something pale flitting from one dark window to another just a bit of rubbish thats all she picked her way quickly across the rubble kicking stones that clacked and clatterednoisily in the silence again she thought she spotted another flash of movement from withinthe darkened bowels of one of the buildings a pale oval with two dark holes that studied her intently for the briefest momentthen disappeared into the gloomy interior im not alone she picked up her pace not wanting to run in case it encouraged whatever was inside to comeout after her in pursuit but too frightened to just walk she hummed a tune a stupid overcheerful plastic bollywood song from her mumschildhood one of those tunes you can never get out of your head once it gets in she clattered her way across times square her humming echoing off dark scorched and blastedwalls she was passing the rusting skeleton of a vehicle on to what had once been broadwaywhen a creature emerged several dozen yards in front of her it stopped and stared at her with deep dark soulless eyes set in a pallid ashgrey baldhead she stopped humming it reminded her of a creature shed once seen in an old movie from way back a moviewith elves and dwarves and magical rings one of the creatures she remembered in particularthough was called gollum the thing standing in front of herreminded her of that it stared at her motionless its mouth finally opened to reveal bloodygums and one or two ragged teeth and it screamed the scream echoed off the tall ruins and was soon joined by other shrill voices joiningin sal looked desperately around and saw other pale oval faces each with dark eyes andtoothless bleeding mouths emerging from hundreds of windows like termites stirring from adisturbed nest and she screamed along with them foster joined maddy outside surveying the broken and blasted citycomplete devastation he whispered something happened here a long timeago and if it happened here i can well imagine its happenedeverywhere he looked at maddy perhaps some sort of a nuclear war she nodded oh god what is it with mankind never happy unless its blowingsomeone up im afraid thats us as a species isnt it just she mused sometimes she felt disgusted tobe human sals out there said foster quietly she looked at him shell be terrified and she may have difficulty finding herway back thats a very differentlooking landscape out there ill just grab some things he said ducking back under the shutter a few minutes later he emerged from beneath the shutter door with a couple of flashlights abottle of water and a shotgun in the crook of his arm her eyes widened at the sight of it you think were going to needit best to be prepared eh she swallowed nervously then nodded ok lets go find her chapter new york sal was running as fast as she could amid the rubble and blocks of crumblingmasonry long ago collapsed across forgotten streets she kept stumbling losing her footingbarking her shins scraping and cutting her hands behind her the creatures there seemed to be dozens now kept pace with hereasily there was surprising agility in those frail and pallid bodies they were small likeundernourished children but with faces that were lined with age or grief theyfollowed her keeping a wary distance not closing not falling behind just intenselycurious for now she glanced up at the street ahead little more than an undulating bed of shattered blocks ofconcrete and protruding spars of rusted metal the frames of buildings either side were theonly visual clue that this had once been a street if this was broadway once then she knew she needed to turn left at some point lefton to east th street that would take her east towards the river and the williamsburgbridge if its still standing another glance over her shoulder and she saw one of them had closed the distance between themand was right behind her a long pale hand reaching out ahead of it its bald head cocked toone side eyes curiously regarding her long black hair oh god she screamed leave me alone she suddenly stopped dead in her tracks and spun round to face it the creature drew up short of her the others coming to a halt behind it they fanned outeither side all of them studying her silently with eyes wide a burning curiosity written onall of their faces sal reached down for a length of rusty metal piping lifting it up flakes of rust crumbledaway she wasnt entirely sure the thing wouldnt crumble to dust the first timeshe swung it at something but all the same it felt good in her hand stay back she snarled her voice shrill and high the creature closest to her stayed its distance standing low crouching almost like aprimate the silence was filled with her ragged breath and the mournful wind she had time tolook at it more closely a pair of expressive eyes clearly a human but it seemed such a pitifullooking human ifshe wasnt so terrified she could almost imagine feeling sorry for it the creature nearest her took a careful measured step forward extending one hand towardsher no you stay back she barked brandishing the crumbling pipe she heard the thing whine a keening sound like some pitiful dog behind bars in a rescuecompound the pale skin stretched across lean arms and legs stretched across ribs anda pelvic bone that protruded unpleasantly was so ghostly white it was almosttranslucent she could see the faint lines of violet arteries beneath its mouth eyes andnose oozed a bloody mucus the thing wanted desperately to come closer to her the hand stretching further forwardwanting to make contact no ill hit you she screamed again it cocked its head again the almost completely toothless mouth opened and closed with a wetsnapping sound oh ahhhiiitttttoooooo it uttered it was attempting to mimic her you you you can speak she managed in response ooo ooo oooannngzbikkkkk it gargled she noticed something in its face intelligence perhaps a longfaded memory stirring behindthose milky boiledfish eyes this thing was human or at least it had once been human shewas sure of that my my nname is sal she said loudly for the benefit of the othersbehind it gesturing at herself when she had introduced herself for the first time to bob hehad cocked his head curiously his lips trying crudely to repeat her name these creatures onthe other hand cowered at the sound of her voice their dead eyes seemed less curious thanbobs they mewled and whined among themselves is that their language the whining noise sal she said again encouraged that her talking seemed to be holding them atbay for the moment im sal annngaahhhh thats right she smiled sal the hand still reaching towards her was now only a few inches away she wondered whether toswing her pipe at it or let it touch her there was no way of knowing whether these thingswanted to communicate in some way or were just attempting to test how much of a threat sheposed to them if i hit it then she suspected some kind of pack instinct would take over theyd be upon her inthe blink of an eye let it touch let it make contact she swallowed nervously as the tips of its fingers eagerly stretched outand brushed lightly against her hair hair she said the fingers curled through the strands flicked at them played with them its hair she said again softening her voice trying to steal the fearfrom it the things mouth seemed to widen stretch exposing a few snaggled teeth emerging frombloody gums my god is that a smile a soft singsong humming vibrated up from the creaturesnarrow bony chest into its throat it became an almost childlike cooing like the contentednoise of a baby suckling a bottle sal found her hand stretching out towards it copying the gesture showing the same curiosityseemed like the right thing to do her hand brushed against the things forearm sheexpected it to be cold and clammy but it was warm and dry just like any humansskin should be and she returned the smile pleased pleased to meet you she said eeeeee eeeeeoooeeeeeoooo it was then she heard the clatter of rubble disturbed behind her you should keep very still it was maddys voice not a shout but a coarse whisper echoing across thestillness no sudden moves ok that was fosters voice keep your eyes onthat thing sal do not look away do you understand she nodded all right sal you should take a slow step back now she wanted to look back over her shoulder to see where her friends were how far away theywere dont hissed foster keep your eyes on it asyou back off wwhy she managed to whisper just do it she did as instructed taking one careful step at a time feeling her way across the unevenground with her feet keeping her eyes locked on the thing in front of her the gollum frowned the humming quickly became a frustrated growl as it shuffled forwardreaching again for her hair its its not going to let me ggo uttered salouch its got hold of my hair again just keep coming sal dont stop said maddy she sounded a littlebit closer the creature was holding tight to a lock of her hair winding its clawlike fingers throughit to get a better hold and then she saw something in its face innocent curiosity vanishingreplaced by some dark instinct it opened its mouth and let out a cry that almost soundedhuman but certainly didnt resemble anything like a language the other creatures suddenly surged forward oh no cried maddy there was the deafening blast of a gunshot the creature holding her hair was suddenly hurledon its back spattering dark blood across the rubble sal quick she turned and saw maddy and foster ten yards beyond a blue veil of gunsmoke clearing asfoster pumped another round into the gun she scrambled on all fours towards them clatteringnoisily over a mound of loose bricks and masonry expecting at any moment to feel claws in herhair again yanking her off her feet from behind instead a moment later she was stumblinginto maddys open arms oh god sal are you all right she was too frightened to answer run she whispered we wwe should run maddy stood her ground held her tight its ok sal its oklook sal turned to look over her shoulder to find the creatures had gone every last one of themexcept for the twitching corpse in front of her had simply vanished within the space ofa few heartbeats as if theyd never been anything more than mere wisps of smokecarried off by a gusting wind the noise of the gun scared them off said foster maddy looked anxiously around at the dark husks of ruined buildings on either side of themtheyre hiding in there we should head back while theyre stillspooked foster nodded and waved them past come on the girls stepped around him quickly and backed away foster followed his shotgun stillshouldered and ready to fire chapter new jersey feldwebel johan kernst rubbed his hands to warm them as he watched the distanttruck approaching the east entrance to the prison camp gefangenenlager from this distanceit seemed to be approaching them far too quickly wake up lads he barked at the men manning the barricade he shielded his eyes from the glare of the sun on the snowcovered fields either side of therutted gravel track he sensed something wasnt quite right ready the m he snapped two of the guards shouldered their carbines and manned the heavycalibre sentry gun four highvelocity barrels that could chew up an unarmoured vehicle in a matter of secondsmounted on a sturdy tripod and sandbagged for stability the truck was still showing no sign of reducing speed as it rolled down twin ruts in theroad splashing fans of slushy mud up on to the banks of snow on either side kernst took several steps forward in front of the vehicle barrier and waved his armsindicating to the driver that he should slow down stop and have some papers ready to showthat or risk being fired upon he cursed under his breath as he heard the rumble of the trucks engine increasing inpitch hes speeding up the german sergeant stepped out of the muddy ruts in the middle of the roadto one side and nodded at his men to fire a short warning burst the m buzzed for a secondspewing a small cascade of steaming shell casings on to the ground divots of slush and muddanced into the air several dozen yards in front of the closing vehicle but it showed no sign of slowing down kernst shook his head the stupid fool driving that vehicle was no doubt some hotheadedamerican kid trying to break in and rescue a relative a loved one well the fool was aboutto die as the truck closed the remaining distance only fifty yards away now and picking up furtherspeed kernst nodded to his men once more they levelled the ms thick barrels at thetruck itself aiming at the windscreen and fired the windscreen exploded the metal grating at the front of the truck began disintegratingamid showers of sparks but momentum was still carrying the heavy fourton vehiclerelentlessly forward kernst found himself diving out of the way at the very last moment into a deep bank of snowas it cannoned past him careering into the m gun emplacement and through the barrierbeyond the vehicle flipped over on to its side and slewed on another ten yards pulling downa good fiftyyard stretch of chainlink perimeter fencing as it ground to a halt on thesnowcovered courtyard in front of the first row of the prison camps huts kernst pulled himself out of the waisthigh snow bank and unslung his carbine he cautiouslyapproached the vehicle now utterly still except for a solitary wheel still spinningand a plume of smoke and steam issuing from the jagged and twisted remains of thetrucks front grille the driversside door suddenly burst open and a man emerged pullinghimself out and dropping off the side of the cab on to the ground with surprising speed andagility kernst fired a dozen rounds at the man most of them missed but hed swear later onin the afternoon when asked to recall what he claimed to have witnessed at least a couple ofhis shots hit the target square in the chest the man was large muscular and apparently utterly fearless he didnt go downscreaming and clutching at his wounds instead his head calmly swivelled round and spottedkernst he brought up both his arms each hand holding a heavy pulse carbine and fired the german found himself head first in the snow bank again as a hail of bullets zipped overmere inches above him kernst decided he was probably best staying right where he was fornow the muscular man strode across the open space eyes scanning the long squat woodenhuts in front of him a moment later doors began creaking open from within the darkinteriors faces peered out dozens of them scanning his eyes locked on each face one after another for a microsecond nothing no liam oconnor bob strode towards the nearest hut just as an alarm went off across the camp the shrillsound of orders being barked in german echoed in the air he kicked in the nearest door and pushed his way into the dark interior his eyes adjustinginstantly to the gloom inside scanning none of the pale and frightened faces within were that of his missionoperative have hhave you come to ffree us a frail voice cried out from amongthe shivering cluster of prisoners bob cocked his head thoughtfully negative pplease hhelp us help us tactical assessment bob could see that the confusion of escaping prisoners would help him rather than hinder himstanding out there alone if he attracted too much fire took too many hits his geneticallyenhanced body would struggle to repair the damage done even though he was an artificial human he was still just blood bones and organs it was abody that could be killed with hundreds of people fleeing in all directions the guards would be confused their firewould be divided turned on the fleeing prisoners as well as him bob looked down at them you are free to leave he uttered in a monotonevoice fiftyfour huts bob proceeded to each one in turn ushering out those brave enough to make arun for the flattened section of perimeter fencing his eyes quickly and systematicallyscanned the faces of the prisoners huddled inside outside the camp courtyard was thick with chaos people scrambling towards the downed fencethe snow scuffed and flattened with footprints and stained pink with blood the air was fullof screams and crying the percussive rattle of shots gunning prisoners down barked ordersvengeful shouts he observed half a dozen guards taken by surprise overrun beaten and then shot as theypleaded for mercy bob himself had casually tallied thirtysix kills by his own hand anumber that would be taken into account when his silicon mind later evaluated his missionperformance as he followed the fleeing crowd of people out of the camp his eyesmomentarily logging each face and coming up with a negative a small lean man jogged acrossthe snow to join him hey you bob turned to look at him yeah you big guy a gun rattled in the distance and several rounds zipped by his head bob swung his carbineround levelled the weapon and fired a short burst in one swift reactive movement fifty yardsaway a guard doubled over amid several puffs of crimson the small mans jaw dropped open revealing a mouthful of tobaccoyellow teeth jeeeez man now that that was some shot bob continued quickly striding towards the downed fence information the standardaccuracy of this firearm is effective at up to one hundred yards he explainedcrisply the man shrugged yeah well sure but you just kinda swung that thing upan just fired without even aiming this tactical situation is hazardous reinforcements will be deployed heresoon bob announced stepping across the twisted and crumpled remains of the chainlinkfence you must leave the vicinity immediately no kidding replied the man those guys are going to be mighty annoyedwhen they arrive i sure aint stickin around for that bob was already over the fence and jogging across the snowy field beyond the small mancaught up with him again panting already as he struggled to keep pace with him hey my names panelli raymond panelli he gasped but i let myfriends call me ray cause its ow he stumbled on a rock buriedbeneath the snow cursing as he hopped and cradled his foot for a momentbefore struggling to catch up again with bob so so what about you he wheezed whats yourname my name is bob bob bob that it they jogged in silence across the field for a while heading towards the cover of a treelinepanelli was rasping like an asthmatic old man beside him so bob bob continued in silence eyes scanning the faces of other prisoners streaming across thesnowy field inside his skull the computer was busy assessing his missions performancescore evaluating the tactical situation meanwhile his body was already hard at work dealingwith five gunshot wounds sustained during the raid congealing the blood around the woundswhite blood cells already coalescing to combat any infection hey bob the small man running beside him was becoming a useless distraction bob turned to look downat him what do you want uh mind if i sort of team up with you for now you kicked some butt backthere i mean really stuck it to them guys it was justamazing panelli shrugged so i figure youre a good guy to have as afriend bob evaluated the small man he could provide assistance in some way as you wish he replied flatly chapter new york thursdayfriday i dont know three days now i think its three its hard to tell thetins of food in the cupboard are running out and well be going hungry soon foster and maddy went out there a few times looking for supplies theyve not foundanything so far just ruins and bones and those creatures outside we now know theyre cannibals foster found the leftovers of one of their own kind half eaten and nearby the bonesof loads of others those things seem to exist in small tribes feeding off each other wheni think now how close i came to being taken that creature running its hand through myhair mustve been sizing me up working out if i could be eaten i dont want to die like that id rather anything else i keep expecting tohear them at any moment outside the garage door scratching at it trying to find a wayin ive never been so jahullychuddah scared in my life i i dont want to go out there again whispered salnever never again foster could see the terror in the poor girls eyes by the gutteringglow of the candle on the table between them the rest of the arch was lost in thedarkness we have to he said firmly but but those things those things had once been human beings but something had happened he suspected some sortof a nuclear war there was plenty of blast damage scorched walls and debris suggesting amoment of intense heat decades of radiation sickness would account for their pitifulcondition anaemic complexion the running sores toothless mouths fosters right said maddy we cant hide in hereforever but they those things are cannibals yes we know exactly what they are maddy snapped perhaps we might be able to communicate with them said foster if somesort of nuclear war happened in and were in then those creatures will be thegrandchildren of the few that survived postapocalypse childrenwhove only ever known ruins and rubble its possible the eldest of them mightjust remember some language youre kidding right said maddy they dribble they donttalk they see us as a freerange meal perhaps shes right those things would probably kill thembefore he could find a way to communicate with them he sighed all right well weve wasted enough time i was hoping anothertime ripple would arrive perhaps one that would improve our situation but it looks like thisis what were stuck with so weve no choice we need to find some way to generatepower enough to reboot our computer system and enough if we can to open a window andpull back liam and bob maddy frowned sounds like were gonna need a lot of power even if we only have enough to pull oneof them back we might learn exactly where and when the timeline was changed she pulled her glasses off her face and wiped the scuffed lenses but then wedalso need enough power to send them back to that point in time to fix it right yes foster managed a grim smile but look well worry aboutthat when we get to it one thing at a time oh jahulla were soooo doomed whispered sal no were not he replied sternly if theres one thingive learned over the long years ive been here working for the agency itsthat everything is fluid nothing is fixed we can we will we must change itall back do you understand failure is not an option both girls stared at him silently nobodys going to do that for us its down to us if we just sit safelyin here until we starve to death well then thats it that world outside ourshutter doors is what will remain forever more he let those words hang above the table their three faces caught in the flickering glow ofthe candle still and impassive so we have a generator in the back room where the clone tubes are we need tofind some diesel fuel for it why dont we have stores of diesel asked maddy whats thepoint of having a backup generator if theres no fuel to run it foster shook his head we used to maintain a store of diesel fuel buttheres something about the energy of our field offices time bubble that corruptsit at a chemical level meaning meaning the diesel degrades the fuel we have in the back room is useless we need toget out there and find some more he was silent for a moment listening to the haunting wind outside their shutter door moaningsoftly it was sal who broke the silence then i i guess wedbetter get off our butts and start looking maddy nodded yeah weve got your gun those creatures will keep theirdistance out there in new york somewhere maybe in someones basement in astoreroom theres got to be some diesel fuel maddy nodded right sal pursed her lips pensively then eventually nodded too lets doit foster reached out for their hands grasping them tightly he smiled proudly at themyou know ive got a feeling you two and liam are one day going to turn out tobe a formidable team the agencys best yet the girls both managed a brave grin chapter prison camp new jersey liam tugged the coarse grey blanket tightly around himself trying to seal in whatlittle warmth his body had managed to generate he was beginning to lose track of how manyweeks hed been there he wasnt sure whether it was four or five months now had to be about that his eyes drifted across hundreds no thousands of other people wrapped insimilar grey blankets and gazing out listlessly through the chainlink fences at the barrenwinter countryside around the prison camp look its just hard to accept to believe said wallace standingnext to him hed been quiet for a while cupping his hands and blowing on them as hethought things through i mean yeah i saw your friend bob take lord knows how many bullet wounds back there at the white house and hejust kind of shrugged it all off i cant say i ever sawanything like that so then you do believe me wallaces jaw was dark with a thatch of unshaven bristles he scratched his chinirritably youre really asking me to believe youre from thefuture yes liam shrugged well actually im from but he offered a tired smile yes i came here from the future and you say you came back to today to to fix history sothat the germans actually lost the second world war yes to correct history wallace shook his head and laughed a plume of his breath billowed out and quickly dissipatedamid the cool morning air thats completely insane listen im tellin you them nazis nevereven came close to losing that war they took poland belgium france britain the restof mainland europe in the space of just two years theres no way on earth they couldhave lost the war no way liam shrugged well where i came from they did thats what i was told andthey lost badly their leader the hitler fella is supposed to have made some pretty big mistakes like starting afight with russia at the same time as he was fighting the wallace scratched at his chin again well the old guy adolf was pretty nutsthat much is true thats why there was a change at the top in thatswhen kramer took command of germany liam turned to wallace tell me more about hitler and this other fella kramer i needto know more see all of these things happened forty years afteri died and im doing my best to catch up and make sense of it all died oh yeah you say you were on the titanicright added wallace sceptically yes on that bleedin supposedly unsinkable hunk of metal wallace snorted youre serious arent you liam sighed just tell me about them would you hitler and kramer the man sucked in a deep breath adolf hitler was the leader of the nazi party they came to power ingermany in because the country was bankrupt and broken and hitler promised the people hecould fix things for them and for a while he did too he got that country going again andhis people loved him for it but then he started going a little crazy in the head madwith the power i suppose he had his country build up their armed forces and then it wasinevitable in they invaded poland that started the second world war second world war so there really was a first one the first world war yeah of course you want me to wind back and tell you all aboutthat too it happened not long after you say you uh died liam shook his head no this is confusing enough for me already just carry onwith hitler and kramer ok so the second world war started the germans took poland belgium france theykicked the british army out of france at a place called dunkirk and then they spent a yearjust digging their heels in and building up their defences over here in america althoughpresident roosevelt wanted to enter the war congress and the senate stopped him and kept usout if it which back then i think most americans thought was a pretty smart idea wefigured it was a european problem not ours so wallace continued there were rumours that hitler had plans toinvade russia next he was certainly preparing something i saw intelligence reports coming infor the president that the germans were massing tanks and infantry in the east then all of asudden its like hitler had a complete change of heart what do you mean i mean he decided not to invade russia in the earlysummer of the germans and russians out of the blue signed a peace treaty and that wasthe very same year that paul kramer came to public attention as hitlers deputy thatwas an incredible and very sudden change of heart because it was well knownthat hitler despised the russians stalin communists we all thought they were the next onhis hit list do you think it was kramer who changed his mind wallace nodded yes yes absolutely i think kramer had hitlers completeattention from the very first moment they met he became his closest adviser his deputy andthen three years later that sly dog kramer kicked that crazy old lunatic hitler out ofpower liam looked at wallace see where ive come from the future the storyi was told is different this hitler fella stayed in power and he went and lost that world war died in a bunker if i recall correctly took hisown life i think no mention of a kramer wallace looked at him incredulously and youre saying in your history bookstheres no paul kramer liam nodded as far as i know wallace stared at him struggling to believe such craziness good god if only thatwere so he replied shaking his head the world has watched that man with batedbreath hes never put a foot wrong hes a genius and a madman wevewatched his empire grow stronger and stronger his military technology become so much betterthan ours an everincreasing threat to america over the last fifteen years wallace puffed air into his cold hands but we thought we hoped hed leave us alone over here there was a hope that kramer wasfinally ready to sign a truce between the greater reich and america that the cold war betweenus was over wallace sighed turns out we were fooled liam watched a couple of armed guards patrol the outside of the perimeter fence nearby theirblack uniforms and deathshead insignia covered by thick winter capes kramer is it him is he from the future liam shivered inside his blanket listen its just possible this kramer issomeone like me another time traveller wallace laughed look your story is getting too farfetched kid even forme oh im quite serious wallace made a face back there in the white house i thought you and your buddy weremaybe secret service guys that maybe there was something special or secret about you two now he shook his head now im sorry im justthinking youre some crazy kid with a little too much imagination im telling you time travel is possible then you know what why dont you go make a time machine and kill kramer all byyourself wallace scoffed he looked like hed finally had enough of liamscrazy story liam sighed im just a dumb ships steward or at least i was anywayeven if i had the brains to actually make a time machine id need to know where andwhen to go to the very first moment kramer entered your history wallace shook his head well everyone knows that except you isuppose uh what do you mean theres an account of hitlers very first encounter with him itsin hitlers second autobiography mein sieg my victory the one he published in just before kramer oustedhim go on it was april its a wellknown encounter he describes kramer as amessenger from god an angel divine intervention he called it in his book he tells howkramer arrived in the dark of a wintry night at the notorious eagles nest the night ofthe fifteenth of april if my memory serves me well liam felt his heart pounding oh my that could be it the time and place weshould have gone to wallace turned to go then stopped his gaunt face smiled teeth showing through his darkbeard i guess id like to believe in your story kid that theres abetter history out there somewhere there is he laughed puffing a cloud of breath before him well let me know when you find iteh liam watched the man turn and go feet crunching across the snow huddled in his own greyblanket a bleak figure as wallace merged with the other prisoners huddling for warmthliams mind turned to a possibility a ray of hope if he could only get thatinformation to foster and maddy that particular place and date perhaps theyd also stumbled across this information somehow this supposedinspirational meeting of kramer and hitler perhaps bob had made it back through the scheduledportal and right now he and foster were on their way back to put things right back to tofind this kramer and to kill him it was a hope wasnt it something for him to hang on to chapter command ship above washington dc karl haas smartly saluted the two ss leibstandarte standing guard either side ofthe doors to the fuhrers observation deck they snapped crisply to attention andthen swung open the double doors for him he proceeded down the oakpanelled passageway towards the second inner doors leading on tokramers extravagantly decorated quarters the heels of his black leather jackboots nolonger clacking noisily on metal plating but softly thudding against the luxuriously thickcarpet what is wrong with paul karl was becoming concerned with his leader in the last couple of months since their finalassault on washington and the taking of the white house kramer had become very distracted itwas becoming increasingly difficult to convince him to attend the weekly situation briefingswith the regional gauleiters and invasion fleets senior commanders and when he didturn up he appeared not to be listening it was even getting harder for karl to see his old friend alone with increasing regularityit seemed kramer insisted he was far too busy to see anyone what is wrong with him surely not that body the worst it could possibly mean is that some future agent had tried andfailed to get to kramer a failed assassination attempt nothing more and the rest of the news was all good back home in europe the people of greater germany wereecstatic with the newsreels they were watching in their cinemas footage of their invasionforces marching proudly through the streets of new york washington boston some of that goodcheer was evident even among the provinces of britain and france who despite beingconquered over a decade ago had come to realize the fuhrer was a good man intent onuniting all people not enslaving them the announcement of unity day a day to celebrate the end of war and a uniting of the westernnations had been met with rapturous approval by the citizens of the greater reich karl wascertain future unity days would be celebrated with street parties everywhere people in everycity in every country of kramers empire happy to draw a line under two thousand yearsof bloody history wars crusades religious intolerance inquisitions torture ethniccleansing holocausts all of those dark things in the past now he rapped his knuckles against the thick wooden doors waiting until he heard kramer beckonhim in he pushed them open stepped inside and saluted his leader kramer was sitting in the window alcove looking down at a misty morning he could just makeout the dome at the top of the white house poking through the pale blanket coveringwashington the orange glow of street lamps along pennsylvania avenue and the pinprickheadlights of slowmoving cars making their way sluggishly to work presently he turned to look at karl and offered him a warm smile good morning karlhow are you karl relaxed his posture dropping his stiff salute and stepping towards his leader hisfriend im well kramer shook his head its amazing how quickly normalityreturns isnt it out there people go to work go to school visit theirfriends their loved ones just as they always have they have a new leader a new flagbut life simply goes on for them yes paul the american people it seems continued kramer have already acceptedthe way of things karl stirred uncomfortably except of course those troublesome peopleattacking the prison camps so said kramer shall we get on with this mornings briefing ihave other matters to attend to of course i have the usual stack of papers for you to sign most of them areapprovals for regional state governors sympathetic politicians mostly karlleaned over and placed the papers on the desk kramer got up from the window seat and sat downat the desk flicking wearily through the forms and signing them absentmindedly so much paperwork these days he sighed the remaining us military forces regrouped in texas have agreed informal terms forsurrender i believe its general macarthur whos in charge there good good silly their fighting on needlessly hes hoping that well grant clemency for the senior officers allow themto return to their families kramer continued scribbling his name as he talked to be honest its the seniorofficers i dont trust tell macarthur his troops will be disarmed and allowed todisband to go home but im afraid he and his high command will be interned along withall our other political prisoners uttered kramer leafing impatiently through thepapers until that is im satisfied they wont be tempted to lead anytroublesome uprisings karl shuffled uncomfortably on that subject we are having afew problems in the washington area hmm raids some insurgents attacking our prison camps kramer looked up at him his pen poised five camps have been raided so far karl continued the garrisons wereoverpowered and quite a few detainees managed to escape on each occasion i presume these insurgents are some rogue us army unit how many of them are wetalking about well theres some confusion there sir said karl awkwardlyeyewitness reports on the earlier raids indicated a very small raidingparty how small well actually just one man what clearly it cant be just one man that would bemadness but among some of the prisoners that weve managed to recapture theres aspreading rumour that some sort of of a superman hascome to their aid they describe a large figure off which bullets bounce a superman karl smiled clearly its wishful thinking a fantasy the americans have alwaysliked their comicbooks their heroic figures in silly costumes its not unreasonablethat their hopes and prayers have taken the form of this kind of mythical figure karl was unsettled by the sudden look of distraction on his fuhrers face as ifhalf his attention was elsewhere listening to a faintly heard tune or a conversation comingfrom the room next door in all likelihood sir the insurgents may well be a small group of welltrainedsoldiers us marines us airborne highly motivated and well equippedand so far theyve just managed to be very lucky kramer nodded yes yes perhaps youre right nonetheless sir i suggest it would be wise to double the garrison strengths on theother camps in the region too many successful raids like these might just encourage otherinsurgents to join in kramer was silent his face clouded his brows locked in a frown of concentration as if hewas trying to listen to someone else karl noticed hed not shaved this morning a faintblur of silvergrey bristles on his chin and he spotted the slightest sporadic tremble in themans jaw small things that only a close friend would notice small things that worried him hes having some kind of a breakdown paul are you all right yes yes of course said kramer absently his gaze returned from whereit had been and focused back on to karl take what action you think is necessary withthese raids kramer hastily scribbled his signature on the last few sheets of paper handed them back andoffered him a flickering smile thank you karl you may leave now yes sir he offered a clipped salute turned on his heel and departed the observation lounge kramer waited until he heard the footsteps recede down the hallway outside to work to work he agreed stepping quickly across the polished floor towards hisstudy door he turned the brass handle and stepped through into his sanctum sanctorum booklined walls several leather armchairs anda work table littered with drafting materials it was very much a replica of his private studyback in the reich chancellery in berlin a place to think to tinker with his weapons designsto ruminate on empirewide policy from his desk drawer he pulled out a little black notebook the corners curled and scuffedthe pages of handwritten notes beginning to yellow with the years now a precious book ofthoughts and ideas theories and secrets his younger handwriting so scribbled andimpatient in the year hed been barely twenty years of age and such a devout fan of themysterious inventor roald waldstein his reputation as an elusive genius the one and only manto mathematically formulate a displacement field that could fold a gap through spacetime theonly man to have actually tested the theory with a workingprototype an honorary director of the international institute of quantum research and theamerican museum of natural history a wealthy entrepreneur a scientific adviser topresidents a complete enigma kramers hard work and promising talent had earned him an internship atwaldsteins prestigious new jersey research centre several months in the company of thegreat old man himself waldstein liked to be in the company of keen young minds hedtaken warmly to kramer the other keen young minds jealous fellow interns suggested thatpaul kramer reminded the sentimental old man of the son hed lost many years before kramer smiled at the pleasant memories those weeks with that great mind earning hisconfidence listening to his theories about how the unseen dimensions of the metaverse heldeverything together in a way beyond the comprehension of most human minds struggling to keepup with him yet understanding just enough parts of it fittedtogether in his young head the old mans overriding passion though what kept him awake lateat nights and fired him up with a preachers zeal was to bury the technology he alonehad pioneered the potential for time travel to ensure absolutely no one followed in his footsteps for kramer it had been frustrating to bediscussing with this great man his most advanced theoretical work and then for waldstein tosuddenly grow cautious on the subject of displacement theory an old man he must have been about sixty then but he seemed so much older and frailer thanthat with hands that shook and trembled constantly and watery eyes that always seemed todart towards dark corners and his bizarre rituals every morning after breakfastkramer watched him shuffle towards a curious sheet of yellowing newsprint framed behind glassand hung on his wall waldstein stared at it for several minutes every day with eyes thatleaked tears down his sunken cheeks kramer had glanced at it once nothing more than a page of personal ads from some oldnewspaper lonely men seeking lonely women waldstein was losing his mind and in the quiet moments sitting with young kramerbeside the warming fire he let slip perhaps a little too much old enough and perhapstrusting enough of kramer to let him know a little more than he should have kramer fingered his tatty old notebook now pages of mathematical characters and equationsthe parts of the old mans puzzle that hed carelessly let go interspersed withpages and pages of angrily crossedout formulae that kramer himself had worked on over theyears pieces of equation that hed tried to squeeze into the spaces to make right with waldsteins elegant work and that alwaysseemed to not quite fit he smiled at the notes scrawled across the draftsmans sheet on the desk it fits together now though paul doesnt it some of it did the waldstein displacement field it had taken kramer fifteen years on and off thinking the problem over in his privatemoments a personal hobby an affliction perhaps the field the waldstein field in theory on paper was merely a method tocrack open the tiniest gap in spacetime that alone didnt make a time machine just away to open a peekhole into the very fabric of spacetime kramer needed computing power athis fingertips to make a time machine computing power to precisely navigate through theswirling chaos of a dimension that mankind had no business entering there were no apple macshere in no pcs no palmtops or organizers that could be cannibalized adapted the schematic sketched out on the sheet of paper in front of him was for a device he couldconstruct merely allowing him to open a tiny window and tap infinite energy from the swirlingchaos beyond thered been something waldstein had once said to him to open timespace is toopen a door into hell itself youve been through that door before yes he uttered softly stepped into hell his voice trembledwith a mixture of fear and excitement waldstein had also once said something to a muchyounger kramer something that had unsettled him back then and did so now consider this paul if a man can place a foot in hellthen whatever exists there might just as easily use the same door and place a foot in ourworld those words tormented him now because he realized it was something far worse than some agentfrom the future after him something far more frightening you must hurry paul before it seeks you out to work said kramer pushing a forgotten plate of food aside on his desk chapter new jersey bob studied the map in front of him a dozen crosses scrawled on the map indicatedthe locations of other prison camps between washington dc and new york simple logic dictatedthat liam oconnor had to have been taken to one of these so far nine of these scrawledcrosses had been paid a visit nine prison camps broken into searched and left behind in astate of chaos prisoners surging out the way hed smashed in buildings on fire thebodies of guards and unfortunate civilians littering the ground and so far hed been unlucky nine camps no sign of liam mission evaluation success probability reduced to the camps were becoming harder to break into there seemed to be more guards stationed ateach now and they were more alert ready and waiting to be attacked after the lastraid bob had walked away with at least a dozen bullet wounds across his body it had takenfive days for the wounds to heal five days of lying still devoting all of his bodysenergy towards the process of recovering the small man who had decided to tag along with him raymond panelli had watched over himtaken care of him as he lay motionless in a state akin to suspended animation healing bobwondered why raymond panelli would care to do that for that matter he wondered why a growingband of humans was following him around from camp to camp with each of hisraids he seemed to be picking up more and more of them tactically speaking they were ofcourse useful they drew some of the enemy fire from him his stomach rumbled noisily and bobs computer brain reminded him that it was time torefuel his body with some protein the food being served up by his growing band of campfollowers a variety of stews broths and soups wasnt as nutrientrichas the highly efficient protein solution he was used to consuming back in the fieldoffices birthing tubes but it would do as a stopgap he folded the map carefully and emerged from his tent stepping through the briar andundergrowth stooping beneath the lowhanging branches as he made his way towards thecampfire as he approached one of his followers hurried over to him with a steaming bowl of soup for you captain bob sir bob took the bowl and stepped towards the fire finding a space on the ground amid the silentcrowd of men they followed his every movement with wide eyes he sat down heavilycrosslegged stared at the flickering fire and began mechanically spooning soup into hismouth the human called raymond panelli leaned forward captain bob weve gotourselves another bunch of fighters for the cause joined us just this evening bob stopped midspoon and looked up from the fire at him these guys right here said panelli pointing out some men clustered near thefire they stared in awed silence clearly wondering what to make of the large muscularsuperhero in front of them bobs eyes panned across them one to another he identified tattered us army uniformson seven of them they looked physically fit and by and large of optimumcombat age more bodies for the enemy guards fire to be distracted by more bodies forthem to aim at and fewer shots directed specifically at him mission evaluation success probability increase bob nodded that is good with more men probability of mission successincreases a softly taken gasp rippled around the campfire at the timbre of his deep rumbling voice acommanding sound one of the men a young corporal turned to panelli can can i ask him askcaptain bob a question panelli gave it some thought then nodded reluctantly just one ok the hero needshis rest needs to be thinking about our raid tomorrow the young man swallowed nervously excuse me ssir bobs steelgrey eyes slowly swivelled towards him words been spreadin across the state youre some kindasuperman can be shot over and over an never die bob stared at him silently his face devoid of any emotion or reaction the young mans lips twitched anxiously im im a ibelieve in the good lord and well thats great son said panelli but the captains gotbetter things to do than listen to your biblethumping i gotta ask you captain bob the young corporal interrupted did godsend you to save us sir bobs silicon mind momentarily suspended work on an array of mission assessmentcalculations to deal with the curious question posed by the young man his computer offered alist of the most appropriate replies to the question the fire crackled noisily in the silence far away through the trees an owl hooted as ifurging bob to hurry up and say something appropriate he picked a biblical quotation from his database that seemed to have themost relevance at this moment when trouble comes the lord is a strong refuge he will sweep away his enemies in anoverwhelming flood he replied his deep voice like a roll of thunder bob wasntentirely sure what the words meant but it seemed to have a suitable effect on the mengathered around the campfire amen someone muttered after a while chapter new york subway fosters torch probed the darkness of the subway station the beam picked outthe glint of twin metal rail tracks to their left over the edge of the platform and theglimmer of pools of stagnant water between them further along the tracks sal could see an old pram lying on its side half in half out ofthe water they could hear skittering sounds along the rails in around and under the rotting woodensleepers the pattering of little vermin feet and the steady metronomelike drip dripdrip of moisture from the curved tunnel roof above them echoed through thestation along the tiled walls of the stations platform sal was fascinated by longfadedadvertisement billboards she passed by the faded image of a happy family gathered around atraditional oak kitchen table all smiling with wellscrubbed rosy cheeks enjoying all thepleasures a tin of colonel johnstons oatmeal cookies couldoffer whatre you expecting to find down here asked maddy even though she spoke in little more than a tremulous whisper her voice seemed to echoendlessly down the stations walls and curved ceiling and off into the dark tunnelbeyond an emergency storeroom of some sort whispered foster i rememberreading that most of new yorks subway stations had backup generatorsinstalled during the second world war hopefully well find one and along with it somecontainers of fuel foster looked back at them i know its a longshot i never knew they had an underground system back then said sal yeah of course they did said maddy i did a school project on the newyork subway once they started digging out the tunnels as early as i think foster nodded thats right brought in irish workers by the tens of thousandsto work on it foster was about to say more but stopped himself so far mercifully theyd yet to encounter a single one of those creaturestheyd come across signs of them on the streets above clusters of small bones ratcarcasses remains of cats and even dog carcasses and of course more ominously here andthere discarded piles of larger bones sometimes carefully stacked or arranged by size salfound that even more unsettling the thought of several of those creatures sitting downand carefully sorting through the bones of someone theyd eaten she shuddered on thavenue she thought shed seen a pale face peeking out at her beforeit dipped back into the dark shadows beyond a departmentstore window frame and on broadwaythe faintest slither of movement among some storefront mannequins their plastic scorchedblack in places fingers and thumbs little more than melted stubs but she was prepared tobelieve she was mistaken preferred to believe that in fact mind you if those things were really there watching from the darkness then at least theywere keeping their distance still very much wary of fosters gun she wondered thoughhow long that would last how long before insatiable hunger for theircomparatively plump wellfed bodies would overcome their caution up ahead whispered foster look he swung his torch along to theend of the platform to a small door with a faded staffroomsign on it beneath that another sign warned of an electrical hazard he picked up the pace his shoes clacking along the platformsurface kicking aside several fallen tiles that clattered noisily across the platform overthe edge and sploshed into the puddles of water below sal cringed as the noise echoedinterminably down the tunnel foster reached for the handle and tried it rattling it hard it came off in his hand amid ashower of rust flakes oh thats just great he snapped let me have a go said maddy she lifted a booted leg and kicked the door by the rusted stub of the handle with a sharpcrack the door rattled inwards on its hinges shards of rusted lock and splinters of woodcascading to the floor foster waved a cloud of dust away from his face shall we age before beauty said maddy he replied with a thin smile and the flicker of a wiry eyebrow then stepped into the roombeyond swinging his torch quickly from side to side the light picking out surfaces coveredin half a century of dust maddy stepped in behind him while sal cast one last glance over her shoulder at the emptyplatform behind now robbed of the light from fosters torch as he made his way furtherinside she hurried in after them foster panned the flashlight around slowly she could see a table and chairs in the middle ofa small room several enamel mugs were on the table along with a yellow tattered and faded copy of thenew york times opened on the funnies page and dotted with ratdroppings on the walls were coat hooks lockers and pinups of beautiful movie starsforgotten faces her mum and dad might have once been able to put a name to it looks untouched since well since whatever happened happenedsaid maddy foster nodded doomsday he stepped over to the table and shone his torch down on the newspaper wednesdaythirteenth of march he looked up at them i was never that keen onwednesdays maddy snorted sal smiled comforted by his lame attempt to lighten the mood she leaned overthe paper scanning the headlines terrorists continue attacks on resettlement camps teacher arrested for teaching preunity history fuhrer absent at unity day parade rumours of illhealth superman just a myth spread by troublemakers at the far end of the room was a door with another electrical hazard warning screwed on toit below that another sign read authorized access only maybe well find something useful in there said foster he steppedaround the table and tried the door handle this time it opened without putting up a fightalthough the hinges creaked drily he pushed it open and flicked his torch from side to sidein the dark void beyond see anything asked maddy i see shelves both sides i see coils of cable some toolsoh silence what is it asked sal yeah maddy chorused more loudly what have you got just a second said foster stepping further inside he let the door go behind him maddy grabbed it before it could slam with a loudbang foster over maddys shoulder sal could see his silhouette inside dancing shadows the flickerof reflected light off dustcovered pipe conduits suspended from a claustrophobic low ceilinghe paced down a narrow walkway flanked on either side by racks of floortoceilingshelves useful supplies in here just taking a look you stay there he called back hemade his way down to the end of the racks of shelves then turned right slipping out ofview sal wanted to call to him to come back to say that they should all remain close togetherbut she didnt maddy was right there next to her light flickered over the tops of the shelves and shadows danced across the low ceiling as hemoved around the end of the shelves and out of sight they could hear his feet tapping andscraping across the cold concrete floor come on foster is there anything we can use in there or not maddy calledout the sound of movement stopped and the torchlight hovered where it was for a whilejust a sec he replied foster was taking his time whats he doing sal whispered checking something out i guess sal bit her lip trying to keep her cool thats right hes just round the corner not far no needto panic saleena vikram however right then it occurred to her that the only gun they hadwas round the corner with him what if those things were back in that tunnel leading out ofthe station watching patiently from the shadows perhaps waiting perhaps growing bolder witheach passing second they might be on the platform approaching the door tothe staffroom right now standing just outside and curious to see what was going on insidecurious to see how close they could get without being spotted she glanced back anxiously over her shoulder at the small room it wasalmost pitch black now she could just about make out the square edge of the table from whatlittle light was reaching them from fosters bobbing torch a faint glint from one ofthe mugs one or two of the chairs were visible but nothing else she turned back to see howthe old man was doing foster called maddy quieter now you gonna tell us what you gotthere the shards of light on the ceiling shifted slightly in response then they heard movementfootsteps across the floor and the shadows danced once more he was on his way back to jointhem you find anything called out maddy a beam of light emerged around the end of the long racks of shelves flashing into theirfaces as it approached them foster were in luck his gruff voice replied theres a generatorin the back hopefully well find some fuel somewhere on these shelves his voice cut off suddenly hes seen something sal felt her blood run cold something behind me quickly she turned round to look back over her shoulder again and saw two pale eyes milkyboiledfish eyes in a ghostly face just a few feet away rounding the end of the table andgliding rapidly towards her get down shouted foster maddy reacted instinctively stepping to one side and pulling sal with her the small room was filled with the deafening boom of fosters shotgun in theflickering instant of muzzleflash she saw a freezeframe image of one of the mutants as itrose up from a low stealthy crouch one long thin arm reaching out towards her only inchesfrom where shed been standing behind it were a dozen more of them caught in the flashas they were filing in through the open door to the staffroom rounding the table and closingin on them darkness she heard something tumble on to the table and thrash noisily for a moment then theskittering of a host of panicked feet the heavy clatter of a mug as it dropped and bouncedsqueals of terror and snarls of frustration bang another blinding moment of muzzleflash a glimpse of a creature sprawled across the tablestill twitching a dark almost black jagged hole in its chest and a slick of liquid poolingbeneath it by the door a tangled nest of pale limbs and skeletal torsos pressing through thenarrow doorframe all of them trying to escape through the doorway at once and then dark again she heard the slap of bare feet fading as the creatures fled down the platform mewlingcrying with both anger and fear as they retreated then silence except for the rasping sound of her and maddys breath the distantrepetitive drip of moisture from somewhere above and the sound of an enamel mug rolling backand forth across the floor oh my god exhaled maddy that was close said foster the torch was on the floor at his feet heddropped it in the panic he bent down and picked it up panning it quickly across them you you two all right he puffed yes said sal her voice robbed of everything but a whisper maddys eyes met hers they were right behind us i mean she gasped forair i mean they were right behind us we best get a move on said foster quickly they may well comeback chapter new york subway they found what they were looking for in a locked storage cupboard towards the backof the storeroom three large metal drums of diesel fuel that sloshed encouragingly as maddystruggled to ease them out on to the floor theyre way too heavy i can barely move them let alone carry one all the wayback to our archway she said foster pulled a face youre right he considered the problem his eyesdarting along the storage shelves for inspiration all right then we can pour the fuelinto a load of smaller containers that we could carry between us but how much will we need the truth was he didnt know hed never used the generator never needed to sofar last time it had been checked out it had chugged away quite happily for a few minutes ifhe knew something about diesel generators if he was a mechanic he could have probably madean educated guess as to how much fuel they were going to need thing was what he did know was that the timedisplacement machinery was going to needto charge itself up before they could use it since the power had been cut for quite a fewhours now the charge would be flat it was probably going to need the generator running adozen maybe twentyfour hours before theyd be able to do anything he had no idea at all how much fuel they needed for that probably quite a lot the girls were looking at him hoping he had an answer come on think how much will we need that depended on what the plan of action was as it stood they needed to transmit a messagethrough time to bob to arrange a new return window where andwhen they opened the window were factors that would decide justhow much of a charge the displacement machinery needed and even if they did manage to get liam and bob back theyd need enough energy to sendthem back to the correct time and place to try to fix history there were too many variables for foster to work out precisely how much fuel they needed foster how much do we need asked maddy again as much as we can carry he replied and if that wasnt enough theywould have to come back down here and get some more a prospect he wasnt too happyabout and the girls most certainly wouldnt be he looked around there were half a dozen jerry cans further along the bottom shelf if theyemptied those out and filled them up with diesel then between them theyd be carryingtwelve gallons of fuel enough it would have to be see those jerry cans he said pointing towards them were goingto fill them all up thatll give us twelve gallons that going to be enough maybe i hope so foster sure he replied thatll do us fine maddy nodded satisfied for the moment with his answer the next thing were going to have to figure outthough he added is how were going to carry those jerry cans back homefilled theyre going to be very heavy well have to take them between us one ata time thats six journeys sal turned to them both hang on ive got an idea they emerged up the stairs from the subway station between them they lifted thepram laden with sloshing cans of fuel up off the last few steps and on to the rubblestrewnpavement the prams large oldfashioned spoked wheels coped far better with the rubbleand debris than some shopping trolley with tiny little castor wheels would have it was getting dark foster had intended for them to be back at base safe and sound beforetoo much of the pallid grey daylight had gone from the sky but things had taken them longerthan expected never mind they were above ground now and even though dusk was settling across the lifelesscity the three of them felt happier out in the open than they had down below they eased thepram through the cluttered street feeling those eyes upon their backs watching andwaiting well be back home soon said foster quietly sal nodded it wasnt too far now just down east th street a right on to th avenueall the way down to delancey street then left over the bridge and home maddy grinned anxiously just takin the little ol baby out for a stroll down the avenueshe muttered with a shaky singsong tone uhhuh just minding our business andheading home oh yes indeedy her eyes darted from one darkwindow to another how about we do those things quietly said foster maddy giggled then shut up nerves the wheels rattled noisily over a scattering of rubble i reckon were being watched anyway foster she replied quietlymight as well make em think were not scared foster nodded maybe shes got a point well a good days work i think he announced loudly i got afeeling that the worst of this is over sal looked up at him do you think so sure well get this lot back ill crank up the generator get thingscharging up well have a nice hot cup of coffee whilst we wait how does thatsound wonderful she replied how long will it take until we can try bringing them back asked maddy foster made a show of shrugging casually his eyes though were on the lengthening eveningshadows on either side of the street id say about twentyfour hours until wecan actually try opening up a portal twentyfour hours maddys voice bounced off the nearest walls andrippled off down the deserted ruins of east th street but he smiled the good news is that we should be able totransmit a message through to the support unit and liam much sooner bob said sal thats what we agreed to call him yes im sorry bob so how does that transmittingmessagesthroughtime thing work exactly im no physicist madelaine so dont start throwing questions at me butthe explanation i was given is that its all to do with tachyon particles theyreparticles of matter that can travel faster than light and thus are able to travel throughtime if we aim them at roughly where we expect liam and bob to be then bobs onboard hardware will detect them and decode the message but they cant send a message back to us foster shook his head no the particles can only travel back through time notforward he snapped his torch on throwing a cone of light down the darkening streetwe know theyre somewhere around washington so well aim the tachyon arrayin that general direction it doesnt need to be that precise then said sal you knowaiming the signal well the more precisely you can aim the particles the fewer particles you need tosend which means you need less energy if we knew exactly wherethey were standing it would take a lot less energy so if we keep the message nice and shortand spread the beam wide it amounts to just about the same power burn maddy nodded i think i get it itd cost the same energy if we had a longermessage but used a narrower beam you got it they walked in silence for a little while accompanied only by the sloshing of the jerry cansin the pram and the clatter of its wheels over the rubblestrewn pavement i hope liams all right said sal i know its been only afew days since he went back but it feels like hes been gone for ages he has from his point of view nearly six months has passed she frowned thats just so weird they walked in silence for a while as she struggled with the idea that liamsexperience of this crisis had stretched over nearly half a year so so how longhave you been a timerider asked sal yourepretty old so i guess you must have been doing it for a while long enough sal he replied long enough does it all make sense to you yet foster shook his head and snorted dismissively does it heck it still messes with mymind chapter prison camp new jersey liam was exhausted barely an hour into the morning shift digging the ditchalongside the camps wire perimeter and he felt drained barely able to lift his spadenearly six months of poor food little more than a starvation diet had left him feeling weakand unable to sustain any sort of physical exertion for long he leaned on the spade trying to catch his breath giving his aching muscles a moment torecover sweat rolled down the small of his back soaking his shirt clouds of his hot breathpuffed out into the crisp winter air in front of him you better not let kohl see you whispered wallace in the ditch beside him kohl was one of the more ruthless guards last week hed pulled a man from thedefensive ditches being dug around the camp and beaten him repeatedly with the butt of hispulse carbine for stopping and taking a rest news was the man had died later on from hisinjuries it was from one of the guards that liam had learned why they weredigging these defensive ditches around the wirefence perimeter thered been someraids successful raids by a small band of resistance fighters several camps had beenoverrun the prisoners freed and most of the soldiers whod been guarding them killedthere was a rumour spreading among the guards that these fighters were being led by somedemonic entity there were varying descriptions of this thing some of theguards whod survived described a giant eight or nine feet tall with the horns of adevil protruding from its head another eyewitness described this demon as being made ofiron yet able to move at a terrifying speed with the agility of a tiger they even had a nickname for this thing der eisenmann the iron man one of the guards further down the line spotted liam resting on his spade and barked a shrillorder at him weiterarbeiten du amerikanischer haufen scheie he started digging again relieved that it hadnt been kohl oconnor youre going to get yourself killed if they see you slackinglike that again hissed wallace hes right the rumours of der eisenmann had put these soldiers on edge liamcould see fear in their eyes as they scanned the distant treeline unhappy with being outsidethe wire fence of the camp the iron man so much time had passed in here that liam had almost begun tobelieve his short time as a timerider had just been a figment of his imagination that timetravel was just a fairytale perhaps his life even his childhood in ireland hisworking a passage on the titanic all those things had been somedream and in fact this dreary camp his fellow starving prisoners in their grey rags thelong low wooden huts that was his real world his real life but then hed heard those rumours about der eisenmann adesperate hope had surfaced a longdiscarded possibility that bob was behind this iron manstory somehow he hated himself for allowing that hope to momentarily flicker to life commonsense tried telling him that this iron man nonsense was nothing more than the superstitiousprattle of spooked soldiers completely unused to being on the losing side ofany kind of a fight youre here for good liam now just you bloody well get used toit it was hard though hard not to hope that one day totally without warning a shimmeringsphere might suddenly pop up beside him and foster and bob and the girls would appear andtake him back stop it no ones coming for you now its been nearly sixmonths no one is coming five months and three weeks a hundred and seventyfive days he knew exactly how longnow one of the prisoners worked as a cleaner in the kommandants office and hadspotted a calendar on his desk the prisoners kept track of time marked the endlessidentical days passed inside here through him you all right there whispered wallace you mustnt give up hopekid you give up you die he was right it was the thin sliver of hope that came in the form of whispered rumoursoverheard conversations between guards that was keeping them going keeping them alive liam turned to wallace and gave him a thin weary smile im allright you know lad things will get better hereplied quietly his thick dark beard parted with a smile the american peoplewont stand for this theyll fight back i know they will liam wondered about that from what hed heard the camps were filled with those peoplewho might have organized or led some sort of a resistance movement army officers civicleaders congressmen lawyers teachers college professors newspaper editors therest those whod been spared imprisonment and left to continue their lives solong as they posed no threat to their new masters were never going to risk their lives theirfamilys lives as long as some semblance of normal life remained for them liam could see this fuhrers plan with stark clarity lock up all the potential troublemakers and either starve them or work them to death eitherway they were never going to see the outside world again meanwhile the rest of thepopulation would get used to the new regime get used to obeying their new masters untilfinally theyd forgotten what it was like to be free just as long as their new ruler their fuhrer continued to ensure there was food and water andelectricity what was it he heard someone muttering last night in their dormitory hut long as them krauties keep the trams runnin theshops well stocked the cinemas playing those cowboy movies the major league baseballplayoffs on schedule and you can still get yer longboy hot dog covered in mustardan ketchup from the vendors tween innings peoplell be content enoughto let things go on as they are theyll forget all about us inhere those on the outside might resent being lordedover but as long as things were kept tickingover kept comfortable enough they were never going to rise up were stuck in here forever whump a geyser of muddy soil erupted from the ground a couple of yards away and sprayed down onhim uh chapter prison camp new jersey liam felt it rather than heard it another whump nearby that punched his chest softly a geyser of snow and soil was tossed into the air a dozen yards from him then another onefurther away and another mortar shells coming in shouted somebody in the trench from the treeline across the field he saw flashes of light amid the undergrowth and momentslater heard the distant percussive rattle of gunfire the guards reacted swiftly dropping down into the ditch alongside theprisoners and returning fire on the treeline an officer quickly issued orders to several ofhis men to escort the prisoners back inside on the double they barked hasty orders at the prisoners shooing them along with their carbinesprisoners must go inside now one of them shouted move moveschnell liam did as he was told keeping his head low as he ran along the ditch towards the opengates at the front of the camp divts of soil spat into the air just above his head as shotslanded home from across the field another half a dozen whumps landed either side of the ditchshowering them with clumps of wet soil a prisoner in a tattered olivegreen marine uniformjust in front of wallace shouted out those are us army mortar shells the guards bellowed shrilly at them to move faster and liam soon found himself climbing upout of the ditch and running into the compound through the open gates herded in by half adozen more soldiers wallace behind him slapped his shoulder grinning and gasping at the same time whatdid i tell you kid the guards standing nearby had their eyes on the increasingly intensive exchange of gunfiregoing on in the field and warily on the jubilant prisoners liam could see they were nervous as much worried about the growing jubilation among the prisoners inside the camp asthey were about the attackers in the treeline yeah yelled wallace triumphantly at them theyre coming for youyou scumbags several of them turned towards him eyes darting from wallace to the growing crowd ofprisoners emerging from their huts into the courtyard to see what was going on come on wallace cheered on the distant attackers come get thesekrauties liam grabbed his arm wallace hey keep it down a mortar shell landed amid several of the guards in the ditch outside blowing them to bloodyshreds wallace and several other prisoners cheered noisily punching the air with glee the camp kommandant emerged from his hut at a trot flanked by a dozen more guards there wasa brief harried conversation barked over the increasing noise of battle he gestured towardsthe growing crowd of jeering prisoners the guards standing around them nodded at his ordersand slowly raised their guns liam realized by the calm ruthless expression on the kommandants face that hedjust given the order for them all to be executed on the spot none of the other prisonersseemed to have noticed their eyes on the gunfight across the fieldoutside i have torun run now liam began to shoulder his way back through the jeering defiant prisoners as the guardssilently raised their pulse carbines jayzus christ the rattle of guns being cocked to fire alerted the rest of the prisoners their eyes dartingback to the line of guards before they could react the kommandant barked a single wordfeuer the guards opened fire suddenly the air about liam was alive with the hum of passing bullets the hard thud ofrounds impacting bodies the muffled gasps of those falling and dying the screams of thewounded and terrified he stumbled back through the panicking crowd expecting at any second to feel a hard sharpblow between his shoulders punching the air from his lungs and throwing him down on to thecompacted snow and muddy slush the opening volley of shots came to a rattling conclusion as ammo clips emptied and theguards began to reload in the pause the air was filled with moaning and crying and wailingand the nearing sounds of fighting across the field liam realized he wasnt running he was on his knees in the mud surrounded by bodiestwitching and flailing run he scrambled to his feet stepping over and on the bodies around him he glanced back to seethe guards finish loading their carbines and begin to level their barrels at the remainingprisoners still on their feet many of those still standing were rooted to the spot in shockothers whod been towards the back of the crowd were now on the run scrambling awayfrom the guards towards the open doors of their huts the guards began firing again at will now picking out individual targetswith short aimed bursts mechanically aiming and firing aiming and firing likeautomatons obeying their orders mindlessly liam rose from a crouch to run for the nearest hut the lurch of movement caught aguards eyes and he swung the barrel of his gun in liams direction several shotswhistled past him close very close and over his head as he dived staggeredand fell across a writhing carpet of dead and dying towards the open door of the nearesthut he fell into the dark interior and scrambled on hands and knees across the rough wooden floorto hide beneath the nearest of the wooden bunks outside the firing continued sporadic clusters of shots short bursts long bursts andsingle taps to finish off the wounded as the soldiers stepped forward among the bodiesmeanwhile the rattle of gunfire in the field outside was coming closer he heard the muffledthud of more mortar shells landing this time inside the perimeter of the camp he heard the shrill sound of panic in the guards voices liam prayed it wasnt something he often did rarely in fact catholic faith drummedinto his head since birth by his mother father and every schoolteacher hed ever hadhad never managed to take hold of him but he certainly was praying now begging the virginmother of jesus to make sure that none of those soldiers outside had decided to stick his headin through the open door and finish him off he heard heavy jackboots slapping through the mud outside running past the open door theguards attention now on the approaching attackers they began taking up defensivepositions as the noise of exchanged gunfire seemed to be reaching a new intensity it sounded like the fight was now within the camp itself a row of jagged holes suddenly stitched its way across the thin plywood walls of his hutsending a shower of wood splinters on to the floor and leaving a line of pale sunbeams lancingthrough the air another explosion deafening this time amid the mud and bodies right outside the hut hurleda wet spray of soil inside through the open door the guards were screaming in german not the barked orders of professional soldiers butcries of sheer terror der eisenmann das ist der eisenmann toten sie ihn toten sie ihn liam heard the appalling sound of a protracted scream suddenly ending with a fleshy rippingsound other cries across the compound faintly the sound of americanvoices could be heard kill the guards you kill them all then the rattle of gunfire and feet splashing the bloodied ground outside you menget those guards theyre running take them down were not taking any ofthese scum prisoner understand not a single one ofthem liam wanted to climb out from beneath the bunk but fear kept him cowering in the dark therewere plenty of shots still echoing around the camp snarling angry voices of men appalled atthe carnage in the compound ahh man ohh jesus he heard a man outside crying they massacredthem before we could rescue em those scum shot em dead aintnever seen oh jeeez the distant pleading of a german voice nein neinich ich habe niemanden erschossen ended with the singlecrack of a gunshot echoing among the rows of huts he heard another pleading german voicesilenced by a single bullet further away across the compound and the distant rattle ofgunfire as the fight continued somewhere on the far side of the camp is liam oconnor here a deep and monotone voice without any sense of expression is liam oconnor here louder closer like a foghorn without any variation is liam oconnor here he heard the heavy splatter of boots in mud just outside the door and then the hut was throwninto darkness as a large body stepped into the doorway blocking out all but the thinnestglimmer of light is liam oconnor here the voice bellowed deafeningly into the hut it was almost too much for him to react almost too much hed convinced himself thathed never see that big robotic ape again the truth took a moment to sink in bob hovered a second longer then stepped out of the doorway bob liam cried out weakly scrambling on all fours to pull himself out fromunder the bunk bob wait im here a pair of broad shoulders and a small head crowned with a tuft of nutbrown hair leaned backinto the hut liam oconnor liam looked up oh sweet jayzusnmarymotherofmercy its goodto see you again bob so it is the support unit stepped inside and then squatted down on his haunches studying the frailform of liam on the floor his calm grey eyes quickly adapting to the darkness inside liam could have sworn that in that moment of recognition as bobs computer mindconfirmed liams visual identity and verified the signature tone of his voice he saw atear in those dull expressionless grey eyes of his then of course he went and ruined that sentimental moment of reunion bygrunting emotionlessly target successfully acquired good to see you too bob replied liam weakly choking back his own tears andgrinning as best he could chapter new york it really smells bad back here complained sal phew smellslike somethings gone off foster panned his torch around theyd not been in the back room of the archway sincethe power had failed them several days ago his torch flickered across the row of largeplastic birthing tubes along the back wall its them he said the embryos inside have died sal stepped across the floor towards them she stared in through the murky plastic at thedark forms inside the foetus the baby the small boy the teenage boy theyre all dead foster nodded filtration system stopped running their own effluence must have backedup and poisoned the nourishment solution what does that mean they choked on their own poop said maddy helpfully as she poured a jerry canof diesel into the generator hey foster you sure this is the right kind of fuelim pouring into this thing how do we know it runs on diesel and not likegasolene he stepped over towards her its diesel although whether this is the rightkind well know soon enough my grandad used to have a generator in his basement said maddy and he was very particular about the kind of fuel you poured into ittwostroke or whatever he said you pour the wrong kind of fuel in and it eventually clogs upthe carburettor or something costs a bunch of money to fix foster shook his head just as long as this generator keeps working long enough to getus out of this fix then ill be happy if it clogs it up and we need to replace itthen well worry about that later ok maddy shrugged ok foster finished emptying the last can and screwed the cap back on the generators tankright he said licking his lips right then fingerscrossed he worked a manual lever on the side of the generator several times grunting with the effortof pulling it down with one last look at maddy he punched a red button on the front thegenerator coughed to life and turned reluctantly over several times before spluttering anddying well that didnt sound too good uttered maddy shes just clearing her throat thats all he said with a lessthan convincing nod he pumped the lever several times his breath catching from the effortbefore hitting the button once more the generator thudded to life again this time with farmore enthusiasm after a few perilous seconds it found a slow chugging rhythm then began topick up the pace the slow thudding at first like a giant heartbeat became a rapid stabbingthen a clattering purr that filled the back room with its deafening volume foster stepped to the side of the vibrating machine and flipped some circuit breakers on afuse board a cobwebcovered light bulb in the ceiling glowed to life bathing the room with aflickering red light yeah yelped maddy we did it foster nodded and grinned clearly relieved so now weve gotpower again he barked loudly struggling to compete with the generators noisychug he turned to sal still staring at the dead bodies in the tubes hey sal cheer upwere well on the way to getting the others back she turned round to look at him eyes redrimmed and wet but too late for them though he shook his head firmly although they look human youmust try not to think of them as such theyre nothing more than meat robots salnothing more come on he said gesturing towards the sliding metal door leading backinto the archway lets get the displacement machine charging up he ushered them out sal craning her neck one last time to look at the tubes as they steppedout what will you do with them she asked ill deal with them dont you worry about that but what will you do with them foster shook his head weve got far more important matters to be thinking aboutright now he closed the door on the smell and the noisy rattle of the generator and made a mental noteto dispose of the clone bodies when sal was fast asleep the last thing she needed to seeright now was him carrying their bodies out he stepped over towards the machine beside the large perspex cylinder and flipped a switcha long row of small red led lights winked on the first of them almost immediately flickeredand turned from red to green ok its charging he said he joined the girls slumped in chairs around their mess table weve beenthrough a lot and theres still a lot more were going to have to do when themachinery is charged up enough well need to get that message throughto bob and of course well need to decide exactly whereand when were opening the return window but fornow he said sighing right now i could murder a cup ofcoffee the girls both grimy and tired looked up at him just what the doctorordered said maddy foster settled back in his chair suddenly feeling as old as the hills come on thenwhose turn is it to brew up chapter new york the shorter the message we try to send the less energy welluse said foster we need to keep it precise and to the point that way we canspend more of the energy of the tachyon burst on creating a wider spread ofparticles sal pulled a face i still dont get it foster scratched a chin thick with several days of white and grey bristles the first thinghe planned to do once things had returned to normal was to get a nice clean wet shave the idea of beams of subatomic particles that could be fired backwards through time had beena hard concept for him to get his head round back when hed first been recruited as atimerider in fact a lot of the concepts the technology the gadgets had been alien to himhis young mind had struggled hard to absorb it all but hed managed look he said its like this what were doing in effectis spraying an area of america in the past fifty years ago with a shower of tiny particles these tachyons now if we knew precisely where bob was standing at a certain time then we could aim ourtransmitter right at that point and fire off a message using very little energy needing tosend only a small number of these tachyon particles however we dont know where bob isright now we just have a general direction but why dont we aim the beam to the location and the point intime that we sent them back to you know the white house front lawn say thirtyseconds after theyd arrived there they wont havebeen able to wander too far in like half a minute said maddy true said foster but then they wont have had time to gather anyuseful intelligence in just thirty seconds wed be right back where we started nonethe wiser and with no information to work from he looked across at the machine beside the perspex tube the winking row of red lights showedthe displacement machinery was still a long way off from being charged up enough to use look ill be honest i really dont know yet whether were evengoing to be able to get one of them back let alone both of them the point is and this is really important we have to hope theyve found out enough in the past to be able to tell us exactly when and where this wrong history diverged from our ownbecause he said looking up at both of them with a stern expression we mayonly have enough power left to get one shot at sending someoneback one last shot he sipped from his mug just one shot to put things right right said maddy quietly so we know they missed the return window and the backup window an hour laterand the last backup twentyfour hours later which means they must have run into trouble butthats not necessarily such a bad thing sal made a face its not no from my many years experience as an operative running into trouble isinevitably how you end up learning things foster smiled the more troubletheyve been in the more theyve probably learned about the world in if theyre still alive that is added maddy liam is a very resourceful young lad hes a quick learnerand the support unit with him well theyre very tough things takes quite a lotof effort to kill one of those between them im sure they will have managed a way tolie low to gather information and await a message from us so then what message are we going to sendthem asked sal foster looked at her we send them a timestamp a location and moment in time forthem to make their way to right we can assume they have remained in the area of washington you sure cut in maddy can we assume that yes because it makes sense bob will assume well pick them up from roughly thesame area so hell have kept as close to the white house as is safe to do were doing a lot of guessing here said maddy a note of scepticism inher voice guessing is all weve got im afraid neither girl looked too happy with that look heres the plan he said were going to turn on thecomputer system pull up a street map for washington and try to find some quiet backstreet nottoo far from the white house say within a mile or two thatll be where well open the return window well write down thecoordinates turn the computers back off since theyre drawing power from the generatorand well have what we want ok so the other part of the message is the when thatsthe part of this weve got to guess right how about the day after the twentyfourhourbackup suggested sal could do but if they failed that then something must haveprevented them getting there id say we need to give them more time something prevented them foster shrugged many things bob or liam might have been wounded incapacitatedsomehow unable to move they might have been arrested the area might have been sealedoff or hazardous so how long after that then asked sal two days threedays his lips tightened as long as we possibly can we dont know what theirsituation is how much planning or recovering they might need to get to thislocation how much time are we talking about asked maddy a week the maximum mission time possible six months he replied maddy pulled off her glasses and absentmindedly wiped the lenses she narrowed her eyesmaximum mission time you mentioned that once before maximum mission time repeated foster twentysix weeks six monthsthats the support units expiry point expiry point said maddy i dont like the sound ofthat the support unit bob is programmed to destroy himself if hes not beenreturned to the present after a period of six months why asked sal to prevent him falling into the wrong hands to prevent him becoming a dangerousweapon dangerous his mind is adaptive ai its software that learns imagine if bob fell into thewrong hands imagine if bobs software began to learn about the world from someone evilor mad imagine if bob learned about the world from someone utterly insane like the roman emperor caligula or was used as a weapon by napoleon or genghiskhan the girls considered that prospect in silence worse still foster continued since his organic body doesnt ageand provided hes able to eat he could live indefinitely a strong man almostimpossible to kill who never ages think about it something like that could end up particularly back in a superstitious time being worshipped as a well as agod sheesh whispered maddy i bet ol dumbnuts would lovethat point is that its a particularly bad idea leaving a support unit behind inhistory so theyre programmed to selfterminate after six months sal frowned so what will bob do blow up nothing quite so dramatic the computer brain shortcircuits and burns itself outyoure left with nothing but a nugget of metal thats useful to no one and the computer burning itself said maddy finishing off her coffeethat like thatll kill bob not exactly with no computer in his head the support unit will be nothing more thana large ablebodied adult male with the undeveloped mind of a newborn baby hes left a gibbering idiot for the rest of time said maddynice no hed most probably die eventually being unable to actually think hed be unable to care for himself feed himself thebody would die of starvation after a few weeks just like any other human body in factunable to figure out he needs a drink hed die within just a few days poor bob said sal foster leaned forward and rested a hand on her shoulder meat robot okthats all he is just a meat robot she nodded slowly meat robot she repeated to herselfmeat robot so said maddy putting her glasses back on thats the timestampwere gonna send back to them that they gotta shift their butts to somewhere in theneighbourhood of the white house for a portal that opens six months after they first arrivedthere maybe a couple or more days before the termination date just so were notcutting it too fine but yes he replied i think thats our bestshot right maddy nodded towards the computer monitors i guess i better bootup the computer see if the thing still works an rustle up a map ofwashington good girl chapter woods outside baltimore so er who are all these guys bob asked liam as he struggledto keep up with him striding across the snowcovered field towards the woods there were menin their wake dozens of them waving their guns in the air discharging them cheeringtriumphantly they keep following me answered bob flatly liam looked back over his shoulder at them a grimy ragtag army of soldiers and civiliansbeyond them he could see the crisp white field was dotted with grubby prisoners fleeing thecamp in all directions the captain did it again cheered one of the fighters lets hear it for captain bob hiphip the men chorused hooray several of them firing their guns again insupport liam leaned closer lowering his voice captainbob you told them you were an army officer jayzus thatwas clever he was genuinely impressed with the initiative bob had shownim proud of you he said slapping him on his broad back i have told them nothing bob replied they have decided to call me thisname hey you liam turned round a dozen yards behind catching up with them was a small weasellylookingman who looked like the sort of dodgy debt dealer his mum had once warnedhim about hey kid dont be crowdin the captain like that you want facetime withhim you come talk to me first all right he dont need to be troubled by no peskylittle kid wantin an autograph liam looked at the other fighters behind him their eyes still glazed with the exhilarationof battle panting plumes of winter breath and gazing at bob with an intensefierce what fondness love no it wasnt that it wasmuch much more it was awe hey kid said the weasel in the suit he jogged over you wanna joincaptain bobs freedom force is that what you want then come talk to me back at the camp the names panelli vicecaptain panelli im the secondincommand around here ill sortyou out with some food and a gun uh no thats ok i dont want to join your freedom forceim just then if you aint joinin the force kid you better scram we got us somemore raids to plan a war to fight an captain bob needs time to rest up before heleads us against them krauties again liam looked up at bob this isnt what were here for is it to fightkramers army he asked ignoring panelli you are correct replied bob mission priority now is to return homewith acquired data so how are we going to do that bob considered the question for a moment i have no available plan suggestion weawait a signal from the agency giving us further instructions we just wait for them to call us affirmative hey cut in panelli grabbing liams arm hey stop that whatsorta weird talk is that yer saying to the captain liam spun round angrily shaking off his hand please can you leaveus alone we need to talk panelli looked at them both suspiciously i heard you say something about an agency signal you some kinda spy some kinda enemysympathizer what no you sound sorta funny to me got some kinda accent going on there what do you thinkmen oh for cryin out loud im irish replied liam imnot a flippin german spy liam looked up at his support unit bob tell them im your friend he is my friend panelli looked surprised you you know thiskid affirmative i know him so so whats the deal you family orsomething liam shrugged yeah thats right were family arent webob bob cocked an eyebrow uncertain what to say then after a moment this is the one ihave been looking for his deep voice rumbled panelli suddenly looked unhappy with that jealous that his selfappointed status asbobs righthand man had seemingly been undermined by some scrawny kid so captain bob you been looking for this kid an now you found himwhat does that mean for me us he asked a look of growing concern on his facedo we do we still follow you bob frowned and looked down at liam for guidance again unsure what to say good grief these guys they think hes some sort of asaint he almost giggled at the ridiculousness of it tell them bob tell them exactly what were doing we are awaiting a signal a sign gasped the young corporal standing just behind panelli yes thats it exactly said liam were awaiting asign the word rippled around the gathered men whispered with growing excitement and awe a sign a sign do you do you mmean continued the corporal a ssign from thelord from the field off added bob helpfully liam elbowed him in the ribs andhe closed his mouth from the what asked panelli a sign repeated liam from you know from beyond whispers spread like a breeze among the men liam spotted several anointing themselves withthe sign of the cross beyond uttered the corporal wideeyed thats right said liam trying to keep his voice even and his lips fromcreasing from you know who a silence settled over the men at that moment a scudding cloud happened to pass out of the way of the sun sending a burstof dazzling rays down on to the snowy ploughed field bathing bob in a warm light the fuzz ofcoarse nutbrown hair growing on his coconutlike head seemed to glow for a moment glow justlike a halo a collective gasp passed through the gathered men and one by one they began to kneel eventhe weasel panelli who liam would never in a month of sundays have thought wasthe churchgoing type oh just great thats all we need chapter woods outside baltimore the soup sploshed into liams bowl from a ladle smelled and looked almost asunappetizing as the gruel hed grown used to eating in the prison camp he looked up at the man whod served him thank you the man offered an awkward smile and tugged his cap politely is there anything i canget for captain bob liam considered that for a moment bob was clumsy with a spoon chances were hed endup dribbling the soup all down his front not very inspiring not very saintlike our leader would like some bread if you got any the man smiled delighted to be of service he rummaged in a backpack and produced a longloaf of stale bread liam nodded a thanks tucked it under his arm and began to head back tothe tent before hesitating and turning back round to face the man uh our leader sends his blessings for the food the man grinned broadly thank you thank you crossing himself as he spokegod bless him liam made his way across the camp illuminated by the glow of a crackling fire and silvershafts of moonlight lancing down between the branches of the forest he nodded politely tothe others he passed offering blessings from bob along the way over thelast couple of days the camps atmosphere seemed to have changed from being that of thesecret den of a band of patriotic freedom fighters to that of some kind of a monastery menwhod exchanged bawdy jokes one day seemed pious and reflective now they believe bob is some warrior angel sent down by god what do youexpect finally reaching bobs modest leanto he ducked under a flap of cloth and steppedinside i picked up some bread for you im afraid its not that usualhighprotein vomitlike gunk that you normally ingest back in the field office i have consumed this food type before said bob reaching for the offered loafof bread and biting off the end of it after chewing on it for a moment his saliva breakingit down his onboard computer analysed the protein content he nodded this is adequate liam sat down on a wooden crate opposite you know i thought i was going to be stuckin that camp forever i thought i was going to die in there he shuddered at the memories of those months inside the faces of prisoners hed grownto know well wallace he wondered what had become of him in the chaos did he survive themassacre had he escaped liam hoped so he slurped noisily on the soup i found myself wondering if id have been betteroff staying on the titanic drowning to death wouldve beena lot quicker than starving to death eh correct announced bob death by oxygen denial takes approximately threeto five minutes nice soothing words liam put down his spoon reached out and patted one of bobs meaty shoulders iknow this probably wont mean much to you since foster says your mind is just a littlemachine filled with codes and programs and stuff but isuppose look i just want to say thank you bob thanks for coming and gettingme he saw some kind of expression flicker across the support units rigid face was itsome sort of involuntary muscle twitch or was it a smile whatever it was it almost lookedconvincing they ate in silence for a while silence that is except for liams soupslurping andthe grinding of bobs teeth sounding not unlike the grating noise liamremembered his uncle diarmids cows made as they chewed on their winter maize so youre suggesting we stay here indefinitely until we get amessage negative just say no bob it sounds more natural no then how long for we wait another seventyeight hours fiftyseven minutes uh seventyeight hours and fiftyseven minutes seemed somewhat specific bob why exactly that long by that time i must have selfterminated liam dropped his spoon in the soup excuse me selfterminate what exactly does that mean bob stopped chewing on the bread and turned his cool grey eyes on him basicoperational requirement sixmonth lifespan in the field if i fail to return from a missionafter six months i must selfterminate they know this so they will not attempt to send meany messages after six months if we are to receive a message it will occur beforethen six months but but youre telling me youre going to destroy yourself in in in three days six hours and fiftyseven minutes time answered bobhelpfully i must terminate by then but why to prevent my computer technology being used liam suddenly realized he felt something for the big automaton in front of him a fondnesshe knew it didnt make any sense that he should care for what was basically ameatandmuscle weapons platform with a personal organizer stored up top perhaps in a wayit was because they were both new to this timeriding thing bothnew boys or maybe it was the thought of being alone in a world that should never have beenwithout bob to watch over him to protect him bob cant you decide not to destroyyourself negative what if i were to give you a direct order as the mission operative im incommand here right this is correct so if i were to order you to cancel this protocol cannot be countermanded it is firmware firmware built into the computers design it cannot be overridden liam looked up at his expressionless face but thats stupid it is unavoidable liam looked down at his soup growing cool in its bowl doesnt the thought ofdying well does it not scare you negative bob say no not negative no you dont have any strong feelings about about terminating yourself my consciousness is merely procedural code my memories are stored on my internal harddrive my body can be regrown from a single cell i can be endlessly duplicated liamoconnor i have no concept of death so i have no concept of fear no fear liam snorted humourlessly jayzus i wish icould say that ive spent the last few months spending every waking hour in fearafraid i might be picked on by a guard to be made an example of afraid theyd decide tofinish us all off afraid that i wish rumbled bob the words stopped liams selfpitying ramble in its tracks he set the spoon down inhis soup bowl and looked up to see the support units eyes were glazed over focused onsome faroff unattainable desire did he just say i wish he remembered foster saying the computer was linked to a small organic brain perhaps thattiny wrinkled part of bob that undeveloped nub of brain matter was able to wish forsomething to desire something in an indefinable way tell me liam said softly what what do you wish for bob i wish i was like you liam oconnor liam cocked his head like me jeez look at me a weedy little runt imsixteen and i still dont have any bristles i can shave and the best i ever managed toachieve before i was supposed to have died was to become a ships steward just aflippin waiter great huh you were recruited because you have essential skills essential skills you kidding i can tidy a cabin make a pot of tea and deliver itwithout spilling it on a napkin big deal your data records indicate you have a very high intelligence quotient fast mentalreaction times and creative cognitive skills really these things are listed in your personal profile records what records i have your complete profile on my hard drive this includes whitestar shippings personnel records details on your family your home town your schoolreports youve got my school reports up there in yourhead affirmative bobs eyes flickered momentarily a sign that he wasretrieving data liam oconnor is quite clearly a clever ladbob began reciting words liam recognized as being penned by his old headmaster fatheroherlihy perhaps one of the brightest in his academicyear however he is also prone to gazing out of the window woolgathering at the slightestopportunity and not applying himself as much as some of the other promising young boys inhis year liam is something of a loner it seems he does rather enjoy his own company duringbreak times not joining in bob stopped dead frozen for a moment you all right there bob one moment one moment the muscles in bobs face flickered and tensed his eyes blinked rapidly as inside hishead every thought process came to a sudden grinding halt transmission particles detected his computer sifted the data coming in subatomic particles winking into existence as if bymagic and passing through solid matter as if it was air enough tachyons were appearing in hisneural net caught like flies in a web for him to begin to decode some partialmessage fragments time cont complete devastation low energyfor one on as follows lat bob whats up with you one moment one moment he replied tonelessly more particles arriving more fragments of message assembling he waited until the passingwave of particles appeared to have finally ceased another minute in silence waiting for a possible second wave of tachyons to be ensnared inside his head but thereseemed to be nothing more now the signal beam from the future had briefly passed this way andmoved on i have just received a weak signal from the field office he announced what liams face lit up just now affirmative oh thank marymotherofjayzus theyve found us and theyre okright of course they are bob became unfrozen and took another bite out of his bread so dont keep me in suspense bob whats the message his eyelids fluttered message from field office timecontamination in present result is complete devastation very low energy unsure of windowsize perhaps for one only no second chance timestamp as follows latn long w time liam stared at bob i im not sure i understood much of that didyou bob nodded their timeline has experienced a significant shift resulting in muchdestruction as a result their external power feed has become compromised liams eyes widened so what does that mean their time machine doesntwork incorrect it works but they have a limited supply of power window for one only that means that means they have only enough power to return one of us bob answeredthat must be you liam shook his head surely they can get us both backsomehow if they fiddle around with their dials or something negative body mass affects the energy required for timeriding you are very smallrequiring much less energy than myself liam sat in silence for a moment then finally shook his headi i cant just leave you here on your own to to terminate yourselfbob i just that is an illogical assessment surely something can be done to boost the energy their end or lighten the load ourend something surely there is something that needs to be done said bob the data on thistimeline is stored in my hard drive and must be transported back with you uh im not sure i like the sound of that liam swallowednervously does that mean what i think it means you will have to break open my cranium and remove the soft tissue inside including myorganic brain to access the computer disconnecting the computer and removing it will requireme to provide detailed instructions before you do this in order to prevent you from triggeringthe selftermination firmware as you extract the computer ugh no im not sure i can do that bob really im you have no choice it is a mission requirement liam shook his head already feeling sick at the thought of hacking open bobs headso so when would i have to perform this operation the extraction window is set for twentyfive hours time and where is it bob blinked retrieving data the coordinates are for a street called jeffersonplace in the city of washington dc it is approximately one mile from the location of ouroriginal arrival window liams eyes widened further a mile from the white house but thats justcrazy that whole area is going to be thick with soldiers and those buzzing airjetthingies we must make for this location within the time left once there youmust extract the computer from my cranium or alternatively remove my head and take that withyou cut your head off liam blanched his face turning sickly pale icant do that bob im ive never been good with blood and ickystuff ill faint im telling you ill keel over and faint so iwill and then ill miss this window and well both bein a fix he looked down at the tepid remains of lumpy soup in his bowl and put it to one side nolonger feeling hungry is there really no other way if you were smaller if i was smaller if the extraction window was opened geographically closer to the field office if the extraction windowwas not so far back in time these factors all affect the total energy required bob looked at him with his calm grey eyes for some reason bob tried out one of those pitifulsmiles hed picked up from sal as far as liam was concerned that didnt helpmatters didnt help at all it made him look strangely vulnerable like an oversizedtoddler you will need to acquire a bone saw or blade with a serrated edge to remove myhead bob continued also you may need to acquire a power drill with jayzus christ liam blurted suddenly enough i need some air think im going to puke chapter woods outside baltimore liam stood outside breathing deeply sucking in the cold air until the sensation ofnausea began to ease he took a few steps through the undergrowth away from bobsshelter trying to clear his mind of what needed to be done past the slender sapling trunks and low fir tree branches he could see the flickering lightof the campfire in the middle of the clearing around it huddled most of bobs littlearmy nearly a hundred after that last raid he wondered how betrayed and angry all those menwere going to be when he had to announce that bob was leaving with him that they had othermore important matters to attend to men dont give up their gods or leaders lightly he imagined the scene was going to be nasty their eyes would be upon him suspicious andaccusing wondering what poison he must have dripped into their leaders ear but therewas no time to delay if bobs decoding of that message was right washingtonwasnt so far away from here just over an hour of driving but theredundoubtedly be roadblocks and guarded perimeters to figure their way through once theyreached the city whyd they have to pick a place so close to the whitehouse he wondered how on earth they came to the conclusion that that was such a good idea but thenit occurred to him that foster maddy and sal could have no idea where theymight be so they were making a simple logical assumption that theyd remainedin the vicinity thats one hell of a big assumption a lot could have happened in six months they could have ended up on the other side of thecountry in that time or even the other side of the world he shook his head it was crazy and stupid that he and bob couldnt communicate backnot for the first time he cursed this insane timetravel technology just when you thoughtyoud managed to get your head round it it just seemed to get even morecomplicated so they had a time and a place now at least that was something heading for the middle ofenemyoccupied washington dc sounded like suicidal foolishness but it wasnt asif they had a choice oh well he muttered to himself he was sure bob would enjoy himself cutting aswathe through the bad guys its what he did best the sooner they got a move on the better left these woods behind and bobs loyal band of worshippers liam decided theyd be best setting off at first light with a nationwide curfew inplace theyd look far more suspicious if they were stopped at a checkpoint travellingaround at night than they would during the day meantime liam decided hed better figure out a way for bob to extract himselfpolitely from his devoted followers he had visions of those men lynching him for luring theirmessiah away from them chapter new york day since the power went so now were waiting waiting for the time machine to store up enough of acharge for us to try opening a window theres no way well know if they got the message we sent no way of knowinguntil we open the window in washington if they got it then they should step through andappear right in front of us if they didnt then well be wasting ourenergy for nothing everythings off in here all the lights everything maddy suggested we should put the field bubble back on so that wedflip back in fortyeight hours time if those creatures outside havent managedto find us by then wed be safe from them because whatever progress they madein finding out where were hiding would be lost when we reset butfoster said it would drain too much power from charging up the displacement machine he saidthats the only thing that matters right now getting that thing chargedup jahulla id rather have the bubble on and have to wait a little longer everylittle noise outside makes me jump out of my skin how much longer do you reckon asked maddy foster studied the row of winking lights on the machinerys chargedisplay id guess four or five more hours that long four or five more hours we open the window and they should pop into existenceright here he smiled encouragingly at her simple as that although its not as simple as that is it foster really wasnt certain the thudding generator in the back room was going to havestored up enough of a charge for them to produce a window big enough for even liam so manyfactors to consider the distance from here the size of the window the mass of the personsbeing sent all variables that affected how much energy would be needed whiletheyd been tapped into new yorks electricity grid these werentconsiderations that normally had to be taken into account but now running on what meagreenergy theyd managed to generate every variable was an important factor to weighup and getting liam and bob home wasnt the only window they needed power for there was also sending them back to where they needed to go to fix this problem once and forall foster had to be sure to conserve enough of a charge to be able to do that too he cursed under his breath too many unknowns so they may have got the message foster said maddy but what if theycant make it to the location we specified what if its just not possibleshe tapped the monitor in front of her showing a street map of washington dc the citycould be completely different there might not even be a street there in their time itcouldve been built over by the germans or razed to the ground or orsubmerged beneath some large rubbish tip or we have to take that chance foster sat tiredly back in the old office chairwith squeaky castor wheels and a faded threadbare cover liamsa smart lad between them theyll find a way madelaine theyll find a way tomake it there in time if theyre still alive that is she added grimly foster couldve replied irritably that her doom and gloom wasnt exactly helpingthings but she was right there were many reasons why this was just a desperate shot in thedark if it failed then this is it the world left forever like this just ashes and rubble and living within this ruinedlandscape those pitiful mutated creatures feeding on the flesh of each other scavenging likerats in a few days time theyd be out of water and canned food then have to beout there scavenging for food just like them and how long before those creatures found them found their little archway they may mewl andbabble like babies but there was intelligence in those pale eyes he could well imagine themslowly but surely scouring the city for them gradually zeroing in on them the thought of itset the grey hairs on his forearms on end if those things managed to find them here theyd work out a way to get insideafter all their humble little base was little more than a crumbling bricksandmortararchway hardly impregnable theyll find a way in and it will all be over veryquickly he couldnt let the girls know what he was thinking of course he couldnt letthem know that he suspected their plan was almost certainly doomed to failure the chance ofthe message getting through was painfully slim let alone liam and bob being able to make theappointed window in time and listening to the faltering muffled chug of the generatorit sounded like it was on its last legs chances were there wasnt going to be enough ofa charge on the displacement machine to get them out of this fix anyway you ok foster asked maddy quietly quiet enough for sal notto hear you dont look so good he smiled im fine just a little tired this is going to work isnt it sheasked he needed to put a brave face on things for now sure of course it is its going to be fine fine if they failed to bring liam and bob home and they were stuck here alone in this ruined placeforever then he silently vowed hed do the deed that was necessary there were a dozenrounds of ammo in his shotgun the first nine hed use to defend them if those creaturesfound their base and decided to break in the last three well thered be one for each of them chapter command ship above washington dc paul what is this kramer looked up from the workbench he smiled when he saw his friend standing in the doorwayto the lab karl good to see you karl stepped into the lab his eyes darting across the assembled machinery trying to makesense of the draping cables the gutted machine parts strung together the wire cage what is this youve not been available for our daily status meetings for over two weekspaul your assistant said you were unwell not taking anymeetings at all kramer looked back down at his handdrawn schematic i have been busy karl verybusy i can see that he replied shaking his head a bemused look on his leansoldiers face what manner of thing are you working on now kramer answered the question with a dismissive shrug karl stepped a little closer ducking beneath a loop of power cables i have a backlogof papers for you to sign paul important matters that need discussing we have a growingproblem in the new jersey and maryland state areas more of those raids on prisoncamps karl squeezed past a rack of acetylene cylinders to join kramer at hisworkbench the american newspapers have printed stories of this superhero and his army thisisnt good paul its giving the american people something to rallyround so close the printing presses replied kramer distracted returning to histask scribbling amendments across his work i have already done that on my own authority but they have underground printingpresses not just in washington but in new york in boston other cities kramer continued scribbling in silence paul this is a problem that could very quickly become serious we dont havethe manpower over here in america to deal with a nationwide insurgency we would need at leastthree four times as many men to cope if this resistance movement catches on kramers eyes remained on the workbench do what you feel is necessarykarl i am busy here i do not have the time to deal with this karl studied him silently he has not been listening to me frustrated he reached across and placed a hand on kramers arm paul you must kramer looked up at him sharply grabbing his hand tightly and pushing it forcefully off himyou forget karl that i am your fuhrer im sorry i meant only to be quiet karl flinched he met kramers eyes and realized there was a hardness there anironstiff resolve none of the warmth of friendship hed grown accustomed to over theyears paul is not himself kramer began to say something then irritably shook his head his gazedropped impatiently back down to the papers splayed out across his workbench karl remained standing stiffly to attention waiting for kramer to formally dismiss him fromthe room as he waited he looked around this lab was kramers thinking space aboardthe command ship it was normally as tidy as his leaders mind a place of order andcalm a place where kramers mind could comfortably work on refinements to theirarmys weapons technology but right now it had the look of a troubled mind along theworkbench a meal started forgotten and unfinished a teacup half full cold and growing askin of congealed cream karls eyes followed a loop of cables snaking across the floortowards a wire cage a cage his mind flashed an image of the museum basement fifteen years ago a desperate gunbattle then hastening into a cage similar to this static electricity sparks then aterrible sensation of falling my god you are making a time machine kramer muttered something in response karls eyes followed another thick string of cables away from the cage across the labtowards what appeared to be a small beer keg suspended in the middle of a protective metalframe by an array of thick springs the unfamiliar frame confused him for a moment but thebeer keg he suddenly recognized paul you have one of the atom bombs in here kramer sighed and looked up indeed is it is it deactivated no karl it is primed and ready for use karl immediately felt his scalp begin to prickle you understand you understandhow dangerous it is to have this aboard the command ship when it is primed for kramers smile was cold and lifeless but worse than that was the vacant look in hiseyes karl felt his leader his friend was looking through him beyond him not at him the muscle tics in his face hed firstnoticed some weeks ago the tremor of kramers jaw were more pronounced his eyes lookeddeep hooded and dark from lack of sleep paul what is wrong will you tell me what is going on here kramers eyes seemed to focus back on him my old friend he said somewarmth finally returning to his lean face i believe it is over for us over what is over someone has come for me karl what are you talking about you saw that body you remember it on the day we took the white house karl cast his mind back yes he remembered a curiously fusedbody remembered it had troubled him for a few nights but then their highpowered weaponstheir incendiary bombs habitually produced all manner of twisted and unpleasant corpseshed had no time to reflect further on it the business of governing a conquered nationhad made sure of that do you see old friend thats them them they know where we are they know when we are and theyre going to come they who kramer shook his head that tremor in his jaw uncomfortably exaggerated now karl realizedpaul must have experienced some kind of a nervous breakdown our actions in history karl have angered them and nowtheyre coming to exact payment to take their pound of flesh karl frowned you are talking of other time travellers kramers eyes redrimmed and glistening widened iveseen it in my nightmares perhaps i glimpsed his face in the gap in spacetime karl when wetravelled back to i must have seen his face then in that swirling chaos betweenthe present and past face whose face the devil karl satan death chaos he regarded his leader in uncomfortable silence he has gone quite mad paul there is no such thing as the devil oh but there is you and i stepped through a gap in spacetime a gap in the laws ofphysics you and i may have stepped briefly so very briefly and placed our feet inhell itself this has to stop paul is not himself and hell has our scent now karl it has our scent it isseeking us and it will punish us karls eyes stole away from kramers intense face and darted again to the atombomb nestled in its metal support frame he could kill us both with thisdevice kill everyone aboard the command ship kramer turned and followed his gaze yes karl this device you want to know what it is you have an atom bomb linked to a time machine kramer shook his head its not a time machine id need things icant get my hands on in to make one of those no its a doomsdaybomb an atom bomb magnified infinitely by waldsteins displacement field hepointed at the wire cage it will ensure a blast and gamma radiation that will wipe outevery living thing my god gasped karl kramers face creased with a playful grin it is agodlike thing is it not karl felt his heart thumping through his charcoalgrey tunic through the silver eaglestitched on his left breast pocket paul this is this is madness i consider it a kindness my old friend what yes yes a kindness we mistakenly let some dark force come into the pastbehind us something evil chaos itself it is seeking usit will come for you and i and will come for every other soul in this world i can see thatnow paul listen there are no angels or demons or it will come for every soul in this world because this is a world that shouldnever have been every person living right now is living a lifethat should never have been karl found his hand instinctively slowly reaching down for the pistol on his belt beingmerely decorative it was unloaded but perhaps kramer would not be aware of that am i really going to pull my gun on him yes he needed paul to come with him now away from thiscontraption where he could talk to him where he could reason with him safely and if needsbe he would order a physician to provide sedatives for the fuhrer the man needed to becalmed desperately needed some sleep by the look of him you know karl i wanted to make a better world a better future said kramerhis tired eyes rimmed with tears instead he shook his head i believe ive condemned us all to something worse than death itself but you are talking of supernatural things paul devilsangels god satan these are things that belong to the middle ages you are a man ofscience not some insane priest perhaps the supernatural is what lies beyond our science it is in that gap inspacetime a solitary tear rolled down kramers gaunt cheek the factis i know the devil has arrived and is coming for us as we speak hes gone too far i have to ask this paul is this devicefunctional kramer nodded it is i have no choice then karls hand stole into his holsterand with one fluid sweep pulled out the pistol he aimed it at kramer the gun was steady hisvoice wasnt paul im ssorry you must understand i cannot letthis go any further kramer remained calm his eyes on the gun he smiled not unkindly im afraidits something i have to do karl cocked his gun look come with me paul well talk about this in yourquarters you and i kramer calmly reached for the intercom on his workbench paul please stop i will shoot i dont believe you will old friend said kramer softly as he thumbed abutton on the intercom security detail to my private laboratory on the doubleplease a tinny voice acknowledged the order over the desk speaker kramer looked up at him id hoped we could face this together karl after allweve been through do you not see youre not well youre tired youre not seeingthings clearly send the guards away and you and i can talk karl could already hear the clatter of boots on the hard floor outside the lab callthem off paul this is madness a rap on the double door a muffled voice outside security detail sir enter karl quickly lowered his gun the ss leibstandarte guards would shoot even him thereichsmarschall if they saw a weapon raised at their beloved leader the door swung open andfive ss leibstandarte entered the oberleutnant leading them glanced at karl the pistol heldloosely in his hand now aiming down at the ground mein fuhrer is everything allright kramer sighed his shoulders sagging im so very sorry karl he steppedaround a nest of cables towards his friend gently easing the unloaded pistol out of his handand placing it on the workbench paul said karl quietly you must listen kramer put a finger to his lips hushing him he reached out and affectionately clasped hisshoulder i consider you my closest friend perhaps my only real friend karl but this is too important a thing my godhes going to place me under arrest karl bit his lip realizing it would be foolish to push kramer any further right now assecondincommand of the reichs invasion force he might still be able to reason withthe guards the higher echelon officers but not right here not like this kramer took a step back trust me he said softly barely more than a whisperfor karls ears only this is a kindness for you paul what are you oberleutnant sir execute reichsmarschall haas the young officers eyes widened in momentary confusion do this right now please what he cant be karl was turning round to sharply bark a counterorder when two precisely aimed shots endedhis life and scattered tissue and blood across kramers workbench chapter woods outside baltimore all right bob you understand what youve got to say tothem affirmat liam raised a finger and cocked a scolding eyebrow yes i understand liam oconnor better this has to be convincing you need to come across sounding sort of like someold testament prophet and not like a bloody robot i understand you remember it all bob looked down at the tattered sheet of paper in his hands and liams untidyhandwriting littered with words crossed out phrases rewritten and written again it is stored in memory right then i suppose we should get a move on correct rumbled bob washington is fiftyseven miles southwest fromthis location we will need to travel quickly liam led the way out of bobs shelter and blinked at the earlymorning sun piercing thebranches and pine needles above them and dappling the hardtrodden snowy ground with pools ofwarmth and light the camp was already stirring with activity some of the men already up andreviving the smouldering campfire to cook breakfast and heat an urn of coffee he could see panelli interviewing more newcomers eager to join the fighteven more eager to catch sight of the legendary captain bob in action oh boy theyre really not going to like this come on he whispered to bob you better lead the way bob strode past him towards the clearing in the middle of the camp when he stepped out fromunder some low branches the camps hum of activity died down to an expectant silence asthey stared in awe at their magnificent heroic leader the newcomers about thirty of them surged forward excitedly keen to get a closer look atcaptain bob hush cried out panelli it looks like he has something tosay bob stood beside the fire legs planted apart his hands on his hips just as liam haddemonstrated his cold grey eyes panned slowly across the people before him with asolemn gravitas the time has come for me to move on o people liam winced at the way bobs flat voice delivered the lines it had sounded pretty goodon paper as he was scribbling it out and reading it to himself however right now with bobbelting it out in a onetone voice it sounded painfully embarrassing i have received a calling from above to leave you now that my work here isdone and i am to form other groups of fighters across the nation to fight this evilinvader this dark force of evil satans army of minions and the devilry of theirinventions and weapons liam felt his cheeks colour maybe i shouldve left that bit out but you will continue the fight here you shall continue gods work i captainbob captain of the lords army will return again one day i shall return andtogether we shall destroy the enemy and return freedom to this great nation announcedbob with all the passion of a bored teacher taking morning registration the forest was still and silent for a long time too long for liam whowondered if between his appalling creativewriting skills and bobs emotionless drawlthey appeared as ridiculous as he suspected they did then one of the men the pious young corporal dropped down on to one knee and gruffly saidamen as did another and another panelli looked down at them and keen not to be outdone did likewiseamen in ones and twos the rest of the men standing there in the forest followed suit dropping totheir knees solemnly good grief were actually getting away with this your leader has spoken and th liam nudged bobs elbow gently we should probably go he hissed out ofthe corner of his mouth whilst were ahead bob nodded and stepped forward and gestured his hand in the way liam had demonstrated in thetent blessings upon you his deep voice boomed to the man nearest him as hetouched his shoulder blessings upon you he said to another as he strodepast liam followed in his wake smiling selfconsciously at the men he passed bywere uh were going to leave now to uh you know to spreadthe good word bob led the way past this mornings newcomers all of them on their knees all lookingup at him with wide eyes blessings upon you all he growled tunelessly as he strode past them towardsthe camouflaged trucks liam nodded yes keep up the good work fellas he said cringing inside athow stupid that had just sounded bob was in the truck turning over the engine with a loud rattling cough and a belch ofexhaust fumes as liam pulled himself up into the cab without a moments hesitation bobslipped it into gear and the truck began to roll across the uneven forestfloor towards the twin muddy ruts of forest track ooh that was awkward liam uttered looking in the rearview mirror asthe pale ovals of curious faces emerged from the undergrowth on to the track behind themwatching them leave he felt something inside him sadness perhaps it was guilt those poor men would probablycarry on the struggle without bob many of them dying as they did so fighting for a futurethat wasnt going to be when they got back home back to and liam told foster exactly where and when theyneeded to return to to put history back on its correct course and this kramer wasconfronted and killed before he could change hitlers destiny when thathappened this incorrect history would cease to be justdisappear and all the sacrifices those men had already made and might yet make in the comingdays it will all have been for nothing although liam would never see it for himself this world would shimmer and shift amidincreasing waves of temporal instability and then in the blink of an eye pop it would become the it should be bob turned to liam there is sufficient time to reach the rendezvous location inwashington dc we have fourteen hours and fiftytwo minutes great thanks bob however there is a high probability that enemy units will stand between us and therendezvous location this reduces the estimated probability of our successfully getting to therendezvous point to ill stop you right there bob if thats ok the support unit looked at him expressionlessly you do not wish to know thepercentage estimation of success liam shook his head uhh no not really chapter washington dc it was after dark when they finally entered washington dc a curfew was in effectand the streets quiet and still street lamps buzzing softly amid the hiss and patter of sleetdrizzling down they decided to ditch the army truck on the outskirts of the city when theyspotted a roadblock ahead the rest of the route into the city they navigated throughdcs subterranean network of sewers bob efficiently led the way liam following grimacing at the stench of sewage and the sightof rats running alongside him on a brick ledge eyeing him cautiously as they scuttledpast finally bob cocked his head his eyes fluttered he took a left turn off the main tunnelwe go up this access ladder the coordinate stamp indicates a location fifty yardsfrom this position bob clambered up the ladder at the top he gently cautiously pushed aside a round sewagecover he poked his head up to check the lay of the land then ducked back down liam was right behind him on the ladder is it clear there are no enemy units in line of sight please stay close to me how long have we got until the window opens seventeen minutes replied bob as he pulled himself up liam nodded a pretty close thing but they were here in time and thats all thatmattered he clambered up the ladder until his head was poking out of the manhole hecould see a fourlaned boulevard nothing moved along it the buildings on either side rows of three and fourstorey town houses looked occupied dull vanilla lightsflickered beyond drawn curtains liam thought he saw the diffused silhouette ofsomeones head and shoulders crossing in front of a bedroom lamp people still living in the city then but subdued cowed frightened above in the night sky still hovering like a dark thundercloud he could see kramerscommand ship in position above the white house several dozen searchlights lanced down fromit sweeping the sullen and silent city hunting for any citizens foolish enough to dare breakthe curfew and step out into the night come whispered bob liam pulled himself up and scrambled across the empty road joining bob in the mouth of adark and litterstrewn backstreet this is the location said bob twenty yards along he addedpointing to the end where garbage pails and boxes were piled against a woodslat fence they made their way down to the end carefully doing their best to avoid kicking any looseclutter across the ground this is the location said bob squatting down he began shifting aside severalwet cardboard boxes full of rubbish recommendation we clear this space ofobstructions otherwise density warnings will prevent them from opening the timewindow liam nodded and eagerly began to help he suddenly realized for the first time sincetheyd been sent back into the past since things had gone so completely pearshaped onthe white house lawn that they were actually going to make it home to i owe you my life bob he said slapping the support unit onthe back you got us here in one piece bob tossed a wet handful of mushed cardboard and rotting refuse to one side missionparameters will be met only when you and the data that has been acquired are successfullyreturned to the field office for analysis liam grinned all right bob i was just trying to say thank you thatsall thank you yeah you know thanks you rescued me i reckon youwerent meant to do that were you im pretty certain you shouldve gonethrough the backup window six months ago to be sure bobs eyebrows locked his mouth opened and shut my mission prioritieswere recalculated mission priorities recalculated huh liamsgrin widened what i think you mean is that you chose to rescue afriend bobs confused frown became a loose approximation of a disapproving scowlnegative i do not have friends i am a biological weapons platform a field supportunit liam pursed his lips and nodded fine sure if thats how you bobs eyes fluttered this location is currently being scanned for densitypackets thats them isnt it foster maddy affirmative liam clapped his hands together oh yes jayzusnmothermarywere going home one minute until window opens said bob please stand clear liam obediently stepped back as did bob they both waited in the dark for the telltale paleflicker of light ten seconds liam grasped bobs hand and shook it we make a good team dontwe bob looked down at the young mans hand folded in his giant sausage fingers for amoment the gesture seemed to be lost on him then he managed an unattractive smile good team he replied a pale spark appeared flickering dimly like a firefly then a moment later liam felt agentle puff of displaced air against his face a soft pump of air that sent several dampscraps of newspaper fluttering up the backstreet and empty tin cans rolling noisily acrossthe ground some grit in his face liam was blinking and rubbing it from his watering eye whenbobs deep voice rumbled this is not good liam rubbed the grit out wiped the tears off with the back of his hand and gazed down at thewindow an undulating sphere of soft paleblue light it was no bigger than a footballbobbing gently a couple of feet above the ground what the they have insufficient power said bob thats it they cant make it any bleedin bigger they have insufficient power said bob again oh no cried liam oh jeez no no no this cant behappening bob turned to look at him liam oconnor you mustbe very quick quick doing what bob pulled a long knife from his belt neither you nor i can go back liamoconnor but the data that they need must goback bob pushed the knife into liams shaking hands you must bevery quick he said again dropping heavily to his knees so that liam could reach hishead i i cant said liam the blade trembling erratically in hishands bob i cant do this i will not feel pain insert the blade between the top of my neck and the base of myskull that is where the cranium casing is weakest then press very hard liam nodded he stepped round behind bob and raised the blade until it was pointing towardsthe dark mop of hair at the back of his head you must do it now insisted bob i i liam could feel his whole body shaking his stomachtightening lurching getting ready to eject the last meal hed eaten you must do it now the small blue shimmering light hovering above the ground began to flicker and modulateuncontrollably in the middle of the sphere liam thought he could just about make out theflickering undulating form of someone no threepeople waiting beckoning for him for someone something anything to step through then it was gone and once again the backstreet was dark and quiet save for the soft pattering of sleet aroundthem im sorry mumbled liam im sorry bob i justcouldnt do it chapter new york maddy and sal stared at the space in the archway where a moment ago the very airhad been thrumming vibrantly a pocket of space that shimmered like the heat veil above abarbecue or the hot tarmac of a sunbaked highway foster had deactivated the timedisplacement machine im sorry he said he leaned wearily against the computer desk tiredand finally looking like someone with no more answers left to give i thought we hadenough of a charge to get liam through i was wrong sal looked up from where the small ball of hot air had shimmered three feet above the groundit had bobbed and undulated for less than a minute and she was almost certain that throughthe flickering haze shed seen liams and bobs faces staring back ather so thats it she said quietly foster nodded hang on weve still got some charge left said maddy pointing at therow of little green lights on the machine there were three green leds and an orange one therest were now red yes he replied so why couldnt you have used that power to widen the window sheasked a sharp edge of desperation creeping into her voice he took a deep breath it was as wide as i could make it there justwasnt enough to work with im sorry couldnt we have maddy was looking for possibilitiescouldnt we have kept the window open longer maybe we could have communicatedwith them somehow we were just wasting energy madelaine just wasting it it was obvious theycouldnt come through so you closed it off he nodded at least we still have some charge left she shook her head a shrill desperate laugh escaped her lips for what foster forwhat he said nothing maybe cut in sal maybe theres enough diesel left in thegenerator to maddy snorted to what charge it up again so we can open up another midgetsizedwindow the muted chugging from the back room filled the long silence between them foster finally nodded towards the small line of lights on the machine we have alittle stored power left i suggest we should be thinking how best to save ourselves nowthat now that its too late to save history said maddy fosters smile was pinched and weak yes what powers left will provideus with light for a while at least and coffee said sal he laughed softly and coffee until it runs out maddy looked up at the ceiling light and then eventually that will flickerout she looked at the other two and then well be like those things outthere in the city foraging in the dark for scraps she immediately wished she hadnt said that they all realized theyd run out of options it hadnt needed spelling out quite so bluntly sal slumped down on one of the armchairs around the breakfast table i guessthats it im so sorry replied foster it does seem like thatsit chapter washington dc thats it then were finished liam looked at the dark hulking silhouette of the support unit standing in the alley besidehim still calm as always free of doubt and despair the sleet had turned to rain and pattered softly around them and the darkness flickered everynow and then with passing light as searchlights from above panned routinely across therooftops across the top of their little backstreet you must assign new mission parameters bobs voice rumbled new mission parameters liam could have laughed cruelly at that there was nothing they could achieve now not in thetime they had left in just under two days time a tiny explosive charge insidebobs head would leave him little more than a comatose giant a mindless dribblingvegetable liam figured he might be able to keep bobs body alive feeding it like a bigbaby keeping it going with protein and water but to what end bob would be goneunable to protect him any more i dont know what to suggest bob whispered liam doyou bob was silent for a few moments negative go back and rejoin the freedom fighters liams smile was thin he wondered what theyd make of theirsuperman captain bob slumped against a tree trunkdrooling long strings of saliva and staring lifelessly at their crackling campfire hardly thestuff of legends hed listened in on those men talking about bob in hushed reverential tones huddled inone of the tents it was almost a form of worship one of them told an exaggerated account tosome newcomers of the raid in which liam had been rescued claiming hed seen ashimmering godly halo around bob as he strode unharmed through the prison campprotecting him from the guards bullets and angels in the clouds lookingprotectively down on him liam wondered if thats how all the legendary figures in history began as tales toldround a campfire then retold and retold through successive generations grandfather tofather father to son each time the tale growing more exaggerated an odd thought occurred to him he wondered if the ancient greek hero achilles had merelybeen a support unit like bob caught up somehow in the siege of troy his presenceunintentionally becoming a part of history or how about the superstrong samson from thebible or attila the hun king leonidas of the spartans he wondered if any of thoseimplausibly heroic characters from history were the unintended sideeffect of a mission liketheirs some other agency team going about their work leaving unavoidable footprints intime footprints in time you must assign new mission parameters footprints in time oh my god he whispered footprints bob remained silent footprints he whispered again bob affirmative i think theres a way we can communicate with the fieldoffice negative tachyon transmissions can only shhh hissed liam listen to me how long will it take us to get to newyork chapter new york maddy realized shed nodded off the steady muted chug of the generator inthe back room had lulled her into a fitful sleep shed been dreaming dreaming of the day shed been snatched from a doomed airliner waking up on this samecot and opening her eyes to see liam slouched on the bed across from hers that daft lopsidedgrin on his face she realized how much she missed liam even bob if she added up the looped mondays andtuesdays theyd all been here in this archway together before things had gonewrong that is it came to several weeks worth of days thats all but itseemed like shed known them both so much longer she missed them another memory floated into her halfconscious mind foster taking them down to the museum ofnatural history shed been there before on school trips but this last time had beendifferent this time not a bored schoolkid gazing at dusty old exhibits behind glass panelsbut seeing these things as precious heirlooms of the past markpoints of a history crying outto her to protect it to preserve it to keep it unchanged she remembered maddy jerked herself out of her drowsy woolgathering oh my god she whispered the generator was still chugging away in the background she climbed offher bunk and looked around the archway sal was sitting at the long desk listlessly staring atthe turnedoff monitors wheres foster sal gestured towards the sliding corrugated door leading to the back room in the backfiddling with the generator i think maddy paced across the floor slid the door to one side and stepped into the smelly darknessfoster torchlight flickered towards her and over the noisy chug of the generator she heard him makehis way over whats up foster i think i think theres a way liam can communicate withus sorry whats that you say he replied cupping his earits noisy he barked lets step out they emerged from the back room and he slid the door shut the noisy percussive rattle of thesicklysounding generator was once more a background thud what were you saying liam i think theres a way liam could try to contact us foster shook his head you know bob cant return atachyon beam transmiss yes i know that she cut in impatiently listen the museum themuseum of natural history what about it when you took us there liam and i were looking at the visitors guest book wewere having a laugh at some of the comments foster shrugged and anyway the museum has kept a guest book in the entrance foyer since the museumfirst opened they have an archive of them that they kept in the basement theyve keptthat archive since like the s i think fosters eyes suddenly widened yes if we go there the old man nodded they might still be down there the hope on his face madehim seem much younger but only for a fleeting moment almost as quickly as it arrived thehope faded away but liam doesnt know all this maddy grinned but he does the security guard there told me liam was standing rightbeside me at the time he was telling us both and if i remembered fosters lined face rumpled with a wide lopsided grin then liam wouldtoo thats what i figured foster nodded yes yes he would hes a smart lad so she continued if he made his way to new york and visited the museumin its possible he could have left a message for us in there foster nodded and that message could give an exact time and location for us to open areturn window for them closer to home maybe in new york would we have enough of a charge left to dothat foster glanced at the blinking leds another red light had turned back to greengenerator isnt going to last much longer by the sounds its making thefuel tanks virtually on empty we need it to get the charge meter up to ten greenlights at a guess but if it can foster chewed his lip deep in thought for a moment if we open a window close enoughto home and even then only for a few seconds wed need an exact time i mean exact his eyes methers then yes we could make a window big enough for liam possibly even forbob then she chewed a fingernail nervously then we have to go see dont we we have to go check out the museum foster took a deep breath i dont think we have any other choice maddy felt her arms and legs trembling oh god why did i have to openmy mouth and suggest this the thought of stepping outside again terrified her butthe prospect of being stuck in this nightmare forever scared her infinitely more foster turned to sal maybe you should stay here sal madelaine and i wont begone long we she shook her head no im coming with you she stood up suckedin a deep breath steadying her own nerves were a team right the three ofus timeriders fosters grin was infectious both girls suddenly found themselves sharing itthe best sal said foster the very best sal shoved the office chair beneath the desk and zipped up her hoodie then what thejahulla are we waiting for maddy nodded atta girl what the jahulla are we waiting for indeedreplied foster ill get the shotgun chapter new york liam gazed out of the window at the streets of new york crowded with brown andgrey stone skyscrapers so tall he had to scrunch down in his seat to look up to catch the verytops of them some buildings he remembered seeing before when foster had taken them through manhattan theempire state building foster said a movie called king kongwas made that featured the building and an eightyfoot gorilla swinging from the top of itliam suspected the old man was joking with him the idea sounded too daft to be made into areal movie he noticed kramers influence was already stamped across the streets of the city largebillboards seemed to hang on every street with the mans face smiling benignly down uponthem messages such as we are here to unite the world in peace unity isprogress i promise you a thousand years without war were stamped beneathhim liam could see troops on the street checkpoints at some of the busier intersectionssoldiers stopping pedestrians and inspecting identification papers above the tall buildingseither side of them hoverjets patrolled the sky and hanging motionless above the hudsonriver he could see another one of those colossal grey command saucers a clear reminderto everyone that the war was over kramers forces had won and that continued resistancewas well futile the uniform liam was wearing was uncomfortable the stiff collarmade his neck itch bob wore a similar uniform ss black with silver buttons andepaulettes an eagle on the left breast pocket and a red armband on the left arm featuring thelooped serpent bob had managed to stop a german army automobile a vw kubelwagen earlier this morningas it cruised down a quiet suburban road in queens the officers were both easily dispensedwith by a quick edgeofthehand chop to the neck the attack bobs suggestion had been a calculated risk some civilians on the road had witnessed it but hurriedalong on their way rather than remain at the scene and risk being questioned somebody mightcall it in it was possible either way the bodies were going to be found sooner orlater liam craned his neck to look up at the patrolling messerschmitt hoverjets and wondered if thealarm had yet been raised to be on the lookout for the stolen vehicle maybe so far at least the risk had paid off well the uniforms and the vehicle had ensuredtheyd only been stopped at one checkpoint and even then bobs fluent german hadgot them through without a problem as the young soldier eyed the deathshead insigniaon their collars and dutifully waved them on up ahead liam recognized the grand front of the museum it looked no different from the lasttime hed seen it except of course for the fluttering crimson pennants dangling fromtwin flagpoles above the main entrance he could see a lot of activity out front workmengoing in and coming out of the building laden with boxes and crates what do you thinks going on there bob looked i do not know liam leaned forward squinting as the kubelwagen slowly edged up the busy street throughseveral traffic lights looks like theyre emptying the place that seemed to make sense of some of what theyd heard last night theyd stopped off for food as liam enjoyed a plate of grits and bacon andbob joylessly slurped a dubiouslooking mixture of porridge and scrambled egg theydlistened in on the quiet talk among the diners regulars truck drivers and localworkers stopping off on the way home there were cautious words being exchanged about someresistance leader down in washington state givin them naziscum a goddamn hiding one of the men perched on a stool wearing a grubby old yankees baseball cap and threadbaredungarees piped up i heard say them fighters is led by the ghost of none otherthan george washington aint no harm them germans can do tohim seeing as how hes a ghost an all bullets go right onthrough aint no ghost jeb sheeoot thatsthe dumbest thing i heard in a long time said another what iheard is he goes by the name of captain fantastic orsomesuch folks are sayin hes some sorta military superhero reckon maybehes like some secret super weapon the guvmint was holdin backon either ways said a third them jerries is gettin kinda nervousbout him aint they murmurs of agreement talk moved on to kramers recent grand announcement that mankinds history was tobe completely wiped clean all of historys past hatreds religious intolerances racialbigotry was to be put behind them and erased and thatmore than anything else seemed to be an issue that enraged the men gathered around thecounter they aint gonna get away with it snapped one of them we foughtthem british for this here country of ours then we fought us a civil war too theycaint take that kinda history off of us an an burn it im hidin my books an stuff my encyclopedias what i bought my kids for school im hidin that stuff in my attic incase them krauties come housesearchin sure as heck aint burnin it like they told us we got to aint right agreed the waitress behind the counter justaint right now up ahead at the museum it seemed kramers dictum was already being put intoaction as bob passed over the intersection swung the vehicle right and parked on the kerb infront of the museum liam got a closer look at what was going on oh boy he uttered on the forecourt in front of the steps leading up to the museums grand entrance hecould see what appeared to be a large pile of bricabrac a rubbish tip of twistedwooden things books and papers frames and furniture the tangled limbs of stuffed animals ofall sizes he watched in growing horror as half a dozen museum workers carried out an egyptiansarcophagus faded flakes of blue and gold paint and shards of ancient dry wood crumbled awaybeneath the fragile object leaving a trail of debris down the steps and then under the watchful eye of several soldiers standing guard they casually tossed iton to the pile where it split and shattered revealing the brittle shrivelled carcass of amummified pharaoh snapping into several pieces as it tumbled stiffly down one side of thelarge pile a dozen yards away several drums of fuel were lined up and a soldier stood beside themwaiting for the order to douse the exhibits and set them on fire my god theyre going to burn it all he whispered it is logical replied bob kramer wishes not to be located by anyfuture agency operatives no history will mean no reference points i hope to god they havent made a start on the things storeddown in the basement liam cast a sideways glance at bob how long have we gotleft before your brain explodes bobs cool eyes narrowed two hours and fiftythree minutes we have little timeto waste liam realized he was trembling from head to foot and cursed the fact that he looked soyoung perhaps the ss uniform he was wearing would be intimidating enough to ensure none ofthe workers nor any soldiers they might encounter would dare to look too closely at him dareto question why someone so young should have an officers rank we must proceed rumbled bob youre right he puffed out nervous breath bob you go tell thosesoldiers we have come directly on kramers orders to supervise the job yes and tell them we will be inspecting the basement area yes bob climbed out of the automobile with liam following in his wake oh boy this better work chapter new york they almost didnt find the museum it was just another dusty grey shell of abuilding amid a landscape of them jagged walls of crumbling masonry and cracked marble thats it are you sure foster nodded as best i can tell thats what was once the museumhe looked up at the sun faint and sick hiding behind scudding clouds it was high in thesky weve only got an afternoon of daylight left come on as the three of them made their way up the rubblecovered steps and into the museumsmain entrance sal spotted a pale face observing them from behind the rusting hulk of a caracross the street look she gasped theyve been following us i never doubted that said foster but theyre getting braver added maddy fire off a shot to scarethem away foster racked the shotgun and aimed it at the sky but then he stopped actually no probably best i conserve the ammo for when we really need it the girls looked uncomfortably at each other come on lets get this done he said leading the way over the rubble and stepping into the gloomy cavernous interior of themuseum maddy snapped on her torch foster another their twin beams picked form out of the darknesstwisted beams of metal dustcovered masonry the scorched and charred remains of a grandwoodwork staircase across the way wheres the big dinosaur skeleton asked sal the museum must have been emptied before their nuclear war i suppose it makes sense said maddy her soft voice echoing around the insideof the entrance hall if back in people knew a nuclear exchange was on thehorizon theyd have moved all the valuables to special nuclear bunkers and stuffright do you think theyd have taken everything those guest books too well have to see where did that guard say they stored them i think he said they stored them down in the museums basement some sort of anarchive down there foster panned his torch across the floor there were doorways leading to other wings of themuseum but he knew where the basement doors were hed visited this place often enoughover the years when not busy saving history follow me up ahead on the right theres a double door that leads down to thebasement maddy followed him as he stepped lightly across the dusty marble floor sal cast one lastglance over her shoulder at the outline of the front doorway expecting to see the hunchedsilhouette of one of the creatures curiously peeking in she turned back to see maddy and foster a dozen yards ahead hey wait for meshe whispered fosters torchlight picked out a faded sign on double doors tostorage basement staff access only he pushed against them andwith the gritty sound of rubble and debris being pushed across the floor on the far side theystiffly yielded he poked his head and torch through the gap there was a stairwell beyond he pushed againstthe doors until they were open enough to squeeze through and stepped inside his torch pickedout smooth concrete walls and steps leading down come on he said maddy reached out for sals hand and could feel it trembling uncontrollablyhey its ok sal just down here well get what were after and beback home again she whispered i i cant go underground again i cant she hissed inreply understandable really the sensation of feeling trapped cornered especially aftertheir runin on the subway maddy wasnt too keen either im not going to leave you alone up here come onsal well be quick sal gritted her teeth ook they made their way slowly down the stairs finally joining foster at the bottom he wasplaying his torch around the entrance to the large basement floor beyond the stairwell unlikeabove the floor wasnt thick with piles of rubble and debris but instead coated in asiltlike carpet of fine dust across the floor and along the walls lined with racks and racksof empty shelves was a thick layer of decades worth of dust foster turned to look at the girls theres nothing here its gone allgone chapter new york the museum worker led bob and liam down the steps so we store them down here he spoke slowly along with all the othervaluable things due to be destroyed he added his voicebarely managing to conceal the bitter hatred he obviously felt towards the pair of them they followed him down the last few steps and into the basement where liam could see endlesscrates and boxes stacked tidily across the floor grouped in orderly categories silentlyawaiting their turn to be carried out and tossed on to the bonfire outside liam studied the mans face and all of a sudden realized there was something familiarabout it he was good with faces how can i possibly know him so the worker looked up at them with an expression that told him hedhappily stab them to death if he thought he could get away with it you need me foranything else bob dutifully faked not being able to understand him it was liam who was going to pretend tospeak barely passable english ja ve are seekingzerr visitorrs guest book the workers eyebrows lifted curiously you want the guestbooks jadas ist corrrect he shrugged an odd request he gestured for them to follow him he led the way along a passageway between shelves that ran from the floorto the ceiling twenty yards down the worker stopped pulled a short stepladder out of a nookand climbed it to the top theyre all kept up here he said patting a cardboard box verry good said liam with a clipped emotionless accent you want me to get them down for you the man asked ja get zzzem down the man pulled out the box unleashing a small shower of dust motes all in heregoing all the way back to but he added with contempt i supposethisll be going up in smoke along with everything else i guess liam cocked his head there was something about the workers voice too that was vaguelyfamiliar im sure ive met this fella before somewhere the young man placed the box on the ground and pulled out the top book leatherbound withpages of thick cartridge paper the handwriting of recent visitors scrawled across every pagerecent that is up until eight months ago when the invasion of eastcoast america hadbegun the guest book the man said passing it over to liam every visitor isfree to sign it and write a message then it came to liam right then where hed seen the man before the security guard he looked once more at the young face of the worker more closely this time theheartshaped mole emerging from his brow this man looked to be in his midtwenties thesecurity guard whod spoken to him and maddy he mustve been in his mid to latesixties the worker standing before him was related somehow not related fool the resemblance was unmistakable its the same man liam felt an irrational urge to reach out and hug him the man was a connection through timea link to where they wanted to be he could almost smell home almost glimpse the worldback in it felt good ah sod it liam blurted all of a sudden im no bloodynazi bob cocked his head curiously and looked at him the worker did likewise neither of us are im irish actually and he he pointed at boband hes well hes not german either the workers expression remained frozen perhaps suspicious that this was some kind ofa devious test truth is were from the future and were here to put history rightarent we bob bob shrugged that is correct liam grinned ive actually met you in the year guess what yourestill working here youre a security guard guarding these very books so ithappens the workers eyes narrowed i i dont understand you dont have to understand i just wanted you to know that liamreached out and grasped the mans arm i want you to know that were goingto make things right again its all going to change and when it does itll belike this invasion never happened the young mans expression changed hang on are you fellas resistancefighters resistance fighters it would make explaining things a lot easier than trying to convince himthey were time travellers liam nodded yes as it happens thats exactlywhat we are well why the heck didnt you say the names sam penney liam held out a hand my names liam so what uh what were you sayin about meeting me before sorry forget that i was thinking of someone else now listen can you helpus sure sure anything i can do anything at all i can could you keep a watch on the stairs for me let me know if anyones comingdown sure well be just a few minutes here sam penney then well be gone againcan you keep this a secret not tell anyone sure the young man looked from liam to bob so whatre you fellasgonna do his expression changed youre not putting a bomb or anythinglike that down here are you no nothing like that none of these precious things will be damaged all right youhave my word so you do oh ok so what are you i cant tell you that sam all i can say is that its part of thefight back all right you have to trust me on this penney gave it a scant moments thought then nodded guess thats goodenough for me so you keep watch at the top of the stairwell all right give us a fewminutes you got it liam watched the man walk back up the stairs then he looked down at the open visitorsbook in his hands he turned to bob so what do i write they will need to know an exact geographical location i will give you thecoordinates down to a yard in accuracy also they will require a timestamp year monthday hour and minute right and the other thing how do we make sure theyre going to be able to find this book in over four decades time you know wheneverythings about to be torched bob stared at him blankly i have no suggestions chapter new york theres nothing left whispered maddy panning her torch aroundthe basement her voice was a weak defeated croak i thought maybe just maybe there are a lot of shelves down here said foster we should spread outand check them all theyre all empty foster dont you see ifthat guest book was stored down here along with all the rest of the museums paperworkthen it was probably looted long ago along with everything else maybe used as fuel for acampfire by the survivors or those things outside fosters face tensed as he looked around liams a clever lad he wouldhave made sure it was somewhere hidden somewhere safe yeah where exactly and howre we going to find out where a sign whispered sal the others turned to look at her standing outside in the stairwell on the bottom stepa sign she said again you see a sign no i dont see one but thats what he wouldhave done if he came down here he would have left us some sort of a sign her facelooked hopeful wouldnt he foster nodded shes right some marker that would have survived this amount of time something permanent he walked back into the stairwelland panned his torch around and right here somewhere thats where idleave a sign come on he said everyone look they did as he instructed their torch beams snaking along the rough breezeblocks of thestairwell walls looking for something etched into the concrete something scratched on thepiping running down the side something carved into the wooden double doors leading on to thebasement floor something that might last fortyfour years and never be completely erased come on liam whispered foster if youve been down here let usknow they searched in silence for a few minutes carefully sweeping their torches across thewalls the stair handrail heating pipes running up the side of the doorway an electricaljunction box even a fire extinguisher still sitting on its wall mount butfinding absolutely nothing maddy sighed maybe he left a sign but it was scrubbed off or plastered over or wornaway its been a long time she shook her head frustrated or maybe hedidnt come back this way and he and bob stayed in thewashington area or the words hung in the silence between them unsaid or maybe they just died back then sals head dropped her dark fringe flopping down over her eyes it was a wasteof time she muttered were never going to find them maybe sals right foster nodded we should probably think aboutheading back whilst its still light outside her dark eyebrows were locked with a frown as she gazed down at her feet we could always try again tomorrow morning as soon as the sun comesup continued foster well have eight or nine hours of sunlight to lookaround down here actually liam may well have left us a clue upstairs in the main hall for all we know well have more timetomorrow maddy reached out and patted sals shoulder hey sal fosters right wecan try again tomorrow dont cry it was just a im not crying she replied shrugging off her hand and squatting quicklydown to the ground she reached for the floor her fingers splayed out in the dust probing afaint groove in the concrete floor sal give me your torch she said to maddy what is it just give me the torch she snapped maddy passed it to her and watched curiously as the young girl leaned closer to the groundblowing the dry plaster dust away from the floor she shone the torch at the small grooveetched into the concrete what is it i think its letters letters scratched into the floor peeringclosely she tilted the torchs beam so that it played obliquely across the faint worngrooves throwing them into much sharper relief foster squatted down beside her what is it sal an i and an h it looks likeand i think its an an arrow maddy dropped down beside them and studied the letters then she gasped that i is an l see the foot of theletters faint but its there can you see it my god yes said foster sal traced the second letter with her finger and that h she said that could be maddy grinned yes a bill be damned it is a b l and b liam and bob thats it said foster he pulled himself tiredly to his feet wincingwith the effort but grinning like a schoolboy hes been here that means he has left a message for us oh god liam yelpedmaddy with joy youre a star sal jumped to her feet her face lit up like a jackolantern theyre cominghome she squealed with delight foster nodded ok then he said hushing them with his hand thearrow hes telling us to go in and we make a left turn they stepped into the basement turning left and seeing ahead of them a wall of rusting metalbrackets and empty shelves but theres nothing on the shelves said maddy therell be another message somewhere said foster check thefloor both girls on hands and knees swept aside the light silt on the floor around the entrance tothe basement probing the ground with their fingers for any more distinct grooves fostermeanwhile ran his torch slowly up the breezeblock wall to the left of the double doors longago painted a joyless mint green it was now flaking off in patches where a creeping damp hadseeped down from the museum above his beam picked out a litany of scratches and gougesendless decades of careless knocks by careless porters wheeling the museums heavyexhibits in and out of storage come on liam talk to us the paint covered over some older acts of clumsiness and was gouged away by newer ones butnone of these marks foster guessed had happened in recent decades certainly not since theworld ended sometime in the past his finger ran over a faint curved groove an indistinct and incompletecurve that might once have been part of a letter or a number he traced the curve dislodginga fine shower of dust exposing more of it c lightly blowing on the wall more dust curled away in a light cloud revealing a string ofwhat looked like numbers i think ive got something the girls clambered to their feet and a moment later were standing beside him peeringclosely at the faint string of figures scratched into the concrete wall it looks like a code of some sort c s p then a dash said sal five three seventhen another dash nine eight one zero then another dash and then five sevennine what does it mean foster shook his head i dont know we need to know insisted maddy she stepped back from the wall panning hertorch around if thats liam again its got to mean something theanswers got to be something we can see as were standing here right that would make sense replied foster she walked a few yards along the wall sweeping her torch along the empty shelves buttheres nothing here she whispered under her breath frustratednothing her torch beam lanced up and down the rusting vertical support struts and then came to reston a small square tag wait a sec she stepped forward examining it more closely a small metal frame attached to the bracketwith screws that were now little more than flaking nubs of rust contained within the frame ayellowed strip of dampstained card numbers almost too faint to read printed on it she flicked the torch along to the next vertical strut nothing but theone after had another tag like this she hurried over to it and found another curled vanillastrip of card with a fading sequence of numbers printed on it its their filing system she called out three letters threenumbers four numbers then three numbers thats right said foster shining his torch on the wall foster smiled hes telling us which shelf to find chapter new york it took them the better part of an hour to find it there were quite a few tagswith numbers too faded to read and others where the cardboard insert had long ago fallenout but two hundred yards down from the basement entrance on the opposite wall on a shelf thatrequired maddy to climb up to reach they found the correct tag and nothing else maddy wiped dust and sweat from her forehead and slumped against the metal support itcreaked and groaned softly dislodging flakes of rust and motes of dust nothing here she called down to them nothing at all there must be something said sal more a plea thana comment its bare somebody made a clean sweep a long time ago the three sat in defeated silence for a moment the coarse rasping of their breathing echoingdown the empty basement floor accompanied by the sound of dripping water somewhere faroff well be losing daylight soon said foster weve done whatwe can i dont want to be outside in the dark whispered sal then i suggest we leave maddy nodded all right she pulled herself up on to her feet and carefully swung one leg over theside of the woodenslat shelf she reached for the torch casting a cone of light thick withswirling dancing motes of dust towards the wall as she did she noticed within the circleof light on the wall one particular block of concrete more clearly outlined than theothers no surely not wait a moment she said to the others swinging her leg back on to the shelfon all fours she crept carefully across the creaking slats of wood mindful to place herweight where the metal support brackets passed underneath she reached out for the block andoptimistically gave it a nudge it shifted with a sharp gritty scrape that echoed loudly likethe lid of a stone sarcophagus shifting aside what have you found up there asked foster he must have heard would you believe it theres a loose breezeblock im justjust going to pull it she eased it slowly out of the hole in the wall heavy it slipped through her hands landingon the shelf she heard a wooden slat crack under its weight and the entire metal framerattled and complained loudly be careful maddy said sal im ok oh my god this has to be it she ducked down thrusting her torch towards the footwide hole in the wall peering into theswirling dusty space beyond it was a small space just a cavity between walls littered withfossilized rat droppings and strung with webs but nestling in the middle of it unmistakablewas a large leatherbound book oh my god grimacing she reached in and gently took hold of it lifting it outthrough the hole in the wall she wiped dust from her glasses and shone her torch down on theleather cover and grinned its here ive got it she heard both sal and foster yelp with excitement pulling the stiff leather cover open she quickly flipped through the thick pages of thebook whats the last possible date that liam and bob could have come here doyou reckon she asked with bob terminating six months after mission inception that would make it acouple of days after the window we tried opening in washington that wouldbe fifth of march said sal maddy leafed through the pages noting the dates left by various guests there were many fromthe previous year but they quickly dried up in the late summer of perhaps the museum was closed then she reached the last page and a last entry from a visitor by the name of jessicaheffenburger the museum must close today the enemy is about totake our city i could cry she scanned the other entries on the page they all shared the same sentiment sadnessbitterness and defeat a broken people seemingly accepting the inevitable paying onelast visit to their beloved museum but then in a fainter ink she spotted it written with a different pen in the gap leftbetween one comment and another scrawled in the untidy hand of a person writingquickly me and bob would really like to come home now please lat n long w time she crawled across the slats with the book cradled in her handsand looked down at foster and sal standing in the aisle below both of them staring up at herwith expectant expressions you find anything asked foster she tore the page out of the book grabbed her torch swung her legs over the side and jumpeddown on to the floor creating a small mushroom cloud of dust hes right here she said flourishing the page in front of her facethen her voice caught and she found her shoulders shaking as adrenalinefuelled laughterfilled the silence of the basement he freakin well did it chapter new york bob and liam took the steps up and found the museum worker sam dutifully standingguard at the top of the stairs just as theyd asked him to were all done down there said liam quietly thanks for lookingout for us look the man eyed them both you said something abouteverything changing to how it should be there really wasnt time for a full explanation although liam would have liked to havegiven the man that for helping them out time is going to correct itself liam smiled and everything is going tobe all right once more i promise you he reached out and patted sams armand guess what what sometime in the future i reckon ill be seeing you again so i will sam penney watched them go scratching his head dumbfounded trying to make sense of thenonsensical things the young lad had just said and beginning to conclude that he must bequite out of his mind when a guard barked at him to help some of the other workers lift aheavy display case down the hallway to be stacked ready for burning liam and bob stepped out through the double doors on to the museumsmain entrance floor busy with workmen in boiler suits toiling under the gaze of sternfacedsoldiers bob dutifully returned the clipped salute from the guard standing in the mainentrance with a barked heil kramer outside the bonfire had already started and tongues of orange flame chased dancing flakes ofash up into the overcast sky liam could feel the searing heat on his face as they made theirway down the grand front steps across the forecourt towards the street amid theheatshimmering pile of burning antiquities he spotted the end of the egyptian sarcophagussticking out of the pile the dry wood blackening and paint work four millennia oldsmouldering and peeling off the side the workers stood in a pitifully sad group watching the exhibits burn beyond the forecourton the street citizens were gathering sombrely witnessing the valuable relics of history andtheir national heritage disappear in a column of acrid smoke on the skyline liam noticed the pall of other plumes of smoke drifting up into the coldwinter sky and guessed that across the city books were burning priceless paintings wereburning historical documents journals and records were all burning pulled from publiclibraries and private galleries he imagined the very same spectacle being duplicated inamericas other main cities in the next few days and duplicated across the cities ofkramers reich over the next few weeks history being wiped clean purged wholesale fromthe face of the earth he felt physically sick they stepped on to the street pushing past silent faces filled with hatred as they glared athis and bobs black uniforms liam was relieved to see the kubelwagen still parked up outside and no soldiers standingaround it on the lookout for the culprits whod stolen it bob climbed in quickly and turned on the engine do you think theyll find our message asked liam as hesettled into the passengers seat and bob eased the vehicle through the crowd back on tothe street i mean weve hidden it away pretty good maybe too good we will know this in approximately seventynine minutes they proceeded south down an orderly central park west on one side of them the cityspark all winterbare trees and drab ochre grass on the other endless office blocks andtraffic nudging forward between red traffic lights it started to rain joyless greasy dropsspattered against the windscreen and soaked dispirited plodding pedestrians outside liam truly wouldnt be sorry to leave this drab browbeaten world behind were on our way home now hopefully he wondered what the archway looked like who might be occupying it here in if indeedanyone was more to the point he wondered what the girls and foster were up to rightnow chapter new york foster noticed them as they jogged quickly down the steps outside the frontentrance not just a couple of dozen of them peering curiously from the dark interiors ofgutted buildings but a hundred or more of them fresh meat the words spreading oh god uttered sal theres so many maddy grabbed her hand protectively foster fire your gun he shook his head i dont think the noise will scare them now but maybe these are ones who dont know your gunkills oh they know all right otherwise im sure theyd already be onus the street leading south central park west was thick with them like some bizarresilent rally to their left was what was once central park now nothing more than a dust bowldotted with the charcoal skeletons of scorched tree trunks or the frazzled stumps oflongdead bushes if the devil was given a say in how a city park should be landscaped fosterimagined he would go with something like this it was wide open terrain though nothing for the creatures to hide behind or jump out fromfar better than picking their way along some narrow street strewn with rusted vehicles we should cut across the park he said then were on the east side its a short way through to the hudson river theycould then follow the river down to the bridge the riverside boulevard was broad all the waydown to the williamsburg bridge and theyd only need to keep an eye out for anythingcoming at them from their right lets go he said leading the way down the last of the steps across theforecourt through twisted and collapsed iron railings over an intersection all but hidden bythe tangle of rusted carcasses of abandoned cars the lateafternoon sun poked through dirty brown clouds as they pushed their way through thefossilized remains of a decorative hedgerow and into central park theyre following said sal her voice trembling foster glanced back over his shoulder to see the creatures moving together as a giant packhundreds of them shifting across central park west and climbing railings squeezing throughdead hedges to enter the park in their wake ok theyre following but at least theyre keeping a distance although as he said that he noticed that the distance seemed to be narrowing as some of themore courageous of them edged out several dozen yards ahead of the herd he wondered if theywere ringleaders pack leaders individuals with something to prove to theirfollowers the girls picked up their pace swift strides quickly turning into an untidy jog kicking upclouds of dust and ash foster brought up the rear the gap between them narrowed further as the creatures hunchedover scuttling becamemore of a hunchedover trot the braver creatures came closer still now thirty or forty feetfrom them foster turned and glanced at the nearest of them male by the look of himtall and painfully thin a few tufts of pale hair growing in isolated islands on his scalp andrags of clothing dangling from his powderwhite body he could hear thecreatures laboured breath and a keening whimper as it yearned to close the gap betweenthem yet understandably it feared the dark metal object in fosters hand perhaps itsmind remembered a solitary word from a longforgotten language gun and it knew the metal tube could spit death in an instant for what seemed an interminable age they maintained this moving standoff the girls joggingacross the dead park foster struggling along several yards behind them his ragged breathgrowing ever more laboured and the silent herd of creatures easily keeping pace butslowly warily closing in the other side of the park look shouted maddy across the empty concrete bowl of a duck pond and the corroded aframes of what had once beenswings he could see a row of stunted black trees and dark metal railings beyond that was thavenue running north to south down the side of the park fifty yards along he could see a way out that wouldnt require them to stop and scalethe railings a gateway then across th avenue theyd be on to east ndstreet half a dozen blocks of ruined buildings on either side and then theyd hit theriver but this is where they may jump us he decided as they pickedtheir way over rubble and weaved through abandoned cars those creatures would finally closethe gap and be upon them he decided now was as good a time as any to demonstrate once morewhat his gun could do he turned round stopped and levelled his gun at the nearestcreature he fired throwing the pitiful thing on its back with a shrill highpitched scream it lay onthe ground in a growing pool of its own blood bony legs thrashing the ground wildly the restof the herd immediately turned on their heels and fled across the ashgreypark like rabbits startled by a farmers gun just reminding them were dangerous maddy nodded good but then she looked at the weapon eleven shotsleft foster racked another round into the shotgun yes eleven they made their way quickly along east nd and ten minutes later emerged on to the broadduallane expanse of fdr drive heading south parallel with the hudson river ahead of them were the shattered remains of queensboro bridge collapsed in the middlebeyond that no more than three quarters of a mile down the hudson foster could see the tallmetal support towers of the williamsburg bridge and on the far side of the river the squatbrick and industrial buildings chimney pots and cranes of brooklyns dockside they rested for a moment on a wooden bench overlooking the muddy bank of the river belowall three of them catching their breath just over the bridge and then were home and dry raspedfoster you ok asked maddy im fine just a little winded let me grab some air they hung on for a moment looking back the way theyd come for the moment it seemedlike theyd lost the creatures you girls ready they both nodded he led them down the wide boulevard all three of them happy to have the broad river to theirleft and four lanes of wide empty road to their right another ten minutes and they were hurrying up a narrow brick stairwell to the williamsburgbridges pedestrian walkway the sick orange sun was now low in the sky and looking fora place to settle among the broken horizon of ruined buildings long violetshadows were spreading across the river reaching for the building on the far side nearly home gasped sal looks like were going to make itshe said grinning at maddy the walkway just wide enough for three to walk abreast and caged by high sides of basketwire ran above the traffic lanes over the bridge as they hurried along they looked down ontwo lanes of crumbling tarmac filled with the ancient rusting hulks of bumpertobumpertraffic a soft wind moaned through shattered windscreens and across car seats and the bonesof those whod died at the wheel suddenly mysteriously decades ago a vehiclegraveyard filling the bridge with hushed whispers of torment and pain foster concentrated on the way ahead just another three or four minutes across the bridgedown the steps on the far side a turn into the backstreet at the base of the bridge thentheyd be home hed checked that the generator was ticking over when they left provided the thing hadmanaged to keep on going while theyd been out and not choke or stall on them heguessed the displacement machine would be ready to use by now he hoped liams message had given them an exact time and once theyd entered thecoordinates into the computer theyd know the exact location if the lad was thinkingsmart he knew precisely where that location should be despite all three of them being exhausted and winded their pace quickened as the far side ofthe lifeless sluggish polluted river below loomed the prospect of safety was just aheadjust minutes away the prospect of bringing home liam of bringing home bob a heroictower of muscle who could protect them from virtually anything urged them on ever faster they were nearly there and foster had begun to allow himself to think thatthis nightmare might just be nearly over there was a scream he spun round to see a twisting branch of lean milkwhite arms pulling at sal through a largehole in the basketwire cage oh no screamed maddy theyve got hold of her chapter new york sals arms and legs thrashed manically in their grasp oh god noheeelp me help me foster shouldered his shotgun but realized he couldnt fire for fear of hitting salmaddy rushed forward and began kicking punching and scratching the arms pulling at salthrough the crosshatch of rusting wire he could see a pack of half a dozen of the creaturesfighting each other to get a grip on her they were standing on the roof of a truckscab the large hole in the rusting wire he guessed had been made recently perhaps only inthe last half an hour it was a trap he realized some of the creatures must have rushed ahead must have known they were headingthis way must have known they crossed the bridge using the raised pedestrian walkwaytheyd found a place they could reach up to theyd made a hole in the wireand waited more of the creatures scrambled up over the truck and on to the cabs roof theyslammed against the wire noisily with their fists snarling at them through the gaps sals legs were being pulled out from beneath her and through the gaping hole in thewire heeelp me maddy desperately tried to peel off the long pale fingers wrapped tightly round her anklesher legs her waist but then found them snatching at her hair roughlypulling the glasses from her face attempting to find a firm hold to pull her through aswell sal was all but through the hole now nothing left but her hands wrapped tightly round thesharp ends of wire the creatures clawed fingers snatched and twisted at hers tryingto wrench them free as she screamed and screamed and screamed foster aimed the shotgun at the pack of creatures no longer concerned that sal might catchsome of the blast the crosshatched wire would deflect some of the shotguns blast butmost of it would certainly fly through and inflict damage on their tightly packed bodies he fired one of the creatures was thrown off the roof of the cab others screamed angrily as thescattered pellets from the shotgun cartridge painfully lashed their bare bodies but theycontinued their eager work their long claws twisting sals fingers off the wire one byone as maddy desperately punched and scratched and screamed at them the last of sals fingers were suddenly wrenched free fosters eyes met the girls for one frozen moment in time wide confusedterrified her mouth an elongated o from which a shrill highpitchednooooooo erupted like the whistle of asteam train the creatures carried her away between them with alarming speed down over the trucksshattered windscreen over the engine hood down on to the road holding her body aloft betweenthem like some squirming trophy she disappeared from view her thin desperate screaming voice fading as they carried herdown the bridge weaving through the vehicle graveyard back towards manhattan maddy turned to look at foster her pale face frozen with shock and dawning realization ofwhat had just happened foster she managed to whisper we we have to foster she said again unable to say anything else shes gone madelaine shes gone he replied he tried desperatelyto blank out of his mind the fate that awaited her we we hhave to go after her gasped maddy already beginning to squirmher way through the hole in the wire foster took a step forward and grabbed her wrist no maddy no she struggled to pull herself free we cant leave her she screamedtears rolling down her scratched and dirtsmudged cheeks a part of him wanted to follow her through to give chase down the road if not to rescuesal then at least to get close enough to take aim and attempt to give the poor child a quickand painless death but that would be foolish it was obvious to him now obvious that those creatures had been biding their time waitinguntil the three of them were boxed in on the bridge had dropped their guard and were certainthey were home and dry they were clever enough to set a trap whats more they musthave known all along where theyd been holed up madelaine he snapped as she squirmed in his grasp they set this upthis was a trap she continued to struggle in the distance echoing down the bridge they heard salsfaint cry pleading for help once more she shuddered her shoulders shaking convulsively as she sobbed im comingsal im coming foster struggled to pull her back we have to go maddy theres nothingwe can do for her im not leaving her behind foster grabbed maddys jaw and turned her face to look at him come on he snapped if they get a hold of us too then itsall over do you understand its all over foreveryone chapter new york bob parked the kubelwagen down the backstreet as liam looked out of thewindscreen at the row of brick arches running underneath the williamsburg bridge were home said liam incorrect replied bob we are back wherewe are not yet back when liam shrugged it felt like they were almost home sittingoutside on the kerb looking at the familiar old brickwork in place of the sliding corrugateddoor were two large wooden doors across them both was painted the sign dang li poh laundry plumes of steam spouted from a pipe beside thewooden doors out into the cool lateafternoon air bob consulted his internal clock we have seventeen minutes until the time wespecified for them to open the window liam leaned forward to look up at the sky there were more hoverjets circling the skylineabove manhattan patrolling in pairs he wondered if anyone was looking for them yet youre right no time to waste he opened the door and climbed out adjusting the black uniform and putting the cap on hishead tugging the peak low to shadow as much of his boyish face as possible bob joined him on the cobbled pavement strewn with rubbish from a kickedover garbagepail liam rapped his knuckles on the wooden door he waited anxiously for aminute before rapping again on the wood a moment later a small service hatch in the lefthanddoor slid open and a ruddyfaced oriental man in a white apron peered out yeah he snapped irritably before registering the deathshead insigniaand pitchblack uniforms liam cleared his throat you will let us in immediately he said affecting aclipped officious tone whuh er what what wrong we have reason to believe these premises are harbouring a criminal the mans eyes widened we not have bad man here you will let us enter now or i shall have you all arrested the mans eyes widened still further i let you in one moment he slid the hatch closed and then a few seconds later they heard bolts slide and the woodendoor creaked open the man waved them in you come in see no criminal here liam and bob stepped inside and almost immediately felt a fug of warm moist air against theirfaces the arch was dimly lit by several bulbs dangling from the arched ceiling you see no bad man here snapped the chinese man liam looked around the gloomy interior there were about a dozen men and women standing overtubs of steaming water stirring clothes with ladles scrubbing them with bars of soap strungacross the archway were laundry lines from which clothing and bed linen hung to dry we laundry make superclean for customer the man explained you will tell your people to leave the building immediately ordered liam the chinese mans eyes narrowed why you want us leave hmm he hadnt actually thought that far ahead liamhesitated a moment too long as he struggled to conjure up an answer the chinese man squinted suspiciously you just boy not real soldier pig you steal uniform an try rob my laundry liam stared at him helplessly er was all he could manage the man continued to glare at him this is trick youleave now bob stepped in to help liam out he reached for the gun in his holster wrenched it out andaimed it at the mans forehead in one fast and fluid motion this is not a trick the mans suspicious expression was instantly wiped away and replaced with wideeyedfear as he stared down the barrel of the pistol you will instruct the personnel here to leave these premises immediately or you willbe terminated bobs deep voice thundered the man swallowed nervously then eyes still anxiously locked on the hand gun he shoutedout in cantonese over his shoulder at the others through the gaps in the hanging laundry liamcould see fear on their faces as they spotted the gun levelled squarely at their boss quicklythey dropped their bars of soap and their stirring ladles and filed out ducking under thelaundry lines and heading for the open door they disappeared outside and a moment later the wooden door swung shut leaving liam and bobin the faint familiar gloom of their arch bob once more consulted his internal clock seven minutes and twentynine secondsuntil our specified window and how long have we got until your brain explodes eyes fluttered sixtyfour minutes and three seconds liam pushed his way past a damp bed sheet and found a stool on which to sit down soif this fails if theres no window you and i will have less than an hour lefttogether affirmative i guess thats enough time to say our goodbyes bob cocked his head curious you will be sad sad that youre going to be left a vegetable of course i flippin willi mean after all this time youve just about worked out how to appear less like acomplete idiot and more like a human itd be a waste to be sure he sighed andshook his head hang on what am i saying i guess maybe its the humans that arethe idiots bob shrugged not entirely understanding what liam was muttering on about liam laughed at that such a human gesture six minutes chapter new york the generator was still chugging when they got back foster slapped the vibratingand warm cylinder head relieved hed been half expecting to find it still and silenton their return having either become clogged up and choked to death on dodgy diesel or thefuel tank having run dry he emerged from the back room to check the time machines charge display they werenearly there two leds were still red he guessed the machine had to be poweredup enough totry opening a window in about twenty minutes he booted up the computer system waiting for it to finish its startup routine properlybefore opening the geopositioning interface software and tapping in the coordinates thatwere scribbled in faded ink on the yellowed page before him he whispered a prayer that liamhad written down the numbers correctly the screen zeroed in on a portion of a map of new york oh good lad he gasped over the noisy chug coming through the open doorof the back room theres a smart lad maddy looked up slumped in one of the armchairs around the communal table her voice soundedtired and small and defeated what what is it foster right here said foster theyre right here right inside thearchway the coordinates theyre saving us as much power asthey can opening the window right here that might just conserve enough power for usto bring them both back she smiled weakly he got up out of his seat to join maddy at the table on his way over he pulled the door tothe back room shut reducing the deafening rattling chug of the generator clearly strugglingon the last dregs of fuel to a muted background rumble he sat down heavily in an armchair beside her its almost overmadelaine its over for sal she replied not necessarily she looked up at him how do you mean he rubbed his face tiredly time travel is very muddy stuff its anunpredictable science if liam and bob can go back and fix things second time round thenits possible just possible that the corrective waveof time realigning shifting everything back to normality might also return sal tous she sat up do you think so its possible just that she grasped his hand poor sal tears cleaned fresh tracks down hergrimecovered cheeks i cant bear to think what what then dont think about it if she comes back tous if she comes back to us those things that happened to her well theywont have happened shell have absolutely no memory of whats been goingon here these last few days shell foster he stopped talking maddys head was cocked her eyes narrowed squinting as shelistened to something did you hear that hear what i thought i heard then he heard it himself something moving in the backstreetoutside the skittering of a loose chunk of rubble kicked carelessly across the ash anddustcovered cobblestones the light brush of something againstthe corrugatediron shutter door then tapping their eyes met and both knew what it meant theyve found us havent they whispered maddy i think so the tapping on the shutter door suddenly became a frustrated bang maddy jerked in her seatand whimpered theyre trying to find a way in said foster cant we open the displacement window right now he looked anxiously across the floor at the row of leds on the time machine eleven of themblinking together awaiting a twelfth to turn green not yet we open it too soon and we could blow this one chance scratching he could hear a scratching scraping noise maddy held her breath listening to the soft noise slowly growing louder more intensewhatre they doing i dont know but he did theyre probing the walls for a weak area perhaps theyvealready found some loose bricks and theyre now scraping out the crumbling mortarbetween them he looked again at the leds willing that last one to flicker over to green they both heard the clatter of a brick falling to the ground outside oh godno maddy hissed theyre coming through the walls foster reached for the shotgun on the table maddy snapped on a torch and studied the wallsfor a sign of their handiwork her breath rattled and fluttered noisily in the quietstillness i i dont want to go like like ssal dont worry he said panning a second torch along the base of the archwalls i wont let them take us i promise you that his beam passed over a small mound of dry grey powder on the floor there she moved her beam over to the pale dust then worked it up the wall until she glimpsed ahairline crack of daylight and a solitary brick shuffling in the wall dislodging morecrumbling mortar on to the ground oh my god you see that yes foster replied getting to his feet and stepping across the floor towardsthe front wall he aimed his gun at the loose brick the brick fidgeted again and thenshuffled inward falling on to the floor with a heavy thud foster glimpsed one of theboiledfish eyes through the hole left behind and fired they heard a highpitched scream and anguished cries of rage outside the scratchingintensified now coming from several other places along the wall oh god foster its everywhere its there was a bang and the sound of something heavy clattering on to the floor in the backroom jesus snapped foster theyre in he ran across the floorand quickly rammed home a locking bolt on the sliding door what they were distracting us at the front meanwhile working on the brick walls at theback his eyes locked on hers theyre in the back room there was a heavy thud against the sliding door leaving a bulge in the thin metal sheetingthe hinges anchored to the old brick wall rattled loosely and rustcoloured brick dustcascaded down maddy screamed another heavy thud left another jagged dent this door isnt going to take too much more of that shouted foster oh god no foster i dont want to die like this he looked again at the charge display cursing that last red led please change colour wwhat what if we open the window now foster can we he grimaced as the door rattled again from another blow and more brick dust settled on hishead and shoulders through the thin metal door he could hear them whimpering crying andsnarling frustrated by this last obstacle foster now open the window now ok its got to be nearly there near enough he handed her the gun and shifted to one side so that she could replace his weight againstthe door hold this as long as you can if they break through youve got nine shots leftdo you understand she nodded i understand seven for tthem aand thats right he smiled grimly two for us another heavy thud the top hinge rattled loose from the brick wall showering maddy withgrit and dust foster grasped her hand tightly and squeezed then he scrambled across the floor towards thecomputer terminals quickly opening up the interface dialogue box with the time machine andtapping in the coordinates on the keyboard the door rattled from another heavy blow and the second hinge halfway down the door lurchedoff the wall showering her again foster hurry hurry he scanned the numbers hed typed checking them against liamsuntidily scrawled figures god help us if ive got this wrong he hit enter on the keyboard chapter new york liam fiddled with the stiff starchy collar around his neck irritated by thestitching of the oak leaves and the deathshead insignia he undid the top button how much longer now bob was standing in the middle of the floor surrounded by laundry lines draped with linensheets his eyes blinked scheduled window imminent precisely fiftyseven seconds from now liam realized his stomach was churning with nervous anticipation in less than a minute theywere going to know whether maddy had remembered the museums guest book in less than aminute liam would know whether he was going to be stuck in the past forever you see anything negative no sign of density probing yet and of course if the window didnt arrive then bob was due to selfterminate shortlyleaving liam all alone he wasnt sure he was going to be able to cope with thatwondering when the men in dark uniforms were going to round him up and put him back in one ofthose camps or worse execute him by firing squad for killing their soldiers stealing thecar stealing the uniforms ten seconds said bob come on maddy please remember the museum guest book he stood up ducking under a laundry line to join bob in the middle of thefloor so this is it bob cross your fingers why its meant to be lucky why it just is its oh forget it window due in six seconds five four liam clenched his chattering teeth his fingers crossed tightly round each other for goodluck knuckles bulging beneath his pale skin come on come on hewhispered three two here we go one nothing liam looked around them snatching the linen sheets to one side in case they hid theshimmering outline of the displacement window where is it bob looked at him there is no window what you sure i would detect tachyon particles in the vicinity if there was one the nervous energy that had liam trembling moments ago drained out of him like water from anemptying bath tub his legs felt wobbly and he found a wooden stool to slump down on to so thats it then he looked up at the support unit standing motionless looking back down at him with a calmexpressionless face so how much time do you have left before you have to terminate bobs brow flickered for a moment liam thought he almost detectedsadness in that expression almost i have fiftysix minutes left on my missionclock fiftysix minutes left to live liam wondered what a person could do with fiftysix minutesnot a lot time for a cup of tea and some cakes a bath and a shave maybe im really sorry bob he said quietly i think i was getting toquite like you you know bobs stern face seemed to shift soften liam was certain that behind the flesh andbone at some level the unit was experiencing something beyond simple binary numbers andlogical functions i am his deep voice searched for unfamiliar words i amsorry too liam oconnor we made a good team didnt we bob tried one of sals smiles it worked pretty well this time still ugly as sinthough yes we made a bob froze midsentence his eyes focused beyond liamthen he was blinking rapidly is he getting something information i am registering tachyon particles in the vicinity said bob allof a sudden is it another message negative one of them density probes negative liam got to his feet ducking under a laundry line a window bob turned round reached out for a laundry line and yanked it aside the line snapped crispand clean sheets and shirts fluttered to the ground and there in the middle of the archwayhe could see it the heat shimmer of a time window flexing and distorting like a poolof water it was a much smaller sphere than the one theyd stepped into returning fromthe assassination of john f kennedy but bigger than washingtonsaborted attempt big enough to carefully step through this time whys it still so small they must have limited power or this window has been projected by machinery that isnot fully charged liam stepped eagerly towards it caution you must be entirely within the sphere any partof you not within will be left behind when it closes liam carefully ducked down low and eased himself within the shimmering envelope of energyonce he was in crouching because the sphere was low bob joined him stepping in andhunkering down wrapping his thick arms around liam to prevent him wobbling out of theenvelope remain completely still said bob then all of a sudden it felt like the ground beneath their feet had been whipped away fromthem and they were tumbling through air new york his feet hit hard cold concrete familiar concrete oilstained concrete thefirst thing he noticed was that the arch was pretty dark the second thing he noticed wasmaddy screaming and then the deafening echoing boom of a shotgun fired just a few feetaway he looked up to see maddy cowering on the floor with the smoking gun in her hands andsomething he thought was a skeleton at first fly back like a rag doll against the wall therewere plenty more of them skeletons in tattered clothes pushing through the sliding door fromthe back room long clawlike hands stretching out to grab her across the room foster wasstaggering from the computer terminals to join her bobs reactions were much quicker he was already on his feet andsprinting with the speed of a bird of prey towards maddy his huge muscled arms thrashedviolently at the nearest of the skeletal things shattering bones and tearing muscletissue he grabbed another and twisted its head with a flick of his wrist the creature flopped tothe ground like a rag doll the shotgun fired again sending another one of them sprawling against a wall liam realized he was doing nothing and then remembered he had a gun he fumbled at theholster on his hip pulled out the pistol and tried his best to aim at the confusing tangle ofpale limbs picked out by a dancing beam of torchlight he fired a shot into the confusing scrum producing an exploding puff of crimson onbobs left shoulder the support unit glanced back at him and growled oh jayzus im sorry bob turned back to the task at hand and tore the limb off another one of them and proceededto swing the flopping thing like a club at the others their highpitched screams made themsound like startled children and they began to scramble back to the door through whichtheyd entered as bob pursued them into the back room the sound of crashing a heavy perspex tube rollingacross the floor and further shrill screams of terror echoed out through the doorway liamjoined foster and maddy whats happening foster looked at him bad things liam bad things he reached down to maddy wide eyed and in shock on the floor you ok maddy you all right her eyes drifted from the contorted pale bodies either side of the doorwayand on to liams face for a moment she seemed confused looking at him as if he was astranger its me liam recognition flickered into her squinting eyes recognition followed by graduallyrealized relief her mouth opened and closed opened and closed oh god shefinally managed to whisper oh god i thought i was going to thought thosethings were were foster reached out and held her shhh its ok now they made it back both ofthem were safe now the sound of struggling in the back room had ceased bob appeared in the doorway his facespattered with dark droplets of blood his ss uniform ripped and soaked with even moreblood information the field office is now clear he said matteroffactly it was then liam registered that they were missing someone wheres sal chapter command ship over washington dc paul kramer sat alone in his lab truly alone karls dead all those other men saul stefan rudydieter others whose faces he could remember if not their names now im the last he looked up from his lap across the messy floor thick with snaking cables towards the atombomb in its frame nestling inside the small wire cage there you are my little friend in his hand he held a simple toggle switch wired carelessly into the complicated device aloosely soldered red cable descended from it linking the switch to his juryrigged version ofa waldstein fielddisplacement cage his thumb rested on the tip of the toggle switch kramer felt so incredibly tired a solid week now without a moments sleep not sincehed had karl killed if hed had the courage he would have activated his deviceright then joined karl in the hereafter moments later karls adjutant and several other senior invasionforce generals had petitioned tosee him over and over problems mounting up issues that needed to be resolved paperworkthat needed signing he could face none of those things right now and thered be no sleep either because the moment his eyes closedthe nightmares came his assassin was no longer some timepoliceman from the future but somedark formless entity from hell hungrily seeking his soul ready to drag him downthrough a rip in spacetime to burn for eternity for daring to step albeit briefly into itsdimension burn for eternity he muttered quietly his thumb toyed with the toggle switch paul its time youre back he said flatly the voice had been so quiet these last fewdays paul thought it had abandoned him i never left you i thought i was going to die alone no you and i well face destiny together kramer gently applied pressure to the switch just a little more paul anounce more pressure on this tiny little switch and all life onthis world will be gone he smiled weakly there was poetry in that to create a new world a new history andthen be the one to destroy it like a child builds a sandcastle then in a moment of vainglorytramples all over it thats right we achieved so much didnt we the toggle switch clicked over and the world turned white chapter new york foster finished telling liam their story as they stood in the backstreet justoutside the open shutter door and gazed upon the ruined city my god liam whispered what do you think happened to thisworld a nuclear war of some sort is the only thing i can think of said fosteri was hoping you might have a better idea though i dont know said liam kramers army had finished the jobof conquering america i heard of no other wars going on he still had russia and china totake but that wasnt happening yet back where we were foster shrugged then something must have happened not long after you left perhapsthis kramer started a nuclear war who knows foster offered him an encouraging smilewe get things fixed in the past and well never need to know what happened afteryou left because because it never will have happened liam finished the old man patted his arm proudly youre getting the hang of itlad they stepped back inside and cranked down the shutter door inside bob had been busy fixingup the holes in the brickwork as best he could and hefting the bodies of the creaturesoutside they sat down at the table joining maddy who quietly nursed a mug ofcoffee in both hands still clearly very shaken by the attack foster you said it was possible we might get sal back if things rightthemselves the old man shrugged its just a possibility liam one of manypossibilities liam reached for a mug and sipped some of the tepid brew but right now out theresomewhere youre absolutely certain shes dead foster sighed we can only hope so whatever she went through he shookhis head tiredly his eyes briefly meeting maddys well id like to thinkits over now its done she cant suffer any more but if we fixed things and she came back would she remember foster shook his head i dont want to raise your hopes even if we get thetimeline corrected she may just stay gone for good there are no guarantees she was so so terrified whispered maddy i saw them carry heraway i i saw the look in her eyes i there was nothing you could have done foster sighed absolutelynothing if id not stopped you going after her then youd have shared the samefate as her but she was just a kid cried maddy angrily just a kid i told you weshould have gone after her if we had wed be dead too he replied softly im sorrymadelaine i truly am but this is what it is we just have to get on with it heturned back to liam our focus has to be on one thing now one thing only correctingtime that literally is all that matters a moment of silent reflection then both liam and maddy nodded he was right now liam you said youve identified a possible point in timefor us to send you back to yes it was in that hitler fellas second book in the correct timeline adolf hitler wrote mein kampf in what and he shot himself in so he never gotto write any more books yes said liam but in the past that we were sent to hitler lived on andwrote this second book and shortly after that he was kicked out of the job by this kramerfella who became the new fuhrer ok so in this second book theres this chapter where he describes receiving inspiration from god in theform of an angel apparently its a wellknown chapter hitler never actually mentionskramers name specifically but its assumed that when he refers to a guardian angel and divine inspiration its kramer hestalking about go on i learned a lot about this guy kramer whilst i was in that prison camp he was avery mysterious man who seemed to sort of pop up out of the woodwork from nowhere no familyhistory no details of a childhood a real mystery man he took credit for steering hitleraway from launching an attack on russia in he claimed to have personally invented mostof the modern weapons that helped them win the war that allowed them to invade america andwipe out their armed forces within just a few weeks his people worshipped him almost like a god and i think he encouraged the idea thathe was extraordinary in some way apparently up until he launched his invasion on america hewas the most writtenabout man of his time hundreds of books about him all trying towork out who he was and where hed come from and you recall the when and where of hitlers first encounter with him yes replied liam there was a fella who told me a man called wallaceif he remembered it correctly that is then yes i can tell you the time and theplace foster considered that in silence for a moment so this kramer is our target then we can only presume hes some foolish technicianfrom the future who fancied the idea of going back in time and ruling the world somebody whodecided to step into the past at a crucial tipping point and make his ownhistory i suppose liam you understand what youre to do locate him and and kill him execute himbefore he meets hitler before he has a chance to change anything to affect history sure all right then give me those details of time and place chapter new york liam looked at the empty perspex cylinder theres no water in thereits empty we dont have a water supply youll have to go back dry thistime so do i still climb in the tube thing foster shook his head ill open the time window right here on the flooritll mean a scoop of our lovely concrete floor will be going back with you butim afraid that cant be helped but you told me nothing but ourselves can go back thats right the less potential for contamination the better but look onthis occasion theres not a lot we can do theres no tap water anywayim not sure wed have enough charge left to shift thirty gallons of water as wellas you two back into the past foster returned to the console i have the fifteenth of april set as thetimestamp the coordinates will place you in some woods near a road that leads up to wherehitlers obersalzberg retreat once stood this is the onlyroad in he turned to face liam and bob its the only way in for this kramer too nowim assuming he arrived as some sort of a special guest perhaps he managed to convincean influential general or a nazi bigwig to arrange an audience for him with adolfhitler would he not have opened a window right inside the building rightin front of the man foster shook his head if it were me i wouldnt what if you appeared right infront of a guard youd be gunned down on sight no he said stroking thegreywhite bristles of his weekold beard far safer to have appeared somewhere quietthen make an approach through some official channel thats how i would do it an offer of untold wealth or strategic knowledge of the enemy something tobluff my way into the offices of some senior nazi official he turned back to the console you say hitler wrote that his profound moment ofinspiration occurred at nine thirty pm on that night i have set your timestamp for eightthirty pm an hour earlier if kramer managed to arrange for an audience with hitler thenits a reasonable assumption he arranged to be punctual his meeting might have been fornine thirty pm but he presumably would arrive a little earlier to ensure he was there ontime to go through whatever security procedures they carried out back then if we miss him if you fail to intercept kramer sighed foster then weve missedour chance what then the old man shook his head it means its game over history remains changedgod help us all well be stuck back in wont we yes liam and maddy and i will be stuck here they stared at each other in silence liam realized their fate would be worse than hiswhat about those creatures foster waved his hand and smiled grimly lets forget about them for now shallwe maddy stepped across the floor over snaking cables she graspedliams arm and looked at him with redrimmed eyes just make sure you get himok he nodded she looked up at the support unit ive downloaded all the historicalinformation we have on obersalzberg and the surrounding area from the database on tobobs hard drive bob stirred affirmative if if youre successful liamsaid foster and history realigns well have a power feed once more we canbring you home the initial return window will be nine thirty pm from the same coordinatesthe first backup will be ten thirty pm the second backup will be twentyfour hours lateris that clear yes sir said liam if you fail said foster stepping towards him if it doesnt workout lad then dont throw your life away on some foolish gamble eh he placed ahand on liams shoulder find a way to survive youll have bob to help youfor the first six months find a way to survive and live your life as best youcan what about you two foster reached out and squeezed maddys hand dont worry about us liamweve got something arranged maddy nodded and offered him a thin smile thats right the four of them stared at each other in silence for a moment understanding the stakesknowing this was their one and only chance to set things right she looked up at bob standing stiffly to attention in his bloodspattered ss uniformoh thats definitely you she punched him softly on the chestlook after liam you dumb ape affirmative she grinned a rim of moisture beginning to spill from her eyes and you liam come back safe ok he nodded thats the plan chapter woods outside obersalzberg falling again falling through a dark void liam had just enough time to wonder whether he was ever going to get used to thestomachlurching sensation before he found himself waistdeep in a drift of powder snow oh great liam looked around at the snowcovered pine trees glowing almost a luminescent blue by thelight of the quicksilver moon thick branches of fir needles were weighed down beneath a heavyshroud of freshfallen snow beneath the thin material of his ss uniform he shivered jayzus its bloodyfffreezing he hissed under his breath sending a plume of condensation out beforehim glad were not just wearing wet ppants right now hang on isnt thatgoing to cause a contamination problem acceptable level of contamination at this point replied bob we willreturn with our clothes he stopped midstride for a moment consulting data in hishead information two hundred yards ahead is the road leading to the eaglesnest right recommendation we attempt to acquire better weapons and appropriate clothing anddisguise liam nodded eagerly at the suggestion of appropriate clothing the support unit led the way pushing through the woods undergrowthdislodging hissing showers of shifting snow from the low branches above them they walkedquietly through the hushed winter forest until finally liam could make out a narrow road snowshovelled to either side to keep it passable bob squatted down surveying the way ahead and liam joined him the road little more than adirt track climbed the hill gently fifty yards up they could see a guard hut picked out inthe glow of a swivelling floodlight sand bags either side and a raisable barrier blockingthe way a small smile crept across liams quivering lips nothing bob cant handle there if you can take out those guards said liam quietly we could wait rightthere for kramer bob nodded affirmative that is a good plan i shall he froze bob what is it i have just detected emerging tachyon particles in the vicinity his grey eyesswivelled on to liam a time window has just been opened nearby what you sure its not traces of our own time window youre pickingup it is not us liam glanced at the trees around them nearby very close within three hundred yards of our position fosters guesswork must have been wrong this guy kramer hadnt already beenback in for some time working at getting an audience with hitler hed only justarrived i am detecting a significant number of decaying particles and that means one large displacement window or many smaller windows liam bit his lip with dawning realization its not just kramer on his own isit it was then that they heard movement through the trees faint at first theswish of a snowladen branch pushed aside the soft clink and rattle of webbing and carriedequipment the hushed whisper of several voices all of it coming their way recommendation we should hide liam looked around in the darkness the glow of moonlight made everything that wasntsnowcovered stand out in stark contrast unless they could quickly bury themselves they weregoing to be spotted he looked up at the tree they were squatting beneath up there he pointed in the tree bob nodded without a moments hesitation he grabbed liam and effortlessly hefted himup on to the lowest branch silently and with the grace of a gymnast on parallel bars heswung up beside him the branch creaking worryingly beneath his immense weight the noises grew subtly louder closer until liam was able to see movement dark shapeswarily emerged from beneath the shadow of trees stepping cautiously across the glowing snowbelow then almost unbelievably coming to a halt beneath the very tree theywere hiding in they squatted down and surveyed the track heading up the hill just as bob had been doing amoment earlier then he heard one of them talking softly this is it karl this is it hitlers winter retreat an accent hevaguely recognized he recalled the precise tones the voice of recited speeches endlesslybroadcast over the prisoncamp speakers kramer a second voice der kehlsteinhaus the eagles nestit does not appear that heavily guarded this one had a clipped foreignsoundingaccent liam strained to hear what the men said next their voices quieter stillthen kramer spoke more clearly a little further up the hillside only a few hundredyards away is an ss garrison housing four or five hundred of them they will happily die todefend their leader your men will have to be very fast karl his voice dropped again then the second murmured a response liam turned to look at bob perched perfectly still on the branch beside him like a night owlwatching the progress of some small rodent and poised ready to leap switch to night sights gentlemen hissed the second man in the darkness belowthem liam saw something glowing a soft ghostly green among the gathered men then severalmore he realized they were goggles of some sort mr kramer sir whispered one of the men it is kramer liam felt his heartsuddenly flutter what is it rudy will we actually get to meet adolf hitler tonight forreal another heavily accented voice yes rudy you will tonight gentlemen kramer raised his voice from awhisper to a soft murmur for them all to hear we are going to write a brandnewhistory together bob tapped liam on the arm they were too close to the men below to be able to talk insteadthe support unit gestured at them an unmistakable gesture that told him i am ready liam swallowed anxiously feeling his gut churning once again with fear gritting his teethhe nodded do it chapter woods outside obersalzberg bob dropped silently down out of the tree on to the men below liam heard the heavythud of his solid body and the unmistakable crack of bones then all hell broke loose voices brittle with alarm and confusion the dark swirling scrum of figures below illuminatedfor a freezeframe second by the single muzzleflash of a silenced weapon bob a bloodiedknife in one hand midslash across the chest of one man his other big hand crushing thethroat of another of them several more strobing muzzleflashes in the confusing darkness accompanied by the muted puffof a silenced rifle the fleeting light showed four tangled bodies on the ground alreadyblood pooling across the snow bob thrashing at another man with lethal speed and agility andat least another dozen men around him recovering from the moment of surprise and cocking theirguns to fire i have to help him liam pulled the pistol out of his holster and aimed it at one of the dark outlines one of the men who looked nearest ready to fire and pulled the trigger the loud crackfrom his gun echoed through the trees no doubt rousing the ss guards up the track one of the men below him grunted and went down clutching his thigh my god i actually hit something having now given his position away he realized he couldnt sit perched up on thebranch any more grimacing and gritting his teeth he dropped down to the ground into thethick of the fight he landed heavily on the back of one of the dead men around him all hecould hear was the grunting the laboured breath of a dozen or more men shrill words barkedin german accented english and one or two other languages there shoot him shoot shoot out of the way schwartz a machine gun spewed a salvo of muzzlesuppressed taps and litthe scene with flickering light liam saw bob take half a dozen shots in the chest his blacktunic erupting with exit wounds and geysers of dark blood not enough to stop him though in an instant he was upon the one whod fired hisblade a lethal flash of quicksilver death across the mans throat another short burst from someone else caught bob from behind and once more his uniform tunicdanced tattered ripped and bloody liam fired several rapidfire rounds at the dark shape it buckled and fell to the snow bob leaped forward at another man his hand twisting the blade into him but he was slowingdown now still a deadly force but no longer with the devastating whiptail speed of a lethalpredator instead he had the lumbering energy of a cornered and exhausted mammoth hisfleshandblood body weakened by too many wounds to recover from another short silenced burst of gunfire sounding like a walking stick dragged across awooden picket fence bob staggered back heavily scheietoten sie ihn another rattle of suppressed fire bob collapsed to his knees wavered for a moment before falling face forward into thesnow a torch snapped on to liam caught in its glare he instantly tossed the gun aside and raisedhis hands dont shoot pplease the torch panned across his face blinding him on your knees liam dropped down into the snow who the hell are you im my names liam who sent you there was no official name for the agency none that foster had been prepared to tell himanyway im im an agent ffrom the future the torch beam dropped down out of his face and liam could now see from the glow that onlyfour of them remained standing the man holding the torch spoke again from the future so soon said kramer there was bitterness in his voicebitter and resentful that his bid to change history had already after mere minutes beenintercepted liam knew for certain his life was now going to be measured in minutes if not mereseconds but this is impossible waldsteins was the onlymachine snapped kramer you have to keep him talking liam keep him talking no kramer youre wrong the people i work for have machines were hereto protect history kramer took a step towards him but why he shook his head angrily whythe world weve come from its dying we killed it with our pollution weoverpopulated it sucked it dry of resources wiped out almost every other species hesquatted down in front of liam why would anyone want to preserve that kind of future liam looked up at him he realized from the haunted expression on kramers face thatperhaps he wasnt driven by greed or an insatiable thirst for power but perhaps bybetter intentions why would anyone want to protect that he asked again i ive seen the future you made uttered liam with my owneyes it its a world of ashes and and ruins kramers eyes narrowed what you will end up doing something terrible and it will destroy the world leavingnothing the future may be bad but what you do makes it far worse one of the other three men stepped forward and stood beside kramer we came back hereto make a better world he said adamantly not todestroy it it was the heavily accented man the one called karl liam shook his head but somehow somehow thats exactly what you will endup doing something will go wrong something you do will lead to a what was it foster said a a nuclear war and therell benothing left liam looked from one of them to the other god help me iveseen whats left of humanity pitiful ghouls living on each othersflesh karls eyes widened for a moment he looked lost confused if there is a hell if there really is then ive seen it saidliam and it will be your actions that createit paul karl turned to kramer paul could this be true kramer shook his head his eyes searching for truth in liams face in the distance they heard a siren begin to wail liams unsilencedgunshots had clearly alerted the ss guards the entire regiment would be roused and combingthe woods soon you say you have seen this yourself askedkramer liam nodded and i think id rather die here than go back tothat clouds of vapour filled the space between them caught like fleeting pale ghosts in the beamof torchlight paul said karl this must be a lie kramers face was shrouded with conflicting thoughts conflicting emotions in thedistance they could hear the barking of dogs over the mournful wailing of the sirens voicesraised and growing closer kramer shook his head something in the expression on his face the glint of his hauntedeyes told liam that deep inside his troubled mind a decision was being made but what it was hed never know a burst of silenced gunfire ripped through the stillness kramers arcticcamouflagejacket spat blood and then he flopped to the ground karl and the other two men turned round to open fire on bob the support unit was splayed onhis back holding one of their machine guns loosely in its left hand most of their unaimedshots sent divots of dry snow into the air but all of bobs shots hit home droppingeach of the three men with surgical precision bob gasped liam scrambling across the ground wet with blood snow staineddark as night bob i thought you were dead up close he could see the support unit had taken too many chest and stomach wounds topossibly survive information he gurgled blood out of the side of his mouth no shhhh bob whispered liam cradling the supportunits head in his lap his coarse dark hair grown over the last six months and longenough to lose a fist in was matted and wet from a head wound bobs grey eyes blinked and fluttered he was doing some housekeeping on his hard drive collating files compressing data bob his eyes cleared and locked on liam mission priority one must destroy theweapons advanced weapons technology yes yes of course gather the weapons together destroy them with a grenade he saidpointing towards an equipment satchel lying on the snow nearby grenades are in thatbag use one set off the others liam nodded and realized there were warm tears running down his cheeks realized he wasshedding tears for a broken machine bob i you must be quiet and listen he could hear voices now dozens of them calling out to each other and baying dogs eager tobe let off the leash in the distance torches flickered faintly through the woodsfloodlights up on the hill where hitlers berghof was located sent beams into thesky the entire hillside seemed to be alive with activity mission priority two you must leave liam oconnor you must not be capturedalive hide await the return window or backup window you must leave immediately just help me get you up ill not leave you here to negative selftermination must be activated no dont you do that bob i mean it dont you do it bob gurgled more blood mission priority three support unit cannotfall into the hands of no thats crazy we can get you out of here if youll just get offyour backside you big lump negative you must leave now you should leave now bob will you shut your mouth for just a second leave now leave now bob please you dont need to terminate ill do it ill doit he looked around the bloodstained snow and saw what he was after chapter new york still quiet but for the rustling of a lifeless breeze across the barrenlandscape tall spires of rusted metal and crumbling concrete stand over the lost remnants ofa place once called times square the creak of a longfaded sign swinging from a lamp post the squeak and bang of a windowshutter somewhere caught and played with by the haunting wind a sickly yellow sun behind scudding brown irradiated clouds casts pallid beams down on toashes and dust from the darkness inside gutted and scorched buildings milky eyes look outhungrily for some other meagre supply of food a rat a dog if any are left perhaps another of its kind not a dying world but a dead world just waiting for theselast pitiful skeletal survivors of mankind to realize the time has come for them to die but gently at first the breeze freshens that loose window shutter across the square bangs ever more heavily small clouds of dustwhip along the ground the wheel on a rusted and upended pram turns slowly with a clickclickclick of bearings then faintly blink and youd miss it the slightest shimmer like theripple across the hot tarmac of a motorway on a midsummers day the flicker of hot airabove a bonfire a shimmer flickering undulating changing the tallest dead spire overlooking times square now has windows unbroken as do the otherbuildings one after the other one can see clear roads and faint ghostly apparitions movingalong them clearer now not ghostly but solid cars buses trams people the sky has changed from an unhealthy poisoned brown to a wettuesday grey and the persistentdrizzle of meanspirited rain tall crimsoncoloured banners with the emblem of a snake eating its tail suddenly adorn everylamp post placards appear above shop entrances featuring the face of a leader who promisesto unite the world under his rule soldiers in grey and black uniforms and tall leather bootspatrol soulless ordered streets full of soberly dressed civilians quietly obediently turningup for work this at least is life not a dead world any more the breeze freshens again the banners flutter as if sensing something more is on its way another shimmer another change is coming rippling forward through months years decades of time as eventsrealign destinies change and possibilities find correct versions of themselves the wet grey sky slowly clears the rain stops the pennants and banners vanish with a whisper the placards disappear with a final flourish and twist of reality times square becomes noisy garish busyimpatient filled with rude people on mobile phones organizing their day ahead jostling eachother for pavement space queuing for breakfast bagels and starbucks coffee a giant green ogre called shrek peers out from a poster a homeless man pushing a shopping trolley full of cardboard boxes and topped with a tarpaulintakes a moment to sit down on a bench and watch the busy world go by a lovely blue sky unseasonably warm sun for this time of year and the distant droneof an approaching plane on the far horizon chapter new york maddy lay on her cot in the dark opposite she could hear fosters labouredbreathing the wheezy rattle of an unwell man all was quiet in the archway save for the drip of water from the brick ceiling somewhere outin the darkness the generator had finally stopped thudding she had lost track of how longthat had been now hours a dozen more no power no light theyd used their last candle as theyd sat either side ofthe table and discussed their options should liam and bob fail not many options if truth betold the choices available to them boiled down to just one really when to do it when to use the last two rounds in theshotgun when theyd both be ready to admit that all was lost shed not been foolish enough to let herself think this was actually going to workthat some foggily remembered date from an autobiography that should never have been writtenwould lead liam and bob right to the cause of all this no that was the kind of unlikely happy ending that belonged on some cheesy tv show or somerubbish fxladen blockbuster movie the nickoftime lastminute reprieve for the good guysthat you always knew was going to happen right from the moment theopening credits rolled maddys face was buried in the pillow when the ceiling lights in thefield office winked silently on half asleep it wasnt until her ears registered thesoft hum of the machinery that maintained the time bubble quietly initializing itself that shestirred and turned her face to one side it took another long moment for her to realize the power had come back on that the archwaywas bathed in a flickering clinical light is this for real or am i dreaming she sat up quickly on her cot almost banging her head against the rough springs of the bunkabove and smiled its not a dream foster she reached across and shook his shoulder foster his rustling breath caught and with a moan of painful discomfort he roused and opened darksallow eyes whuh what is it madelaine she pointed up at the bulb in the wire cage above them glowing brightly foster ithink they did it several minutes later they were standing outside in their rubbishstrewn backstreet savouringthe return of a familiar world a lovely sunny day in september the rumble of traffic overthe williamsburg bridge above them the honk of impatient horns the distant wail of a policesiren life impatient life ive never seen anything so beautiful cried maddy her cheeksunashamedly wet nor i replied foster she stretched an arm round his sloped shoulders and planted a kiss on a cheek as dry andwrinkled as parchment we made it she whispered foster smiled then lets bring them back home shall we the lights in the archway flickered momentarily as a result ofthe drain of power the hum of the displacement machinery rose in pitch and then all of asudden there it was maddy could see the shimmering outline of the window in the middle ofthe floor appearing in exactly the same place it had when theyd sent both of them backto within the window she could see a faint rippling image like a reflection in a disturbed poolof water it looked to her like a world of trees and snow then into view the waveringsilhouette of something dark merged into the puddlelike image unmistakably a human figuresomeone coming to them a moment later liam stepped alone on to the floor of the arch liam screamed maddy with initial delight then she saw that his hands and armswere slick with wet and drying blood his uniform his neck his face pale like a ghost werespattered with dark droplets oh my god what happened liam are you ok he turned to look at her his mouth struggling to reply searching for words foster stepped forward liam lad are you all right he looked at the old man frowning struggling to take things in blinking back thebrightness from the strip lights above him finally he nodded as he opened the palm of onehand and held out something metallic it was the size of a small mobile phone and coated withclots of drying blood i managed to he took a breath and tried again wellanyway heres bob foster reached for the object taking it from him gently you did well liamhe replied softly knowing full well the grisly deed that liam had just carried outthats no easy thing to do come sit down lad headded leading him over to the table and chairs did did we do it liam asked maddy grinned and hugged him tightly in answer to his question yes liam replied foster you did it chapter new york a couple of hours later after liam had given a more detailed account of his timein the past he was fast asleep on one of the cots his snoring seemed to reverberate throughthe arch even more noisily than the generator had foster worked over at the computer desk having scrubbed bobs neural processor cleanof brain tissue and blood he connected it up to the computer system and began downloading theentire content of its hard drive bobs ai is in there amongst that he said nodding towards the loadingbar slowly creeping across the screen thats a lot of data uploading there said maddy well he was away for nearly six months all the time his eyes and ears recordingeverything that was going on so whats the deal with bob is his ai intact foster shrugged im no computer expert so i dont know how it works butthe code that makes up bobs ai will merge with the computer systems hetapped the keyboard youll be able to communicate with him in there right six months of learning i guess that ai codes a lot smarter thanthe idiot that plopped out of the birthing tube foster chuckled oh yes she looked at him how are we going to grow ourselves anothersupport unit those tubes are smashed the gunk they were growing in has all gone off he raised a hand theres going to be a lot of work to do to get this fieldoffice online again ill help you with that you look tired if she was being honestshe would have said he looked ready to keel over and die new clone embryos and growing solution the generator needs replacing the walls fixedup you need to replenish our supplies he added a new generator thats going to cost money fine said foster just go find a hardware store and buyanother weve got enough money as much as youll ever need its in a bank account cool do we get a debit card with that or something he turned to her thats one of many things im going to need to gothrough with you before his voice trailed off before what foster looked uncomfortable before i leave leave leave you cant leave us neither of us know what the heck weredoing just yet jesus i i certainly dont you did fine foster smiled you did just fine id say right nowtheres no team better trained to do this than you you survived the ordealyoull be able to cope with pretty much anything else this job has to throw at you ofthat im sure team theres no team theres just me andliam now she cast a glance at the bank of monitors in front of her and the upload barnow inching past the halfway mark oh and a computer system thats verysoon going to start insisting we call it bob it was then they heard the soft scrape of feet behind them they turnedround to see sal standing in the middle of the archway a shopping bag in one hand lookingcuriously down at the small crater of scoopedout concrete in the floor so what happened here this place is a real mess she said shaking her headdisapprovingly i go out for a couple of hours to get some milk and bagels forbreakfast and come back and its like someones been drilling holes in the walloutside and someone dropped a bowling ball on the floor here sal maddys jaw dropped sal a dark eyebrow arched quizzically uh yeah and youre alive maddy leaped up from the desk and swept the confused girlinto her arms oh my god youre alive youre alive foster could see sals bewildered face over maddys shaking shoulder uh is someone going to tell me whats been going on while i wasout chapter new york monday they havent told me everything that happened i can tell some things wenton that theyre keeping from me but i know now that while i was out buying milk andbagels a time shift happened the world changed and liam and bob went into the past to fixit liam told me he and bob were actually stuck in the past for six whole months and i knowabout none of it time travel is such a strange thing to get your head round they said our field office was attacked but no ones told me by who or what yetthere are scratch marks everywhere on the wall outside like someone took a scouring brushto the bricks maybe we were attacked by an army of porcupines or something many of the things in the back room were broken shards of glass and stuff everywhere so iguess there was a bit of a struggle back there i wish theyd just tell me everythinginstead of trying to protect me just cause im the youngest and bob died i know thats affected liam hes missing him i see him typingto bob on the computer system every day maddy tells him not to be so cut up about it hes not actually gone hes just in the computer insteadshe said its no different to like chatting to a friend on msn i miss the big guy too foster says we can grow another bob once the birthing equipment has been sorted outim not sure how ill feel though about a bob version it just wontbe the same bob or will it i mean theyre clones so i suppose it will be exactlythe same maddys been kept very busy foster says shes the team leader and needs to doa lot of learning while we rest up and recover the birthing tubes in the back room have gotto be replaced and well need new cloned foetuses and supplies of that gooey soupthey float in fosters getting maddy to sort out those things we also have to get anew backup generator installed to replace the old one and supplies of food and water anddiesel and so many other things were all going to be kept busy for the next few days thats for sure you know i hate that i completely missed out on whatever happened i feel like imstill the newbie here and the other two are now sort of like old hands in fact all three of them seem a bit different like what happened changed them somehowlike for example liam hes sort of older now i swear hes grown an inch ortwo taller he seems bigger firmer less boyish and a bit more manly obviously hessix months older than he was but its actually like hes two or threeyears older its weird maddy jokes around a little less now she seems to have so much on her mind all thetime like shes about to sit a whole load of exams and she hasnt doneany revision and then theres foster i worry about him he looks soooo sick and soooo much older coming back from myshopping trip it was like hed sort of aged a hundred years in the time that i wasout i figured it would be rude to blurt something out about how he lookedreally old all of a sudden so i havent said anything about it these last few days iguess its a timetravel thing so incredibly weird though this timetravel business it really messes with yourhead sal looked up from writing her diary and slurped a spoon from her breakfast bowlof rice krispies the cereal had gone soggy in the milk as shed been scribbling awayshe stared disinterestedly at one of the banks of computer monitors in front of hershed tuned the signal feed from cnn to the disney channel and right now toy story was on buzz and gang desperately trying to cross abusy highway disguised as traffic cones sal had seen it many times over it had been one ofher dads favourites the arch is quiet right now liam is on his bunk his nose stuck in a historybook all about the second world war he does a lot of reading says he never ever wants tobe stuck again in a time he knows nothing about maddy and foster went out earlier he told her he had a number of things to discuss withher confidentially i dont like that that there are things hestelling her and not me and liam it doesnt seem fair after all were a teamarent we sal had watched them both step out under the open shutter door a couple of hoursago foster had waved a goodbye but there was something about the way hed done that arueful smile as hed surveyed the scruffy place in fact the old man had been acting very oddly these last few days she wondered if it wasbecause he was tired foster seemed to have too much on his shoulders too much to do shedecided when they returned shed insist he sit back in one of thetatty old armchairs they had around the table put his feet up and shed make a fuss ofhim make him some coffee some beans on toast whatever he wanted he looked like he could do with some tlc chapter new york so said foster eventually so now you know everything youneed to know madelaine everything maddy stared back across the table at him it was midmorning and starbucks was relativelyquiet the morning rush for takeaway lattes and frappucinos had been and gone and now thecoffee shop was half empty and now you know why im dying why i cantrisk riding time any more why i cant live in the field offices time bubble anymore youre sure she looked at him youre sure the technologyis killing you yes he replied the damage it does builds up slowly over time youdont notice it at first but it catches up on you really fast eventually i dontknow how much longer ill be able to live outside the bubble but itll be longerthan if i remain inside with you if you did stay stayed with you inside he shruggedits hard to tell maybe id live on a few more days a week or two atmost he sighed its not an exact science and im nodoctor maddy bit her lip im sorry dont be he smiled weakly it goes with being an operative i wastold early on when i first started out and i was a fit young lad that being a timeriderwould eventually kill me but you carried on regardless given all the wonderful history ive seen maddy all the history ivetouched smelled tasted all the experiences ive had the things ive learnedjesus id do it all again i really would you were given the same choice that you gave us join up or go back and face yourpredestined death yes he replied and i dont regret a moment of it so what about liam foster pursed his lips in thought then eventually reluctantly he nodded yesim afraid liam will end up like this time travel will age him faster than you or saltime travel will sooner or later kill him riddle his body with cancers she shook her head and looked down at her coffee and her muffin all of a sudden she had noappetite for either poor poor liam it was going to be down to her as the team leader to tell him some time to let him knoweach occasion he stepped through a displacement window and was sent back into the past thatthe cells of his body were going to become more and more corrupted until finally they turnedon themselves and became tumours that would eventually eat him up from the inside so she said after a while where will you go i dont know he shrugged i guess i wouldnt mind feelingthe sun on my face whilst i enjoy a good hotdog he grinned make the most ofwhatever time ive got left will you stay in new york they say its the city that never sleeps and as somebody once told meyou can do all the sleeping you want when youre dead so i guess new yorks theplace for me they both laughed a dry sad noise that filled the space between them he finished the last of his coffee anyway it was always my plan tovisit new york and see the sights i just got waylaid for a little while he reached for a bag at his feet a small overnight bag with a few personal keepsakes andmementoes foster wait said maddy im not sure i can do this imnot sure were ready to cope on our own youre more than ready i know youll make agreat team how can you know theres still so much we need to i know he said firmly as he rose from his seat slowly painfully grimacingwearily from the effort will we see you again you have all the information you need maddy its there in your head in whative told you what youve learned what youve experienced anything youdont know well there are notes on the computers database answers to allthe questions youre ever likely to ask how do you know what im going to ask he winked this is time travel maddy what goes around comesaround she cocked her head confused by his cryptic answer yes but if i needed yourhelp could i find you out here somewhere his frail liverspotted old hand squeezed her shoulder lightly youll do justfine maddy so you will he turned away and shuffled towards the glass front of the coffee shop with his overnight bagslung over one shoulder he looked like the worlds oldest traveller pulling the dooropen and stepping out on to the busy manhattan pavement she stifled an urge to call out tochase after him and beg him to stay on a while longer with them but then he was gone from view lost amid the busy pavement traffic for awhile she watched the bustling street outside pondering all the things foster had told herwondering how much of that information she ought to share with the others how much of it wasbest she keep to herself already she was beginning to feel the burden of responsibilitysettling all too heavily on her narrow shoulders top you up maddy looked up at the starbucks waitress standing beside her booth holding a decanter ofsteaming coffee in her hand a girl the same age as her for a moment she wondered whattroublesome dilemmas kept her tossing and turning atnight go skating with sheena and kayisha tomorrow should i acceptdannys invitation to jimmys house party or shall i go out with stevieinstead should i do an overtime shift tuesday or shall i make itwednesday top you up maddy nodded distracted sure yeah please fill me up the waitress poured till the cup was filled and she moved on to the next booth to ask thesame question maddy watched her go envious of what she supposed was an untroubled life of petty decisionsshe realized right then that if she could wave a magic wand and swap places with the waitress she could pour coffee and miss starbucks waitress could go and worry about keepinghistory the way it is shed do it in a heartbeat but she realized rubbing her tired eyes and thinking she needed to get a new pair of specssomeones got to do it you know someones got to keep an eye on the time
