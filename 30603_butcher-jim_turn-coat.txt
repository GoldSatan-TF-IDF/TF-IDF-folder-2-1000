jim butcher turn coat acknowledgments for bob sleep well i would like to thank anne sowards my marvelous editor my agent jenn jackson and my poor deluded beta readers ive been facing the kinds of problems authors only dream about having and you all have been a tremendous help to me with luck ill figure out how best to repay you for the time and effort youve all given me and always for shannon and jj who like me even when i vanish into my own head for days at a time chapter one the summer sun was busy broiling the asphalt from chicagos streets the agony in my head had kept me horizontal for half a day and some idiot was pounding on my apartment door i answered it and morgan half his face covered in blood gasped the wardens are coming hide me please his eyes rolled back into his skull and he collapsed oh super up until that moment id been laboring under the misapprehension that the splitting pain in my skull would be the worst thing to happen to me today hells frickin bells i blurted at morgans unconscious form you have got to be kidding me i was really really tempted to slam the door and leave him lying there in a heap he sure as hell deserved it i couldnt just stand there doing nothing though you need to get your head examined i muttered to myself then i deactivated my wardsthe magical security system ive got laid over my apartmentgrabbed morgan under the arms and hauled him inside he was a big man over six feet with plenty of muscleand he was completely limp i had a hard time moving him even though im no junior petite myself i shut the door behind me and brought my wards back up then i waved a hand at my apartment in general focused my will and muttered flickum bicus a dozen candles spaced around the room flickered to life as i pronounced the simple spell and i knelt beside the unconscious morgan examining him for injuries he had half a dozen nasty cuts oozing and ugly and probably painful but not lifethreatening the flesh on his ribs beneath his left arm was blistered and burned and his plain white shirt had been scorched away he also had a deep wound in one leg that was clumsily wrapped in what looked like a kitchen apron i didnt dare unwrap the thing it could start the bleeding again and my medical skills are nothing id want to bet a life on even morgans life he needed a doctor unfortunately if the wardens of the white council were pursuing him they probably knew he was wounded they would therefore be watching hospitals if i took him to one of the local emergency rooms the council would know about it within hours so i called a friend waldo butters studied morgans injuries in silence for a few moments while i hovered he was a wiry little guy and his black hair stood up helterskelter like the fur of a frightened cat he wore green hospital scrubs and sneakers and his hands were swift and nimble he had dark and very intelligent eyes behind black wirerimmed spectacles and looked like he hadnt slept in two weeks im not a doctor butters said wed done this dance several times you are the mighty butters i said you can do anything im a medical examiner i cut up corpses if it helps think of this as a preventative autopsy butters gave me an even look and said cant take him to the hospital huh yeah butters shook his head isnt this the guy who tried to kill you that one halloween and a few other times before that i said he opened a medical kit and started rummaging through it i was never really clear on why i shrugged when i was a kid i killed a man with magic i was captured by the wardens and tried by the white council i guess you got off i shook my head but they figured that since i was just trying to survive the guy killing me with magic maybe i deserved a break suspended sentence sort of morgan was my probation officer probation butters asked if i screwed up again he was supposed to chop my head off he followed me around looking for a good excuse to do it butters blinked up at me surprised i spent the first several years of my adult life looking over my shoulder worrying about this guy getting hounded and harassed by him i had nightmares for a while and he was in them truth be told i stillhad nightmares occasionally about being pursued by an implacable killer in a grey cloak holding a wicked cold sword butters began to wet the bandages over the leg wound and youre helping him i shrugged he thought i was a dangerous animal and needed to be put down he really believed it and acted accordingly butters gave me a quick glance and youre helping him he was wrong i said that doesnt make him a villain it just makes him an asshole it isnt reason enough to kill him reconciled eh not especially butters lifted his eyebrows then whyd he come to you for help last place anyone would look for him be my guess jesus christ butters muttered hed gotten the improvised bandage off and found a wound maybe three inches long but deep its edges puckered like a little mouth blood began drooling from it its like a knife wound but bigger thats probably because it was done with something like a knife but bigger a sword butters said youve got to be kidding me the councils old school i said really really really old school butters shook his head wash your hands the way i just did do it thoroughtakes two or three minutes then get a pair of gloves on and get back here i need an extra pair of hands i swallowed uh butters i dont know if im the right guy to oh bite me wizard boy butters said his tone annoyed you havent got a moral leg to stand on if its okay that im not a doctor its okay that you arent a nurse so wash your freaking hands and help me before we lose him i stared at butters helplessly for a second then i got up and washed my freaking hands for the record surgeries arent pretty theres a hideous sense of intimately inappropriate exposure to another human being and it feels something like accidentally walking in on a naked parent only theres more gore bits are exposed that just shouldnt be out in the open and theyre covered in blood its embarrassing disgusting and unsettling all at the same time there butters said an infinity later okay let go get your hands out of my way it cut the artery i asked oh hell no butters said whoever stabbed him barely nicked it otherwise hed be dead but its fixed right for some definitions of fixed harry this is meatball surgery of the roughest sort but the wound should stay closed as long as he doesnt go walking around on it and he should get looked at by a real doctor soonest he frowned in concentration just give me a minute to close up here take all the time you need butters fell silent while he worked and didnt speak again until after hed finished sewing the wound closed and covered the site in bandages then he turned his attention to the smaller injuries closing most of them with bandages suturing a particularly ugly one he also applied a topical antibiotic to the burn and carefully covered it in a layer of gauze okay butters said i sterilized everything as best i could but it wouldnt shock me to see an infection anyway he starts running a fever or if theres too much swelling youve got to get him to one of two placesthe hospital or the morgue got it i said quietly we should get him onto a bed get him warm okay we lifted morgan by the simple expedient of picking up the entire area rug he was lying on and settled him down on the only bed in the place the little twin in my closetsized bedroom we covered him up he really ought to have a saline iv going butters said for that matter a unit of blood couldnt hurt either and he needs antibiotics man but i cant write prescriptions ill handle it i said butters grimaced at me his dark eyes concerned he started to speak and then stopped several times harry he said finally youre on the white council arent you yeah and you are a warden arent you yep butters shook his head so your own people are after this guy i cant imagine that theyll be very happy with you if they find him here i shrugged theyre always upset about something im serious this is nothing but trouble for you so why help him i was quiet for a moment looking down at morgans slack pale unconscious face because morgan wouldnt break the laws of magic i said quietly not even if it cost him his life you sound pretty sure about that i nodded i am im helping him because i know what it feels like to have the wardens on your ass for something you havent done i rose and looked away from the unconscious man on my bed i know it better than anyone alive butters shook his head you are a rare kind of crazy man thanks he started cleaning up everything hed set out during the improvised surgery so how are the headaches theyd been a problem the past several monthsincreasingly painful migraines fine i told him yeah right butters said i really wish youd try the mri again technology and wizards dont coexist well and magnetic resonance imagers are right up there one baptism in fireextinguishing foam per year is my limit i said it could be something serious butters said anything happens in your head or neck you dont take chances theres way too much going on there theyre lightening up i lied hogwash butters said giving me a gimlet stare youve got a headache now dont you i looked from butters to morgans recumbent form yeah i said i sure as hell got one now chapter two morgan slept my first impression of the guy had stuck with me pretty hardtall heavily muscled with a lean sunken face id always associated with religious ascetics and halfcrazy artists he had brown hair that was unevenly streaked with iron and a beard that while always kept trimmed perpetually seemed to need a few more weeks to fill out he had hard steady eyes and all the comforting reassuring charm of a dental drill asleep he looked old tired i noticed the deep worry lines between his brows and at the corners of his mouth his hands which were large and bluntfingered showed more of his age than the rest of him i knew he was better than a century old which was nudging toward active maturity for a wizard there were scars across both of his handsthe graffiti of violence the last two fingers of his right hand were stiff and slightly crooked as if theyd been badly broken and healed without being properly set his eyes looked sunken and the skin beneath them was dark enough to resemble bruises maybe morgan had bad dreams too it was harder to be afraid of him when he was asleep mouse my big grey dog rose from his usual napping post in the kitchen alcove and shambled over to stand beside me two hundred pounds of silent companionship he looked soberly at morgan and then up at me do me a favor i told him stay with him make sure he doesnt try to walk on that leg it could kill him mouse nudged his head against my hip made a quiet snorting sound and padded over to the bed he lay down on the floor stretching out alongside it and promptly went back to sleep i pulled the door most of the way shut and sank down into the easy chair by the fireplace where i could rub my temples and try to think the white council of wizards was the governing body for the practice of magic in the world and made up of its most powerful practitioners being a member of the white council was something akin to earning your black belt in a martial artit meant that you could handle yourself well that you had real skill that was recognized by your fellow wizards the council oversaw the use of magic among its members according to the seven laws of magic god help the poor practitioner who broke one of the laws the council would send the wardens to administer justice which generally took the form of ruthless pursuit a swift trial and a prompt executionwhen the offender wasnt killed resisting arrest it sounds harsh and it isbut over time id been forced to admit that it might well be necessary the use of black magic corrupts the mind and the heart and the soul of the wizard employing it it doesnt happen instantly and it doesnt happen all at onceits a slow festering thing that grows like a tumor until whatever human empathy and compassion a person might have once had is consumed in the need for power by the time a wizard has fallen to that temptation and become a warlock people are dead or worse than dead it was the duty of the wardens to make a quick end of warlocksby any means necessary there was more to being a warden than that though they were also the soldiers and defenders of the white council in our recent war with the vampire courts the lions share of the fighting had been carried out by the wardens those men and women with a gift for swift violent magic hell in most of the battles such as they were it had been morgan who was in the center of the fighting id done my share during the war but among my fellow wardens the only ones who were happy to work with me had been the newer recruits the older ones had all seen too many lives shattered by the abuse of magic and their experiences had marked them deeply with one exception they didnt like me they didnt trust me and they didnt want anything to do with me that generally suited me just fine over the past few years the white council had come to realize that someone on the inside was feeding information to the vampires a lot of people died because of the traitor but he or she had never been identified given how much the council in general and the wardens in particular loved me the ensuing paranoiafest had kept my life from getting too boringespecially after id been dragooned into joining the wardens myself as part of the war effort so why was morgan here asking for help from me call me crazy but my suspicious side immediately put forward the idea that morgan was trying to sucker me into doing something to get me into major hot water with the council again hell hed tried to kill me that way once several years ago but logic simply didnt support that idea if morgan wasnt really in trouble with the council then i couldnt get into trouble for hiding him from a pursuit that didnt exist besides his injuries said more about his sincerity than any number of words could they had not been faked he was actually on the lam until i found out more about what was going on i didnt dare go to anyone for help i couldnt very well ask my fellow wardens about morgan without it being painfully obvious that i had seen him which would only attract their interest and if the council was after morgan then anyone who helped him would become an accomplice to the crime and draw heat of his own i couldnt ask anyone to help me anyone else i corrected myself id had little option but to call butters inand frankly the fact that he was not at all involved in the supernatural world would afford him some insulation from any consequences that might arise from his complicity besides which butters had earned a little good credit with the white council the night hed helped me prevent a familysized order of necromancers from turning one of their number into a minor god hed saved the life of at least one wardentwo if you counted meand was in far less danger than anyone attached to the community would be me for example man my head was killing me until i knew more about what was going on i really couldnt take any intelligent actionand i didnt dare start asking questions for fear of attracting unwanted attention rushing headlong into a investigation would be a mistake which meant that i would have to wait until morgan could start talking to me so i stretched out on my couch to do some thinking and began focusing on my breathing trying to relax the headache away and clear my thoughts it went so well that i stayed right there doing it for about six hours until the late dusk of a chicago summer had settled on the city i didnt fall asleep i was meditating youre going to have to take my word for it i woke up when mouse let out a low guttural sound that wasnt quite a bark but was considerably shorter and more distinct than a growl i sat up and went to my bedroom to find morgan awake mouse was standing next to the bed leaning his broad heavy head on morgans chest the wounded man was idly scratching mouses ears he glanced aside at me and started to sit up mouse leaned harder and gently flattened morgan to the bed again morgan exhaled in obvious discomfort and said in a croaking dry voice i take it i am undergoing mandatory bed rest yeah i said quietly you were banged up pretty bad the doctor said that walking on that leg would be a bad idea morgans eyes sharpened doctor relax it was off the books i know a guy morgan grunted then he licked cracked lips and said is there anything to drink i got him some cold water in a sports bottle with a big straw he knew better than to guzzle he sipped at it slowly then he took a deep breath grimaced like a man about to intentionally put his hand in a fire and said thank y oh shut up i said shuddering neither of us wants that conversation maybe i imagined it but it looked like he relaxed slightly he nodded and closed his eyes again dont go back to sleep yet i told him i still have to take your temperature it would be awkward gods beard yes morgan said opening his eyes i went and got my thermometer one of the oldfashioned ones filled with mercury when i came back morgan said you didnt turn me in not yet i said im willing to hear you out morgan nodded accepted the thermometer and said aleron lafortier is dead he stuck the thermometer in his mouth presumably to attempt to kill me with the suspense i fought back by thinking through the implications instead lafortier was a member of the senior councilseven of the oldest and most capable wizards on the planet the ones who ran the white council and commanded the wardens he washad beenskinny bald and a sanctimonious jerk id been wearing a hood at the time so i couldnt be certain but i suspected that his voice had been the first of the senior council to vote guilty at my trial and had argued against clemency for my crimes he was a hardline supporter of the merlin the head of the council who had been dead set against me all in all a swell guy but hed also been one of the bestprotected wizards in the world all the members of the senior council were not only dangerous in their own rights but protected by details of wardens to boot attempted assassinations had been semiregular events during the war with the vampires and the wardens had become very very good at keeping the senior council safe i did some math from there it was an inside job i said quietly like the one that killed simon at archangel morgan nodded and they blamed you morgan nodded and took the thermometer out of his mouth he glanced at it and then passed to me i looked ninetynine and change i met his eyes and said did you do it no i grunted i believed him whyd they finger you because they found me standing over lafortiers body with the murder weapon in my hand he replied they also turned up a newly created account in my name with several million dollars in it and phone records that showed i was in regular contact with a known operative of the red court i arched an eyebrow gosh that was irrational of them to jump to that conclusion morgans mouth turned up in a small sour smile whats your story i asked him i went to bed two nights ago i woke up in lafortiers private study in edinburgh with a lump on the back of my head and a bloody dagger in my hand simmons and thorsen burst into the room maybe fifteen seconds later you were framed thoroughly i exhaled a slow breath you got any proof an alibi anything if i did he said i wouldnt have had to escape custody once i realized that someone had gone to a lot of effort to set me up to take the blame i knew that my only chance he broke off coughing was to find the real killer i finished for him i passed him the drink again and he choked down a few sips slowly relaxing a few minutes later he turned exhausted eyes to mine are you going to turn me in i looked at him for a silent minute and then sighed itd be a lot easier yes morgan said you sure you were going down for it something in his expression became even more remote than usual he nodded ive seen it often enough so i could leave you hanging out to dry you could but if i did that we wouldnt find the traitor and since youd died in his place hed be free to continue operating more people would get killed and the next person he framed might be you morgan finished with my luck i said glumly no might about it the brief sour smile appeared on his face again theyre using tracking spells to follow you i said i assume youve taken some kind of countermeasure or theyd already be at the door he nodded how long is it going to last fortyeight hours sixty at the most i nodded slowly thinking youre running a fever ive got some medical supplies stashed ill get them for you hopefully we can keep it from getting any worse he nodded again and then his sunken eyes closed hed run out of gas i watched him for a minute then turned and started gathering up my things keep an eye on him boy i said to mouse the big dog settled down on the floor beside the bed fortyeight hours i had about two days to find the traitor within the white councilsomething no one had been able to do during the past several years after that morgan would be found tried and killedand his accomplice your friendly neighborhood harry dresden would be next nothing motivates like a deadline especially the literal kind chapter three i got in my bustedup old volkswagen bug the mighty blue beetle and headed for the cache of medical supplies the problem with hunting down the traitor in the white council was simple because of the specific information leaks that had occurred there were a limited number of people who could have possessed the information the suspect pool was damn smalljust about everyone in it was a member of the senior council and everyone there was beyond reproach the second someone threw an accusation at one of them things were going to get busy and fast if an innocent was fingered they would react the same way morgan had knowing full well that the justice of the council was blind especially to annoying things like facts they would have little choice but to resist one punky young wizard like me bucking the system was one thing but when one of the heavyweights on the senior council did it there would be a world of difference the senior council members all had extensive contacts in the council they all had centuries of experience and skill to back up enormous amounts of raw strength if one of them put up a fight it would mean more than resisting arrest it would mean internal strife like the white council had never seen it would mean civil war and under the circumstances i couldnt imagine anything more disastrous for the white council the balance of power between the supernatural nations was a precarious thingand we had barely managed to hang on throughout the war with the vampire courts both sides were getting their wind back now but the vampires could replace their losses far more quickly than we could if the council dissolved into infighting now it would trigger a feeding frenzy amongst our foes morgan had been right to run i knew the merlin well enough to know that he wouldnt blink twice before sacrificing an innocent man if it meant holding the council together much less someone who might actually be guilty meanwhile the real traitor would be clapping his hands in glee one of the senior council was already down and if the council as a whole didnt implode in the next few days it would become that much rifer with paranoia and distrust following the execution of the most capable and highly accomplished combat commander in the wardens all the traitor would need to do was rinse and repeat with minor variations and sooner or later something would crack i would only get one shot at this i had to find the guilty party and i had to be right and irrefutable the very first time colonel mustard in the den with the lead pipe now all i needed was a clue no pressure harry my half brother lived in an expensive apartment on the very edge of the gold coast area which in chicago is where a whole lot of people with a whole lot of money live thomas runs an upscale boutique specializing in the kind of uppercrust clientele who seem to be willing to pay a couple hundred dollars for a haircut and a blowdry he does well for himself too as evidenced by his expensive address i parked a few blocks west of his apartment where the rates werent quite so gold coasty and then walked in to his place and leaned on his buzzer no one answered i checked the clock in the lobby then folded my arms leaned against a wall and waited for him to get home from work his car pulled into the buildings lot a few minutes later hed replaced the enormous hummer that wed managed to trash with a brandnew ridiculously expensive cara jaguar with plenty of flash and gold trim it was needless to say pure white i kept on lurking waiting for him to come around to the doors he did a minute later he was maybe a hair or three under six feet tall dressed in midnight blue leather pants and a white silk shirt with big blousy sleeves his hair was midnight black presumably to complement the pants and fell in rippling waves to just below his shoulders he had grey eyes teeth whiter than the ku klux klan and a face that had been made for fashion magazines he had the build to go with it too thomas made all those spartans in that movie look like slackers and he didnt even use an airbrush he raised his dark brows as he saw me arry he said in the hideously accurate french accent he used in public good evening mon ami i nodded to him hey we need to talk his smile faded as he took in my expression and body language and he nodded but of course we went on up to his apartment it was immaculate as always the furnishings expensive modern and oh so trendy with a lot of brushed nickel finish in evidence i went in leaned my quarterstaff against the frame of the front door and slouched down onto one of the couches i looked at it for a minute how much did you pay for this i asked him he dropped the accent about what you did for the beetle i shook my head and tried to find a comfortable way to sit that much money youd think they could afford more cushions ive sat on fences more comfy than this thats because it isnt really meant to be sat upon thomas replied its meant to show people how very wealthy and fashionable one is i got one of my couches for thirty bucks at a garage sale its orange and green plaid and its tough not to fall asleep in it when you sit down its very you thomas said smiling as he crossed to the kitchen whereas this is very much me or very much my persona anyway beer long as its cold he returned with a couple of dark brown bottles coated in frost and passed me one we took the tops off clinked and then he sat down on the chair across from the couch as we drank okay he said whats up trouble i replied i told him about morgan thomas scowled empty night harry morgan morgan whats wrong with your head i shrugged i dont think he did it who cares morgan wouldnt cross the street to piss on you if you were on fire thomas growled hes finally getting his comeuppance why should you lift a finger because i dont think he did it i said besides you havent thought it through thomas slouched back in the chair and regarded me with narrowed eyes as he sipped at his beer i joined him and let him mull it over in silence there was nothing wrong with thomass brain okay he said grudgingly i can think of a couple of reasons youd want to cover his homicidal ass i need the medical stuff i left with you he rose and went to the hall closetwhich was packed to groaning with all manner of household articles that build up when you stay in one place for a while he removed a white toolbox with a red cross painted on the side of it and calmly caught a softball that rolled off the top shelf before it hit his head he shut everything in again got a cooler out of his fridge and put it and the medical kit on the floor next to me please dont tell me that this is all i can do he said no theres something else he spread his hands well id like you to find out what the vampire courts know about the manhunt and i need you to stay under the radar while you do it he stared at me for a moment and then exhaled slowly why i shrugged ive got to know more about whats going on i cant ask my people and if a bunch of people know youre asking around someone is going to connect some dots and take a harder look at chicago my brother the vampire went completely still for a moment it isnt something human beings can do all of him even the sense of his presence in the room just stopped i felt like i was staring at a wax figure youre asking me to bring justine into this he said justine was the girl who had been willing to give her life for my brother and who hed nearly killed himself to protect love didnt begin to cover what they had neither did broken my brother was a vampire of the white court for him love hurt thomas and justine couldnt ever be together shes the personal aide of the leader of the white court i said if anyones in a good position to find out she is he rose the motion a little too quick to be wholly human and paced back and forth in agitation shes already taking enough risks feeding information on the white courts activities back to you when its safe for her to do it i dont want her taking more chances i get that i said but situations like this are the whole reason she went undercover in the first place this is exactly the kind of thing she wanted to do when she went in thomas mutely shook his head i sighed look im not asking her to deactivate the tractor beam rescue the princess and escape to the fourth moon of yavin i just need to know what shes heard and what she can find out without blowing her cover he paced for another half a minute or so before he stopped and stared at me hard promise me something first what promise me that you wont put her in any more danger than she already is promise me that you wont act on any information they could trace back to her dammit thomas i said wearily that just isnt possible theres no way to know exactly which information will be safe to use and no way to know for certain which bits of data might be misinformation promise me he said emphasizing both words i shook my head i promise that ill do absolutely everything in my power to keep justine safe his jaws clenched a few times the promise didnt satisfy himthough it was probably more accurate to say that the situation didnt satisfy him he knew i couldnt guarantee her complete safety and he knew that id given him everything i could he took a deep slow breath then he nodded okay he said chapter four about five minutes after i left thomass place i found myself instinctively checking the rearview mirror every couple of seconds and recognized the quiet tension that had begun to flow through me my gut was telling me that id picked up a tail granted it was only an intuition but hey wizard over here my instincts had earned enough credibility to make me pay attention to them if they told me someone was following me it was time to start watching my back if someone was following me it wasnt necessarily connected to the current situation with morgan i mean it didnt absolutely have to be right but i hadnt survived a ton of ugly furballs by being thick all of the time generally maybe but not all the time and id be an idiot to assume that my sudden company was unconnected to morgan i took a few turns purely for fun but i couldnt spot any vehicles following mine that didnt necessarily mean anything a good surveillance team working together could follow a target all but invisibly especially at night when every car on the road looked pretty much like the same pair of headlights just because i couldnt see them didnt mean that they werent there the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and i felt my shoulders ratcheting tighter with each passing streetlight what if my pursuer wasnt in a car my imagination promptly treated me to visions of numerous winged horrors soaring silently on batlike wings just above the level of the ambient light of the city preparing to dive down upon the blue beetle and tear it into strips of sheet metal the streets were busy as they almost always were in this part of town it was one hell of a public location for a hit but that didnt automatically preclude the possibility it had happened to me before i chewed on my lower lip and thought i couldnt go back to my apartment until i was sure that i had shaken the tail to do that id have to spot him i wasnt going to get through the next two days without taking some chances i figured i might as well get started i drew in a deep breath focused my thoughts and blinked slowly once when i opened my eyes again i brought my sight along with them a wizards sight his ability to perceive the world around him in a vastly broadened spectrum of interacting forces is a dangerous gift whether its called spirit vision or inner sight or the third eye it lets you perceive things youd otherwise never be able to interact with it shows you the world the way it really is matter all intertwined with a universe of energy of magic the sight can show you beauty that would make angels weep humble tears and terrors that the blackgoatwithathousandyoung wouldnt dare use for its kids bedtime stories whatever you see the good the bad the insanityinducingit sticks with you forever you cant ever forget it and time doesnt blur the memories its yours permanently wizards who run around using their sight willynilly wind up bonkers my third eye showed me chicago in its true shape and for a second i thought i had been teleported to vegas energy ran through the streets the buildings the people appearing to me as slender filaments of light that ran this way and that plunging into solid objects and out the other side without interruption the energies coursing through the grand old buildings had a solid and unmoving stability about them as did the city streetsbut the rest of it the random energies generated by the thoughts and emotions of eight million people was completely unplanned and coursed everywhere in frenetic haphazard garish color clouds of emotion were interspersed with the flickering campfire sparks of ideas heavy flowing streams of deep thought rolled slowly beneath blazing dancing gems of joy the muck of negative emotions clung to surfaces staining them darker while fragile bubbles of dreams floated blissfully toward kaleidoscope stars holy crap i could barely see the lines on the road through all of that i checked over my shoulder seeing each occupant of the cars behind me clearly as brilliantly lit shapes of white that skittered with other colors that changed with thoughts moods and personalities if id been closer to them id have been able to see more details about them though they would be subject to my subconscious interpretation even at this distance though i could tell that they were all mortals that was a relief in some ways id be able to spot any wizard strong enough to be one of the wardens if whoever was pursuing me was a normal it was almost certain that the wardens hadnt caught up to morgan yet i checked up above me and time froze try to imagine the stench of rotten meat imagine the languid arrhythmic pulsing of a corpse filled with maggots imagine the scent of stale body odor mixed with mildew the sound of nails screeching across a chalkboard the taste of rotten milk and the flavor of spoiled fruit now imagine that your eyes can experience those things all at once in excruciating detail thats what i saw a stomachchurning nightmareinducing mass blazing like a lighthouse beacon upon one of the buildings above me i could vaguely make out a physical form behind it but it was like trying to peer through raw sewage i couldnt get any details through the haze of absolute wrongness that surrounded it as it bounded from the edge of one rooftop to another moving more than fast enough to keep pace with me someone screamed and i dimly noted that it was probably me the car hit something that made it shriek in protest it jounced hard up and down whamwham id drifted into the curb i felt the front wheels shimmy through the steering wheel and i slammed on the brakes still screaming as i fought to close my third eye the next thing i knew car horns were blaring an impatient symphony i was sitting in the drivers seat gripping the wheel until my knuckles were white the engine had died judging from the dampness on my cheeks i must have been cryingunless id started foaming at the mouth which i reflected was a distinct possibility stars and stones what on gods green earth was that thing even brushing against the subject in my thoughts was enough to bring the memory of the thing back to me in all its hideous terror i flinched and squeezed my eyes shut shoving hard against the steering wheel i could feel my body shaking i dont know how long it took me to fight my way clear of the memoryand when i did everything was the same only louder with the clock counting down i couldnt afford to let the cops take me into custody for a dwi but thats exactly what would happen if i didnt start driving again assuming i didnt actually wreck the car first i took a deep breath and willed myself not to think of the apparition i saw it again when i came back id bitten my tongue and my throat felt raw i shook even harder there was no way i could drive not like this one stray thought and i could get somebody killed in a collision but i couldnt remain there either i pulled the beetle up onto the sidewalk where it would be out of the street at least then i got out of the car and started walking away the city would tow me in about three point five milliseconds but at least i wouldnt be around to get arrested i stumbled down the sidewalk hoping that my pursuer the apparition wasnt when i looked up again i was curled into a ball on the ground muscles aching from cramping so tight people were walking wide around me giving me nervous sidelong glances i felt so weak that i wasnt sure i could stand i needed help i looked up at the street signs on the nearest corner and stared at them until my cudgeled brain finally worked out where i was standing i rose forced to lean on my staff to stay upright and hobbled forward as quickly as i could i started calculating prime numbers as i walked focusing on the process as intently as i would any spell one i muttered through clenched teeth two three five seven eleven thirteen and i staggered through the night literally too terrified to think about what might be coming after me chapter five by the time id reached twentytwo hundred and thirtynine id arrived at billy and georgias place life had changed for the young werewolves since billy had graduated and started pulling in serious money as an engineer but they hadnt moved out of the apartment theyd had in college georgia was still in school learning something psychological and they were saving for a house good thing for me i wouldnt have been able to walk to the suburbs georgia answered the door she was a tall woman lean and willowy and in a tshirt and loose long shorts she looked smarter than she did pretty my god she said when she saw me harry hey georgia i said twentytwo hundred and uh fortythree i need a dark quiet room she blinked at me what twentytwo hundred and fiftyone i responded seriously and send up the wolfsignal you want the gang here twentytwo hundred and uh sixty seven she stepped back from the door holding the door open for me harry what are you talking about i came inside twentytwo hundred and sixty not divisible by three sixtynine i need a dark room quiet protection is something after you georgia said even with the help of eratosthenes when georgia asked the question and my brain answered it i couldnt keep the image of that thingfrom invading my thoughts and it drove me to my knees and would have sent me all the way to the floorexcept that billy caught me before i could get there he was a short guy maybe five six but he had the upper body of a professional wrestler and moved with the speed and precision of a predator dark room i gasped call in the gang hurry do it georgia said her voice low and urgent she shut the door and locked it then slammed down a heavy wooden beam the size of a picnic tables bench that they had installed themselves get him into our room ill make the calls got it billy said he picked me up the way youd carry a child barely grunting as he did he carried me down the hall and into a dark bedroom he laid me down on a bed then crossed to the windowand pulled and locked a heavy steel security curtain over it evidently another customization that he and georgia had installed what do you need harry billy asked dark quiet explain it later he put a hand on my shoulder and said right then he padded out of the room and shut the door it left me in the dark with my thoughtswhich is where i needed to be come on harry i muttered to myself get used to the idea and i thought about the thing id seen it hurt but when i came back to myself i did it again and again and again yes id seen something horrible yes it was a hideous terror but id seen other things too i called up those memories too all of them just as sharp and fresh as the horror pressing upon me id seen good people screaming in madness under the influence of black magic id seen the true selves of men and women good and bad seen people killand die id seen the queens of faerie as they prepared for battle drawing all their awful power around them and id be damned if i was going to roll over for one more horrible thing doing nothing but jumping from one rooftop to another come on punk i snarled at the memory next to those others youre a bad yearbook picture and i hit myself with it again and again filling my mind with every horrible and beautiful thing i had ever seenand as i did i focused on what i had bloody well done about it i remembered the things id battled and destroyed i remembered the strongholds of nightmares and terrors that i had invaded the dark gates id kicked down i remembered the faces of prisoners id freed and the funerals of those id been too late to save i remembered the sounds of voices and laughter the joy of loved ones reunited the tears of the lost and bereaved there are bad things in the world theres no getting away from that but that doesnt mean nothing can be done about them you cant abandon life just because its scary and just because sometimes you get hurt the memory of the thing hurt like hellbut pain wasnt anything special or new id lived with it before and would do it again it wasnt the first thing id seen and it wouldnt be the last i was not going to roll over and die sledgehammers of perfect memory pounded me down into blackness when i pulled myself back together i was sitting on the bed my legs folded indianstyle my palms rested on my knees my breathing was slow and rhythmically heavy my back was straight my head pounded painfully but not cripplingly so i looked up and around the room it was dark but id been in there long enough for my eyes to adjust to the light coming under the door i could see myself in the dresser mirror my back was straight and relaxed id taken my coat off and was wearing a black tshirt that read prefectionist in small white letters backward in the mirror a thin dark runnel of blood had streamed from each nostril and was now drying on my upper lip i could taste blood in my mouth probably from where id bitten my tongue earlier i thought of my pursuer again and the image made me shudderbut that was all i kept breathing slowly and steadily that was the upside of being human on the whole were an adaptable sort of being certainly id never be able to get rid of my memory of this awful thing or any of the other awful things id seenso if the memory couldnt change it would have to be me i could get used to seeing that kind of horror enough to see it and yet remain a reasoning being better men than i had done so morgan had i shivered again and not because of any memory it was because i knew what it could mean when you forced yourself to live with hideous things like that it changed you maybe not all at once maybe it didnt turn you into a monster but id been scarred and i knew it how many times would something like this need to happen before i started bending myself into something horrible just to survive i was young for a wizard where would i be after decades or centuries of refusing to look away ask morgan i got up and went into the bathroom attached to the bedroom i turned on the lights and winced as they raked at my eyes i washed the blood from my face and cleaned the sink of it carefully in my business you dont leave your blood where anyone can find it then i put my coat back on and left the bedroom billy and georgia were in the living room billy was at the window that led out to the tiny balcony georgia was on the phone im not getting anything out here billy said is he sure georgia murmured into the phone yes hes sure it circled this way it should be in sight from where you are it isnt billy said he turned his head over his shoulder and said harry are you all right ill survive i said and paced over to the window it followed me here huh somethings outside billy said something weve never run into before its been playing hideandseek with kirby and andi for an hour they cant catch it or get a good look at it i gave billy a sharp look there werent many things that could keep ahead of the werewolves working together wolves are just too damn alert and quick and billy and company had been working chicago almost as long as i had they knew how to handle themselvesand in the past couple of months id been teaching my apprentice a little humility by letting her try her veiling spells against the werewolves theyd hunted her down in moments every time so whatevers out there it isnt human i said not if it can stay ahead of kirby and andi i crossed to the window and stared out with billy and it can veil itself from sight what is it billy asked quietly i dont know i said but its real bad i glanced back at georgia how long was i down she checked her watch eightytwo minutes i nodded its had plenty of time to try to come in if thats what it wanted i felt a nauseated little quiver in my stomach as a tight smile stretched my lips its playing with me what billy said its dancing around in front of us out there under a veil its daring me to use my sight so that ill be able to spot it from outside there was a sound a cry it was short and highpitched loud enough to make the windows quiver id never heard anything like it before the hair stood up on the back of my neck a purely instinctive reaction my instincts had been tracking this thing well so far so i trusted them when they told me one more thingthat cry was a statement the hunt was on an instant later every light in sight blew out in a shower of sparks and darkness swallowed several city blocks tell andi and kirby to get back here to the apartment i snapped at georgia i grabbed my staff from where it leaned against the wall by the door billy youre with me get your game face on harry georgia said confused now i snapped flinging the bar off the door by the time id reached the bottom of the stairs there was the sound of a heavy controlled impact and a wolf with hair the same dark brown as billys hit the floor next to me it was an enormous beast easily as heavy as mouse but taller and leanera wolf the world has rarely seen between here and the last ice age i slammed open the door and let billy out ahead of me he bounded over a parked carand i mean completely over it lengthwiseand shot toward the buildings at the back of the complex billy had been in contact with andi and kirby and knew their approximate positions i followed him my staff in hand already summoning up my will i wasnt sure what was out here but i wanted to be ready for it kirby appeared from around the northernmost corner of the other building he hurried along with a cell phone pressed to his ear a lanky darkhaired young man in sweat pants and a baggy tshirt the active phone painted half his face like a miniature floodlight i checked the southern corner of the building at once and saw a dark furry shape trotting around the cornerandi like billy in her wolf form wait a minute if the whateveritwas had taken out the local lights how in the hell had kirbys cell phone survived the hex magic and technology dont get along so well and the more complex electronic devices tended to fall apart most quickly cell phones were like those security guys in red shirts on old star trek as soon as something started happening they were always the first to go if the creature whatever it was had blown out the lights it would have gotten the phone too unless it hadnt wanted to take the phone out kirby was the only clearly lit object in sightan ideal target when the attack came it came fast there was a ripple in the air as something moving beneath a veil crossed between me and the light cast by kirbys phone there was an explosive snarl and the phone went flying leaving kirby hidden in shadow billy flung himself forward even as i ripped the silver pentacle amulet from around my neck and lifted it calling forth silverblue wizard light with my will light flooded the area between the complexs buildings kirby was on his back in the center of a splatter of black that could only be blood billy was standing crouched over him his teeth bared in a snarl he suddenly lunged forward teeth ripping and a distortion of the air in front of him bounded up and then to one side i lurched forward feeling as if i was running through hipdeep peanut butter i got the impression of something fourlegged and furry evading billys attack a raw flicker of vision like something seen out of the very corner of the eye then billy was on his back slashing with canine claws ripping savagely with his teeth while something shadowy and massive overbore him pinning him down andi a redfurred wolf that was smaller and swifter than billys form hurtled through the air and tore at the back of the attacker it screamed again the sound deeperchested than before more resonant the creature whirled on andi too swiftly to be believed and a limb slammed into her sending her flying into a brick wall she hit with a yipping cry of pain and a hideous snapping sound i raised my staff anger and terror and determination surging down into the wooden tool and shouted forzare my will unspooled into a lance of invisible energy and slammed into the creature ive flipped over cars with blasts of force like that but the thing barely rocked back slapping at the air with its forelimbs the blast shattered against it in a shower of reddish sparks the conflicting energies disrupted its veil just for a second i saw something somewhere between a cougar and a bear with sparse dirty golden fur it must have weighed several hundred pounds it had oversized fangs bloodied claws and its eyes were a bright and sickly yellow that looked reptilian somehow its snarling mouth twisted in a way that no animals could forming words albeit words that i did not understand its form twisted changing with liquid speed and in maybe half a second a cougar bigger than any mountain lion id ever even heard about was hurtling toward me vanishing into the rippling colors of a veil as it came i brought up my left hand slamming my will into the bracelet hung upon it the bracelet a braid of metals hung with charms in the shape of medieval shields was another tool like the staff a device that let me focus the energies i wielded more quickly and efficiently a quarter dome of bluewhite light sprang into existence before me and the creature slammed into it like a brick wall well more like a rickety wooden wall i felt the shield begin to give as the creature struck itbut at least initially it stopped it in its tracks billy hit it low and hard the great dark wolf sailed in teeth ripping and got hold of something the creature howled this time more in pain than fury and whirled on billybut the leader of chicagos resident werewolves was already on the way back out and he bounded aside from the creatures counterattack it was faster than billy was it caught him and i saw billy hunch his shoulders against its attack his fur being bloodied as he crouched low standing his ground so that georgia could hit it low and hard georgia s wolf form was dusty brown taller and lither than billys and moved with deadly precision she raked at the creature forcing it to turn to heronly to be forced to keep whirling as billy went after its flank i brandished my staff timing my shot with my teeth gritted and then screamed again as i sent another lance of force at the creature aiming for its legs the blast tore gashes in the asphalt and brought the nearly invisible thing to the ground once more disrupting its veil billy and georgia rushed toward it to keep it pinned down and i raised my staff calling up more energy my next shot was going to piledriver the thing straight down into the water table by god but once more its shape turned liquidand suddenly a hawk with a wingspan longer than my car tore into the air reptilian yellow eyes glaring it soared aloft its wings beating twice and vanished into the night sky i stared after that for a second then i said oh crap i looked around in the wildly dancing light of my amulet and rushed toward andi she was unconscious her body reverted to its human formthat of a redhead with a killer figure one entire side of her body was a swelling purple bruise she had a broken arm shoulder ribs and her face was so horribly damaged that i had to worry about her skull as well she was breathing barely the shapeshifter had been strong georgia arrived at my side in wolf form her eyes ears and nose all alert scanning around us above us i turned my head to see billy nude and in human form crouched over kirby i lifted my light and moved a couple of steps over toward him so i could see kirbys throat was gone just gone there was a scoop of flesh as wide as my palm missing and bare vertebrae showed at the back of it the edges of the gaping wound were black and crumbling as if charred to black dust kirbys eyes were glassy and staring his blood was everywhere hells bells i breathed i stared at the dead young man a friend and shook my head hard once billy come on andis still alive we cant leave her out here weve got to get her behind your threshold and get her an ambulance now billy crouched over kirby his face twisted in confusion and rage will i shouted he looked up at me andi i said help me get her inside he nodded jerkily then the two of us went to her we laid my duster out on the ground and got her onto it as gently as we could then we picked her up and carried her back toward the apartment building people were calling out in the buildings around us now flashlights and candles and chemical glow lights had begun to appear i had no doubt that within a few minutes wed get sirens too from somewhere above us there was a contemptuous brassy crythe same tone i heard before though modulated differently now coming from an avian throat what was that billy asked his tone dull and heavy what was that thing im not certain i answered breathing hard georgia was coming along behind us dragging my staff in her jaws but if its what i think it is things just got a lot worse billy looked up at me kirbys blood all over his face and hands what is it harry a native american nightmare i said i looked at him grimly a skinwalker chapter six georgia told the emts she was andis sister which was true in a spiritual sense i suppose and rode with her in the ambulance to the hospital the emts looked grim the cops had gathered around kirbys body and were busy closing off the scene i have to be here billy said i know i said im on the clock billy i cant stay i cant lose the time he nodded what do i need to know about skinwalkers theyre theyre just evil man they like hurting people shapeshifters obviouslyand the more afraid of them you are the more powerful they get they literally feed on fear billy eyed me meaning you arent going to tell me anything more because it wont help me you think it will scare me we knew it was here we were ready for a fight and you saw what happened i said if it had hit us from a real ambush it would have been worse he bared his teeth in a snarl we had it we had it at a momentary disadvantageand it saw that and it was smart enough to leave and come back later all we did was prove to it that it would have to take us seriously to kill us we wont get another opportunity like that one i put a hand on his shoulder you and georgia stay close to andi this thing likes hurting people and it gets off on hunting down wounded prey shes still in danger got it he said quietly what are you going to do find out why its here i said theres council business afoot christ i didnt mean to bring you into this i stared toward the knot of officers around kirbys corpse i didnt mean for this to happen kirby was an adult dresden billy said he knew what could happen he chose to be here which was the truth but it didnt help kirby was still dead i hadnt known what the skinwalkerwas before beyond something awful but that didnt change anything kirby was still dead and andi god i hadnt even thought about that part andi and kirby had been an intense item she was going to be heartbroken assuming she didnt die too billyi just couldnt think of him as willblinked tears out of his eyes and said you didnt know it was going to come down like that man we all owe you our lives harry im glad we got the chance to be there for you he nodded toward the police ill do the talking then get to georgia youd better go we traded grips and his was crushingly tight with tension and grief i nodded to him and turned to leave the city lights were starting to come back on as i went out the back entrance to wills building down a side street and through an alley that ran behind an old bookstore where i wasnt welcome anymore i passed the spot in that alley where id nearly died and shivered as i did id barely dodged the old mans scythe that day tonight kirby hadnt my head felt dislocated somehow i should be feeling more than i was i should be madder than hell i should be shaking with fear something but instead i felt like i was observing events from a remote cold place somewhere up above and behind me it was i reasoned probably a side effect of exposing myself to the skinwalkers true form or rather a side effect of what id had to do to get over it i wasnt worried about the skinwalker sneaking up on me oh sure he might do it but not cold supernatural beings like the skinwalker had so much power that reality itself gets a little strained around them wherever they go and that has a number of side effects one of them is a sort of psychic stench that goes with thema presence that my instincts had twigged to long before the skinwalker had been in a position to do me any real harm read a little folklore the stuff that hasnt been prettied up by disney and the like start with the brothers grimm it wont tell you about skinwalkers but it will give you a good idea of just how dark some of those tales can be skinwalkers are dark compared to that youve got to get the real stories from the peoples of the navajo ute and other southwestern tribes to get the really juicy material they dont talk about them often because the genuine and entirely rational fear the stories inspire only makes the creatures stronger the tribes rarely talk about them with outsiders because outsiders have no foundation of folklore to draw upon to protect themselvesand because you never know when the outsider to whom youre telling dark tales might be a skinwalker looking to indulge a sense of macabre irony but ive been in the business awhile and i know people who know the stories theyd confided a handful to me in broad daylight looking nervously around them as they spoke as if afraid that dredging up the dark memories might catch a skinwalkers attention because sometimes it did thats how bad skinwalkers are even amongst the people who know the danger they represent who know better than anyone else in the world how to defend against them no one wants to talk about skinwalkers but in a way it worked in my favor walking down a dark alley in the middle of a chicago night and stepping over the spot on the concrete where id almost been ripped to pieces just wasnt spooky enough to encompass the presence of a skinwalker if things got majorly tales from the darksidecreepy and shivery id know i was in real trouble as it was the night was simply a small figure in a lightweight cubs jacket stepped around the corner at the end of the alley the newly restored streetlight shone on blond hair and sergeant karrin murphy said evening dresden complicated murph i responded woodenly murphy was a sergeant with chicago pds special investigations department when something supernaturally bad happened and the cops got involved murphy often contacted me to get my take on things the city didnt want to hear about imaginary things like skinwalkers or vampires they just wanted the problem to go awaybut murphy and the rest of si were the people who had to make it happen i tip a guy down at impound to keep an eye out for certain vehicles murphy said pay him in bottles of mcanallys ale he calls me and tells me your car got brought in uhhuh i said murphy fell into pace beside me as i turned out onto the sidewalk she was five feet nothing with blond hair that fell a little past her shoulders and blue eyes she was more cute than pretty and looked like someones favorite aunt which seemed likely she had a fairly large irish catholic family then i hear about a power outage she said and a huge disturbance at the same apartments where your werewolf friends live i hear about a girl who might not make it and a boy who didnt yeah i said it might have come out a little bleak who was it murphy asked kirby i said jesus murphy said what happened something fast and mean was following me the werewolves jumped it things went bad murphy nodded and stopped and i dimly realized that we were standing next to her saturnan updated version of the one that had been blown upblithely parked in front of a hydrant she went around to the trunk and popped it open i took a look at that pile of parts you call a car she drew out the medical toolbox and cooler from her trunk and held them up these were on the passenger seat i thought they might have been there for a reason hells bells in the confusion of the attack and its aftermath i had all but forgotten the whole reason id gone out in the first place i took the medical kit from her as she offered it yeah stars and stones yeah murph thank you you need a ride she asked me id been planning on flagging down a cab eventually but it would be better not to spend the money if i didnt need to wizarding might be sexy but it didnt pay nearly as well as lucrative careers like law enforcement sure i said what a coincidence i need some questions answered she unlocked the door with an actual key not the little whatsit that does it for you automatically with the press of a button and held it open for me with a gallant little gesture like id done for her about a million times she probably thought she was mocking me with that impersonation she was probably right this mess was getting stickier by the minute and i didnt want to drag murphy into it i mean jesus the werewolves had been capable defenders of their territory for a long while and id gotten half of them taken out in the first couple hours of the case murphy wouldnt fare any better in the waters through which i was currently swimming on the other hand i trusted murph i trusted her judgment her ability to see where her limits lay shed seen cops carved to pieces when they tried to box out of their weight division and knew better than to attempt it and if she started throwing obstacles in my wayand she could a lot of them that i couldnt do diddly aboutthen my life would get a whole lot harder even though she wasnt running cpds special investigations department anymore she still had clout there and a word from her to lieutenant stallings could hobble me maybe lethally so i guess you could say that murphy was threatening to bust me if i didnt talk to her and youd be right and you could say that murphy was offering to put her life on the line to help me and youd be right and you could say that murphy had done me a favor with the medical kit in order to obligate me to her when she told me that she wanted to be dealt in and youd be right you could also say that i was standing around dithering when time was critical and youd be right about that too at the end of the day murphy is good people i got in the car so let me get this straight murphy said as we approached my apartment youre hiding a fugitive from your own peoples cops and you think the guys been set up in order to touch off a civil war within the white council and theres some kind of navajo boogeyman loose in town following you around and attempting to kill you and you arent sure theyre related more like i dont know how theyre related yet murphy chewed on her lip is there anyone on the council who is in tight with native american boogeymen hard to imagine it i said quietly injun joe listenstowind was a senior council member who was some kind of native american shaman he was a doctor a healer and a specialist in exorcisms and restorative magic he was in fact a decent guy he liked animals but someones a traitor murphy said quietly right yeah i said someone murphy nodded frowning at the road ahead of her the reason treachery is so reviled she said in a careful tone of voice is because it usually comes from someone you didnt think could possibly do such a thing i didnt say anything in reply in a minute her car crunched to a stop in the little gravel lot outside my apartment i picked up the medical kit the cooler and my staff and got out of the car call me the minute you know something she said yep i told her dont take any chances if you see something coming she shook her head they arent your kids harry doesnt matter anything you can do to protect them in the hospital relax she said your werewolves wont be alone ill see to it i nodded and closed my eyes for a second harry she asked me yeah you dont look so good its been a long night i said yeah she said look i know something about those murphy did shed had more than her share of psychic trauma shed seen friends die too my memory turned out an unwelcome flash from years beforeher former partner carmichael half eviscerated and bleeding to death on white institutional tile flooring ill make it i said of course you will she said theres just theres a lot of ways you could deal harry some of them are better than others i care about what happens to you and im here i kept my eyes closed in order to make sure i didnt start crying like a girl or something i nodded not trusting myself to speak take care harry she said you too i said it came out a little raspy i tilted the toolbox at her in a wave and headed into my apartment to see morgan i had to admiti hated hearing the sound of my friends car leaving i pushed those thoughts away psychic trauma or not i could fall to little pieces later i had work to do chapter seven morgan woke up when i opened the bedroom door he looked bad but not any worse than he did before except for some spots of color on his cheeks lemme see to my roommates i said i got the goods i put the medical kit down on the nightstand he nodded and closed his eyes i took mouse outside for a walk to the mailbox he seemed unusually alert nose snuffling at everything but he didnt show any signs of alarm we went by the spot in the tiny backyard that had been designated as mouses business area and went back inside mister my bobtailed grey tomcat was waiting when i opened the door and tried to bolt out i caught him barely mister weighs the next best thing to thirty pounds he gave me a look that might have been indignant then raised his stumpy tail straight in the air and walked haughtily away making his way to his usual resting point atop one of my apartments bookcases mouse looked at me with his head tilted as i shut the door something bad is running around out there i told him it might decide to send me a message id rather he didnt use mister to do it mouses cavernous chest rumbled with a low growl or you either for that matter i told him i dont know if you know what a skinwalker is but its serious trouble watch yourself mouse considered that for a moment and then yawned i found myself laughing pride goes before a fall boy he wagged his tail at me and rubbed up against my leg evidently pleased to have made me smile i made sure both sets of bowls had food and water in them and then went in to morgan his temperature was up another half a degree and he was obviously in pain this isnt heavyduty stuff i told him as i broke out the medical kit me and billy made a run up to canada for most of it theres some codeine for the pain though and ive got the stuff to run an iv for you saline intravenous antibiotics morgan nodded then he frowned at me an expression i was used to from him raked his eyes over me more closely and asked is that blood i smell on you damn for a guy who had been beaten to within a few inches of deaths door he was fairly observant andi hadnt really been bleeding when we picked her up in my coat she was only oozing from a number of gouges and scrapesbut there had been enough of them to add up yeah i said what happened i told him about the skinwalker and what had happened to kirby and andi he shook his head wearily theres a reason we dont encourage amateurs to try to act like wardens dresden i scowled at him got a bowl of warm water and some antibacterial soap and started cleaning up his left arm yeah well i didnt see any wardens doing anything about it chicago is your area of responsibility warden dresden and there i was i said and if they hadnt been there to help id be dead right now then you call for backup you dont behave like a bloody superhero and throw lambs to the wolves to help you do it those are the people youre supposed to be protecting good thinking i said getting out the bag of saline and suspending it from the hook id set in the wall over the bed i made sure the tube was primed air bubbles bad thats exactly what we need more wardens in chicago morgan grunted and fell silent for a moment eyes closed i thought hed dropped off again but evidently he was only thinking it must have followed me up huh the skinwalker he said when i left edinburgh i took a way to tucson i came to chicago by train it must have sensed me when the tracks passed through its territory why would it do that follow an injured wizard he asked because they get stronger by devouring the essence of practitioners i was an easy meal it eatsmagic morgan nodded adds its victims power to its own so what youre telling me is that not only did the skinwalker get away but now its stronger for having killed kirby he shrugged i doubt the werewolf represented much gain relative to what it already possessed your talents or mine are orders of magnitude greater i took up a rubber hose and bound it around morgans upper arm i waited for the veins just below the bend of his elbow to pop up seems like an awfully unlikely chance encounter morgan shook his head skinwalkers can only dwell on tribal lands in the american southwest it wasnt as if whoever is framing me would know that i was going to escape and flee to tucson point i said slipping the needle into his arm who would wanna go there in the summer anyway i thought about it the skinwalkers got to go back to his home territory though morgan nodded the longer hes away the more power it costs him how long can he stay here i asked he winced as i missed the vein and had to try again more than long enough how do we kill it i frowned as i missed the vein again give me that morgan muttered he took the needle and inserted it himself smoothly and got it on the first try i guess you learn a few things over a dozen decades we probably dont he said the true skinwalkers the naagloshii are millennia old tangling with them is a fools game we avoid it i taped down the needle and hooked up the catheter pretend for a minute that it isnt going to cooperate with that plan morgan grunted and scratched at his chin with his other hand there are some native magics that can cripple or destroy it a true shaman of the blood could perform an enemy ghost way and drive it out without those our only recourse is to hit it with a lot of raw powerand it isnt likely to stand still and cooperate with that plan either its a tough target i admitted it knows magic and how to defend against it yes morgan said he watched me pick a preloaded syringe of antibiotics from the cooler and its abilities are more than the equal of both of us put together jinkies i said i primed the syringe and pushed the antibiotics into the iv line then i got the codeine and a cup of water offering morgan both he downed the pills laid his head back wearily and closed his eyes i saw one once too he said i started cleaning up i didnt say anything they arent invulnerable they can be killed i tossed wrappers into the trash can and restored equipment to the medical kit i grimaced at the bloodied rug that still lay beneath morgan id have to get that out from under him soon i turned to leave but stopped in the doorway howd you do it i asked without looking behind me it took him a moment to answer i thought hed passed out again it was the fifties he said started in new mexico it followed me to nevada i lured it onto a government testing site and stepped across into the nevernever just before the bomb went off i blinked and looked over my shoulder at him you nuked it he opened one eye and smiled it was sort of creepy stars and stones thats i had to call a spade a spade kind of cool gets me to sleep at night he mumbled he closed his eye again sighed and let his head sag a little to one side i watched over his sleep for a moment and then closed the door i was pretty tired myself but like the man said i have promises to keep i sighed to myself i got on the phone and started calling my contacts on the paranet the paranet was an organization id helped found a couple of years before its essentially a union whose members cooperate in order to protect themselves from paranormal threats most of the paranet consisted of practitioners with marginal talents of which there were plenty a practitioner had to be in the top percentile before the white council would even consider recognizing him and those who couldnt cut it basically got left out in the cold as a result they were vulnerable to any number of supernatural predators which i think sucks so an old friend named elaine mallory and i had taken a dead womans money and begun making contact with the marginal folks in city after city wed encouraged them to get together to share information to have someone they could call for help if things started going bad a distress call could be sent up the paranet and then i or one of the other wardens in the us could charge in we also gave seminars on how to recognize magical threats as well as teaching methods of basic selfdefense for when the capes couldnt show up to save the day it had been going pretty well we already had new chapters opening up in mexico and canada and europe wouldnt be far behind so i started calling up my contacts in those various cities asking if theyd heard of anything odd happening i couldnt afford to get any more specific than that but as it turned out i didnt need to of the first dozen calls folks in four cities had noted an upswing in warden activity reporting that they were all appearing in pairs only two of the next thirty towns had similar reports but it was enough to give me a good idea of what was going ona quiet manhunt but i just had to wonder of all the places the wardens could choose to hunt for morgan why would they pick poughkeepsie why omaha the words wildgoose chase sprang to mind whatever morgan was doing to mask his presence from their tracking spells it had them chasing their tails all over the place at least i accomplished one positive thing establishing rumors of wardens on the move meant that i had a good and nonsuspicionarousing motivation to start asking questions of my own so next i started calling the wardens i was on good terms with three of them worked for me technically speaking in several cities in the eastern and midwestern united states im not a very good boss i mostly just let them decide how to do their job and try to lend a hand when they ask me for help i had to leave messages for two but bill meyers in dallas answered on the second ring howdy meyers said im serious he actually answered the phone that way bill its dresden harry he said politely bill was always polite with me he saw me do something scary once speak of the devil and he appears is that why my nose was itching i asked likely bill drawled i was gonna give you a call in the morning yeah whats up rumors bill said i spotted two wardens coming out of the local entrance to the ways but when i asked them what was up they stonewalled me i figured you might know what was going on darn i said i called to ask you he snorted well were a fine bunch of wise men arent we as far as the council is concerned the us wardens are a bunch of mushrooms eh kept in the dark and fed on bullshit i hear that meyers said what do you want me to do keep an ear to the ground i told him captain luccio will tell us sooner or later ill call you as soon as i learn anything you do the same gotcha he said we hung up and i frowned at the phone for a moment the council hadnt talked to me about morgan they hadnt talked to any of the wardens in my command about him either i looked up at mister and said its almost like they want to keep me in the dark like maybe someone thinks i might be involved somehow which made sense the merlin wasnt going to be asking me to christmas dinner anytime soon he didnt trust me he might have given the order to keep me fenced out that wouldnt hit me as a surprise but if that was true then it meant that anastasia luccio captain of the wardens was going along with it she and i had been dating for a while now granted she had a couple of centuries on me but a runin with a bodyswitching psychopath several years before had trapped her in the body of a coed and she didnt look a day over twentyfive we got along well we made each other laugh and we occasionally had wildmonkey sex to our mutual intense satisfaction i would never have figured anastasia to play a game like that with me i got on the phone to ramirez in la the other regional commander in the united states to see if hed heard anything but just got his answering service at this rate i was going to have to go to the spirit world for answersand that was risky in more ways than one not the least of which was the very real possibility that i might get eaten by the same entity i called up to question but i was running a little low on options i pulled back the rug that lay over the trapdoor leading down to my lab and was about to go down and prepare my summoning circle when the phone rang im meeting justine in half an hour my brother told me okay i said come get me chapter eight chicago s club scene is wide and diverse you want to listen to extemporaneous jazz we got that you want a traditional irish pub a turkishstyle coffeehouse belly dancers japanese garden party swing dancing ballroom dancing beat poetry youre covered you dont have to look much harder to find all sorts of other clubsthe kind that ma and pa tourist dont take the kids to gay clubs lesbian clubs strip clubs leather clubs and more subtle flavors within the genre and then theres zero i stood with thomas outside what looked like a fireexit door at the bottom of a stairway a story below street level in the side of a downtown building a red neon oval had been installed on the door and it glowed with a sullen lurid heat the thump of a bass beat vibrated almost subaudibly up through the ground is this what i think it is i asked him thomas now dressed in a tightfitting white tshirt and old blue jeans glanced at me and arched one dark eyebrow depends on if you think its zero or not zeros one of those clubs that most people only hear rumors about it moves around the city from time to time but its always as exclusive as a popular nightspot in a metropolis can possibly be ive been a pi in chicago for better than a decade id heard of zero but that was it it was where the rich and beautiful and rich people of chicago went to indulge themselves you know somebody here i asked because they arent going to let us thomas popped a key into the lock turned it and opened the door for me in i finished a wash of heat and smoke heavy with legally questionable substances pushed gently against my chest i could hear the whumpwhumpwhump of techno dance music somewhere behind the redlit smoke its a family business thomas explained he put the keys back in his pocket an odd expression on his face i met justine at zero there any more of the other side of the family in there i asked him white court vampires were the least physically dangerous of any of the various vamps running aroundand the most scary creatures of seduction they fed upon the emotions and life energy of those they preyed upon their victims became addicted to the act and would willingly offer themselves up over and over until eventually there was nothing left to give the poor suckers in thrall to a white court vampire were virtually slaves tangling with them in any sense of the word was a bad idea thomas shook his head i doubt it or justine wouldnt have chosen to meet us here unless shed been forced to do so i thought to myself i didnt say anything i like to stay cozy with my paranoia not pass her around to my friends and family after you thomas said and then he calmly stripped his shirt off i eyed him the club has an image they strive to maintain he said he might have been just a little bit smug the bastard his abs look like they were added in with cgi my abs just look like i cant afford to feed myself very well oh i said do i need to take my shirt off too youre wearing a black leather coat thats wardrobe enough small favors i muttered then i went through the door we walked down a hallway that got darker louder and more illicitly aromatic as we went it ended at a black curtain and i pushed it aside to reveal a few more feet of hallway a door and two politely formidablelooking men in dark suits standing in front of it one of them lifted a hand and told me im sorry sir but this is a private thomas stepped up next to me and fixed the man with a steady grey gaze he lowered his hand and when he spoke it sounded rough as if his mouth had gone dry excuse me sir i didnt realize he was with you thomas kept staring the bouncer turned to the door unlocked it with a key of its own and opened the door will you be in need of a table sir drinks thomass unblinking gaze finally shifted from the guard as if the man had somehow vanished as a matter of any consequence my brother walked by him without saying anything at all the bouncer gave me a weak smile and said sorry about that sir enjoy your evening at zero sir thanks i said and followed my brother into a scene that split the difference between a dionysian bacchanal and a fellini flick there was no white light inside zero most of it was red punctuated in places with pools of blue and plenty of black lights scattered everywhere so that even where shadows were thickest some colors jumped out in disquieting luminescence cigarette smoke hung in a pall over the large room a distancedistorting haze under the black lights we had entered on a kind of balcony that overlooked the dance floor below music pounded the bass beat so loud that i could feel it in my lower stomach lights flashed and swayed in synchronicity the floor was crowded with sweating moving bodies dressed in a broad spectrum of clothing from full leather coverings including a wholehead hood at one extreme to one girl clad in a few strips of electrical tape on the other there was a bar down by the dance floor and tables scattered around its outskirts under a thirtyfoothigh ceiling a few cages hung about eight feet over the dance floor each containing a young man or woman in provocative clothing stairways and catwalks led up to about a dozen platforms that thrust out from the walls where patrons could sit and overlook the scene below while gaining a measure of privacy for themselves most of the platforms were furnished with couches and chaise longues rather than tables and chairs there were more exotic bits of furniture up on the platforms as well the giant x shape of a st andrews cross which was currently supporting the bound form of a young man his wrists and ankles secured to the cross his face to the wood his hair falling down over his naked back another platform had a shiny brass pole in its center and a pair of girls danced around it in the middle of a circle of men and women sprawled over the couches and lounges everywhere i looked people were doing things that would have gotten them arrested anywhere else couples threesomes foursomes and nineteensomes were fully engaged in sexual activity on some of the private platforms from where i stood i could see two different tables where lines of white powder waited to be inhaled a syringe disposal was on the wall next to every trash can marked with a bright biohazard symbol people were being beaten with whips and riding crops people were bound up with elaborate arrangements of ropes as well as with more prosaic handcuffs piercings and tattoos were everywhere screams and cries occasionally found their way through the music agony ecstasy joy or rage all indistinguishable from one another the lights flashed constantly changing and shifting and every beat of the music created a dozen new frozen montages of sybaritic abandon the music the light the sweat the smoke the booze the drugsit all combined into a wet desperate miasma that was full of needs that could never be sated thats why the place was called zero i realized zero limits zero inhibitions zero restraint it was a place of perfect focused abandon of indulgence and it was intriguing and hideous nauseating and viscerally hungry zero fulfillment i felt a shudder run through me this was the world as created by the white court this is what they would make of it if they were given the chance planet zero i glanced aside at thomas and saw him staring around the club his eyes had changed hue from their usual grey to a paler brighter silver actual flecks of metallic color in his eyes his eyes tracked over a pair of young women who were passing by us dressed in black lingerie under long leather coats and holding hands with their fingers intertwined the women both turned their eyes toward him as if theyd heard him call their names and stared for a second their steps slowing and faltering thomas dragged his eyes away and let that inhuman stillness fill him again the women blinked a few times then continued on their way their expressions vaguely puzzled hey i yelled through the music you all right he nodded once and then twitched his chin up at the highest platform in the building on the far side of the dance floor up there i nodded and thomas took the lead we negotiated the maze of catwalks and stairs they had been purposefully designed to be just barely too narrow for two people to pass one another without touching as i found out when thomas and i passed a girl in leather shorts and a bustier both of which strained to match themselves to a body whose curves were made ripe and inviting by the red lights primitive rhythm she slid by thomas her eyes locked on his chest as if she was about to lean over and bite him he ignored her but then the girl reached meand i take up more room than thomas i felt her hip brush me and she arched her back as i stepped past her turned sideways her breasts pressed against my sternum pliant resilient warmth and her lips were parted her eyes too bright her hand brushed over my thigh a touch that could have been accidental but wasnt and my body was suddenly demanding that i stop for a moment and see where this would lead you cant trust your body when it tells you stuff like that it doesnt understand about things like actual affection interaction pregnancy stds it just wants i tried not to pay any attention to itbut there were other people on the catwalks and evidently there was no such thing as a less than gorgeous woman inside zeros walls most of them seemed perfectly happy to make sure i knew it as they went by so did some of the men for that matter but that was less of an issue as far as my focus went it probably didnt help matters that we were walking by things that i hadnt ever seen before not even in movies there was this one girl doing a thing with her tongue and an ice cube that look just trust me on this one it was distracting as hell thomas was walking faster as we approached the stairway leading up to the highest platform and he took the last steps three at a time i followed along behind him scanning around me steadily trying to be on the lookout for potential bad guys this had the side effect of me getting to ogle more pretty girls than id ever seen in one place at one time but it was professional ogling one of them could have been concealing well actually i was sort of shocked at what one of them was concealing i made it up the last stairway just in time to see thomas throw himself into a womans arms justine wasnt particularly tall for a girl or at least she hadnt been before shed put on the boots with the fiveinch heels she looked like i remembered her lasta gorgeous face that still fell into the girlnextdoor category with a heartmelting smile her hair was silverwhite and was being held in a tight bun up high on the back of her head with a pair of white chopsticks of course the last time id seen her she hadnt been dressed in a formfitting white rubber cat suit that included gloves over her fingers it emphasized absolutely everything and did it well thomas fell to his knees and wrapped his arms around her waist drawing her to him she twined her rubbercovered arms around his neck and clung tightly both of them closed their eyes and just stood there for a long minute embracing without moving just holding each other close it was an alien act in that place i turned away leaned on the platforms safety railing and stared down at the club trying to give my brother and the woman he loved a moment of privacy justine hadnt worn the covereverything suit for the sake of fashion the touch of honest love real and selfless love was anathema to the white court thomas had told me about white court vampires who had been badly burned by the touch of some wedding rings or the brush of a sweethearts rose but most dangerous of all to them was the touch of someone who was loved and who loved in return id seen thomas give himself a seconddegree burn on his lips and mouth the last time hed kissed justine they hadnt been together since the night she had laid down her life to save his offering herself up to his hunger so that he could survive the evening thomas in turn had refused to devour her denying his own darker nature it had nearly killed her anyway turning her hair white literally overnight it had taken her years to recover her mind after a longterm addiction to being fed upon by an incubus but shed done it she was currently an assistant to thomass older sister lara and positioned to find out all kinds of juicy details about the white court being protected by love meant that the vamps couldnt feed on justine which lara thought ideal in a personal assistant it also meant that my brother couldnt touch the woman he loved if hed been like most of the white court only interested in feeding his hunger hed have been able to have her all he wanted instead sometimes irony is a lot like a big old kick in the balls i stared down at the dance floor for a while not so much ogling as simply taking in the light and motion as a whole until i saw them part in my peripheral vision then i turned and walked over to join them as justine gestured for us to sit on a pair of couches that had been moved to face each other thomas sat down in a corner of the couch and justine pressed up close against him careful to keep what little of her was exposed from touching his skin i settled down across from them leaning my elbows forward onto my knees i smiled at justine and nodded to her the floor and halfwall railing of the platform must have been made from soundabsorbing material the roar of the club was much reduced up here justine you look like the michelin mans wet dream she laughed pink touching her cheeks well the club has a look we try to maintain how are you harry half buzzed on this smoke and floundering i said thomas told me you had some information justine nodded seriously and picked up a manila file folder from the couch beside her word is out about a hunt for a renegade warden she said there werent a lot of details but i was able to turn up this she slid the folder over to me and i opened it the first page was a printout of a web site of some kind what the hell is craigslist its a site on the internet justine said its sort of like a giant classified ads section only you can get to it from anywhere in the world people use it to advertise goods they want to buy or sell goods thomas put in and services help wanted with veiled language for the lesslegal things a lot of shady deals happen there because its relatively easy to do so anonymously escorts mercenaries you name it there was an ad printed on it wanted for permanent position donald morgan mil finders fee considerations lostwardenfoundyahoocom hells bells i cursed quietly i passed the page to thomas a wanted poster he said i nodded and not dead or alive either they just want him dead every supernatural hitter on the bloody planet was going to be coming after morgan not so much for the money probably as for the favors that the ad promised they carry a hell of a lot more weight than cash in the world of the weird the five million was just there to provide scope a sense of scale for the favors that would come with it every button man in the world and his brother i muttered this just keeps getting better and better why would your people do that justine asked they wouldnt i said thomas frowned how do you know because the council solves things inhouse i said which was true they had their own assassin for jobs like this when he was needed i grimaced besides even if they did put out a hit they sure as hell wouldnt use the internet to do it thomas nodded fingers idly stroking justines rubberized shoulder then who did who indeed i said is there any way to find out who put this here or who this email thingy belongs to justine shook her head not with any confidence then well have to make contact ourselves thomas said maybe we can draw them out i scratched my chin thinking if theyve got a lick of sense they wont show themselves to anyone who isnt established in the field but its worth a try i sighed ive got to move him why thomas asked i tapped the page with my finger when the hard cases start coming out of the woodwork things are going to get messy and old people live upstairs from me thomas frowned and nodded where i began to answer when the tempo of the beat suddenly changed below and a wave of frenzied cries rolled up deafening despite any soundproofing a second after that an odd frisson crawled across my nerves and i felt my heart pound a little more quickly and the earlier demands my body had been making returned in a rush across from me justine shivered and her eyes slid almost completely closed she took a deep breath and her nipples tightened against the rubber cat suit her hips shifted in a small unconscious movement brushing against thomass thigh my brothers eyes flashed from light grey to cold hard silver for a second before he narrowed them and rose carefully disentangling himself from justine he turned to face the dance floor his shoulders tense i followed his example what is it trouble he said and looked over his shoulder at me familys come to visit chapter nine thomas stared hard at the floor below and then nodded once as if in recognition harry he said in a steady quiet voice stay out of this in recognition harry he said in a steady quiet voice stay out of this stay out of what i asked he turned to look at me his expression inhumanly remote its family business it wont involve you the house has given orders that wizards are not to be molested without clearance if you dont get involved i wont have to worry about you what i said thomas just let me handle it he said his voice hard i was going to answer him when the vampire entered the room it was one of those sensations you have trouble remembering afterwardlike the last moments of the dream you have just before waking you know that once youre outside the dream youre going to forgetand you cant believe you could lose something so significant so undeniably tangible i turned to look the second she enteredjust like everyone else in the room she wore white of course a white dress a simple shift made of some kind of glistening silken fabric which fell to the top of her thighs she was at least six feet tall more so in the partially transparent shoes she wore her skin was pale and perfect her hair dark and shining with highlights that changed color in the beat of the strobe lighting of the club her face was perfect beauty that remained unmarred by the obvious arrogance in her expression and her body could have been used on recruiting posters for wet dreams she descended to the dance floor and crossed to the stairways and catwalks with a predators easy motion each stride making her hips roll and shoulders sway somehow in time to the music and far more graceful than the efforts of the sweating dancers more sensual than the frantic lovers at the foot of the first stairway she came to a young man in leather pants and the scraps of a shirt that looked like it had been torn to pieces by ardent admirers without hesitation she pushed him up against the railing beside the stairway and pressed her body up against his she twined her arms slowly around his neck and kissed him a kiss and that was allbut apparently no one told the young man that from his reaction youd have thought that shed mounted him then and there her lips were sealed to his their tongues lashing one another for maybe a minute then she turned away with that same precise grace and began walking up the stairsslowly so that every shift and change of muscle in her perfectly formed legs danced in mesmerizing ripples beneath her soft white skin the young man simply melted onto the floor muscles twitching his eyes closed i didnt think he was actually aware that she had left the woman had every eye in the building and she knew it it wasnt an enormous event the way she took the attention of everyone there it wasnt a single large simultaneous significant motion when everyone turned to look there was no sudden silence no deepening stillness that would have been bad enough her influence was a lot scarier than that it was simply a fact like gravity that everyones attention should be directed to her every person there men and women alike glanced up or tracked her movement obliquely with their eyes or paused for half a beat in their conversations for most of them it was an entirely unconscious act they had no idea that their minds had already been ensnared and as i realized that i realized that mine was in danger too it was a real effort to close my eyes and remind myself of where i was i could feel the succubuss aura like the silken brush of cobwebs against my eyelashes something tingling and delicious and fluttering that swayed up my legs and through my groin on its way to my brain it was only a promise a whisper to the fleshbut it was a goodwhisper i had to make an effort to wall it away from my thoughts until suddenly reason reasserted itself and that fluttering haze froze and cracked and blew away under the chill wind of sensible fear when i opened my eyes the woman was stalking toward us along that last catwalk slithering nearer in her thin white dress as she mounted the last few stairs she paused there letting us look at her knowing what effect she was having even on guard against it i could feel the subtle sweetness of her presence calling out to me whispering that i should relax and let my eyes run over her for a while she turned her cornflower blue eyes to me for a moment and her mouth parted spreading slowly into a smile that shrunk my pants about three sizes in as many seconds cousin thomas she purred still noble and starving i see madeline thomas replied a small smile showing white perfect teeth still undisciplined and blatant i see madeline raiths mouth and eyes reacted in completely different ways to my half brothers remark her smile widened into a beautypageant expression wide and immobile but her eyes narrowed and went completely white the pale blue vanishing from her irises she looked from thomas to justine laras little pet mortal madeline said i wondered where you were running off to now i find you meeting with your old flame and her eyes slid to me the enemy dont be ridiculous justine replied though her voice was calm her cheeks were bright pink her eyes dilated i came to go over the books the way i do every week but this time you wore perfume madeline said and a rather provocative ensemble not that you dont do it justice darling i find ither tongue touched her upper lipinteresting madeline thomas said in a tone of exaggerated patience please go away i have every right to be here she murmured it didnt seem right that she should be able to keep her voice so maddeningly soft and sensual over the beat of the clubs music she turned to me and took a few steps my way with her full attention on me i suddenly felt like a teenagera little bit afraid a whole lot excited and filled with so many hormones demanding so many inexplicable things that i nearly lost the ability to focus my eyes she stopped just out of the reach of my hand dont mind my cousins horrible manners the infamous harry dresden hardly needs an introduction she looked me up and down and twined a finger through a tendril of dark hair how could i come to chicago so many times without meeting you but ive seen you i said my voice was a little rough but it worked oh she asked the sexy smile widening are you the sort who likes to watch harry you betcha i said and that time i was watching who framed roger rabbit her smile faltered a fraction you are jessica rabbit right i asked all slinky and overblown and obvious the smile vanished because i know ive seen you somewhere and gosh ill be embarrassed if it turns out that you were the evil princess from buck rogersinstead what she said buck what i gave her my best forced smile hey dont get me wrong you do that ensemble justice but youre trying too hard i leaned a little closer and fakewhispered lara does more for me just sitting in a chair than you did with your whole entrance madeline raith became as still and cold as a statue of a furious goddess and the air temperature around us dropped several degrees i suddenly sensed thomass presence beside me and found my brother had leaned back against the railing on his elbows his hands loose and relaxed he was standing just a tiny bit closer to madeline than i was madeline he said in the precise same tone hed used a moment before go away before i beat you to death with my bare hands madeline jerked her head back as if thomas had slapped her what you heard me he said calmly it isnt quite cricket as family squabbles go i know but im tired i dont give a fuck what you or anyone else in the house thinks of me and i dont respect you enough to play games with you even if i was in the mood how dare you madeline snarled how dare you threaten me lara will have the skin flayed from your body for this oh thomas gave her a wintry smile after what you projected at the wizard hed be well within his rights to burn you right down to your overpriced shoes i never and despite the orders handed down from the king thomas said shaking his head laras getting tired of cleaning up after you mad shed probably buy me a new set of steak knives if i found a way to make her life a bit less trying madeline laughed it reminded me of glass breaking and do you think she loves you any better cousin mine you refuse to appear with the house at meetings of the court and spend your time among the kine grooming them and bringing shame upon your family at least tell me you are planning to take the beasts to some sort of auction you arent capable of understanding why i do what i do thomas said who would want to she retorted youre as much a degenerate as any of those fools in skavis and malvora thomass mouth ticked at the corner but that was all the reaction he gave her go away madeline last warning two members of the oldest bloodlines in raith murdering each other madeline said sneering the white king could not tolerate such a divisive act and you know it she turned away from thomas and walked toward justine youre bluffing she said over her shoulder besides we havent heard from our little pink rose yet her voice sank to a throaty purr and justine quivered in place seemingly unable to move as madeline approached pretty justine madeline put a hand on justines shoulder and slid a single fingertip down the slope of one breast i dont generally enjoy does as much as some darling but even i find the thought of taking you delicious you ccant touch me justine stammered she was breathing faster not yet madeline said but theres not enough will left in your pretty little head to control yourself for long madeline stepped closer sliding her hand along justines waist some night perhaps ill come to you with some beautiful young buck and whisper pretty things to you until youre mad to be taken and after he has made use of you little doe ill take you in one big bite she licked her lips ill take you whole and make you scream how much you love it as it happen thomas broke a chair over madelines head it was particularly impressive given that all the chairs on the balcony were made of metal it happened fast during an eye blink one instant he was standing beside me tightening with anger and the next there were popped rivets zinging everywhere and madeline had been crushed to the floor of the balcony the air went cold thomas dropped the ruined chair madeline bounced up from the floor and threw a blow at thomass jaw he hunched and twisted a boxers defense and took it on the shoulder with a grunt of pain then he seized her ankle and slammed her in a half circle smashing a dent into the drywall madeline cried out and her limbs went loose thomas swung her in another arc that brought her crashing down onto the low coffee table between the couches she lay there and let out a single choked gasp her eyes unfocused without pausing my brother snatched both chopsticks from justines hair letting the whitesilver locks tumble down her back then in two sharp swift motions he slammed the chopsticks through madelines wrists and into the table beneath them pinning her like a butterfly to a card youre right of course he snarled lara couldnt ignore one member of the family murdering another it would make the king look weak his hand closed over madelines face and he pulled her head up toward his making her arms strain at a painful angle i was bluffing he shoved her back down against the table of course he said youre family families dont murder one another he looked up at justine and said they share she met his eyes a very small very hard smile graced justines features you wanted to taste her thomas said his fingers twining with justines rubberclad ones well madeline be my guest justine leaned over and kissed madeline raiths forehead her silken silver hair falling to veil them both the vampire screamed the sound was lost in the pounding rhythm and flashing lights justine lifted her head a few seconds later and swept her hair slowly down the length of madelines form the vampire writhed and screamed again while thomas held her pinned to the table wherever justines hair glided over exposed fleshed the skin sizzled and burned blackening in some places forming blisters and welts in others she left a trail of ruin down one of madelines legs and then rose together with thomas two bodies making one motion madeline raiths face was a ruin of burn marks and the imprint of justines soft mouth was a perfect black brand on pale flesh in the center of her forehead she lay on the table still pinned by the chopsticks and quivered in jerking little motions gasping and breathless with the pain thomas and justine walked hand in hand to the stairs leading down from our platform i followed them they passed beneath an airconditioning outlet and a few strands of justines hair blew against thomass naked arm and chest small bright lines of scarlet appeared thomas didnt flinch i walked over to them and passed justine a pair of pencils taken from my coat pocket she took them with a nod of thanks and quickly bound up her hair again i looked over my shoulder as she did madeline raith lay helpless and gaspingbut her white eyes burned with hate thomas took his tshirt from where hed stowed it on a belt loop and put it back on then he slid his arms around justine again and pulled her against his chest holding her close will you be all right he asked justine nodded her eyes closed ill call the house lara will send someone for her you leave her there and its going to make trouble i told him he shrugged i couldnt get away with killing her but our house has rather stern views on poaching something hard and hot entered his eyes justine is mine madeline had to be shown that she deserved it justine clung a little bit tighter to him he returned the gesture we all started down the stairs together and i was glad to be leaving zero still i said seeing her like that i feel like maybe somebody went too far i feel a little bit bad for her thomas arched an eyebrow and glanced back at me you do yeah i said i pursed my lips thoughtfully maybe i shouldnt have said that jessica rabbit thing chapter ten the hot summer night outside zero felt ten degrees cooler and a million times cleaner than what wed left behind us thomas turned sharply to the right and walked until hed found a spot of shadow between streetlights and leaned one shoulder against the wall of the building he bowed his head and stayed that way for a minute then two i waited i didnt need to ask my brother what was wrong the display of strength and power hed used on madeline had cost him energyenergy that other vampires gained by feeding on victims as madeline had done to that poor sap inside he wasnt upset by what had happened in zero he was hungry thomass struggle against his own hunger was complicated difficult and maybe impossible to sustain that never stopped him from trying though the rest of the raith family thought he was insane but i got it he walked back over to me a minute later his cool features distant and untouchable as antarctic mountains he fell into pace beside me as we began walking down the street toward the lot where hed parked his car ask you a question i said he nodded the white court only get burned when they try to feed on someone touched by true love right it isnt as simple as that thomas said quietly its got to do with how much control the hunger has over you when you touch i grunted but when they feed the hungers in control thomas nodded slowly so whyd madeline try to feed on justine she had to know it would hurt her same reason i do thomas said she cant help it its reflex i frowned i dont get it he was quiet long enough to make me think he wasnt going to say anything before he finally spoke justine and i were together for years and she means a lot to me when im near her i cant think about anything else but her and when i touch her everything in me wants to be nearer to her including your hunger i said quietly he nodded we agree on that point my demon and i so i cant touch justine without it being close to the surface i suppose you could call it and it gets burned i said he nodded madeline is the other end of the spectrum she thinks she should get to feed on anyone she wants anywhere anytime she doesnt see other people she just sees food her hunger controls her completely he smiled a bitter little smile so for her its reflex just like for me youre different for her its everyone i said not only justine he shrugged i dont care about everyone i care about justine youre different i said thomas turned to face me his expression rigid and cold shut up harry but his voice dropped to a low snarl shut up it was a little scary he stared hard at me for a while longer then shook his head and exhaled slowly ill get the car wait here sure i said he walked away on silent feet his hands in his pockets his head bowed every woman he passed and some of the men turned their heads to watch him go by he ignored them i got a lot of looks too but that was because i was standing on a sidewalk near a lot of chicagos night spots on a hot summer night wearing a long leather coat and carrying a quarterstaff carved with mystic runes thomass looks had all been subtitled yum my looks all said weirdo tough to believe i was coming out ahead on that one while i waited my instincts nagged me again a hairsonthebackofmyneck certainty that someone was focused on me my instincts had been on a streak so i paid attention to them quietly preparing my shield bracelet as i turned my head in a slow casual look up and down the street i didnt spot anybody but my vision sort of flickered as it passed over an alley across the street i focused on that point intently for a moment concentrating and was able to make out a vaguely human shape there then the flicker was abruptly replaced with the form of anastasia luccio who raised a hand and beckoned me yikes i jaywalked over to her timing my crossing in between the occasional passing car and we took several steps back into the alley evening stacy i said she turned to me and in a single motion drew a curved saber from a sheath at her hip and produced a gun in her other hand the tip of the blade menaced my face and i had to jerk my head back which put me off balance and i wound up with my shoulders pressed up against a wall anastasia arched an eyebrow her soft mouth set in a hard line i hope for your sake that you are the true harry dresden only using that abomination of a nickname to make sure that i was the true anastasiashe emphasized the word slightlyluccio well yes anastasia i said being careful not to move and by your reaction i can tell that it really is you she dropped the swords point and lowered the gun the tension faded from her body and she put her hardware away well of course its me who else would it be i shook my head ive had a bad shapeshifter night she arched an eyebrow anastasia luccio was the captain of the wardens of the white council she had a couple of centuries of experience ive had those she said and put a hand on my arm are you all right we stepped into each other and hugged i hadnt realized how stiffly id been holding myself until i exhaled and relaxed a little she felt slender and warm and strong in my arms so far im not dead i said i take it you used a tracking spell to run me downsince you dont seem to be worried about whether or not im me she lifted her face to mine and planted a soft kiss on my mouth honestly harry she said smiling who would pretend to be you someone who wanted to be kissed in dark alleys by seductive older women apparently her smile widened for a second and then faded i thought i was going to have to break down the door and come in after you what were you doing in that white court cesspit i didnt think id done anything to cause it but we stepped out of each others arms looking for information i said quietly somethings up and someones cut me out of the loop anastasia pressed her lips together and looked away her expression was closed touched with anger yes orders orders i said from the merlin i guess from ebenezar mccoy actually i grunted in surprise mccoy had been my mentor when i was young i respected him i get it i said he was afraid that if i heard morgan was on the run id hat up and dish out some payback she glanced up at me and then across the street at zero she shrugged without quite looking me in the face god knows you have enough cause to do so you agreed with him i said she looked up at me her eyes a little wider if i did then why am i standing here i frowned at her and scratched my head okay youve got me on that one besides she said i was worried about you worried she nodded morgans done something that is hiding him from even the senior councils abilities i was afraid that he might come here poker face dont fail me now thats crazy i said why would he do that she squared her shoulders and faced me steadily maybe because hes innocent and there are a number of people who have sought permission from the senior council to investigate and interrogate you under the presumption that you were the traitor who has been feeding information to the red court she looked away again morgan has been one of the most overt agitators i took a deep breath youre saying that morgan knows he isnt the traitor and he thinks its me and he might be moving toward you in an attempt to prove his own innocence or failing that kill me i said quietly if hes going to go down you think he might have decided to take out the real traitor before he gets the axe and suddenly i had to wonder if morgan had shown up at my door for the reasons hed given me anastasia had been morgans mentor when he was an apprentice shed known the man for the vast majority of his life literally for generations what if her judgment of him was better than mine sure morgan wasnt in any shape to kill me personallybut he wouldnt need to all he had to do is call the wardens and tell them where he was a lot of people in the council didnt like me much id go down with morgan for giving aid and comfort to a traitor i suddenly felt naive and vulnerable and maybe a little stupid he was already in custody i said how did he get away luccio smiled faintly we arent sure he thought of something we didnt and he put three wardens in the hospital when he left but you dont think hes guilty i she frowned for a moment and then said i refuse to let fear turn me against a man i know and trust but it doesnt matter what i think theres enough evidence to kill him what evidence i asked other than finding him standing over lafortiers corpse with a literal bloody knife in his hand yeah i said other than that she raked her fingers back through her curly hair the information the red court has attained was exclusive to a very small pool of suspects of which he was one we have telephone records of him in frequent contact with a known operative of the red court we also tracked down an offshore account belonging to him in which several million dollars had recently been deposited i snorted derisively yeah thats him morgan the mercenary nothing but dollar signs in his eyes i know she said thats what i mean about fear clouding peoples judgment we all know that the red court is going to come after us again we know that if we dont eliminate the traitor their first blow could be fatal the merlin is desperate join the club i muttered i rubbed at my eyes and sighed she touched my arm again i thought you had a right to know she said im sorry i wasnt able to get here sooner i covered her hand with mine and pressed gently yeah i said thanks you look awful you sweet talker you she lifted her hand to touch my face ive got a few hours before i need to be back on duty i was thinking a bottle of wine and a massage might be in order i only barely kept from groaning in pleasure at the very thought of one of anastasias massages what she didnt know about inflicting merciless pleasure on a mans aching body hadnt been invented but i sure as hell couldnt have her back over to the apartment if she found out about morgan and if he truly intended to betray me it would be frighteningly easy for her head to wind up on the floor next to morgans and mine i cant i told her ive got to go to the hospital she frowned what happened a skinwalker picked up my trail earlier tonight when i was at billy bordens place kirbys dead andis in the hospital she sucked in a breath wincing in empathy dio harry im so sorry i shrugged i watched my vision blur and realized that i wasnt only making an excuse to keep her away from my place kirby and i hadnt been blood brothers or anythingbut he was a friend a regular part of my life emphasis on the was is there anything i can do she asked i shook my head then i said actually yeah very well find out whatever you can about skinwalkers im going to kill this one all right she said meanwhile i said is there anything i can do for you for me she shook her head but morgan could use whatever help he can get yeah i said like im gonna help morgan she lifted her hands i know i know but theres not much i can do everyone knows he was my apprentice theyre watching me if i try to help him openly theyll suspend me as captain of the wardens at best dont you just love it when justice cant be bothered with petty concerns like fact harry she said what if hes innocent i shrugged the way i was all those years im too busy admiring the karma to lend a hand to the bastard out on the street thomass jag cruised by the end of the alley then pulled up to the curb and stopped i glanced at the car and said theres my ride anastasia arched an eyebrow at thomas and his car the vampire he owed me a favor mmmm anastasia said her look at thomas did not say yum she looked more like someone who was trying to judge by how much she would need to lead a moving target youre sure i nodded the white king told him to play nice he will until he doesnt she said walkers cant be choosers i said the beetle died again uhhuh why dont you get a different car she asked because the blue beetle is mycar anastasia smiled faintly up at me i wonder how you make something like that so endearing its my natural good looks i said i could make athletes foot endearing if i really had to she rolled her eyes but was still smiling ill head back to edinburgh and help coordinate the search if theres anything i can do i nodded thank you she put her hands on my cheeks im sorry about your friends when this is over well find some quiet spot and relax i turned my head to one side and kissed the pulse in her wrist then gently clasped her hands with mine look im not making any promises but if i see something that might help morgan ill let you know thank you she said quietly she stood up on her toes and kissed me goodbye then she turned and vanished into the shadows farther down the alley i waited until she was gone to turn around and join my brother in the white jag damn that girl is fit thomas drawled where to stop looking i said my place if morgan was going to give me the shaft i might as well find out now chapter eleven thomas stopped his jag in front of the boardinghouse where my apartment was and said ill have my cell phone on me try to call me before things start exploding maybe this time itll be different maybe ill work everything out through reason diplomacy dialogue and mutual cooperation thomas eyed me i tried to look wounded it could happen he reached into his jeans pocket pulled out a plain white business card with a phone number on it and passed it to me use this number its to a clone i looked at him blankly its a supersecret sneaky phone he clarified no one knows i have it and if someone traces your calls and goes looking for me theyll find someone else oh i said right you sure you dont want to just load morgan up and go i shook my head not until i give him the score he sees me coming in with a vampire in tow hes going to flip out as in try to kill us both i got out of the jag glanced at the house and shook my head you stay alive for a dozen decades doing what morgan does paranoia becomes reflex thomas grimaced yeah give me an hour or so to get what you need call me when youve got him ready to go i glanced at the number committed it to memory and pocketed the card thanks ill pay you back for the gear he rolled his eyes shut up harry i snorted out a breath and nodded my head in thanks we rapped knuckles and he pulled out onto the street and cruised out into the chicago night i took a slow look around the familiar shapes of dark buildings where only a few lights still burned id lived in this neighborhood for years youd think id be confident about spotting anything out of the ordinary fairly quickly but call me crazy there were just too many players moving in this game with god only knew what kinds of abilities to draw upon i didnt spot anyone out there getting set to kill me to get to morgan but that didnt mean that they werent there if thats not paranoid reflex i muttered i dont know what is i shivered and walked down the steps to my apartment i disarmed the wards and reminded myself again that i really needed to do something about the deep divots in the steel security door the last thing i needed was for old mrs spunkelcrief my neardeaf landlady to start asking me why my door looked like it had been shot a dozen times i mean i could always tell her because it has been but that isnt the sort of conversation one has with ones landlady if one wants to keep ones home i opened the bulletdented door went inside turned toward the bedroom door and was faced with a bizarre tableau morgan was off the bed sitting on the floor with his back to it his wounded leg stretched out in front of him he looked awful but his eyes were narrowed and glittered with suspicion sprawled in the bedroom doorway was my apprentice molly carpenter molly was a tall young woman with a bunch of really wellarranged curves and shoulderlength hair that was this month dyed a brilliant shade of sapphire she was wearing cutoff blue jeans and a white tank top and her blue eyes looked exasperated she was sprawling on the floor because mouse was more or less lying on top of her he wasnt letting his full weight rest on her because it probably would have smothered her but it seemed obvious that she was not able to move harry molly said she started to say something else but mouse leaned into her a little and suddenly all she could do was gasp for air dresden morgan growled at about the same time he shifted his weight as if to get up mouse turned his head to morgan and gave him a steady look his lips peeling back from his fangs morgan settled down hooboy i sighed and pushed the door shut leaving the room in complete darkness i locked the door put the wards back up and then muttered flickum bicus i waved my hand as i spoke and sent a minor effort of will out into the room and half a dozen candles flickered to life mouse turned to me and gave me what i could have sworn was a reproachful look then he got up off of molly padded into the alcove that served as my kitchen and deliberately yawned at me before flopping down on the floor to sleep the meaning was clear now its your problem ah i said glancing from mouse to my apprentice to my guest um what happened here exactly the warlock tried to sneak up on me while i slept morgan spat molly quickly stood up and scowled at morgan her hands clenched into fists oh thats ridiculous then explain what youre doing here this late at night morgan said what possible reason could you have to show up here now im making concentrationsupporting potions she said from between clenched teeth in a tone that suggested shed repeated herself about a hundred times already the jasmine has to go in at night tell him harry crap in all the excitement id forgotten that the grasshopper was scheduled to show up and pull an allnighter um i said what i meant to ask was how is it that mouse came to be sitting on you both the warlock summoned up her will and prepared to attack me morgan said frostily the dog intervened molly rolled her eyes and glared at him oh please you are such an asshole the air in the room seemed to tighten a little as power gathered around the young woman molly i said gently she glanced over at me scowling what i cleared my throat and gestured at her with one hand she blinked for a second then seemed to catch on she closed her eyes took a deep breath and exhaled it slowly as she did the ominous sense of stormy energy faded molly ducked her head a little her cheeks flushing sorry but it wasnt like that morgan snorted i ignored him go on i told molly talk he just i just got so angry molly said he made me so upset i couldnt help it she gestured to mouse and then he just just flattened me and he wouldnt let me up and he wouldnt let morgan move either seems to me that the dog had better sense than you i said i glanced up at morgan either of you youre supposed to stay still you wanna kill yourself it was a reaction to her approach morgan said calmly i survived it i shook my head and you i said to molly how many months have we spent working on your emotional control i know i know she said its never good to use magic in anger i know harry youd better know it i said quietly if its so easy to get a rise out of you that one bitter old washedup warden can blow your oring the first reactionary goomba to come along looking for an excuse to take you out is going to put you in a casket claim it was selfdefense and get away with it morgan bared his teeth in an expression only remotely resembling a smile youd know all about that dresden wouldnt you you son of a bitch molly snarled and whirled toward morgan seizing a candlestick and hefting it like a club the candle on it tumbled to the floor morgan sat perfectly still with that same gruesome smile on his face never flinching i lurched forward and grabbed mollys arm on her backswing an instant before she would have brought the heavy candlestick crashing down on morgans skull molly was strong for a woman and i had to make a pretty serious effort to hold her back my fingers digging into her wrist while i snagged her around the waist with my other arm and bodily hauled her away from morgan no i demanded dammit molly no i actually had to lift her feet off the ground to turn her away from the bedroom i tightened my grip on her wrist and said drop the candlestick molly now she let out a sound full of anger and laced with a little pain and the heavy candlestick dropped to the floor making a dull thud as it hit the rugcovered concrete the air around her was alive with power buzzing against my skin like a thousand tiny sparks of static electricity in a dry winter he cant talk to you like that molly snarled think i told her my voice hard but measured remember the lessons theyre just words molly look for the thought behind them he set you up for this reaction youre allowing him to make you embarrass me molly opened her mouth on an angry retort then forced her mouth closed and turned her face away from me she remained rigidly tense and after a fuming half minute she said her voice more calm im sorry dont be sorry i replied as gently as i could be disciplined you cant afford to let them rattle you not ever she took another deep breath exhaled and then i felt her begin to ease down relaxing her mental grasp on the power shed instinctively prepared okay she said okay harry i let her go slowly she began to rub at her right wrist with her other hand i winced a little on her behalf i thought id left bruises on her skin do me a favor i said take mouse and grab the mail im fine i dont need she began then she stopped herself shook her head and looked at mouse the big dog heaved himself up walked over to the basket next to the door grasped his leather lead in his jaws and dragged it out then he looked up at molly his head cocked to one side his tail wagging hopefully molly let out a rueful little laugh and knelt down to hug the big dog she clipped his lead onto his collar and the two of them left i turned and eyed the candle it had spilled hot wax onto a genuine navajo rug on the floor but it hadnt set anything on fire i bent down and picked up the candle then started trying to clean up the spilled wax as best i could why i asked in a hard voice its one way to take a measure of a man he said looking at his students you didnt look i said you needled her until she broke shes a selfproclaimed warlock dresden he replied guilty of one of the most hideous and selfdestructive crimes a wizard can commit is there some reason she shouldnt be tested what you did was cruel i said was it morgan asked there are others she is going to meet one day who will be even less gracious are you preparing her to deal with those people i glared at him his gaze never wavered you arent doing her any favors by going easy on her dresden he said more quietly you arent preparing her for exams she doesnt receive a bad mark if she fails i was quiet for a minute then i asked did you learn shields as an apprentice of course one of my earliest lessons how did your master teach you she threw stones at me he said i grunted without looking at him pain is an excellent motivator he said and it teaches one to control ones emotions at the same time he tilted his head why do you ask no reason i told him she could have broken your head open you know he gave me that same unsettling smile you wouldnt have let her molly came back into the apartment carrying a handful of mail including one of those stupid circuit city fliers that they just wont stop sending me she shut the door put the wards back up and took mouses lead off the big dog went over to the kitchen and flopped down molly put the mail on the coffee table gave morgan a level pensive look and then nodded at him so whats he doing here boss i stared at molly for a moment and then at morgan what do you think i asked him he shrugged a shoulder she already knows enough to implicate her besides dresdenif you go down with me theres no one left to take responsibility for her her sentence will not remain suspended i ground my teeth together molly had made a couple of bad choices a few years back and violated one of the laws of magic in doing so the white council takes a harsh view of such thingstheir reactions start with beheadings and become progressively less tolerant id staked my own life on the belief that molly wasnt rotten to the core and that i could rehabilitate her when i did it id known that i was risking my own wellbeing if molly backslid id bear the responsibility for it and get a death sentence about twenty seconds after she did i hadnt really considered that it would also work the other way around say for a minute that it was morgans intention to get caught and take me down with him it also meant that molly would take a fall hed get rid of both of the councils former warlocks with the same move two birds one stone well crap okay i sighed i guess youre in i am molly looked at me with widening eyes um in what i told her chapter twelve i dont like it morgan growled as i pushed the wheelchair over the gravel toward the street and the van thomas had rented gee theres a shock i said morgan was a lot to push around even with the help of the chair you upset with how i operate hes a vampire morgan said he cant be trusted i can hear you thomas said from the drivers seat of the van i know that vampire morgan said without raising his voice he eyed me again he owes me a favor i said from that coup attempt in the white court morgan glowered at me youre lying he said for all you know its true no it isnt he said flatly youre lying to me well yes he looked from me to the van you trust him to a degree i said idiot he said though he sounded like his heart wasnt in it even when a white court vampire is sincere you cant trust it sooner or later its demon takes control and then youre nothing but food its what they are i felt a little surge of anger and clubbed it down before it could make my mouth start moving you came to me remember you dont like how im helping you feel free to roll yourself right out of my life morgan gave me a disgusted look folded his armsand shut his mouth thomas turned on the hazard lights as the van idled on the street then he came around and opened up the side door he turned to morgan and picked up the wheelchair the wounded warden sat in with about as much effort as id use to move a sack of groceries from the cart into my cars trunk thomas put the wheelchair carefully into the van while morgan held the iv bag steady on its little metal pole clamped to the chairs arm i had to give morgan a grudging moment of admiration he was one tough son of a bitch obviously in agony obviously exhausted obviously operating in the shambles of his own shattered pride he was still stubborn enough to be paranoid and annoying if he wasnt aiming it all at me i probably would have admired him even more thomas slid the door shut on morgan rolled his eyes at me and got back into the drivers seat molly came hurrying up carrying a pair of backpacks holding one end of mouses leash i held out my hand and she tossed me the black nylon pack it was my trouble kit among other things it contained food water a medical kit survival blankets chemical light sticks duct tape two changes of clothing a multitool two hundred dollars in cash my passport and a couple of favorite paperbacks i always kept the trouble kit ready and available in case i need to move out in a hurry it had everything i would need to survive about ninety percent of the planets environments for at least a couple of days molly acting on her own initiative had begun putting her own trouble kit together the same day shed learned about mine except that her backpack was pink you sure about this i asked her pitching my voice low enough that morgan wouldnt hear she nodded he cant stay there alone you cant stay with him neither can thomas i grunted do i need to search your bag for candlesticks she gave me a chagrined shake of her head dont feel too bad kid i told her he had a couple of hours to work you up to that and hes the guy who nearly cut your head off during that mess around splattercon it wasnt that she said quietly its what he said to you what hes done to you i put my hand on her arm and squeezed gently she smiled faintly at me ive never never really felt hate before not like that your emotions got the better of you thats all but it isnt she insisted folding her arms against her stomach her shoulders hunching a little harry ive seen you all but kill yourself to help people who were in trouble but for morgan that doesnt matter youre just this thisthing that did something wrong once and youll never ever be anything else aha kid i said quietly maybe you should think about who you were really angry with back there what do you mean i shrugged i mean theres a reason you snapped when he started in on me maybe the fact that he was being morgan just happened to be coincidental she blinked her eyes several times but not fast enough to stop one tear you did a bad thing once i said it doesnt make you a monster two more tears fell what if it does she wiped at her cheeks with a brusque frustrated motion what if it does harry i nodded because if morgans right and im just a ticking timebomb and im trying to rehabilitate you you havent got a chance in hell i get it she pressed her lips together and it made her words sound stiff just before mouse knocked me down i wanted to to do things to morgan to his mind to make him act differently i was so angry and it felt right feeling something and acting on it are two different things she shook her head but who would want to do that harry what kind of monster would feel that i slung the pack over one shoulder so that i could put my hands on either side of her face and turn her eyes to mine her tears made them very blue the human kind molly you are a good person dont let anyone take that away from you not even yourself she didnt even try to stop the tears her lip quivered her eyes were wide and her cheeks were feverwarm under my fingers aare you sure yes she bowed her head and her shoulders shook i leaned down to rest my forehead against hers we stayed that way for a minute youre okay i told her quietly you arent a monster youre gonna be all right grasshopper a series of sharp rapping sounds interrupted us i looked over my shoulder and found morgan glowering at me he held up a pocket watchan honest to god gold pocket watchand jabbed a forefinger at it impatiently jerk molly mumbled sniffling big fat grumpy jerk yes but he has a point ticktock she swiped a hand at her nose and collected herself okay she said lets go the storage rental facility was located a couple of blocks from deerfield square in a fairly upscale suburban neighborhood north of chicago proper most of the buildings nearby were residential and it was tough to go more than a quarter of an hour without spotting a patrol car id picked it as the spot for my bolt hole for one reason shady characters would stand out against the uppermiddleclass background like mustard stains under a black light granted it would probably work even better if i wasnt oneof them i used my key at the security gate and thomas pulled the van around to my unit a storage unit the size of a twocar garage i unlocked the steel door and rolled it up while thomas got morgan out of the van molly followed and when i beckoned she wheeled morgan into the storage space mouse got down out of the van and followed us i rolled the door back down and called wizard light to the amulet i held up in my right hand until its bluewhite glow filled the unit the interior of the place was mostly empty there was a camp cot complete with sleeping bag and pillow placed more or less in the middle of the room along with a footlocker i had filled with food bottled water candles and supplies a second footlocker sat next to the first one and was filled with hardware and magical geara backup blasting rod and all manner of useful little items one could use to accomplish a surprisingly broad spectrum of thaumaturgic workings a camp toilet with a couple of jugs of cleaning liquid sat on the opposite side of the cot the floor the walls and the ceiling were covered in sigils runes and magical formulae they werent proper wards like the ones i had on my home but they worked on the same principles without a threshold to build them upon no single one of the formulae was particularly powerfulbut there werelots of them they began to gleam with a silvery glow in the light coming from my amulet wow molly said staring slowly around her what is this place harry bolt hole i set up last year in case i needed someplace quiet where i wouldnt get much company morgan was looking too though his face was pale and drawn with pain he swept his eyes around and said whats the mix concealment and avoidance mostly i replied plus a faraday cage morgan nodded glancing around it looks adequate whats that mean molly asked me a faraday what its what they call it when you shield equipment from electromagnetic pulses i told her you build a cage of conductive material around the thing you want to protect and if a pulse sweeps over it the energy is channeled into the earth like a lightning rod molly said pretty much i said only instead of electricity this is built to stop hostile magic once morgan corrected me primly i grunted without a threshold to work with theres only so much you can do the idea is to protect you from a surprise assault long enough for you to go out the back door and run molly glanced at the back of the storage unit and said theres no door there harry thats a wall its kind of the opposite of a door morgan nodded his head at the back corner of the space where a large rectangular area on the floor was clear of any runes or other markings there he said wheres it come out about three long steps from one of the marked trails the council has right of passage on in unseelie territory i said i nodded at a cardboard box sitting in the rectangle its cold there therere a couple of coats in the box a passage to the nevernever molly breathed i hadnt thought of that hopefully whoever was coming after me wouldnt either i said morgan eyed me one cant help noting he said that this place seems ideally suited to hiding and sheltering a fugitive from the wardens hunh i said now that you mention it yeah yeah it does seem kind of friendly to that sort of purpose i gave morgan an innocent look just an odd coincidence im sure since i happen to be one of those paranoid lunatics myself morgan glowered you came to me for a reason chuckles i said besides i wasnt thinking about the wardens nearly so much as i was i shook my head and shut my mouth as who harry molly asked i dont know who they are i said but theyve been involved in several things lately the darkhallow arctis tor the white court coup theyre way too handy with magic ive been calling them the black council there is no black council morgan snapped with the speed that could only have been born of reflex molly and i traded a look morgan let out an impatient breath any actions that may have been taken are the work of isolated renegades he said there is no organized conspiracy against the white council uhhuh i said gosh id have thought youd be right on board with the conspiracy thing the council is not divided he said his voice as hard and cold as i had ever heard it because the moment we turn upon one another were finished there is no black council dresden i lifted both eyebrows from my perspective the councils been turning on me for most of my life i said and im a member i have a robe and everything you morgan spat are he almost seemed to be choking on something before he blew out a breath and finished vastly irritating i beamed at him thats the merlins line isnt it i said there is no conspiracy against the council it is the position of the entire senior council morgan shot back okay smart guy i said explain what happened to you he glowered again only with more purple i nodded sagely then turned to molly this place should protect you from most tracking spells i said and the avoidance wards should keep anyone from wandering by or asking any questions morgan made a growling noise suggestions not compulsions i said rolling my eyes theyre in common usage and you know it what do i do if someone does come she asked veil and run i said she shook her head i dont know how to open a way to the nevernever harry you havent shown me yet i can show her morgan said both of us stopped and blinked at him he was very still for a second and then said i can do it if she watches maybe shell learn something he glared at me but doors open both ways dresden what if something comesin through it mouse went over to the open space and settled down about six inches away from it he sighed once shifted his weight a bit and went to sleep again though his ears twitched at every noise i went to the first footlocker and opened it took out a boxed fruit drink and passed it to him your blood sugars getting low its making you grumpy but if you do get an unexpected visitor from the other side i went to the second locker opened it and drew out a pumpaction shotgun its barrel cut to well below the minimum legal length i checked it and passed the weapon to molly its loaded with a mix of steel shot and rock salt between that and mouse it should discourage anything that comes through right molly said she checked the weapons chamber and then worked the pump chambering a shell she doublechecked the safety and then nodded at me you taught her guns morgan said but not how to open passages to the nevernever theres enough trouble right here in the real world i said morgan grunted true enough where are you going only one place i can go he nodded edinburgh i turned toward the door and opened it i looked from morgan with his juice box to molly with her shotgun you two play nice chapter thirteen wizards and technology dont get on so well and that makes travel sort of complicated some wizards seemed to be more of a bad influence on technology than others and if any of them were harder on machinery than me i hadnt met them yet id been on a jet a couple of times and had one bad experiencejust one after the planes computers and guidance system went bad and we had to make an emergency landing on a tiny commercial airfield i wasnt eager to repeat the experience buses were better especially if you sat toward the back but even they had problems i hadnt been on a bus trip longer than three or four hundred miles without winding up broken down next to the highway in the middle of nowhere cars could work out especially if they were fairly old modelsthe fewer electronics involved the better even those machines though tended to provide you with chronic problems id never owned a car that ran more than maybe nine days in tenand most of them were worse than that trains and ships were the ideal especially if you could keep yourself a good way from the engines most wizards when they traveled stuck with ships and trains either that or they cheatedlike i was about to do back at the beginning of the war with the vampire courts the white council with the help of a certain wizard private investigator from chicago who shall remain nameless negotiated the use of ways through the near reaches of the nevernever controlled by the unseelie court the nevernever the world of ghosts and spirits and fantastic beings of every description exists alongside our own mortal realitybut it isnt the same shape that meant that in places the mortal world touched upon the nevernever at two points that could be very close together while in the mortal realm they were very far apart in short use of the ways meant that anyone who could open a path between worlds could use a major shortcut in this case it meant i could make the trip from chicago illinois to edinburgh scotland in about half an hour the closest entry point to where i wanted to go in the nevernever was a dark alley behind a building that had once been used for meat packing a lot of things had died in that building not all of them cleanly and not all of them cows theres a dark sense of finality to the place a sort of ephemeral quality of dread that hangs so lightly on the air that the unobservant might not notice it at all in the middle of the alley a concrete staircase led down to a door that was held shut with both boards and chainstalk about overkill i walked down the steps to the bottom of the stairs closed my eyes for a moment and extended my otherworldly senses not toward the door but toward the section of concrete beside it i could feel the thinness of the world there where energy pulsed and hummed just beneath the seemingly rigid surface of reality it was a hot night in chicago but it wouldnt be on the ways i wore a longsleeved shirt and jeans and a couple of pairs of socks beneath my hiking shoes my heavy leather duster had me sweating i gathered up my will reached out my hand and with a whisper of aparturum i opened a way between worlds honestly it sounds quite a bit more dramatic than it looks the surface of the concrete wall rippled with a quick flickering of color and began to put out a soft glow i took a deep breath gripped my staff in both hands and stepped directly forward into the concrete my flesh passed through what should have been stone and i emerged in a dark wood that lay covered in frost and a thin layer of snow at least this time the ground in chicago had been more or less level with the ground in the nevernever last time id had a threeinch drop i hadnt expected and id fallen on my ass into the snow no harm done i suppose but this part of the nevernever was just chockfull of things you did notwant to think you were clumsy or vulnerable i took my bearings with a quick look around the woods were the same all three times id been through them a hillside sank down ahead of me and climbed steadily into the night behind me at the top of the small mountain i stood upon i was told was a narrow and bitterly cold pass that led into the interior of the unseelie mountains to mabs stronghold of arctis tor below me the land sank into foothills and then into plains where mabs authority ended and that of titania the summer queen began i stood at a crossroadswhich was only sensible since id arrived from chicago one of the great crossroads of the world one trail led upslope and down the other crossed it at almost perfect right angles and ran along the face of the hillside i took a left following the face of the hillside in a counterclockwise direction also known as widdershins in the parlance of the locals the trail ran between frozen trees their branches bowed beneath their burden of frost and snow i moved quickly but not quickly enough to slip and blow out an ankle or brain myself on a lowhanging branch the white council had mabs permission to move through the woods but they were by no means safe i found that out for myself about fifteen minutes into my walk when snow suddenly fell softly from the trees all around and silent black shapes descended to encircle me it happened quickly and in perfect silencemaybe a dozen spiders the size of ponies alit upon the frozen ground or clung to the trunks and branches of the surrounding trees they were smoothsurfaced sharpedged creatures like orbweavers longlimbed and graceful and deadlylooking they moved with an almost delicate precision their bodies of a color of grey and blue and white that blended flawlessly with the snowy night the spider who had come down onto the trail directly in front of me raised its two forelegs in warning and revealed fangs longer than my forearm dripping with milkywhite venom halt manthing said the creature that was actually scarier than the mere appearance of economysized arachnids between its fangs i could see a mouth movinga mouth that looked disturbingly human its multiple eyes gleamed like beads of obsidian its voice was a chirping buzzing thing halt he whose blood will warm us halt intruder upon the wood of the winter queen i stopped and looked around the circle of spiders none of them seemed to be particularly larger or smaller than the others if i had to fight my way clear there wasnt any obvious weak link to exploit greetings i said as i did i am no intruder honored hunters i am a wizard of the white council and i and my folk have the queens permission to tread these paths the air around me shivered with chitters and hisses and clicks manthings speak often with false tongues said the lead spider its forelimbs thrashing the air in agitation i held up my staff i guess they always have one of these too huh the spider hissed and venom bubbled from the tips of its fangs many a manthing bears such a long stick mortal careful legs i said im on speaking terms with queen mab herself i dont think you want to play it like this the spiders legs shifted in an undulating motion and the spider rippled two or three feet closer to me the other spiders all shifted too moving a bit nearer i didnt like that not even a little if one of them jumped theyd be all over meand there were just too many of the damn big things to defend myself against them effectively the spider laughed the sound hollow and mocking mortals do not speak to the queen and live to tell the tale it lies hissed the other spiders the phrase a low buzzing around me and its blood is warm i eyed all those enormous fangs and had an acutely uncomfortable flashback to morgan driving his straw through the top of that damn juice box the spider in front of me flowed a little to the left and a little to the right the graceful motion intended to distract me from the fact that it had gotten about a foot closer to me manthing how are we to know what you truly are in my professional opinion you rarely get handed a straight line that good i thrust the tip of my staff forward along with my gathered will focusing it into an area the size of my own clenched fist as i shouted forzare an invisible force hammered into the lead spider right in its disturbing mouth it lifted the huge beast off all eight of its feet drove it fifteen feet backward through the air and ended at the trunk of an enormous old oak the spider smacked into it like an enormous water bottle making a hideous splattering sound upon impact it bounced off the tree and landed on the frozen ground its legs all quivering and jerking spasmodically maybe three hundred pounds of snow shaken loose by the impact came plummeting down from the oak trees branches and half buried the body everything went still and silent i narrowed my eyes and swept my gaze around the circle of monstrous arachnids i said nothing the spider nearest its dead companion shifted its weight warily from leg to leg then in a much quieter voice it trilled let the wizard pass damn right let him pass i muttered under my breath then i strode forward as though i intended to smash anything else that got in my way the spiders scattered i kept walking without slowing breaking stride or looking back they didnt know how fast my heart was beating or how my legs were trembling with fear and as long as they didnt i would be just fine after a hundred yards or so i did look backonly to see the spiders gathered over the body of their dead companion they were wrapping it up in silk their fangs twitching and jerking hungrily i shuddered and my stomach twisted onto itself one thing you can count on when visiting the nevernever you dont ever get bored i turned off the forest path onto a foot trail at a tree whose trunk had been carved with a pentacle the trees turned into evergreens and crowded close to the trail things moved out of sight among the trees making small scuttling noises and i could barely hear highpitched whispers and sibilant voices coming from the forest around me creepy but par for the course the path led up to a clearing in the woods centered in the clearing was a mound of earth about a dozen yards across and almost as high thick with stones and vines massive slabs of rock formed the posts and lintel of a black doorway a lone figure in a grey cloak stood beside the doorway a lean and fitlooking young man with cheekbones sharp enough to slice bread and eyes of cobalt blue beneath the grey cloak he wore an expensive dark blue cashmere suit with a creamcolored shirt and a metallic coppercolored tie a black bowler topped off the ensemble and instead of a staff or a blasting rod he bore a silverheaded walking cane in his right hand he was also holding the cane at full extension pointed directly at me with narrowed serious eyes as i came down the trail i stopped and waved a hand easy there steed the young man lowered the cane and his face blossomed into a smile that made him look maybe ten years younger ah he said not too obvious a look one hopes its a classic i said how you doing chandler i am freezing off my welltailored ass chandler said cheerily in an elegant accent straight from oxford but i endure thanks to excellent breeding a background in preparatory academies and metric tons of british fortitude those intense blue eyes took a second look at me and though his expression never changed his voice gained a touch of concern how are you harry been a long night i said walking forward arent there supposed to be five of you watching the door five of me guarding the door are you mad the sheer power of the concentrated fashion sense would obliterate visitors on sight i burst out in a short laugh you must use your powers only for good precisely and i shall he tilted his head thoughtfully i cant remember the last time i saw you here i only visited once i said and that was a few years ago right after they drafted me chandler nodded soberly what brings you out of chicago i heard about morgan the young wardens expression darkened yes he said quietly its hard to believe youre here to help find him ive found murderers before i said i figure i can do it again i paused for whatever reason chandler was almost always to be found working near the senior council if anyone would know the scuttlebutt he would who do you think i should talk to about it wizard liberty is coordinating the search he replied wizard listenstowind is investigating the scene of the murder ancient mai is getting the word out to the rest of the council to convene an emergency session i nodded what about wizard mccoy standing by with a strike team when last i heard chandler replied hes one of the few who can reasonably expect to overpower morgan yeah i said morgans a pain in the ass all right i shivered and stamped my feet against the cold ive got some information theyre going to want where do i find them chandler considered ancient mai should be in the crystalline hall wizard liberty is in the offices wizard mccoy should be somewhere near the war room and wizard listenstowind and the merlin are in lafortiers chambers how about the gatekeeper i asked chandler shrugged gatekeeping i daresay the only wizard i see less frequently than he is you i nodded thanks chandler i faced him soberly and put a formal solemnity in my voice as i adhered to security protocols more than five centuries old i seek entry to the hidden halls o warden may i pass he eyed me for a moment and gave me a slow regal nod his eyes twinkling be welcome to the seat of the white council enter in peace and depart in peace i nodded to him and walked forward through the archway id come in peace sure but if the killer was around and caught onto what i was doing i wouldnt depart in peace just in pieces chapter fourteen the hidden halls of edinburgh were the redoubt and fortress of the white council of wizardry from time immemorial well actually that last bit isnt true its been our headquarters for a little under five hundred years the white council has existed since preroman times in one form or another and its headquarters has shifted from time to time and place to place alexandria carthage romewe were in the vatican in the early days of the church believe it or notconstantinople and madrid have all been home to the councils leadership at one time or anotherbut since the end of the middle ages theyve been located in the tunnels and catacombs hewn from the unyielding stone of scotland edinburgh s tunnel network is even more extensive than those beneath the city of chicago and infinitely more stable and sturdy the main headquarters of the complex is located deep beneath the auld rock itselfcastle edinburgh where kings and queens lords and ladies have defied besieged betrayed and slaughtered one another since prechristian times theres a reason a fortress has been there for as long as mankind can rememberit is one of the worlds largest convergences of ley lines ley lines are the natural currents of magical energy running through the world they are the most powerful means of employing magic known to manand the lines that intersect in the earth deep below the auld rock represent a staggering amount of raw power waiting to be tapped by someone skilled or foolish enough i walked over a ley line about three steps after i entered the hidden halls and i could feel its shuddering energy beneath my feet rushing by like an enormous silent subterranean river i walked a bit faster for a few paces irrationally nervous about being swept off of my feet by it until i could only sense it as a dim and receding vibration in the ground i didnt need to call up a light crystals set in the walls glowed in a rainbow of gentle colors bathing the whole place in soft ambient illumination the tunnel was ancient worn chilly and damp water always seemed ready to condense into a halffrozen dew the instant it was given the opportunity by an exhaled breath or a warm body the tunnel was about as wide as my spread arms and maybe eight feet high the walls were lined with basrelief carvings in the stone some of them were renditions of scenes of what id been told were the historical high points of the white council since i didnt recognize anyone in the images i didnt have much context for them so they mostly just looked like the crudely drawn cast of thousands you see on the bayeux tapestry the rest of the carvings were wardsseriously worldclass heavyweight wards i didnt know what they did but i could sense the deadly power behind them and i tread carefully as i passed deeper into the complex the entry tunnel from the nevernever was more than a quarter of a mile long sloping gently downward the whole way there were metal gates every couple of hundred yards each of them manned by a warden backed up by a pair of ancient mais templedog statues the things were three feet high at the shoulder and looked like escapees from a godzilla movie carved from stone the blocky figures sat inert and immobilebut i knew that they could come to dangerous life at an instants notice i tried to think about what it might be like to be facing a pair of aggressive templedog statues in the relatively narrow hallway i decided that id rather wrestle an oncoming subway locomotive at least then it would be over quickly i exchanged polite greetings with the wardens on guard until i passed the last checkpoint and entered the headquarters proper then i took a folded map from my duster pocket squinted at it and got my bearings the layout of the tunnels was complex and it would be easy to get lost where to begin if the gatekeeper had been around i would have sought him out first rashid had been my supporter and ally on more than one occasion god knew why i wasnt on what anyone would call good terms with the merlin i barely knew martha liberty or listenstowind i found ancient mai to be a very scary little person that left ebenezar i headed for the war room it took me the better part of half an hour to get there like i said the tunnel complex is enormousand after the way the war had reduced the ranks of the council it seemed lonelier and emptier than ever my footsteps echoed hollowly back from stone walls for minutes at a time unaccompanied by any other sound i felt intensely uncomfortable as i paced the hidden halls i think it was the smell that did it when id been a young man hauled before the council to be tried as a violator of the first law of magic they had brought me to edinburgh the musty wet mineral smell of the place had been almost all i knew while i had waited hooded and bound in a cell for a full day i remember being horribly cold and tortured by the knots my muscles worked themselves into after so many hours tied hand and foot i remember feeling more alone than ever in my life while i awaited whatever was going to happen i had been scared so scared i was sixteen it was the same smell and that scent had the power to animate the corpses of some of my darkest memories and bring them lurching back into the front of my thoughts psychological necromancy brains i moaned to myself drawing the word out if you cant stop the bad thoughts from coming to visit at least you can make fun of them while theyre hanging around in a stroke of improbable logic the war room was located between the central chambers of the senior council and the barracks rooms of the wardens which included a small kitchen the smell of baking bread cut through the musty dampness of the tunnel and i felt my steps quickening i passed the barracks which would doubtless be empty for the most part most of the wardens would be out hunting morgan as evidenced by the skeleton guard id seen at chandlers post i took the next left nodded to the very young warden on guard opened a door and passed into the war room of the white council it was a spacious vault about a hundred feet square but the heavy arches and pillars that supported the ceiling took away a lot of that room illuminating crystals glowed more brightly here to make reading easier bulletin boards on rolling frames took up spaces between pillars and were covered by maps and pins and tiny notes most of them had one or more chalkboards next to them which were covered in diagrams cryptic brief notation and cruder maps completely ordinary office furniture occupied the back half of the vault broken up into cubicles typewriters clacked and dinged men and women of the administrative staff wizards all moved back and forth through the room speaking quietly writing typing and filing a row of counters on the front wall of the room supported coffeepots warmed by propane flames and several wellworn couches and chairs rested nearby half a dozen veteran wardens lay sprawled on couches napping sat in chairs reading books or played chess with an old set upon a coffee table their staves and cloaks were all at hand ready to be taken up at an instants notice they were dangerous hard men and women the old guard survivors of the deadly days of the early vampire war i wouldnt have wanted to cross any of them sitting in a chair slightly apart from them staring at the flames crackling in a rough stone fireplace sat my old mentor ebenezar mccoy he held a cup of coffee in his thick workscarred fingers a lot of the more senior wizards in the council had a sense of propriety they took way too seriously always dressed to the nines always immaculate and proper ebenezar wore an old pair of denim overalls with a flannel shirt and leather work boots that could have been thirty or forty years old his silver hair what he had left of it was in disarray as if hed just woken from a restless sleep he was aging even by wizard standards but his shoulders were still wide and the muscles in his forearms were taut and visible beneath agespotted skin he stared at the fire through wirerimmed spectacles his dark eyes unfocused one foot slowly tapping the floor i leaned my staff against a handy wall got myself a cup of coffee and settled down in the chair beside ebenezars i sipped coffee let the warmth of the fire drive some of the wet chill out of my bones and waited they always have good coffee here ebenezar said a few moments later and they dont call it funny names i said its just coffee not frappalattegrandechino ebenezar snorted and sipped from his cup nice trip in got tripped up by someones thugs on the winter trail he grimaced aye weve had our people harassed several times the past few months how are you hoss uninformed sir i said he eyed me obliquely mmmm i did as i thought best boy i wont apologize for it dont expect you to i said he nodded what are you doing here what do you think he shook his head i wont take you on the strike team hoss you think i cant pull my weight he turned his eyes to me you have too much history with morgan this has got to be dispassionate and youre just about the least dispassionate person i know i grunted youre sure it was morgan who did lafortier his eyes returned to the fire i would never have expected it but too many things are in place no chance its a frame ebenezar blinked and shot me a look why do you ask because if the ass is finally getting his comeuppance i want to make sure its on the level i said he nodded a couple of times then he said i dont see how it could have been done it looks like a duck walks like a duck quacks like a duck odds are its a damn duck occams razor hoss someone could have gotten into his head i said at his age ebenezar asked aint likely i frowned what do you mean as a mind grows older it gets established he said more set in its ways like a willow tree supple when its young but gets more brittle as it ages once youve been around a century or so it generally aint possible to bend a mind without breaking it generally you cant push it that far ebenezar said push a loyal man into betraying everything he believes in youd drive him insane before you forced him into that which means that morgan made a choice if he did it i shook my head i just keep asking myself who profits most if we axe morgan ourselves ebenezar grimaced its ugly all the way around he said but there it is i reckon you gazed him hoss but it aint a lie detector you know that too i fell silent for a while and sipped coffee then i asked just curious who holds the sword when you catch him its usually morgan who does the head chopping captain luccio i reckon ebenezar said or someone she appoints but she aint the kind to foist something like that off on a subordinate i got treated to the mental image of anastasia decapitating her old apprentice then of me taking mollys head i shuddered that sucks ebenezar kept staring at the fire and his eyes seemed to sink into his head as if he had aged twenty years right in front of me aye the door to the war room opened and a slender reedy little wizard in a tan tweed suit entered lugging a large portfolio his short white hair was curled tightly against his head and his fingers were stained with ink there was a pencil tucked behind one ear and a fountain pen behind the other he stopped and peered around the room for a moment spotted ebenezar and bustled right on over pardon wizard mccoy he said if you have a moment i need you to sign off on a few papers ebenezar put his coffee on the floor and accepted a manila folder from the little guy along with the fountain pen what this time peabody first power of attorney for the office in jakarta to purchase the building for the new safe house wizard peabody said opening the folder and turning a page ebenezar scanned it then signed it peabody turned more pages very good then an approval on the revision of wages for wardensinitial there please thank you and the last one is approval for ensuring wizard lafortiers holdings are transferred to his heirs only three ebenezar asked the others are eyesonly sir ebenezar sighed ill drop by my office when im free to sign them sooner is better sir peabody said he blinked and seemed to notice me for the first time ah warden dresden what brings you here i thought id come see if someone wanted help taking morgan down i drawled peabody gulped i see has injun joe found anything ebenezar asked peabody s voice became laced with diffident disapproval as he answered wizard listenstowind is deep in preparations for investigative divination sir so no i said peabody sniffed not yet between him and the merlin im sure theyll turn up precisely how warden morgan managed to bypass senior council security he glanced at me and said in a perfectly polite tone they are both wizards of considerable experience and skill after all i glowered at peabody but i couldnt think of a good dig before he had accepted the papers and pen back from ebenezar peabody nodded to him and said thank you sir ebenezar nodded absently as he picked up his coffee cup and peabody bustled out again paperpushing twit i muttered under my breath invaluable paperpushing twit ebenezar corrected me what he does isnt dramatic but his organizational skills have been a critical asset since the outbreak of the war i snorted bureaucromancer ebenezar smiled faintly as he finished his cup the first couple of fingertips of his right hand stained with blue ink then he rose and stretched drawing several faint popping sounds from his joints cant fight a war without clerks hoss i stared down at my half cup of coffee sir i said quietly speaking hypothetically what if morgan is innocent he frowned down at me for a long moment i thought you wanted a piece of him ive got this weird tic where i dont want to watch wrongly accused men beheaded well naturally you do but hoss youve got to underst ebenezar froze abruptly and his eyes widened they went distant with thought for a moment and i could all but hear gears turning in his head his eyes snapped back to mine and he drew in a slow breath speaking in a murmur so thats it youre sure i nodded my head once hells bells the old man sighed youd best start asking your questions a lot more careful than that hoss he lowered his chin and looked at me over the rims of his spectacles two heads fall as fast as one you understand i nodded slowly yeah dont know what i can do for you he said ive got my foot nailed to the floor here until morgans located assuming its not a duck i said where do i start looking he pursed his lips for a moment then he nodded slowly and said injun joe chapter fifteen the senior council members as it turned out do not live like paupers after i passed through still more security checkpoints the stone hallway yielded to a hall the size of a ballroom that looked like something out of versailles a white marble floor with swirls of gold in it was matched in color to elegant white marble columns a waterfall fell from the far wall into a pool around which grew a plethora of plants from grass to roses to small trees forming a surprisingly complex little garden the faint sound of wind chimes drifted through the air and the golden light that poured down from crystals in the ceiling was indistinguishable from sunlight birds sang in the garden and i saw the quick darting black shape of a nightingale slalom between the pillars and settle in one of the trees a number of expensive comfortablelooking sets of furniture were spaced in and near the garden like the sets you sometimes see at the pricier hotels a small table against one wall was covered with an eclectic buffet of foods everything from cold cuts to what looked like the sautéed tentacles of an octopus and a wet bar stood next to it ready to protect the senior council members from the looming threat of dehydration a balcony ran around the entire chamber ten feet up and doors opened onto the senior council members private chambers i paced through the enormous grandiose space of the ostentatiatory to a set of stairs that swept grandly up one wall i looked around until i spotted which door had a pair of templedog statues standing guard along with a sleepylooking young man in a wardens cape and a walking cast i walked around the balcony and waved a hand at him i was just about to speak when both templedog constructs abruptly moved turning their heads toward me with a grating sound of stone sliding against stone i stopped in my tracks and held my hands up a little nice doggy the young warden peered at me and said something in a language i didnt recognize he looked like someone from eastern asia though i couldnt have guessed at his nation of origin he stared at me for a second and i recognized him abruptly as one of the young men on ancient mais personal staff the last time id seen him hed been frozen half to death trying to bear a message to queen mab now a broken ankle had presumably kept him from joining the search for morgan some people are just born lucky i guess good evening i said to him in latin the official tongue of the white council how are you lucky stared at me for another moment before he said we are in scotland it is morning sir right my half hour walk had taken me six time zones ahead i need to speak with wizard listenstowind he is occupied lucky told me he is not to be disturbed wizard mccoy sent me to speak to him i countered he felt it was important lucky narrowed his eyes until they were almost closed then he said wait here please do not move the temple dogs continued staring at me okay i knew they werent really staring they were just rock but for essentially mindless constructs they had an intense gaze that will not be a problem i told him he nodded and vanished through the door i waited for ten uncomfortable minutes before he returned touched each dog lightly on the head and nodded to me go in i took a wary step watching the constructs but they didnt react i nodded and went on by them trying not to look like a nervous cat as i passed from the ostentatiatory into lafortiers chambers the first room i came to was a study or an office or possibly a curio shop there was a massive desk carved out of some kind of unstained wood though use and age had darkened the front edge the handles of the drawers and the area immediately in front of the modern office chair a blotter lay precisely centered on the desk with a set of four matching pens laid in a neat row shelves groaned with books drums masks pelts old weaponry and dozens of other tokens that looked as though they came from exotic lands the wall spaces between the shelves were occupied by shields fronted with two crossed weaponsa norman kite shield with crossed broadswords a zulu buffalohide shield with crossed assegais a persian round shield with a long spike in its center with crossed scimitars and many others i knew museums that would declare mardi gras in the galleries if they could get their hands on a collection half that rich and varied a door at the far end of the study led into what was evidently a bedroom i could see a dresser and the foot of a covered bed approximately the size of a railroad car i could also see redblack droplets of blood on the walls come on harry dresden called a quiet weathered voice from the bedroom were at a stopping point and waiting on you i walked into the bedroom and found myself standing in a crime scene the stench hit me first lafortier had been dead for days and the second i crossed the threshold into the room the odor of decay and death flooded my nose and mouth he lay on the floor near the bed blood was sprinkled everywhere his throat gaped wideopen and he was covered in a blackbrown crust of dried blood there were defensive wounds on his hands miniature versions of the slash on his throat there might have been stab wounds on his torso under the mess but i couldnt be sure i closed my eyes for a second swallowed down my urge to throw up and looked around the rest of the room a perfect circle of gold paint had been inscribed on the floor around the body with white candles burning at five equidistant points incense burned at five more points halfway between the candles and take it from methe scent of sandalwood doesnt complement that of a rotting corpse it just makes it more unpleasant i stood staring down at lafortier he had been a bald man a little over average height and cadaverously skinny he didnt look skinny now the corpse had begun to bloat the front of his shirt was stretched tight against its buttons his back was arched and his hands had locked into claws his teeth were bared in a grimace he died hard said the weathered voice and injun joe listenstowind stepped out of a doorway that led to a bathroom drying his hands on a towel his long hair was greywhite with a few threads of black in it his leathery skin was the ruddy bronze of a native american complexion exposed to plenty of sunshine and his eyes were dark and glittering beneath white brows he wore faded blue jeans moccasin boots and an old aerosmith tshirt a fringed leather bag hung from a belt that ran slantwise across his body and a smaller similar bag hung from a thong around his neck hello harry dresden i bowed my head to him respectfully injun joe was generally regarded as the most skilled healer on the white council and maybe in the world he had earned doctoral degrees in medicine from twenty universities over the years and he went back to school every decade or two to help him stay current with modern practice went down fighting i agreed nodding to lafortier injun joe studied the body for a moment his eyes sad then he said id rather go in my sleep i think he glanced back at me what about you i want to be stepped on by an elephant while having sex with identical triplet cheerleaders i said he gave me a grin that briefly stripped a century or two of care and worry from his face ive known a lot of kids who wanted to live forever the smile faded as he looked back to the dead man maybe someday that will happen but maybe not dying is part of being alive there wasnt much i could say to that i was quiet for a minute what are you setting up here his death left a mark the old wizard replied were going to reassemble the psychic residue into an image i arched an eyebrow is that even possible normally no injun joe said but this room is surrounded on all sides by wards we know what theyre all supposed to look like that means we can extrapolate where the energy came from by what impact it had on the wards its also why we havent moved the body i thought about it for a minute what injun joe was describing was possible i decided but only barely it would be something like trying to assemble an image illuminated by a single flash of light by backtracking how the light in the flash had all bounced around the room the amount of focus concentration and the sheer mental process that would be involved in imagining the spell that could reassemble that image were staggering i thought this was open and shut already i said the evidence is conclusive injun joe said then why are you bothering with this this thing injun joe looked at me steadily and didnt say anything the merlin i said he doesnt think morgan did it whether he did it or not injun joe said morgan was the merlins right hand if he is tried and found guilty the merlins influence credibility and power will wane i shook my head gotta love politics dont be a child injun joe said quietly the current balance of power was largely established by the merlin if he is undone as the leader of the council it will cause chaos and instability across the supernatural world i thought about that for a minute then i asked you think hes going to try to fake something injun joe didnt react for a moment and then he shook his head slowly and firmly i wont let him why not because lafortiers death has changed everything why injun joe nodded toward the study lafortier was the member of the council with the most contacts outside of the western nations he said many many members of the council come from asia africa south americamost of them from small less powerful nations they feel that the white council ignores their needs their opinions lafortier was their ally the only member of the senior council who they felt treated them fairly i folded my arms and the merlins righthand man killed him whether morgan is guilty or not they think he did it possibly on the merlins orders injun joe said if he is found innocent and set free matters could turn ugly very ugly my stomach turned again civil war injun joe sighed and nodded fantastic where do you stand i asked him i would like to say that i stood with the truth he said but i cannot the council could survive the loss of morgan without falling to pieces even if it means a period of chaos while things settle out he shook his head a civil war would certainly destroy us so morgan did it and thats all there is to it i said quietly if the white council falls who will stand between humanity and those who would prey upon it he shook his head and his long braid gently bumped his back i respect morgan but i cannot permit that to happen he is one man balanced against mankind so its going to be morgan when youre finished i said no matter who it really is injun joe bowed his head i doubt that it will work even with the merlins expertise what if it does what if it shows you another killer you start picking who lives and who dies and to hell with the truth injun joe turned his dark eyes to me and his voice became quiet and harder than stone once i watched the tribe i was expected to guide and protect be destroyed harry dresden i did so because my principles held that it was wrong for the council or its members to involve itself in manipulating the politics of mortals i watched and restrained myself until it was too late for me to make a difference when i did that i chose who would live and who would die my people died for my principles he shook his head i will not make that mistake again i looked away from him and remained silent if you would excuse me he said and walked from the room hells bells i had been hoping to enlist injun joes aidbut i hadnt counted on the additional political factors i didnt think hed try to stop me if he knew what i was up to but he certainly wasnt going to help the more i dug the messier this thing kept getting if morgan was vindicated doom if he wasnt vindicated doom doom doom and doom damn i couldnt even be angry at injun joe i understood his position hell if it was me on the senior council and i was the one making the call i wasnt completely confident that i wouldnt react the same way my headache started coming on again how the hell was i supposed to do the right thing if there wasnt a right thing chapter sixteen i stared at lafortiers corpse for a moment longer shook my head and then pulled one of those disposable cameras you can get from a vending machine out of my duster pocket i walked around the room snapping pictures of the body the blood splatters and the broken bits of furniture i ran through the entire role of film making the most complete record of the scene that i could and then pocketed the camera again and turned to leave lafortiers chambers back in the ostentatiatory i heard voices drifting up from below i nodded pleasantly to lucky who gave me an inscrutable look and walked to the balcony railing listenstowind and the merlin were standing by the buffet table speaking quietly peabody hovered in the background carrying a different set of folders ledgers and pens i paused for a moment to listen its a trick i picked up somewhere along the linenot really magic per se as much as it is turning my mental focus completely to my sense of hearing to find out the truth the merlin was saying as he loaded up a plate with tiny sandwiches and wedges of cheese and fresh green grapes surely you have no objection to that i think the truth is already well established listenstowind replied quietly were just wasting time here we should be focusing on controlling the fallout the merlin was a tall man regal of bearing with a long white beard and long white hair to go with itevery inch the wizards wizard he wore a blue robe and a silver circlet about his brow and his staff was an elegant length of pure white wood completely free of any marking he paused in loading his plate and regarded injun joe with a level gaze ill take it under advisement injun joe listenstowind sighed and held up his hands palms forward in a conciliatory gesture were ready to begin let me get some food in me and ill be right in ahem peabody said diffidently actually wizard listenstowind if you could sign a few papers for me while the merlin eats it would be greatly appreciated there are two files on your desk that need your approval and i have three he paused and began to juggle the load in his arms until he could peer into a folder no four four others here with me injun joe sighed okay he said come on the two of them walked toward the stairs leading up to the balcony turned the opposite way i had when they reached the top and entered a chamber on the far side of the room i waited until they were gone to descend the staircase to the ground level the merlin had seated himself in the nearest group of chairs and was eating his sandwiches he froze for a second as he saw me and then smoothly resumed his meal funny i didnt like the merlin much more than i would a case of flaming gonorrhea but i had never seen him in this context before id always seen him at the head of a convened council and as this remote and unapproachable figure of unyielding authority and power id never even considered the notion that he might eat sandwiches i was about to go on past him but instead swerved and came to a stop standing over him he continued eating apparently unconcerned until hed finished the sandwich come to gloat have you dresden he asked no i said quietly im here to help you he dropped the bit of cheese hed been about to bite into it fell to the floor unnoticed as his eyes narrowed regarding me suspiciously excuse me i bared my teeth in a cold little smile i know its like having a cheese grater shoved against my gums just saying it he stared at me for a silent minute before taking in a slow breath settling back into the chair and regarding me with steady blue eyes why should i believe you would do any such thing because your balls are in a vise and im the only one who can pull them out i said he arched an elegant silver eyebrow okay i said that came out a little more homoerotic than i intended indeed said the merlin but morgan cant stay hidden forever and you know it theyll find him his trial will last about two seconds then he falls down and breaks his crown and your political career comes tumbling after the merlin seemed to consider that for a moment then he shrugged a shoulder i think its far more likely that you will work very very hard to make sure he dies i like to think i work smarter not harder i said if i want him dead all i need to do is stand around and applaud it isnt as though i can make his case any worse oh said the merlin im not so certain you have vast talents in that particular venue hes already being hunted half the council is howling for his blood from what i hear all the evidence is against himand anything i find out about him is going to be tainted against him by our antagonistic past i shrugged at this point i cant do any more damage so what have you got to lose a small smile touched the corners of his mouth lets assume for a moment that i agree what do you want from me a copy of his file i said everything youve found out about lafortiers death and how morgan pulled it off all of it and what do you intend to do with it the merlin asked i thought id use the information to find out who killed lafortier i said just like that i paused to think for a minute yeah pretty much the merlin took another bite of cheese and chewed it deliberately if my own investigations yield fruit he said i wont need your help the hell you wont i said everyone knows your interests are going to lie in protecting morgan anything you turn up to clear him is going to be viewed with suspicion whereas your antagonism with morgan is wellknown the merlin mused anything you find in his favor will be viewed as the next best thing to divine testimony he tilted his head and stared at me why would you do such a thing maybe i dont think he did it his eyebrows lifted in amusement that never quite became a smile and the fact that the man who died was one of those whose hand was set against you when you were yourself held in suspicion has nothing to do with it right i said rolling my eyes there you go theres my selfcentered petty vengeful motivation for wanting to help morgan out because it serves that dead bastard lafortier right the merlin considered me for another long moment and then shook his head there is a condition a condition i said before you will agree to let me help you get your ass out of the fire he gave me a bleak smile my ass is reasonably comfortable where it is this is hardly my first crisis warden and yet you havent told me to buzz off he lifted a finger a gesture reminiscent of a fencers salute touché i acknowledge that it is technically possible for you to prove useful gosh im glad i decided to be gracious and offer my aid in fact im feeling so gracious im even willing to listen to your condition he shook his head slowly it simply isnt sufficient to prove that morgan is innocent the traitor within our ranks is real he must be found someone must be held accountable for what happened to lafortierand not just for the sake of the councils membership our enemies must know that there are consequences to such actions i nodded so not only prove morgan innocent but find the guy who did it too maybe i can set the whole thing to music and do a little dance while im at it i feel obligated to point out that you approached me dresden he gave me his brittle smile again the situation must be dealt with cleanly and decisively if we are to avoid chaos he spread his hands if you cant present that sort of resolution to the problem then this conversation never happened his eyes hardened and i will expect your discretion youd hang your own man out to dry even though you know hes innocent his eyes glittered with a sudden cold fire and i had to work not to flinch i will do whatever is necessary bear that in mind as you help me a door opened upstairs and in a few seconds peabody began a precarious descent of the stairs balancing his ledgers and folders as he did samuel the merlin said his eyes never leaving me be so good as to provide warden dresden with a complete copy of the file on lafortiers murder peabody stopped before the merlin blinking ah yes of course sir right away he glanced at me if you would come this way warden dresden the merlin said in a pleasant tone if this is some sort of ruse you would be welladvised to be sure i never learn of it my patience with you wears thin the merlin was generally considered to be the most capable wizard on the planet the simple words with their implied threat were almost chilling almost im sure youll last long enough for me to help you out of this mess merlin i smiled at him and held up my hand palm up fingers spread as if holding an orange in them balls i said vise come on peabody peabody blinked at me as i swept past him on the way to the door his mouth opening and closing silently several times then he made a few vague sputtering sounds and hurried to catch up with me i glanced back at the merlin as i reached the door i could clearly see his cold flat blue eyes burning with fury while he sat in apparent relaxation and calm the fingers of his right hand twitched in a violent little spasm that did not seem to touch the rest of his body for an instant i had to wonder just how desperate he had to be to accept my help i had to wonder how smart it was to goad him like that and i had to wonder if that apparent calm and restrained exterior was simply a masterful control of his emotionsor if under the pressure it had become some kind of quiet deadly madness damn morgan for showing up at my door and damn me for being fool enough to open it chapter seventeen peabody went into an immaculate office lined with shelves bearing books arranged with flawless precision grouped by height and color many of the shelves were loaded with binders presumably full of files and documents similarly organized in a dazzling array of hues i files and documents similarly organized in a dazzling array of hues i guess it takes all kinds of colors to make a bureaucratic rainbow i started to follow him inside but he turned on me with a ferocious glare my office is a bastion of order warden dresden you have no place in it i looked down at him for a second if i was a sensitive guy that would hurt my feelings he gave me a severe look over his spectacles and said as if he thought the words were deadly venom and might kill me you are an untidy person i put my hand over my heart grinning at him ow the tips of his ears turned red he turned around stiffly and walked into the office he opened a drawer and started jerking binders out of it with more force than was strictly necessary i read your book by the way i said he looked up at me and then back down he slapped a binder open the one about the erlking i said the collected poems and essays he took a folder out of the binder his back stiff the warden from bremen said you got the german wrong on the title i continued that must have been kind of embarrassing huh i mean its been published for like a hundred years or something must eat at you german said peabody severely is also untidy he walked over to me with the folder a pad of paper an inkwell and a quill sign here i reached out for the quill with my right hand and seized the folder with my left sorry no autographs peabody nearly dropped the inkwell and scowled at me now see here warden dresden now now simon i said taking vengeance on behalf of the germanspeaking peoples of the world we wouldnt want to screw up anyones plausible deniability would we my given name is samuel he said stiffly you warden dresden may address me as wizard peabody i opened the file and skimmed over it it was modeled after modern police reports including testimony photographs and onsite reports from investigating wardens the militant arm of the white council at least seemed to be less behind the times than the rest of us dinosaurs that was largely anastasias doing is this the whole file sam he gritted his teeth it is i slapped it shut thanks that file is official property of the senior council peabody protested waving the paper and the ink i must insist that you sign for it at once stop i called stop thief i put a hand to my ear listened solemnly for a few seconds and shook my head never a warden around when you need one is there sam then i walked off and left the little wizard sputtering behind me i get vicious under pressure the trip back was quieter than the one in no bmovie escapees tried to frighten me to deaththough there were a few unidentifiable bits wrapped up in spider silk hanging from the trees where id established the pecking order apparently all that was left of the bug id smashed i came out of the nevernever and back into the alley behind the old meatpacking plant without encountering anything worse than spooky ambience back in chicago it was the darkest hour of night between three and four in the morning my head was killing me and between the psychic trauma the skinwalker had given me the power id had to expend during the previous day and a pair of winter wonderland hikes i was boneweary i walked another five blocks to the nearest hotel with a taxi stand flagged down a cab and returned to my apartment when i first got into the business i didnt think anything of sacrificing my sleeping time to the urgency of my cases i wasnt a kid in my twenties anymore though id learned to pace myself i wouldnt help anyone if i ran myself ragged and made a critical error because i was too tired to think straight mister my bobtailed grey tomcat came flying out of the darkened apartment as i opened the door he slammed his shoulder into my legs startled me half to death and nearly put me on my ass hes the next best thing to thirty pounds of cat and when he hits me with his shoulder block of greeting i know it i leaned down to grab him and prevent him from leaving and wearily let myself into the house it felt a lot quieter and emptier without mouse in it dont get me wrong me and mister were roommates for years before the pooch came along but it had taken considerable adjustments for both of us to get used to sharing our tiny place with a monstrous friendly dust mop and the sudden lack of his presence was noticeable and uncomfortable but mister idly sauntered over to mouses bowl ate a piece of kibble and then calmly turned the entire bowl over so that kibble rolled all over the floor of the kitchen alcove then he went to mouses usual spot on the floor and lay down sprawling luxuriously so maybe it was just me i sat down on the couch made a call left a message and then found myself lacking sufficient ambition to walk all the way into my bedroom strip the sheets morgan had bloodied and put fresh ones on before i slept so instead i just stretched out on the couch and closed my eyes sleep was instantaneous i didnt so much as stir until the front door opened and murphy came in holding the amulet that let her in past my wards it was morning and cheerful summer sunlight was shining through my well windows harry she said i got your message or at least thats what i think she said it took me a couple of tries to get my eyes open and sit up hang on i said hang on i shambled into the bathroom and sorted things out then splashed some cold water on my face and came back into the living room right i think i can sort of understand english now she gave me a lopsided smile you look like crap in the morning i always look like this before i put on my makeup i muttered why didnt you call my cell id have shown up right away needed sleep i said morning was good enough i figured murphy drew a paper bag from behind her back she put it down on the table i opened it coffee and donuts cop chicks are so hot i mumbled i pushed peabodys file across the table to her and started stuffing my face and guzzling murphy went through it frowning and a few minutes later asked whats this warden case file i said which you are not looking at the worm has turned she said bemusedly why am i not looking at it because its everything the council has about lafortiers death i said im hoping something in here will point me toward the real bad guy two heads are better than one got it she said she took a pen and a notepad from her hip pocket and set them down within easy reach what should i be looking for anything that stands out she held up a page heres something she said in a dry tone the vic was two hundred and seventynine years old when he died i sighed just look for inconsistencies ah she said wisely then we both fell quiet and started reading the documents in the file morgan had given it to me straight a few days before a warden on duty in edinburgh heard a commotion in lafortiers chambers she summoned backup and when they broke in they found morgan standing over lafortiers stillwarm corpse holding the murder weapon he professed confusion and claimed he did not know what had happened the weapon had been matched to lafortiers wounds and the blood had matched as well morgan was imprisoned and a rigorous investigation had turned up a hidden bank account that had just received a cash deposit of a hell of a lot of money once confronted with that fact morgan managed to escape badly wounding three wardens in the process can i ask you something murphy said sure one of the things that make folks leery of pulling the trigger on a wizard is his death curse right uhhuh i said if youre willing to kill yourself to do it you can lay out some serious harm on your killer she nodded is it an instantaneous kind of thing i pursed my lips not really then how long does it take minutes seconds about as long as it takes to pull a gun and plug somebody i said some would be quicker than others a second or three then yeah did morgan get blasted by lafortiers death curse then i lifted an eyebrow um its sort of hard to say it isnt always an immediate effect best guess i sipped at the last of the coffee lafortier was a member of the senior council you dont get there without some serious chops a violent death curse from someone like that could turn a city block to glass so if i had to guess id say no lafortier didnt throw it why not i frowned some more he had time enough murphy said there was obviously a struggle the vic has defensive wounds all over his armsand he bled to death that doesnt take long but its plenty of time to do the curse thing for that matter i mused why didnt either of them use magic this was a strictly physical struggle could their powers have canceled each other out technically i guess i said but that sort of thing needs serious synchronization it doesnt often happen by accident well thats something then she said both men either chose not to use magic or else were unable to use magic ditto the curse either lafortier chose not to use it or he was incapable of using it the question is why i nodded sound logic so how does that help us get closer to the killer she shrugged unfazed no clue thats how investigation works most of the time cops detectives and quixotic wizards hardly ever know which information is pertinent until weve actually got a pretty good handle on whats happening all you can do is accumulate whatever data you can and hope that it falls into a recognizable pattern good thought but it doesnt help yet i said what else have we got murphy shook her head nothing that i can see yet but do you want a suggestion sure she held up the page with the details on the incriminating bank account follow the money the money witnesses can be mistakenor bought theories and deductions can throw you completely off target she tossed the page back onto the coffee table but the money always tells you something assuming you can find it i picked up the page and scanned it again a foreign bank amsterdam can you get them to show you where the payment came from youre kidding murphy said it would take me days weeks maybe months to go through channels and get that kind of information from an american bank if i could get it at all from a foreign bank specializing in confidentiality ive got a better chance of winning a slamdunk contest against michael jordan i grunted i got the disposable camera out of my duster pocket and passed it over to murphy i snapped some shots of the scenea lot more of them than are in the wardens file id like to get your take on them she took the camera and nodded okay i can take them by a photo center and my old rotary telephone rang interrupting her i held up a hand to her and answered it harry thomas said his voice tight we need you here now i felt my body thrum into a state of tension whats happening hurry my brother snapped i cant take them on by m the line went dead oh god i looked up at murphy who took one look at my face and rose to her feet car keys in hand already moving toward the door trouble trouble where i rose seizing my staff and blasting rod storage rental park off deerfield square i know it murphy said lets go chapter eighteen the handy part about riding with a cop was that she has the cool toys to make it simpler to get places quickly even on a busy chicago morning the car was still bouncing from sweeping into the street from the little parking lot next to my apartment when she slapped a whirling blue light on the roof and started a siren that part was pretty neat the rest of the ride wasnt nearly as fun moving fast through a crowded city is a relative term and in chicago it meant a lot of rapid acceleration and sudden braking we went through half a dozen alleys hopped one bad intersection by driving up over the curb through a parking lot and swerved through traffic at such a rate that my freshly imbibed coffee and donuts started swirling and sloshing around in a distinctly unpleasant fashion kill the noise and light i said a couple of blocks from the storage park she did it asking why because whatever is there there are several of them and thomas didnt think he could handle them i drew my out of my duster pocket and checked it nothings on fire so lets hope that nothings gone down yet and well be all sneakylike until we know whats happening still with the revolvers murphy said shaking her head she drove past the street leading to the storage units and went one block past it instead before she turned and parked when are you going to get a serious gun look i said just because youve got twice as many bullets as me three times as many murphy said the sig holds twenty twenty look the point is that and it reloads a lot faster youve just got some loose rounds at the bottom of your pocket right no speed loader i stuck the gun back in my pocket and tried to make sure none of the bullets fell out as we got out of the car thats not the point murphy shook her head damn dresden i know the revolver is going to work i said starting toward the storage park ive seen automatics jam before new ones well no murphy had placed her own gun in the pocket of her light sports jacket its a good thing youve got options thats all im saying if a revolver was good enough for indiana jones i said its good enough for me he was a fictionalcharacter harry her mouth curved up in a small smile and he had a whip i eyed her her eyes sparkled do you have a whip dresden i eyed her even more murphy are you coming on to me she laughed her smile white and fierce as we rounded a corner and found the white rental van where thomas had left it across the street from the storage park two men in similar grey suits and grey fedoras were standing nonchalantly in the summermorning sunshine on the sidewalk next to the van on second glance they were wearing the exact same grey suit and the exact same grey hat in fact feds i asked murphy quietly as we turned down the sidewalk even feds shop at different stores she said im getting a weird vibe here harry i turned my head and checked out the storage park through the tenfoothigh black metal fencing that surrounded it i saw another pair of men in grey suits going down one row of storage units two more pairs were on the next and two more on the one after that that makes twelve murphy murmured to me she hadnt even turned her head murphy has cop powers of observation all in the same suit yeah theyre from out of town i said lot of times when beings from the nevernever want to blend in they pick a look and go with it i thought about it for a couple of steps the fact that they all picked the same look might mean they dont have much going for them in the way of individuality meaning id only have to go on a date with one of them to know about the rest murphy asked meaning that you need a sense of selfto have a sense of selfpreservation murphy exhaled slowly thats just great she moved a hand toward her other pocket where i knew she kept her cell more manpower might help might set them off too i said im just saying if the music starts dont get soft and shoot somebody in the leg or something youve seen too many movies harry she said if cops pull the trigger its because they intend to kill someone we leave the trick shots to swat snipers and indiana jones i looked at the booth beside the entrance to the storage park there was normally an attendant there during the day but there was no one in the boothor in sight on the street for that matter where is your unit murphy asked i waggled my eyebrows at her right where its always been dollface she made a noise that sounded like someone about to throw up first row past the middle i said down at the far end of the park we have to walk past those two jokers by the van to see it yeah i said but i dont think these suits have found it yet theyre still here and still looking if they had located morgan theyd be gone already as we approached i noticed that the two tires next to the curb on the white rental van were flat theyre worried about a getaway are you sure they arent human murphy asked um reasonably she shook her head not good enough are they from the spirit world or not might not be able to tell until we get closer i said might even need to touch one of them she took a slow deep breath as soon as youre certain she said tell me shake your head if youre sure they arent human nod if you cant tell or if they are we were less than twenty feet away from the van and there was no time to argue or ask questions okay i took a few more steps and ran smack into a curtain of nauseating energy so thick and heavy that it made my hair stand on enda dead giveaway of a hostile supernatural presence i twitched my head in a quick shake as the two men in grey suits spun around at precisely the same time at precisely the same speed to face me both of them opened their mouths before any sound could come out murphy produced her sidearm and shot them both in the head twice doubletapping the target like that is a professional killers policy theres a small chance that a bullet to the head might strike a target at an oblique angle and carom off of the skull it isnt a huge possibilitybut a double tap drops the odds from very unlikely to virtually impossible murphy was a cop and a competition shooter and less than five feet away from her targets she did the whole thing in one smooth move the shots coming as a single pulsing hammer of sound the men in grey suits didnt have time to so much as register her presence much less do anything to avoid their fate clear liquid exploded from the backs of their skulls and both men dropped to the sidewalk like rag dolls their bodies and outfits deforming like a snowman in the spring leaving behind nothing but ectoplasm the translucent gooey gel that was the matter of the nevernever hells bells i choked as my adrenaline spiked after the fact murphy kept the gun on the two until it was obvious that they werent going to take up a second career as headless horsemen then she looked up and down the street her cold blue eyes scanning for more threats as she popped the almostfull clip from the sig and slapped a fully loaded one back in she may look like somebodys favorite aunt but murph can play hardball a couple of seconds later what sounded like the howls of a gang of rabid band saws filled the air there were a lot more than twelve of them come on i shouted and sprinted forward the grey suits werent individualists it wasnt unthinkable that they would possess some kind of shared consciousness whacking the lookouts had obviously both alerted and enraged the others and i figured that they would respond the way any colonyconsciousness does when one of its members gets attacked the grey suits were coming to kill us we couldnt afford to run not when they were this close to morgan and molly but if the grey suits caught us on the open street we were hosed our only chance was to move forward fast to get into the storage park while they went screaming out of it looking for us if we were quick enough we might have time to get to the storage unit collect morgan and company and make a quick escape through the portal in the floor and into the nevernever i pounded across the street and through the entrance with murphy on my heels i threw myself forward as the howls grew louder and made it into the center row just as maybe twenty or twentyfive grey suits came rushing out of the other rows some of them saw us and slammed on the brakes throwing up gravel with their expensive shoes putting up a new tone of howl the others belatedly began to turn as well and then we were all the way into the center row of storage units still moving at a dead run the grey suits rushed after us but murphy and i had a good fortyyard lead and they didnt appear to be superhumanly light on their feet we were going to make it then i remembered that the door to the storage bay was locked shut i fumbled for the key as i ran trying to pull it out of the front pocket of my jeans so that it would be ready i figured that if i didnt get the door unlocked and open on the first try the grey suits would catch up to us and kill us both so naturally i dropped the damn key i cursed and slid to a stop slipping on the gravel i looked around wildly for the dropped key horribly aware of the mob of grey suits rushing toward us now in eerie silence harry murphy said i know she appeared beside me in a shooting stance aiming at the nearest grey suit harry i know metal gleamed amongst the gravel and i swooped down on it as murphy opened fire with precise measured shots sending the nearest grey suit into a tumbling sprawl the others just vaulted over him and kept coming id found the key but it was already too late neither of us was going to make it to the shelter of my hideaway chapter nineteen stay close i shouted i thrust the end of my staff into the gravel and dragged it through drawing a line in the dust and stones i swiftly inscribed a quick rough circle maybe four feet across around murphy and me actually getting between her gun and the grey suits for a second dammit harry get down she shouted i did so reaching out to touch the line in the gravel slamming a quick effort of will into the simple design murphys gun barked twice i felt the energy gather in the circle and coalesce in a rush snapping into place in a sudden and invisible wall the nearest of the grey suits staggered and then flung itself into a forward dive murphy flinched back and i grabbed her hard before she could cross the circle and disrupt it the grey suit slammed into the circle as if striking a solid wall rebounding from its surface in a flash of bluewhite light that described a phantom cylinder in the air an instant later more of the grey suits did exactly the same thing maybe twenty of them each of them bouncing off the circles field easy i said to murphy still holding her against me easy easy i felt her relax a little ceasing to struggle against being held in place its okay i said as long as we dont break the circle they cant get through we were both shaking murphy took a pair of gulping breaths we just stood there for a moment while the grey suits spread out around the circle reaching out with their hands to find its edges i had time to get a better look at them while they did they were all the same height and weight their features were unremarkable and similar if not quite identical they looked as if they could have all been from the same family their eyes were all the same color an odd greygreen and there was no expression none whatsoever on their faces one of them reached out as if to try to touch me and his open hand flattened against the circles field as it did a freaking mouth opened on his palm parallel to his fingers it was lined with serrated sharklike teeth and a slithering coiling purpleblack tongue emerged to lash randomly against the circle as if seeking a way through yellowish mucus dripped thickly from the tongue as it did okay murphy said in a small toneless voice that is somewhat disturbing and its gonna get better i muttered sure enough the other grey suits started doing the same thing within seconds we were completely surrounded by eerie handmouths writhing tongues and dripping slime murphy shook her head and sighed eckgh tell me about it how long will this thing keep them off theyre spirit beings i said as long as the circles here theyre staying outside it couldnt they just scuff dirt on it or something i shook my head breaking the circle isnt just a physical process its an act of choice of willand these things dont have that murphy frowned then why are they doing anything at all i had to restrain myself from smacking my forehead with the heel of my hand because someone summoned them from the nevernever i said their summoner wherever he is is giving them orders could he break the circle murphy asked yeah i said easily which is an excellent note upon which to begin our conversation said a mans voice with a heavy cockney accent make a hole lads the suits on one side of the circle lowered their hands and stood back revealing a blocky bulldog of a man in a cheap maroon suit he was average height but heavy and solid with muscle and he wore a few too many extra beers around his middle his features were blunt and rounded like waterworn stone his hair was graying and cut into the shortest buzz you could get without going bald and his eyes were small and hardand the exact same color as those of the grey suits a distinctive greygreen ah love said the man grinning i think its quite fine to see couples who arent afraid to express their affection for each other i blinked at him then down at murphy and realized i was still holding her loosely against me by the expression on her face murph hadnt really taken note of the fact either she cleared her throat and took a small step back from me being careful not to step on the circle in the gravel he nodded at us still grinning allo dresden why not make this easy for all of us and tell me which unit donald morgan is hiding in i suddenly realized that i recognized this jerk from the profile the wardens had on him binder i said thats what they call you isnt it binders smile widened and he bowed slightly at the waist the same murphy frowned at binder and said who is this asshole one of the guys the wardens wish they could just erase i said hes a wizard i do have some skills in that direction love binder said hes a onetrick hack i said looking directly at him got a talent for calling up things from the nevernever and binding them to his will so binder murphy said nodding yeah hes scum who sells his talent to the highest bidder but hes careful not to break any of the laws of magic so the wardens havent ever been able to take him down i know binder said cheerfully and thats why i am positively savoring the exquisite irony of me being the one to take down the famous warden donald morgan the selfrighteous prig you havent got him yet i said matter of time my lad binder said winking he stooped and picked up a single piece of gravel he bounced it thoughtfully on his palm and eyed us see theres a bit of competition for this contract and its a fair bit of quid so im willing to give you a chance to make my job easier in exchange for considerations what considerations i asked he held up the pebble between his thumb and forefinger i wont pitch this into your circle and break it that way my lads wont need to kill you bothand wont that be nice behind binder down at the end of the row of storage units the dust stirred something unseen moved across the gravel given how my life had been going odds were good that it couldnt be a good thing unless come on binder i said dont be a simp what makes you think i wont ask the lady here to put a bullet through that empty spot in your head where your brains supposed to go she does that she lowers the circle and my lads tear you apart binder replied that wont be your problem by then i said binder grinned at me all of us go down in a blaze of gory is it murphy calmly raised her gun and settled it on binders face binder faced her his grin never fading now little lady dont you be doing nothing youll regret without my ah personal guidance my lads here will tear this good gentlemans throat out right quick but theyre considerably less ah professional with ladies his grin faded and you miss do not want to know what theyre like when theyre not professional fingers and slimy tongues and fangs continued pressing against the outer edge of the circles protective field murphy didnt let it show on her face but i saw her shudder decision time miss binder said either pull that trigger right now and live with what happensor put it down like a proper lady and work through this politely murphys eyes narrowed at his comments for all i know youre about to toss that rock at us i think ill keep the gun right where it is bear something else in mind binder i said i know that you think you can just have your pets step in front of you and throw the rock from behind a wall of them but think about what happens to you if you kill me your death curse is it he asked binder raised his hands and flattened his palms against his cheek in mock horror oh no a death curse whatever shall i do i faced him with a chilly little smile youll spend the rest of your life unable to use magic i think i said in a quiet hopefully confidentsounding voice when i die i take away your power forever no more summoning no more binding binders expression began to flatten out into neutrality you ever had a job that you liked binder i asked him im betting you havent ive read your file youre the kind who likes to sleep late spend a lot of money impressing people always buys room service always with the champagne and you like the women the money gets you i shook my head how many bottles of champagne you think youll be able to afford when a paper hat becomes part of your professional wear youve got enough talent to live a nice long life man as a nobody he stared at me in silence for a second you cant do that binder said take away my talent that isnt possible im a wizard of the white council binder not some stupid hack who spent his life using his gift to hurt people do you think we go around advertising everything we can do if you knew half the things ive done that you think are impossible youd already be running binder faced me beads of sweat suddenly standing out on his jowls so id think real careful before i threw that rock binder real careful a police siren sounded from fairly nearby i smiled showing teeth hey cops thisll get interesting you he asked incredulously youd bring the cops into a private matter i pointed a finger sideways at murphy who produced her badge and tucked the back of its folder into her belt so that the shield faced binder already did murphy said besides the whole reason i picked this joint was how heavily the neighborhood was policed i said one gunshot and nobody reports anything half a dozen and people get nervous binders eyes narrowed and he looked from us toward the front of the park ticktock i said applying the pressure as hard as i could its just a matter of time my lad binder looked around him again then shook his head and sighed balls its always messy when i have to deal with the cops idiots dying by the truckload buckets of blood he gestured at his men identical suspects fleeing in all directions everyone out chasing them and more people dying when they manage to catch them he stared hard at me how about it wizard cop maybe youve got stones enough to take it when i threaten you i can admire that my stomach got a little sinking feeling i had been counting out seconds hoping that my nerves didnt make me rush there should have been enough time by now how about those policemen you willing to have their deaths on your conscience he rolled his neck a little like a prizefighter warming up because ill tell you right now that they arent going to stop me i put my hand out and touched murphys wrist she glanced aside at me and then lowered the gun thats better binder said there was no hint of jocularity in his manner now all i want is the warden hes a dead man already and you know it what does it matter who takes him something stirred at the end of the row behind binder and i started smiling ive got no quarrel with you or with this town binder continued tell me where he is ill leave peaceful and bobs your uncle murphy drew in a sharp breath okay i said hes right behind you binders smile this time was positively vulpine dresden we have a bit of banter going between us were both here in a moment where neither of us wants to act rashly and thats all good fun its one of the little things that makes a day more enjoyable his voice hardened but dont do me the incredibly insulting disservice of assuming that im a bloody moron im not i told him hes about forty feet behind you in a wheelchair binder gave me a gimlet stare then he rolled his eyes and shot a brief glance over his shoulderthen did a double take as his mouth dropped open morgan sat in his wheelchair about forty feet away from binder my shotgun in his hands mouse stood beside the chair focused intently upon binder and his minions his body tensed and ready to spring forward hello binder morgan said in a flat merciless tone of voice now miss carpenter molly appeared out of literally nowhere as she dropped the veil shed been holding over herself since id first seen her moving at the beginning of the conversation with binder she was holding my spare blasting rod in her hand its far end covered with pale dust from being dragged through the gravel she knelt beside the long lazy arc of the circle shed drawn in the dust and touched her hand to it frowning in concentration circles of power are basic stuff really practically anyone can make one if they know how to do it and learning how to properly establish a circle is the first thing any apprentice is taught circles create boundaries that isolate the area inside from the magical energies of the world outside thats why binders minions couldnt cross the plane of the circle id drawn on the groundtheir bodies were made up of ectoplasm held into a solid form by magical energy the circle cut off that energy when they tried to cross it as it sprang to life at my apprentices will mollys circle did the same thing as mineonly this time the grey suits were inside it as the energy field rose up it cut off the grey suits from the flow of energy they needed to maintain their solid forms and suddenly the next best thing to forty demonic thugs collapsed into splatters of transparent gook binder let out a cry as it happened spinning around desperately mumbling some kind of incantation under his breathbut he should have saved himself the effort if he wanted them back he would have to get out of the isolating field of the enormous circle first and then he would have to start from scratch ow binder i said in patently false empathy didnt see that one coming did ya ernest armand tinwhistle morgan thundered in a tone of absolute authority raising the shotgun to his shoulder surrender yourself or face destruction you worthless little weasel binders intense greygreen eyes went from morgan to the two of us then he seemed to reach some kind of conclusion and charged us like a bull his head down his arms pumping murphys gun tracked to him but with a curse she jerked the barrel up and away from binder he slammed a shoulder into her chest knocking her down even as i received a stiff arm in the belly i threw a leg at his as he went by but i was off balance from the shove and although i wound up on my ass i forced him to stumble for a step or three murphy took the impact with fluid grace tumbled onto her back rolled smoothly over one shoulder and came back up on her feet get them out of here she snarled as she spun and took off at a sprint after binder mouse came pounding up to my side staring after murphy with worried doggy eyes then glancing at me no i told him watch this binder was running as hard as he could but i doubted he had been all that light on his feet when he was young much less twenty years and forty pounds later murphy worked out practically every day she caught him about ten feet before the end of the row timed her steps for a second and then sharply kicked his rearmost leg just as he lifted it to take his next step his foot got caught on the back of his own calf as a result and he went down in a sprawl binder came to his feet with an explosive snarl of rage and whirled on murphy he flung a handful of gravel at her face and then waded in with heavy looping punches murph ducked her head down and kept the gravel out of her eyes slipped aside from one punch and then seized his wrist on the second the two of them whirled in a brief half circle binder let out a yelp and then his bald head slammed into the steel door of a storage unit i had to give the guy credit for physical toughness he rebounded from the door a little woozily but drove an elbow back at murphys head murphy caught that arm and continued the motion using her own body as a fulcrum in a classic hip throwexcept that binder was facing in the opposite direction than usual for that technique you could hear his arm come out of its socket fifty feet away and then he hit the gravel facefirst binder got extra points for brains in my book after that he lay still and didnt put up a struggle as murphy dragged his wrists behind his back and cuffed him i traded a glance with mouse and said wisely hardcore the police sirens were getting louder murphy looked up at them and then down the row at me she made an exasperated shooing motion come on i said to mouse the two of us hurried down the row to morgans chair i couldnt shoot him with this scatter pipe with the two of you standing there morgan complained as i approached why didnt you do it thats why i said nodding to the park entrance where a patrol car was screeching to a halt its blue bubbles flashing they get all funny about corpses with gunshot wounds in them i turned to scowl at molly i told you to bug out at the first sign of danger she took the handles of morgans wheelchair and we all started back toward the storage unit and its portal we didnt know what was going on until we heard them all start shrieking she protested and then mouse went nuts and started trying to dig his way through a metal door i thought you might be in trouble and you were that isnt the point i said i glanced at the circle drawn in the gravel as we crossed it breaking it and releasing its power whose idea was the circle mine morgan said calmly circle traps are a standard tactic for dealing with rogue summoners im sorry it took so long to draw molly said but i had to make it big enough to get them all not a problem he was happy to kill time running his mouth we all entered the storage bay and i rolled the door closed behind us you did good grasshopper molly beamed i looked around us and said hey wheres thomas the vampire morgan asked i had him watching the outside of the park just in case i said morgan gave me a disgusted look and rolled himself forward toward the prepared portal into the nevernever the vampire goes missing just before a bounty hunter who couldnt possibly know my location turns up and youre actually surprised dresden thomas called me and told me there was trouble i said my voice tight if he hadnt youd have been drowning in grey suits by now molly chewed her lip worriedly and shook her head harry i havent seen him since he dropped us off i glanced back toward the entrance of the park clenching my teeth where was he if hed been able to do otherwise thomas would never have let murphy and me fight alone against binders minions he would have been right in there beside us except he hadnt been why not had circumstances forced him to leave before i arrived or worse had someone else involved in the current crisis decided to take measures against him psycho bitch madeline came uncomfortably to mind and the skinwalker had already demonstrated that it was happy to murder my allies instead of striking directly at me or maybe hed simply been overwhelmed by a crowd of greysuited demons maybe his body was already cooling in some nook or cranny of the storage park my mouth went dry at the thought hells bells what had happened to my brother morgan spoke a quiet word and opened a shimmering rectangular portal in the floor molly walked over to it and stared down impressed dresden morgan said we cant afford to become entangled with the local authorities i wanted to scream at him but he was right more sirens had closed in on the park we had to leave i grabbed the handles to morgans chair started for the portal and said lets go people dammit thomas i snarled to myself where the hell are you chapter twenty the portal in my hideaway opened three steps from the trail in the nevernever all right but those three steps werent handicappedaccessible molly and i each had to get under one of morgans arms and half carry him to the trail i left molly and mouse with him went back half carry him to the trail i left molly and mouse with him went back and got the wheelchair and dragged it up the frozen slope to a path that was all but identical to the one id been on earlier we loaded morgan into the wheelchair again he was pale and shaking by the time we were finished i laid a hand against his forehead it was hot with fever morgan jerked his head away from my fingers scowling what is it molly asked she had thought to grab both coats id had waiting and had already put one of them on hes burning up i said quietly butters said that could mean the wound had been infected im fine morgan said shivering molly helped him into the second coat looking around at the frozen haunted wood with nervous eyes shouldnt we get him out of the cold then yeah i said buttoning my duster shut its maybe ten minutes from here to the downtown portal does the vampire know about that too morgan growled whats that supposed to mean that youd be walking into an obvious trap dresden all right thats it i snapped one more comment about thomas and youre going body sledding thomas morgans pale face turned a little darker as he raised his voice how many corpses is it going to take to make you come to your senses dresden molly swallowed harry um excuse me both of us glared at her she flushed and avoided eye contact isnt this the nevernever yeah i said obviously morgan said at the same time we faced each other again all but snarling okay molly said havent you told me that its sort of dangerous she took a deep breath and hurried her speech i mean you know isnt it sort of dumb to be standing here arguing in loud voices all things considered i suddenly felt somewhat foolish morgans glower waned he bowed his head wearily folding his arms across his belly yeah i said reining in my own temper yeah probably so not least because anyone who comes through the ways from edinburgh to chicago is going to walk right over us morgan added molly nodded which would be sort of awkward i snorted quietly i nodded my head in the proper direction and started pushing the wheelchair down the trail this way molly followed her eyes darting left and right at the sounds of movement in the faerie wood around us mouse fell into pace beside her and she reached down to lay a hand on the dogs back as she walked an entirely unconscious gesture we moved at a steady pace and in almost complete silence for maybe five minutes before i said we need to know how they found out about you the vampire is the best explanation morgan replied his tone carefully neutral i have information about him that you dont i said suppose it isnt him how did they do it morgan pondered that for a time not with magic you certain yes he sounded like it your countermeasures arethat good i asked yes i thought about that for a minute then it dawned on me what morgan had done to protect himself from supernatural discovery you called in your marker the silver oak leaf the one titan i forced myself to stop glancing uneasily around the faerie forest the one the summer queen awarded you morgan turned his head slightly to glance at me over his shoulder i whistled id seen queen titania with my sight once the tableau of titania and her counterpart mab preparing to do battle with each other still ranked as the most humbling and aweinspiring display of pure power i had ever witnessed thats why youre so certain no one is going to find you shes the one shielding you i admit morgan said with another withering look its no donut i scowled howd you know about that titanias retainer told me the entire summer court has been laughing about it for months molly made a choking sound behind me i didnt turn around it would just force her to put her hand over her mouth to hide the smile how long did she give you i asked sundown tomorrow thirtysix hours give or take a few hours more than id believed i had but not much do you have the oak leaf on you of course he said may i see it morgan shrugged and drew a leather cord from around his neck a small leather pouch hung from the cord he opened it felt around inside and came out with ita small exquisitely detailed replica of an oak leaf backed with a simple pin he held it out to me i took it and pitched it into the haunted wood morgan actually did growl this time why because the summer queen bugged them last year her goon squad was using mine to track me down all over chicago morgan frowned at me and glanced out toward where i had thrown it then he shook his head and rubbed tiredly at his eyes with one hand must be getting senile never even considered it i dont get it molly said isnt he still protected anyway he is i said but that leaf isnt so if the summer queen wants him found or if someone realizes what shes doing and makes her a deal she can keep her word to morgan to hide him and give him away all she has to do is make sure someone knows to look for the spell on the oak leaf the sidhe are only bound to the letter of their agreements morgan said nodding which is why one avoids striking bargains with them unless there are no options so binder could have been following the oak leaf molly asked i shrugged maybe it is still entirely possible that the summer queen is dealing in good faith morgan said i nodded which brings us back to the original question how did binder find you well molly said not to mince words but he didnt he would have found us in a matter of moments morgan said thats not what i mean she said he knew you were in the storage park but he didnt know which unit exactly i mean wouldnt tracking magic have led him straight to you and if thomas sold you out wouldnt he have told binder exactly which storage bay we were in morgan started to reply then frowned and shut his mouth hngh i glanced over my shoulder at the grasshopper and gave her a nod of approval molly beamed at me someone on the ground following us morgan asked a tailing car wouldnt have been able to enter the storage park without a key i thought of how id been shadowed by the skinwalker the previous evening if theyre good enough it would be possible i admitted not likely but possible so morgan said where does that leave us baffled i said morgan bared his teeth in a humorless smile where to next then if i take you back to my place theyll pick us up again i said if someones using strictly mortal methods of keeping track of our movements theyll have someone watching it morgan looked back and up at me i assume you arent just going to push me in circles around chicago while we wait for the council to find us no i said im taking you to my place morgan thought about that one for a second then nodded sharply right where the bad guys will see us and send someone else to kill us molly said no wonder im the apprentice because im so ignorant that i cant see why that isnt a silly idea watch and learn grasshopper watch and learn chapter twentyone we left the trail again and for the second time in a day i emerged from the nevernever into the alley behind the old meatpacking plant we made two stops and then walked until we could flag down another cab the cabbie didnt seem to be overly thrilled with mouse or the wheelchair or how we filled up his car but maybe he just didnt speak enough english to ably convey his enthusiasm you never know these really arent good for you molly said through a mouthful of donut as we unloaded the cab its morgans fault he started talking about donuts i said and besidesyoure eating them i have the metabolic rate of youth molly said smiling sweetly youre the one who needs to start being healthconscious o venerable mentor ill be invincible for another year or two at least we wrestled morgan into his chair and i paid off the cabbie we rolled morgan over to the steps leading down to my apartment and between the two of us managed to turn his chair around and get him down the stairs and into the apartment without dropping him after that i grabbed mouses lead and the two of us went up to get the mail from my mailbox and then ambled around to the boardinghouses small backyard and the patch of sandy earth set aside for mouses use but instead of loitering around waiting for mouse i led him into the far corner of the backyard which is a miniature jungle of old lilacs that hadnt been trimmed or pruned since mr spunkelcrief died they were in bloom and their scent filled the air bees buzzed busily about the bushy plants and as i stepped closer to them the corner of the building cut off the traffic sounds it was the only place on the propertys exterior that was not readily visible from most of the rest of the buildings on the street i pressed past the outer branches of the lilacs and found a small and relatively open space in the middle then i waited within seconds there was a buzzing sound like the wings of a particularly large dragonfly and then a tiny winged faerie darted through the lilacs to come to a halt in front of me he was simply enormous for a pixie one of the wee folk and stood no less than a towering twelve inches high he looked like an athletically built youth dressed in an odd assortment of armor made from discarded objects and loose ends hed replaced his plastic bottlecap helmet with one made of most of the shell of a hollowedout golf ball it was too large for his head but that didnt seem to concern him his cuirass had first seen service as a bottle of peptobismol and hanging at his hip was what looked like the blade to a jigsaw with one end wrapped in string to serve as a grip wings like those of a dragonfly buzzed in a translucent cloud of motion at his back the little faerie came to attention in midair snapped off a crisp salute and said mission accomplished my lord of pizza that fast i asked it hadnt been twenty minutes since id first summoned him after wed gotten donuts and before wed gotten into the cab quick work toottoot even for you the praise seemed to please the little guy immensely he beamed and buzzed in a couple of quick circles hes in the building across the street from this one two buildings toward the lake i grunted thinking if i was remembering right that was another boardinghouse converted into apartments like mine the white one with green shutters yes thats where the rapscallion has made his lair his hand flashed to his waist and he drew his sawtoothed sword from its transparent plastic scabbard scowling fiercely shall i slay him for you my lord i very carefully kept the smile off of my face i dont know if things have escalated to that level just yet i said how do you know this guy is watching my apartment oh oh dont tell me this one toot jittered back and forth in place bobbing in excitement because he has curtains on the windows so you cant see in and then theres a big black plastic box with a really long nose poking through them and a glass eye on the end of the nose and he looks at the back of it all the time and when he sees someone going into your house he pushes a button and the box beeps camera huh i asked yeah that probably makes him our snoop i squinted up at the summer sunshine and adjusted the uncomfortably warm leather duster i wasnt taking it off though there was too much hostility flying around for that how many of your kin are about toot hundreds toottoot declared brandishing his sword thousands i arched an eyebrow youve been splitting the pizza a thousand ways well lord he amended several dozen at any rate the wee folk are a fractious fickle bunch but ive learned a couple of things about them that im not sure anyone else knows first that theyre just about everywhere and anywhere they arent they can usually get they dont have much of an attention span but for short simple tasks they are hell on wheels secondthey have a lust for pizza that is without equal in this world ive been bribing the wee folk with pizza on a regular basis for years and in return theyve given me their admittedly erratic loyalty they call me the zalord and the little fair folk who take my pizza also serve in the zalords guardwhich means mostly that the wee folk hang around my house hoping for extra pizza and protecting it from wee threats toottoot was their leader and he and his folks had pulled off some very helpful tasks for me in the past they had saved my life on more than one occasion no one in the supernatural community ever expected everything of which they were capable as a result toot and his kin are generally ignored i tried to take that as a life lesson never underestimate the little people this was a job that was right up toottoots alley almost literally do you know which car is his i asked toot threw back his head yul brynner style of course the blue one withthis on the hood he threw his arms out and up at an angle and stood ramrod straight in a y shape blue mercedes eh i asked okay heres what i want you to do five minutes later i walked back around the side of the house to the front opposite the street then i turned to face the house where the snoop was set up and put on my most ferocious scowl i pointed directly at the curtained secondfloor windows then turned my hand over and crooked my finger beckoning then i pointed to the ground right in front of me one of the curtains might have twitched i gave it a slow count of five and then started walking briskly toward the other boardinghouse crossing the busy street in the process a young man in his twenties wearing khaki shorts and a green tshirt came rushing out of the converted boardinghouse and ran toward a blue mercedes parked on the street an expensive camera hanging around his neck i kept walking not changing my pace he rushed around to the drivers door pointing some kind of handheld device at the car then he clawed at the door but it stayed closed he shot another glance at me and then tried to insert his key into the lock then he blinked and stared at his key as he pulled it back trailing streamers of a rubbery pink substancebubble gum i wouldnt bother i said as i got closer look at the tires the young man glanced from me to his mercedes and stared some more all four tires were completely flat oh he said he looked at his gumcovered key and sighed well shit i stopped across the car from him and smiled faintly dont feel too bad about it man ive been doing this longer than you he gave me a sour look then he held up his key bubble gum coulda been superglue take it as a professional courtesy i nodded toward his car lets talk turn the airconditioning on for crying out loud he eyed me for a moment and sighed yeah okay we both got in the car he scraped the gum off of his key and put it in the ignition but when he turned it nothing happened oh pop the hood i said he eyed me and did i went around to the front of the car and reconnected the loose battery cable i said okay and he started the engine smoothly like i said give toottoot and his kin the right job and they are formidable as hell i got back in the car and said you licensed the young man shrugged and turned his ac up to deep freeze yeah i nodded how long not long cop in joliet he said but not now didnt fit why are you watching my place he shrugged i got a mortgage i nodded and held out my hand harry dresden he frowned at the name you the one used to work for nick christian at ragged angel yeah nick has a good reputation he seemed to come to some kind of conclusion and took my hand with a certain amount of resignation vince graver you got hired to snoop on me he shrugged you tail me last night you know the score man graver said you take someones money you keep your mouth shut i lifted my eyebrows a lot of pis wouldnt have the belly to be nearly so reticent under the circumstances it made me take a second look at him thin built like someone who ran or rode a bicycle on his weekends cleancut without being particularly memorable medium brown hair medium height medium brown eyes the only exceptional thing about his appearance was that there was nothing exceptional about his appearance you keep your mouth shut i agreed until people start getting hurt then it gets complicated graver frowned hurt there have been two attempts on my life in the past twentyfour hours i said do the math he focused his eyes down the street into the distance and pursed his lips damn damn he nodded morosely there go the rest of my fees and expenses i arched an eyebrow at him youre bailing on your client just like that accomplice is an ugly word so is penitentiary smart kid smarter than i had been when i first got my pi license i need to know who backed you graver thought about that one for a minute then he said no why not i make it a personal policy not to turn on clients or piss off people who are into murder you lost the work i said what if i made it up to you maybe you didnt read that part of the book the i in pi stands for investigator not informer maybe i call the cops maybe i tell them youre involved in the attacks maybe you cant prove a damned thing graver shook his head you dont get ahead in this business if you cant keep your teeth together i leaned back in my seat and crossed my arms studying him for a moment youre right i said i cant make you so im asking you please he kept on staring out the windshield why they after you im protecting a client old guy in the wheelchair yeah graver squinted he looks like a hard case you have no idea we sat in the airconditioning for a moment then he glanced at me and shook his head you seem like a reasonable guy graver said hope you dont get dead conversation over i thought about pushing things but ive been around long enough to recognize someone who was genuinely toughminded when i see him you got a business card he reached into his shirt pocket and produced a plain white business card with his name and a phone number he passed it over to me why sometimes i need a subcontractor he lifted both eyebrows one who knows how to keep his teeth together i nodded to him and got out of the car i leaned down and looked in the door before i left i know a mechanic ill give him a call and hell come on out hes got a compressor on his truck and he can fill up your tires ill pay for it graver studied me with calm intelligent eyes and then smiled a little thanks i closed the door and thumped on the roof with my fist then i walked back to my apartment mouse who had waited patiently in the yard came shambling up to greet me as i stepped out of the street and he walked alongside me as i went back to the apartment morgan was lying on my bed again when i came back in molly was just finishing up changing his bandages mister watched the entire process from the back of the couch his ears tilted forward evidently fascinated morgan nodded to me and rasped did you catch him yeah i said a local pi had been hired to keep track of me but there was a problem whats that i shrugged he had integrity morgan inhaled through his nose and nodded pretty rare problem yeah impressive young man what are the odds molly looked back and forth between us i dont understand hes quitting the job but he wont tell us what we want to know about his client because he doesnt think it would be right i said hes not willing to sell the information either molly frowned then how are we going to find out who is behind all of this i shrugged not sure but i told him id get someone to come by and put the air back in his tires excuse me wait hes still out there yeah i said blue mercedes and hes a young man sure i said a little older than you names vince graver molly beamed well then ill go get him to tell me she walked over to my icebox opened it pulled out a dark brown bottle of microbrewery beer and walked toward the door how you gonna do that i asked her trust me harry ill change his mind no morgan said fiercely he coughed a couple of times no i would rather be deaddo you hear me be dead than have you use black magic on my behalf molly set the beer down on the shelf by the door and blinked at morgan youre right she said to me he is kind of a drama queen who said anything about magic she pulled one arm into her tshirt and wriggled around a little a few seconds later she was tugging her bra out of the arm hole of her shirt she dropped it on the shelf picked up the bottle and held it against each breast in turn then she turned to face me took a deep breath and arched her back a little the tips of her breasts pressed quite noticeably against the rather strained fabric of her shirt what do you think she asked giving me a wicked smile i thought vince was doomed i think your mother would scream bloody murder i said molly smirked call the mechanic ill just keep him company until the truck gets there she turned with a little extra hip action and left the apartment morgan made a low appreciative sound as the door closed i eyed him morgan looked from the door to me im not dead yet dresden he closed his eyes doesnt hurt to admire a womans beauty once in a while maybe but that was just just wrong morgan smiled though it was strained with discomfort shes right though especially with a young man a woman can make a man see everything in a different light wrong i muttered just wrong i went to call mike the mechanic molly came back about fortyfive minutes later beaming morgan had been forced to take more pain medication and was tossing in a restless sleep i closed the door carefully so that we wouldnt wake him well i asked his car has really good airconditioning molly said smugly he never had a chance between two fingers she held up a business card like the one id gotten i did the same thing with mine mirroring her she flipped hers over showing me a handwritten note on the other side im worried about my job as your assistant she put the back of her hand against her forehead melodramatically if something happens to you whatever will i do wherever shall i go and she held out the card to me and vince suggested that i might consider work as a paralegal he even suggested a law firm smith cohen mackleroy his jobhunting suggestion eh i asked she smirked well obviously he couldnt just tell me who hired him that would be wrong you are a cruel and devious young woman i took the card from her and read it it said smith cohen mackleroy listed a phone number and had the name evelyn derek printed under that i looked up to meet mollys smiling eyes her grin widened damn im good no argument here i told her now we have a name a lead one might even call it a clue not only that molly said i have a date good work grasshopper i said grinning as i rolled my eyes way to take one for the team chapter twentytwo smith cohen and mackleroy as it turned out was an upscale law firm in downtown chicago the building their offices occupied stood in the shadow of the sears tower and must have had a fantastic view of the lake having plucked out the enemys eyes so to speak i thought that i might have bought us some breathing space without vince on our tail i hoped that morgan could get a few hours of rest in relative safety id figure out somewhere else to move himjust as soon as i leaned on ms evelyn derek and found out to whom she reported vinces findings i guess i looked sort of mussed and scraggly because the buildings security guard gave me a wary look as i entered solidly in the middle of lunch hour i could practically see him deciding whether or not to stop me i gave him my friendliest smilewhich my weariness and stress probably reduced to merely politeand said excuse me sir i have an appointment with an attorney at smith cohen and mackleroy theyre on the twentysecond floor right he relaxed which was good beneath his suit he looked like he had enough muscle to bounce me handily out the door twentyfour sir right thanks i smiled at him and strode confidently past confidence is critical to convincing people that you really are supposed to be somewhereespecially when you arent sir said the guard from behind me id appreciate it if you left your club here i paused and looked over my shoulder he had a gun his hand wasnt exactly resting on it but hed tucked his thumb into his belt about half an inch away it isnt a club i said calmly its a walking stick six feet long its traditional ozark folk art with dents and nicks all over it i thought about it for a second im insecure get a blanket he held out his hand i sighed and passed my staff over to him do i get a receipt he took a notepad from his pocket and wrote on it then he passed it over to me it read received one six foot traditional ozark walking club from mr smartass thats doctor smartass i said i didnt spend eight years in insult college to be called mister he leaned the staff against the wall behind his desk and sat back down at his chair i went to the elevator and rode up it was one of those express contraptions that goes fast enough to compress your spine and make your ears pop it opened on the twentyfourth floor facing a reception desk the law office apparently took up the entire floor the receptionist was inevitably a young woman and just as unavoidably attractive she went with the solidoak furnishings the actual oil paintings and the handcrafted furniture in the reception area and the faint scent of lemon wood polish in the airvariations on a theme of beautiful practicality she looked up at me with a polite smile her dark hair long and appealing her shirt cut just low enough to make you notice but not so low as to make you think less of her i liked the smile maybe i didnt look like a beatenup bum maybe on me it just looked ruggedly determined im sorry sir she said but the addictioncounseling center is on twentysix sigh im actually here to see someone i said assuming that this is smith cohen and mackleroy she glanced rather pointedlybut still politelyat the front of her desk where a plaque bore the firms name in simple sans serif lettering i see sir who are you looking for ms evelyn derek please do you have an appointment no i said but shell want to talk to me the receptionist looked at me as though she had some kind of bitter unpleasant taste in her mouth id timed my arrival correctly then the young lady clearly would have been much more comfortable handing me off to a secretary or executive assistant or whatever youre supposed to call them now and letting someone else decide if i was supposed to be there and ms evelyn dereks assistant was just as clearly out to lunch which was the point of showing up during lunch hour who shall i say is here i produced vincent gravers business card and passed it to her please tell her that vince has acquired some unexpected information and that she needs to hear about it she pushed a button adjusted her headset and dutifully passed on the message to whoever was on the other end she listened and nodded straight back down the hall sir the second door on the left i nodded to her and walked through the door behind her the carpet got even thicker and the decor more expensive a nook in the wall showcased a small rock fountain between a pair of twothousanddollar leather chairs i shook my head as i walked through a hall that absolutely reeked of success power and the desire for everyone to know about it i bet they would have been seethingly jealous of the ostentatiatory in edinburgh i opened the second door on the left went in and closed it behind me to find a secretarys desk currently unoccupied and an open door to what would doubtless be an executive office appropriate to the status of evelyn derek attorney at law come in mr graver said an impatient womans voice from inside the office i walked in and shut the door behind me the office was big but not monstrous she probably wasnt a full partner in the firm the furnishings were sleek and ultramodern with a lot of glass and spaceage metal there was only one small filing cabinet in the room a shelf with a row of legal texts a slender and fragilelooking laptop computer and a framed sheepskin from somewhere expensive on the wall she had a window but it had been frosted over into bare translucency the glass desk and sitting table and liquor cabinet all shone without a smudge or a fingerprint to be seen anywhere it had all the warmth of an operating theater the woman typing on the laptop might have come with the office as part of a complete set she wore rimless glasses in front of the deepest green eyes i had ever seen her hair was raven black and cut close to her head showcasing her narrow elegant features and the slender line of her neck she wore a dark silk suit jacket with a matching skirt and a white blouse she had long legs ending in shoes that must have cost more than most mortgage payments but she wore no rings no earrings and no necklace there was something cold and reserved about her posture and her fingers struck the keys at a rapid decisive cadence like a military drummer she said nothing for two full minutes focusing intently on whatever she was typing obviously she had something to prove to vince for daring to intrude upon her day i hope you dont think you can convince me to rehire you mr graver she said eventually without looking up what is it that you think is so important ah vince had quit already he didnt let much grass grow under his feet did he this woman was evidently used to being taken very seriously i debated several answers and decided to start things off by annoying her i know me shocking right i stood there treating her the same way she had treated me saying nothing until evelyn derek exhaled impatiently through her nose and turned a cool and disapproving stare toward me hi cuddles i said ill give the lady this muchshe had a great poker face the disapproval turned into a neutral mask she straightened slightly in her chair though she looked more attentive than nervous and put her palms flat on the desktop youre going to leave smudges i said she stared at me for a few more seconds before she said get out of my office i dont see any windex in here i mused looking around did you hear me she said her voice growing harder get out i scratched my chin maybe its in your secretarys desk you want me to get it for you spots of color appeared on her cheeks she reached for the phone on her desk i pointed a finger at it sent out an effort of will and hissed hexus fouling up technology is a fairly simple thing for a wizard to do but it isnt surgical in its precision sparks erupted from the phone from her computer from the overhead lights and from something inside her coat pocket accompanied by several sharp popping sounds ms derek let out a small shriek and tried to flinch in three directions at once her chair rolled backward without her and she wound up sprawled on the floor behind her glasstopped desk in a most undignified manner her delicatelooking glasses hung from one ear and her deep green eyes were wide the whites showing all around them purely for effect i walked a couple of steps closer and stood looking down at her in silence for a long moment there was not a sound in that room and it was a lot darker in there without the lights i spoke very very quietly there are two shut doors between you and the rest of this officewhich is mostly empty anyway youve got great carpets solidoak paneling and a burbling water feature out in the hallway i smiled slightly nobody heard what just happened or they would have come running by now she swallowed and didnt move i want you to tell me who had you hire a detective to snoop on me she made a visible effort to gather herself together ii dont know what youre talking about i shook my head lifted my hand and made a beckoning gesture at the liquor cabinet as i murmured forzare and made a gentle effort of will the door to the cabinet swung open i picked a bottle of what looked like bourbon and repeated the gesture causing it to flit from the opened cabinet across the room to my hand i unscrewed the cap and took a swig it tasted rich and burned my throat pleasantly on the way down evelyn derek stared at me in pure shock her mouth open her face whiter than rural maine i looked at her steadily are you sure oh god she whispered evelyn i said in a chiding voice focus you hired vince graver to follow me around and report on my movements someone told you to do that who was it mmy clients she stammered confidential i felt bad scaring the poor woman her reaction to the use of magic had been typical of a straight who had never encountered the supernatural beforewhich meant that she probably had no idea of the nature of whoever she was protecting she was terrified i mean i knew i wasnt going to hurt her but i was the only one in the room who did the thing about playing a bluff is that you have to play it all the way out even when it gets uncomfortable i really didnt want this to get ugly i said sadly i took a step closer and put the bottle down on the desk then i slowly dramatically raised my left hand it had been badly burned several years before and while my ability to recover from such things was more intense than other human beings at least in the long term my hand still wasnt pretty it wasnt quite horrormovie special effects anymore but the molten scars covering my fingers wrist and most of my palm were still startling and unpleasant if you hadnt ever seen them before no wait evelyn squeaked she backed across the floor on her buttocks pressed her back to the wall and lifted her hands dont you helped your client try to kill people evelyn i said in a calm voice tell me who her eyes widened even more what no no i didnt know anyone would get hurt i stepped closer and snarled talk all right all right she stammered she she stopped speaking as suddenly as if someone had begun strangling her i eased up on the intimidation throttle tell me i said more quietly evelyn derek shook her head at me fear and confusion stripping away the reserve id seen in her only moments before she started shaking i saw her open her mouth several times but only small choked sounds emerged her eyes lost focus and started flicking randomly around the room like a trapped animal looking for an escape that wasnt normal not even a little someone like evelyn derek might panic might be cowed might be backed into a cornerbut she would never be at a loss for words oh i said mostly to myself ihate this crap i sighed and walked around the desk to stand over the cowering lawyer hell if id known that someone had i shook my head she wasnt really listening very hard to me and shed started crying it was one of about a thousand possible reactions when someones free will has been directly abrogated by some kind of psychic interdiction id just created a situation in which every part of her logical rational mind had been completely in favor of telling me who had hired her her emotions had been lined up right behind her reasoned thoughts too only i was betting that someone had gotten into her head someone had left something inside her that refused to let ms derek speak about her employer hell she might not even have a conscious memory of who hired herdespite the fact that she wouldnt just hire some detective to spy on somebody for no reason everyone always thinks that such obvious logical inconsistencies wouldnt hold up that the mind would somehow tear free of the bonds placed upon it using those flaws but the fact is that the human mind isnt a terribly logical or consistent place most people given the choice to face a hideous or terrifying truth or to conveniently avoid it choose the convenience and peace of normality that doesnt make them strong or weak people or good or bad people it just makes them people its our nature theres plenty to distract us from the nastier truths of our lives if we want to avoid them evelyn derek i said in a firm authoritative voice look at me she flinched closer to the wall shaking her head i knelt in front of her then i reached out to touch her chin and gently lifted her face to mine evelyn derek i said in a gentler voice look at me the woman lifted her dark green eyes to mine and i held her gaze for the space of a long breath before the soulgaze began if the eyes are the windows to the soul then wizards are the souls voyeurs when a wizard looks into another persons eyes we get to see something of that person a vision of the very core of their being we each go through the experience a little differently but it amounts to the same thinga look into another persons eyes gives you an insight into the most vital portions of their character evelyn dereks deep green eyes almost seemed to expand around me and then i found myself staring at a room that was if anything almost identical to the womans office the furniture was beautiful and minimalistic ms derek it seemed was not the kind of person to overly burden her soul with the care and mementos most people collect over the course of a lifetime she had devoted her life to her mind to the order and discipline of her thoughts and she had never left herself much room for personal entanglements but as i stared at the room i saw ms derek herself i would have expected her in her business clothing or perhaps in students attire instead she was wearing well she was wearing very expensive very minimalistic black lingerie stockings garters panties and bra all black she wore them ahem very well she was kneeling on the floor her knees apart her hands held behind the small of her back she faced me with her lips parted her breath coming in quickened pants i was able to change my viewpoint slightly as if walking around her and those green eyes followed me pupils wide with desire her hips shifting in little yearning rolls with every tiny correction of her balance her wrists were bound behind her back with a long slender ribbon of white silk i caught a motion in the corner of my eye and i snapped my gaze up to see a slender feminine form vanish into the corridors of evelyn dereks memory showing me nothing more than a flash of pale skin and a gleam of silver eyes son of a bitch someone had bound up ms dereks thoughts all right and woven those restraints together with her natural sexual desire to give them permanence and strength the method and the glimpses id seen of the perpetrator flashes of memory that had managed to remain in her thoughts perhaps gave strong indicators as to who was responsible a vampire of the white court and then there was a wrenching sensation and i was kneeling over evelyn derek her eyes were wide her expression a mixture of terror and awe as she stared up at me oh yeah that was the thing about a soulgaze whoever you look at gets a look back at you they get to see you in just as much detail as you see them ive never had anyone soulgaze me who didnt seem disconcerted by the experience evelyn derek stared at me and whispered who are you i said harry dresden she blinked slowly and said her voice dazed she ran from you tears started forming in her eyes what is happening to me magic that invades the thoughts of another human being is just about as black as it gets a direct violation of the laws of magic that the wardens uphold but there are grey areas like in any set of laws and there are accepted customs as to what was or was not allowed in practice there wasnt much i could do for evelyn it would take a hand lighter and more skilled than mine to undo the harm that had been done to her mind if it could be undone at all but there was one thing i could do for her a bit of grey magic that even the white council acknowledged as an aid and a mercy especially for those who had suffered the kind of psychic trauma evelyn had i called up my will as gently as i could and reached out with my right hand i passed my fingertips gently over her eyes causing her to close them and as i passed my palm from her forehead down to her chin i released that will with as much care as i possibly could murmuring dorme dormius evelyn dorme dormius she let out a little whimpering sound of relief and her body sagged to the floor in sudden and complete relaxation she breathed in deeply once exhaled and then passed into simple and dreamless slumber i made her as comfortable as i could with luck when she woke she would pass most of our confrontation off as a bad dream then i turned and left the law office behind me quiet anger growing inside me with every step i went by the security guard at the door as the anger started nudging over into fury i slapped the receipt down on his desk and with a gesture and a muttered word caused my staff to leap from where it leaned against the wall and into my hand the guard fell out of his chair and i left without looking back the white court was involved they were trying to get morgan killedand mewith himand whats more they were preying on people in my town ripping into their psyches and inflicting harm that could blossom into madness given the right circumstances there was a broad difference between their usual predation and what had been done to evelyn derek someone was going to answer for it chapter twentythree i got back to my apartment shouldered open my door and found a bizarre tableau again morgan lay on the floor about five feet from the bedroom door hed apparently seized my walking cane from the old popcorn tin by the door where i keep things like ozark folk art carved quarter staves blasting rods umbrellas and so on the cane is an old victorianstyle swordcane you twist the handle and pull and you can draw a slender thirtyinch spring steel blade from the wooden cane morgan had he lay on his side on the floor his arm extended up at about a fortyfivedegree angle holding the sword its tip rested against mollys carotid artery just under her left ear molly for her part leaned back against one of my bookcases her knees bent a little her arms spread out to either side as if shed stumbled over something and flung out her hands to brace herself against the bookcase as she fell back to the left of the door mouse crouched with his fangs bared and resting lightly against anastasia luccios throat she lay on her back and her gun lay on the rugcovered floor about two feet beyond the reach of her hand she appeared to be quite relaxed though i couldnt see much of her face from where i stood mouses deep brown eyes were focused steadily on morgan morgans steely gaze was locked on mouses jaws i stared at them aghast for a minute no one moved except mouse when i looked at him his tail wagged hopefully once or twice i blew out a heavy breath set my staff aside and plodded to the icebox stepping over anastasias leg on the way i opened it considered the contents for a moment and then pulled out a cold coke i opened it and took a long drink then i picked up a dry kitchen towel went to the couch and sat down i would ask what the hell happened i said to the room at large except that the only one with any sense who witnessed it cant actually talk i eyed the dog and said this had better be good mouse wagged his tail tentatively again okay i said let her go mouse opened his jaws and sat up and away from anastasia at once he immediately padded over to me and leaned against me as his gaze flicked from anastasia to morgan and back morgan i said ease off the psycho throttle a little and put down the sword no morgan said in a voice half strangled with fury not until this little witch is bound and wearing a gag and a blindfold mollys already done duty as a beercalendar model today i said were not dressing her up for a bdsm shoot next i put the coke down and thought about it for a second threats werent going to have any effect on morgan except to make him more determined it was one of the charming side effects of having such a rigid oldschool personality morgan i said quietly you are a guest in my home he flashed me a quick guilty glance you came to me for help and im doing my best hell the kid has put herself into harms way trying to protect you ive done everything for you that i would have for blood family because you are my guest there are monsters from whom i would expect better behavior once they had accepted my hospitality whats more theyd give it to me morgan let out a pained sound then he turned his head sharply away from molly and dropped the sword at the same time the steel of the blade chimed as it bounced off the thin rug morgan settled into a limp heap on the floor and molly sagged lifting her hand and covering the vulnerable skin of her throat for a moment i waited until anastasia sat up to toss her the towel id brought from the kitchen she caught it her expression neutral and lifted it to begin drying her neck mouse is a great dog but he has to work hard to control his slobber issues so i take it things almost devolved into violence again i said to them and mouse had to get involved she just came walking in here molly protested she saw him i blinked and looked at her and you did what exactly she blinded me anastasia said calmly and then she hit me she lifted the towel and wiped at her nose some blood came away though most of it stayed crusted and brown below one nostril so they hadnt been in the standoff for long anastasia gave molly a steady gaze and said she hit me like a girl for goodness sake child have you had no combat training at all theres been a lot of material to cover i growled blinded you not permanently molly said more sullenly now she rubbed at the knuckles of her right hand with her left i just kind of veiled everything that wasnt her an unnecessarily complicated way to go about it anastasia said primly for you maybe molly said defensively besides who was the one on the ground getting pounded yes youre forty pounds heavier than me anastasia said calmly bitch i know you didnt say just say that molly bristled stepping forward with her hands clenched mouse sighed and heaved himself back to his feet molly stopped eyeing the big dog warily good dog i said and scratched mouses ears he wagged his tail without taking his serious brown eyes from molly i had to stop her molly said she was going to report morgan to the wardens so you physically and magically assaulted her i said what choice did i have i eyed morgan and you staggered up out of the bed youre supposed to be staying in grabbed the first pointy thing you could reach and forced her off of anastasia morgan eyed me wearily obviously i sighed and looked at anastasia and you thought the only solution you had was to take them both down and sort everything out later and mouse stopped you anastasia sighed there was a blade out harry the situation had to be controlled i eyed mouse and you wound up holding anastasia hostage so morgan wouldnt hurt molly mouse ducked his head i cant believe im about to say this i said so think real careful about where this is coming from have you people ever considered talking when youve got a problem that didnt please anybody and they gave me looks with varying degrees of irritation mixed with chagrin except for mouse who sighed and said something like uhwoof sorry i told him at once fourfooted nonvocalizing company excepted she was going to get the wardens molly said if that happened before we proved who really killed lafortier all of us would be up the creek actually anastasia said thats true i turned my gaze to her she rose and stretched wincing slightly i assumed she said quietly that morgan had recruited your apprentice to assist him in his escape scheme and that they had done away with you i made a small frustrated sound why the hell would you assume something like that she narrowed her eyes as she stared at me why would morgan flee to the home of the one wizard in the council who had the most reason to dislike him she asked i believe your words were that would be crazy i winced ouch uh i said yeah i you lied to me she said in a level tone most people probably wouldnt have noticed the undertone of anger and pain in her voice or the almost imperceptible pause between each word i could see bricks being mortared into place behind her eyes and i looked away from her the room was completely silent until morgan said in a small and broken voice what i looked up at him his hard sour face had gone gray his expression was twisted up in shock and surprise like that of a small child discovering the painful consequences of gravity for the first time ana he said almost choking on the words you you think that i how could you think that i would he turned his face away it couldnt have been a tear not from morgan he wouldnt shed tears if he had to execute his own mother but for a fraction of a second something shone on one of his cheeks anastasia rose and walked over to morgan she knelt down by him and put her hand on his head donald she said gently weve been betrayed by those we trusted before it wouldnt be the first time that was them he said unsteadily not looking up this is me she stroked his hair once i never thought you had done it of your own free will donald she whispered quietly i thought someone had gotten into your mind held a hostage against your cooperation something who could they have held hostage morgan said in a bitter voice theres no one for that very reason and you know it she sighed and closed her eyes you knew his wards morgan went on youve been through them before often you opened them in under a second when you came in you have a key to his apartment she said nothing his voice turned heavy and hollow youre involved with dresden anastasia blinked her eyes several times donald she began he looked up at her his eyes empty of tears or pain or anything but weariness dont he said dont you dare she met his eyes id never seen such gentle pain on her face youre running a fever donald please you should be in bed he laid his head on the rug and closed his eyes it doesnt matter donald it doesnt matter he repeated dully anastasia started crying in silence she stayed next to morgan stroking her hand over his mottled silverandbrown hair an hour later morgan was unconscious in bed again molly was down in the lab pretending to work on potions with the trapdoor closed i was sitting in the same spot with an empty can of coke anastasia came out of the bedroom and shut the door silently behind her then she leaned back against it when i saw him she said i thought he had come here to hurt you that he had learned about the two of us and wanted to hurt you you i asked and morgan she was quiet for a moment before she said i never allowed it to happen it wasnt fair to him but he wanted it anyway i said she nodded hells bells i sighed she folded her arms over her stomach never looking up was it any different with your apprentice harry molly hadnt always been the grasshopper she was today when id first begun teaching her shed assumed that i would be teaching her all sorts of things that had nothing to do with magic and everything to do with her being naked and that had been more than all right with her just not with me not much i acknowledged but he hasnt been your apprentice for a long long time i have always been of the opinion that romantic involvement was a vulnerability i could not afford not in my position not always i said apparently she exhaled slowly it was a much easier opinion to hold in my previous body it was older less prone to life i suggested she shrugged desire loneliness joy pain life i said perhaps she closed her eyes for a moment when i was young i reveled in love harry in passion in discovery and in new experiences and in life she gestured down at herself i never realized how much of it i had forgotten until corpsetaker left me like this she opened her pained eyes and looked at me i didnt realize how much i missed it until you reminded me and by then morgan wasnt he was like i had been detached in other words i said hed made himself more like you patterned himself after you and because hed done that after your change he wasnt capable of giving you what you wanted she nodded i shook my head a hundred years is a long time to carry a torch i said that one must burn like hell i know and i never wanted to hurt him you must believe me heres where you say the heart wants what the heart wants i said trite she said but true all the same she turned until her right shoulder leaned on the door facing me we should talk about where this leaves us i toyed with the can of coke before we can do that i said we have to talk about morgan and lafortier she exhaled slowly yes what do you intend to do i asked hes wanted by the council harry she said in a gentle voice i dont know how hes managed to avoid being located by magical means but sooner or later in hours or days hewill be found and when that happens you and molly will be implicated as well youll both die with him she took a deep breath and if i dont go to the council with what i know ill be right there beside you yeah i said you really think hes innocent she asked of lafortiers murder i said yes do you have proof ive found out enough to make me think im right not enough to clear himyet if it wasnt morgan she said quietly then the traitor is still running around loose yeah youre asking me to discard the pursuit of a suspect with strong evidence supporting his guilt in favor of chasing a damn ghost harry someone weve barely been able to prove exists much less identify not only that youre asking me to gamble your life your apprentices life and my own against finding this ghost in time yes i am she shook her head everything ive ever learned as a warden tells me that its far more likely that morgan is guilty which brings us back to the question i said what are you going to do silence yawned she pushed off the door and came to sit down on the chair facing my seat on the couch all right she said tell me everything chapter twentyfour this is not how diplomacy is done anastasia said as we approached the château raith youre in america now i said our idea of diplomacy is showing up with a gun in one hand and a sandwich in the other and asking which youd prefer anastasias mouth curved up at one corner you brought a sandwich who do i look like kissinger id been to château raith before but it had always been at night or at least twilight it was an enormous estate most of an hour away from chicago proper a holding of house raith the current ruling house of the white court the château itself was surrounded by at least half a mile of oldgrowth forest that had been converted to an idyllic even gardenlike state like you sometimes see on centuriesold european properties huge trees and smooth grass beneath them dominated with the occasional suspiciously symmetrical outgrowth of flowering plants often located in the center of golden shafts of sunlight that came down through the greenshadowed trees at regular intervals the grounds were surrounded by a high fence topped with razor wire that couldnt be readily seen from the outside the fence was electrically charged too and the latest surveillance camerasseemingly little more than glass beads with wires running out of themmonitored every inch of the exterior at night it made for one extremely creepy piece of property on a bright summer afternoon it just looked pretty very very wealthy and very very pretty like the raiths themselves the grounds were only scary when seen at the right time a polite security guard with the general bearing of exmilitary had watched us get out of a cab called ahead and let us in with hardly a pause wed walked past the gate and up the drive through little sherwood until we reached the château proper how good are her people anastasia asked im sure youve read the file yes she said as we started up the steps but id prefer your personal assessment since laras taken over the hiring i said theyve improved significantly i dont think theyre fed upon to keep them under control anymore and you base that assessment on what i shrugged the before and after the last batch of hired muscle was just out of touch willing to die at a moments notice but not exactly the sharpest tacks in the box pretty and vacant and pretty vacant i gestured back at the entrance that guy back there had a newspaper nearby and he was eating lunch when we showed up before they just stood around like mannequins with muscle im betting that most of them are exmilitary the hardcore kind not the getmycollegefunded kind officially she said as we reached the top of the steps they remain untested or maybe laras just smart enough not to show them off until its necessary to use them i said officially anastasia said dryly she remains untested you didnt see her killing super ghouls with a couple of knives the way i did during the white court coup i said i rapped on the door with my staff and adjusted the hang of my grey cloak i know my word isnt exactly respected among the old guard wardens but take it from me lara raith is one smart and scary bitch anastasia shook her head with a faint smile and yet youre here to hold a gun to her head im hoping that if we apply some pressure well get something out of her i said im low on options and i dont have time to be anything but direct well she said at least youre playing to your strengths a squarejawed flattopped man in his thirties opened the door he was wearing a casual beige sports suit accessorized by a gun in a shoulder holster and what was probably a kevlar vest beneath his white tee if that wasnt enough he had some kind of dangerouslooking little machine gun hanging from a nylon strap over one shoulder sir he said with a polite nod maam may i take your cloaks thank you anastasia said but theyre part of the uniform if you could convey us directly to ms raith that would be most helpful the security man nodded his head before you accept the hospitality of the house i would ask you both to give me your personal word that you are here in good faith and will offer no violence while you are a guest anastasia opened her mouth as if she intended to readily agree but i stepped slightly in front of her and said hell no the security man narrowed his eyes and looked a little less relaxed excuse me go tell lara that whether or not we rip this house to splinters and broken glass is still up for debate i said tell her theres already blood on the floor and i think some of it is on her hands tell her if she wants a chance to clear the air she talks to me tell her if she doesnt that it is answer enough and that she accepts the consequences the guard stared at me for several seconds then he said youve got a real high opinion of yourself do you know whats around you do you have any idea where youre standing yeah i said ground zero more silence stretched and he blinked before i did ill tell her wait here please i nodded to him and he walked deeper into the house ground zero anastasia muttered out of the corner of her mouth a trifle melodramatic dont you think i answered her in a similar fashion i was going to go with three feet from where theyll find your body but i figured that would have made it too personal hes just doing his job she shook her head is there some reason this cant be a civil visit laras at her most dangerous when everyones being civil i said she knows it i dont want her feeling comfortable itll be easier to get answers out of her if shes worried about all hell breaking loose it might also be easier to question her if we arent worried about it anastasia pointed out she does hold the advantage here one notes that there is fairly fresh plaster on the walls on either side of us for instance i checked she was right so so if i was the one preparing to defend this place i think i might line the walls with antipersonnel mines wired to a simple charge and cover them in plaster until i needed them to remove a threat too dangerous to engage directly id personally seen what an ap mine could do to human bodies it wasnt pretty imagine whats left of a squirrel when it gets hit with large rounds from a heavygauge shotgun theres not much there but scraps and stains its essentially the same when a human gets hit with a load of ball bearings the size of gumballs that spew from an ap mine i glanced at either wall again at least i was right i said ground zero anastasia smiled faintly i just thought id mention the possibility theres a fine line between audacity and idiocy and if she thinks shes in danger lara might just detonate them now i said preemptive selfdefense mmmm generally the favored method for dealing with practitioners the customs of hospitality would have protected us from her as much as her from us i thought about that for a second and then shook my head if we were all calm and polite shed never give away anything and she wont kill us not until she finds out what we know she shrugged you could be right youve dealt with the smart scary bitch more often than me i guess well know in a minute a minute later we were still there and the security guy reappeared this way please he said we followed him through the wealthy splendor of the house hardwood floors custom carved woodworking statues fountains suits of armor original paintings one of them a van gogh stainedglass windows household staff in formal uniform i kept expecting to come across a flock of peacocks roaming the halls or maybe a pet cheetah in a diamondstudded collar after a goodly hike the guard led us to a wing of the house that had apparently been converted to corporate office space there were half a dozen efficientlooking people working in cubicles a phone with a digital ring tone chirruped in the background copiers wheezed in the background a radio played soft rock we went past the office down a short hall past a break room that smelled of fresh coffee and to the double doors at the end of the hallway the guard held open one of the doors for us and we went inside to an outer office complete with a secretarys desk manned by a stunning young woman by justine in fact her white hair held back in a tail wearing a conservative grey pantsuit as we entered she rose with a polite impersonal smile that could have taken any number of competitive pageants sir maam if youll come this way please ms raith is ready to see you she went over to the door on the wall behind her desk knocked once and opened it enough to say ms raith the wardens are here a very soft feminine voice answered her justine opened the door all the way and held it for us smiling coffee sir maam another beverage no thank you anastasia said as we entered justine shut the door carefully behind us lara raiths office had a few things in common with evelyn dereks it had the same rich furnishingsthough her style was more rich dark hardwood than glassthe same clarity of function and purpose the resemblance ended there laras office was a working office mail was stacked neatly on a corner of the desk files and envelopes each had their own specific positions upon her desk and the worktable against one wall a pen and ink set was in evidence on the desktop paperwork anarchy threatened the room but order had been strongly imposed guided by an obvious will lara raith de facto ruler of the white court sat behind the desk she wore a silk business suit of purest white cut close to the flawless lines of her body the cut of the suit elegantly displayed her figure and contrasted sharply with the long blueblack hair which hung in waves past her shoulders her features had the classically immortal beauty of greek statues balancing sheer beauty with strength intelligence and perception her eyes were a deep warm grey framed by thick sooty lashes and just looking at her full soft mouth made my lips twitch and tingle as they demanded an introduction to laras warden dresden she murmured her voice soothing and musical warden luccio please be seated i didnt need to check with anastasia both of us just stood there staff in hand regarding her quietly she leaned back in her chair and a wicked little smile played over that mouth without ever getting as far as her eyes i see im being intimidated are you going to tell me why or do i get three guesses stop being cute lara i said your lawyer evelyn derek hired a private eye to tail me and report on my movementsand every time i turn around something nasty has shown up to make a run at me the smile remained in place lawyer i took a look at her head i said and found the marks of the white court all over itincluding a compulsion not to reveal who she was working for and you think it was my doing she asked in these parts i asked why not im hardly the only member of the white court in the region dresden lara said and while im flattered that you think so highly of me the others of my kind do not love me so well as to consult with me before every action they take anastasia stepped in but they wouldnt engage the white council in this sort of business without your approval she smiled such a thing would be seen as a challenge to yourto the authority of the white king lara studied luccio for a while grey eyes probing captain luccio she said i saw you dance in naples anastasia frowned it would have been what two centuries ago give or take a few decades lara smiled you were exquisitely gifted granted that was before your current condition ms raith anastasia said that is hardly germane to the subject at hand it could be lara murmured you and i attended the same party after your performance i know the sort of appetites you indulged back then her lips curled into a hungry little smile and it was suddenly all i could do to keep my knees from buckling in sheer sudden irrational sexual desire perhaps youd care to revisit old times lara purred and as quickly as that the desire was gone anastasia took a slow deep breath im too old to be amused by such antics ms raith she replied calmly just as im too intelligent to believe that you dont know something of whats been happening in chicago it took me a couple of seconds to pull my mind back from the places lara had just sent it but i managed we know youre working with someone inside the council i said quietly i want you to tell us who it is and i want you to release thomas laras eyes snapped to me on that last thomas i leaned on my staff and watched her face closely thomas managed to warn me about the hit man evelyn derek had directed to me but he disappeared before he could get involved hes not answering either of his phones and no one at the salon has seen him either laras eyes went distant for a moment and a frown line marred the perfection of her brow is that all you have dresden a fading psychic impression that one of my kind manipulated this lawyer and the apparent disappearance of my little brother is that the basis of reasoning that brought you here at the moment i said now that id laid down a lot of truth i threw in the little lie but by the time we finish tracing the money back to its source well know for certain that youre involved and after that there wont be any going back lara narrowed her eyes at that you wont find anything she said in a firm cold tone because nothing of the sort is going on aha that had touched a nerve i applied pressure come on lara you know and i know how you and your folk do businessfrom behind proxies and catspaws you cant possibly expect me to believe you when you say that you dont have a hand in whats going on laras eyes flickered in color changing from deep grey to a far paler more metallic shade and she rose to her feet frankly i dont care what you believe dresden i have no idea what kind of evidence you think youve discovered but i am not involved in any internal affairs of the white council she lifted her chin as she sneered at us contrary to your own perceptions the world is a great deal larger than the white council of wizardry you arent a vital body in todays world youre a sad little collection of selfdeluded hasbeens whose selfrighteous prattle has always taken second place to its hypocritical practice well i couldnt argue with that but the words made anastasias eyes narrow dangerously lara leaned the heels of her hands on her desk and faced me her words clipped and precise you think you can simply walk into my home and issue commands and threats as it pleases you the world is changing wardens the council isnt changing with it its only a matter of time before it collapses under its own obsolescent weight this kind of highhanded arrogance will only she broke off suddenly turning toward the window her head tilted slightly to one side i blinked and traded a glance with anastasia an instant later the lights went out red emergency lights snapped on immediately though they werent needed in the office a few seconds after that a rapid steady chiming sound filled the room coming from speakers on the wall i looked down from the speaker to find lara staring intently at me whats happening i asked her her eyes widened slightly you dont know how the hell should i know i demanded exasperated its your stupid alarm system then this isnt your doing she gritted her teeth bloody hell her head whipped toward the window again and this time i heard itthe sound of a man screaming in highpitched shameless agony and then i felt it a nauseating quiver of wrongness in the air a hideous sense of the presence of something ancient and vile the skinwalker were under attack lara snarled come with me chapter twentyfive justine knocked and entered the room her eyes wide ms raith security status lara asked in a calm voice unknown justine said she was breathing a little too fast the alarm went off and i called mr jones but the radios cut out most of your electronics are probably gone youve been hexed i said its a skinwalker lara turned and stared hard at me are you sure anastasia nodded and drew the sword from her hip i feel it too lara nodded what can it do everything i can only better i said and its a shapeshifter very fast very strong can it be killed yeah i said but its probably smarter to run lara narrowed her eyes this thing has invaded my home and hurt my people like hell she turned drove her fist with moderate force into a wooden wall panel and dislodged it completely in the empty space behind the panel was a rack hung with a belt bearing two wavybladed swords and a machine pistol like a baby uzi she kicked out of her expensive shoes shrugged out of her coat and began strapping on weapons justine how many of the blood are in the house four counting you justine replied immediately your sisters elisa and natalia and your cousin madeline she nodded wardens she said if you would not mind delaying our argument for a time i would take it as a personal favor hell with that i said this thing killed one of my friends lara glanced at the two of us i propose a temporary alliance against this invader concur anastasia said sharply doesnt look like theres any way to get out of it i said gunfire erupted somewhere in the hallsmultiple automatic weapons all going off at the same time then there were more screams justine i said holding out my hand get behind me the young woman hurried to comply her expression strained but controlled anastasia took up position on my right and lara slid up next to me on the left her perfume was exquisite and the surge of lust that hit me as i breathed it nearly had me turning to take a bite out of her she smelled so good its fast and tough i said and smart but not invulnerable we hit it from several directions at once and ran it off a shotgun boomed much closer to us than the earlier gunfire had been it was immediately followed by the sounds of something heavy being slammed several times into the walls and floor the psychic stench of the skinwalker abruptly thickened and i said here it comes by the time i got to it the skinwalker was already through the door to the outer office seemingly moving faster than the splinters that flew off the door when the creature shattered it covered in a veil it was just a flickering blur in the air i brought my shield up focused far forward filling the doorway to laras office with invisible force the skinwalker hit the barrier with all of its strength and speed the shield heldbarelybut so much energy had gone into the impact that wisps of smoke began curling up from the bracelet and the skin on my wrist got singed so much force surged into my shield that it physically drove me back across a foot of carpet as it hit the energies of the skinwalkers veil came into conflict with those in my shield each canceling out the other and for a second the creature was visible as an immensely tall lean shaggy vaguely humanoid thingwith matted yellow hair and overlong forelimbs tipped in long almost delicate claws as the shield fell anastasia pointed a finger at the thing and hissed a word and a blindingly bright beam of light no thicker than a hair flashed out from her finger it was fire magic not unlike my own but infinitely more intense and focused and far more energy efficient the beam swept past the skinwalker intersecting with its upper left arm and where it touched fur burned away and flesh boiled and bubbled and blackened the skinwalker flashed to one side of the doorway and vanished leaving nothing behind but a view of the smoking pinprick hole in the expensive paneling of the outer office i pointed my staff at the door and lara did the same thing with the gun for maybe ten seconds everything was silent where is it lara hissed gone justine suggested maybe it got scared when warden luccio hurt it no it didnt i said its smart right now its looking for a better way to get to us i looked around the office trying to think like the enemy lets see i said ifi was a shapeshifting killing machine how would i get in here the options were limited there was the door in front of us and the window behind us i turned to face the window still looking silence reigned except for the sigh of the airconditioning billowing steadily into the office from the from the vents i turned and thrust my staff toward a large air vent covered with the usual slatted steel contraption drew forth my will and screamed fulminos bluewhite lightning suddenly filled the air with flickering fire while a spear of blinding heat and force crackled forth from my staff and slammed into the metal vent the metal absorbed the electricity and i knew it would carry it back through the vent itselfand into anything inside there was a weird chirping scream and then the vent cover flew outward followed by a pythonshaped blur in the air even as it arced toward us that shape flowed and changed into that of something lowslung stocky and viciously powerful like maybe a badger or a wolverine it hit anastasia high on the chest and slammed her to the floor and on the way down i caught a flash of goldenyellow eyes dancing with sadistic glee i turned to kick the thing off of anastasia but lara beat me to the metaphorical punch she slammed the barrel of her machine pistol into its flank as if driving a beer tap into a wooden keg with her bare hands and pulled the trigger on the way fire and noise filled the room and the skinwalker went bouncing to one side it hit the ground once twisted itself in midair and raked its claws across justines midsection using the reaction to control its momentum it landed on its feet and hurled itself out of the room by way of the window behind laras desk justine staggered and let out a small cry of pain lara stared at the window for a second her eyes wide then breathed empty night i turned to anastasia but she waved me off with a grimace it didnt look like she was bleeding i turned to justine and tried to assess her injuries there were six horizontal lines sliced into the soft flesh of her abdomen as neatly as if with a scalpel blood was welling readily from thembut i didnt think any of them had been deep enough to open the abdominal cavity or reach an artery i seized laras discarded coat folded it hastily and pressed it against justines belly hold it here i snapped to justine youve got to control the bleeding hold it here her teeth were bared in pain but she nodded and grasped at the improvised pad with both hands as i helped her up lara looked from justine to the window her eyes a little wide empty night she said again ive never seen anything that fast given that i had once seen her cover ground in a dead sprint at maybe fifty miles an hour i figured she knew what she was talking about we were never going to get that thing to hold still long enough to kill it i went to the window hoping to spot it and found myself staring into an oncoming comet of purple flame presumably courtesy of the skinwalker i fell back hurling my left arm and its shield bracelet in an instinctive gesture and the fiery hammer of the explosion flung me supine to the floor that otherworldly shriek sounded again mocking and full of spite and then there was a crash from somewhere below us its back inside the house i said i offered my hand to anastasia to help her up she took it but as i began to pull she clenched her teeth over a scream and i eased her back onto the floor at once cant she panted breathing hard its my collarbone i spat out a curse of every kind of simple fracture there is a fractured collarbone is one of the most agonizing and debilitating injuries you can get she wasnt going to be doing any more fighting today hell she wasnt going to be doing any morestanding the floor beneath my feet abruptly exploded i felt a steel cable wrap my ankle and pull and then i was falling with a hideous stench filling my nose i crashed down onto something that slowed my fall but gave way and i went farther down still the noise was hideous then the fall stopped abruptly though i wasnt quite sure which way was up about a hundred objects slammed into me all at the same time pounding the wind out of my lungs i lay there stunned for a few seconds struggling to remember how to breathe the floor the skinwalker had smashed its way up to me through the floor it had pulled me downbut all the falling debris must have crashed through the floor the skinwalker had been standing on in turn id just fallen two stories amidst maybe a ton of debris and managed to survive it talk about lucky and then beneath my lower back something moved the rubble shifted and a low growl began to reverberate up through it in a panic i tried to force my dazed body to flee but before i could figure out how it worked a yellowfurred toolong forearm exploded up out of the rubble quicker than you could say the late harry dresden its long clawed fingers closed with terrible strength on my throat and shut off my air chapter twentysix heres something a lot of people dont know being choked unconscious hurts theres this horrible crushing pain on your neck followed by an almost instant surge of terrible pressure that feels like its going to blow your head to tiny pieces from the inside thats the blood thats being trapped in your brain the pain surges and ebbs in time with your heartbeat which is probably racing it doesnt matter if youre a waifish supermodel or a steroidpopping professional wrestler because it isnt an issue of strength or willpowerits simple physiology if youre human and you need to breathe youre going down a properly applied choke will take you from feisty to unconscious in four or five seconds of course if the choker wants to make the victim hurt more they can be sloppy about the choke make it take longer ill let you guess which the skinwalker preferred i struggled but i might as well have saved myself the effort i couldnt break the grip on my neck the pile of rubble shifted and surged and then the skinwalker sat up out of the wreckage sloughing it off as easily as an arctic wolf emerging from a bed beneath the snow the skinwalkers nightmarishly long arms hung below its knees so as it began moving down the hallway i was able to get my hands and knees underneath me at least part of the time preventing my neck from snapping under the strain of supporting my own weight i heard boots hitting hardwood the skinwalker let out a chuckling little growl and casually slammed my head against the wall stars and fresh pain flooded my perceptions then i felt myself falling through the air and landing in a tumble of arms and legs that only seemed to be connected to me in the technical sense i lifted dazed eyes to see the security guy from the entrance hall come around the corner that little machine gun held to his shoulder his cheek resting against the stock so that the barrel pointed wherever his eyes were focused when he saw the skinwalker uncovered from its veil he stopped in his tracks to his credit he couldnt have hesitated for more than a fraction of a second before he opened fire bullets zipped down the hall so close that i could have reached out a hand and touched them the skinwalker flung itself to one side a goldenfurred blur and rebounded off the wall toward the gunman its form changing then it leapt into the air flipping its body as it did and suddenly a spider the size of a subcompact car was racing along the ceiling toward the security guy at that point he impressed me again he turned and ran sprinting around a corner with the skinwalker coming hard behind now someone called as the skinwalker reached the intersection of the two hallways and a sudden howl of thunder filled the hallways with noise and light bullets ripped into the floor the wall and the ceiling coming from some point out of sight around the corner filling the air with splinters of shattered hardwood the skinwalker let out a deafening caterwaul of pain and boundless fury the gunfire reached a thunderous frantic crescendo then men began screaming i tried to push myself to my feet but someone had set the hallway on tumble dry and i fell down again i kept trying whoever had made the hall start acting like a laundromat dryer had to run out of quarters eventually by using the wall i managed to make it to my knees i heard a soft sound behind me i turned my head blearily toward the source of the noise and saw three pale lithe forms drop silently from the floors above through the hole that the skinwalker had made the first was lara raith shed torn her skirt up one side almost all the way to her hip and when she landed in a silent crouch she looked cold and feral and dangerous with her sword in one hand and her machine pistol in the other the other two women were vampires as well their pale skin shining with eerie beauty their eyes glittering like polished silver coinsthe sisters justine had mentioned i presumed i guess id arrived in the middle of the night vampire time and gotten some people out of bed the first sister wore nothing but weapons and silver body piercings which gleamed on one eyebrow one nostril her lower lip and her nipples her dark hair had been cropped close to her head except for where her bangs fell to veil one of her eyes and she carried a pair of wavybladed swords like laras the second seemed to be taller and more muscular than the other two she wore what looked like a mans shirt closed with only a single button her long hair was a mess still tousled from sleep and she held an exoticlooking axe in her hands its blade honed along a concave edge instead of the more conventional convex one without any visible signal they all started prowling forward at the same timeand it was a prowl an atavistic feline motion that carried what were very clearly predators forward in total silence lara paused when she reached me glanced over my injuries with cold silver eyes and whispered stay down no problem i thought dully down is easy the screaming stopped with a last stuttering burst of gunfire the security guy came staggering around the corner blood matted his hair and covered half of his face there was a long tear through his jacket on the left side his left arm hung uselessly but he still gripped the handle of his miniature assault weapon with his right he wavered and dropped to one knee as he spotted the three vampires lara gestured with a hand and the other two spread out and moved forward while she came to the side of the wounded guard what happened we hit it he said his voice slurred we hit it with everything didnt even slow it down theyre dead theyre all dead youre bleeding lara said in a calm tone get behind me defend the wizard he nodded unsteadily yeah okay laras guy had to be either incredibly lucky or really good to have survived a closequarters battle with the skinwalker i stared dully at security guy for a second before my impactaddled brain sent up a warning flag nobody was that lucky lara i choked out security guy turned in a blur of motion sweeping the machine gun at laras head like a clubbut she had begun moving the instant shed heard my warning and he missed knocking her head off her shoulders by a fraction of an inch she flung herself to one side and rolled as security guys other arm flashed out lengthening and sprouting yellow fur and claws as it came she avoided the worst of it but the skinwalkers claws left a triple line of incisions down one shapely thigh and they welled with blood a little too pale and pearly to be human the skinwalker followed her motion surging forward its body broadening and thickening into the form of something like a great bear with oversized jaws and vicious fangs it overbore her by sheer mass slapping and raking with its clawed paws snapping with its steely jaws i heard a bone break heard lara cry out in rageand then the skinwalker flew straight up into the ceiling its head and shoulders slamming into it with such force that it went cleanly through it and out onto the floor above lara had rolled to her back and had launched the thing away from her with her legs they were long and smoothly muscled and utterly desirable even as she lowered them and rolled lightly to her feet holding one arm tucked in close to her side her skin shone with cold alien power and her eyes had become spheres of pure white she stared at the ceiling for a few seconds slowly lifting and straightening her arm as she did her forearm had received a compound fracture i could see bone poking out through the flesh but over the next few seconds the flesh seemed to ripple and become more malleable the bone withdrew vanishing beneath the skin of her armeven the hole that the bone had torn in the skin sealed slowly closed and in ten seconds i couldnt even tell shed been hurt she turned those empty white eyes to me and stared at me with an expression of focused naked hunger for a second i felt my body responding to her desire even as woozy as i was but that was quickly snuffed out by a surge of nausea i turned my head and threw up onto the expensive floor while my head and neck screamed with pain when i looked up again lara had turned her head away from me she picked up her fallen weaponbut the machine pistol had been bent into the shape of a comma by a blow from the skinwalkers sledgehammer paws she discarded it recovered her sword and drew the matching weapon from her belt she was breathing quicklynot in effort but in raw excitement and the tips of her breasts strained against her dirtied blouse she licked her lips slowly and said evidently for my benefit i sometimes see madelines point there was a feminine scream from somewhere close by a challenge that was answered by a leonine roar that shook the hallway the shorthaired sister flew into the wall at the t intersection ahead and collapsed like a rag doll there were sounds of swift motion from around the corner and a gasp then silence a moment later a blur came around the corner dragging the axewielding sisters limp form by the hair the veil faded as the skinwalker came closer once more showing us its bestial notquitehuman form it stopped in front of us maybe ten feet away then quite casually it lifted one of the unconscious vampires hands to its fanged mouth and never looking away from lara calmly nipped off a finger and swallowed it lara narrowed her eyes and her rich mouth split into a wide hungry smile did you need a break before we continue the skinwalker spoke its voice weirdly modulated as if several different creatures were approximating speech at the same time break with the word it calmly snapped the vampire girls left arm in midhumerus hells bells i am going to kill you lara said calmly the skinwalker laughed it was a hideous sound little phage even here at the center of your power you could not stop me your warriors lay slain your fellow phages are fallen even the foolish pretenders to power visiting your house could not stop me id gotten enough of my head back together to push myself to my feet lara never looked at me but i could sense her attention on me nonetheless i didnt have time to gather my will for a magical strike the skinwalker would feel me doing it long before it became a fact fortunately i plan for such contingencies the eight silver rings i wore one on each of my fingers served a couple of purposes the triple bands of silver were moderately heavy and if i had to slug someone they made a passably good imitation of brass knuckles but their main purpose was to store back a little kinetic energy every time i moved one of my arms it took a while to build up a charge but when they were ready to go i could release the force stored in each ring with instant precision a blast from a single band of a ring could knock a big man off his feet and take the fight out of him in the process there were three bands to each ringwhich meant that i had a dozen times that much force ready to go on each hand i didnt bother to say anything to lara i just lifted my right fist and triggered every ring on it unleashing a pile driver of kinetic energy at the skinwalker lara bounded forward at the same instant swords spinning ready to lay into the skinwalker when my strike threw it off balance and distracted it but the skinwalker lifted its left hand fingers crooked into a familiar defensive gesture and the wave of force that should have knocked it tail over teakettle bounced back from it like light from a mirrorand struck lara fullon instead lara let out a startled whuffas the equivalent force of a speeding car slammed into her knocked her back and flattened her against the mound of rubble still filling the hallway behind me the skinwalkers mouth split into a leering smile of its own and its bestial voice purred break little phage break lara gasped and lifted herself up with her arms her white eyes were fixed on the skinwalker her lips twisted into a defiant snarl i stood there staring at the skinwalker it was hard and i had to use the wall to help me balance then i took a deep breath and stepped away from the wall moving very carefully until i stood between the skinwalker and lara i turned to face it squarely okay i said lets have it have what pretender the skinwalker growled you arent here to kill us i said you could have done it by now oh so true it murmured its eyes dancing with malicious pleasure you dont have to gloat about it prick i muttered under my breath then i addressed the skinwalker again you must want to talk so why dont you just say what you came to say the skinwalker studied me and idly nipped another finger from the unconscious vampire girl it chewed slowly with some truly unsettling snapping popping sounds and then swallowed you will trade with me i frowned trade the skinwalker smiled again and tugged something from around its neck with one talon then it caught the object and tossed it to me i caught it it was a silver pentacle necklace a twin to my own if considerably less battered and worn it was thomass necklace my belly went cold trade the skinwalker said thomas of raith for the doomed warrior i eyed the thing so it wanted morgan too suppose i tell you to fuck off i will no longer be in a playful mood it purred i will come for you i will kill you i will kill your blood your friends your beasts i will kill the flowers in your home and the trees in your tiny fields i will visit such death upon whatever is yours that your very name will be remembered only in curses and tales of terror i believed the creature no reflexive comeback quip sprang from my lips given what id seen of the skinwalkers power i had to give that one a fivestar rating on the threatometer and to encourage you its gaze shifted to lara if the wizard does not obey i will unmake you as well i will do it every bit as easily as i have done today and it will bring me intense pleasure to do so lara stared at the skinwalker with pure white eyes her expression locked into a snarl of hate do you understand me little phage you and that rotting bag of flesh youve attached yourself to i understand lara spat the skinwalkers smile widened for an instant if the doomed warrior is not delivered to me by sundown tomorrow i will begin my hunt it might take more time than that i said for your sake pretender pray it does not it idly flung the unconscious vampire away from it to land in a heap atop the other sister you may reach me through his speaking devices the skinwalker said then it leapt lightly up through one of the holes in the ceiling and was gone i slumped against the wall almost falling thomas i whispered that nightmare had my brother chapter twentyseven lara took charge of the aftermath a dozen security guards were dead another dozen maimed and crippled the walls in the hallway where the guards had sprung their ambush were so covered in blood that it looked like they had been painted red at least a dozen more personnel hadnt been able to reach the battle before it was over it had all happened so swiftlywhich meant that there was someone available to help stabilize the wounded and clean up the bodies the skinwalkers hex had effectively destroyed every radio and cell phone in the château but the land lines based on much older simpler technology were still up lara called in a small army of other employees including the medical staff that the raiths kept on retainer i sat with my back against the wall while all this happened a little apart from the activity it seemed appropriate my head hurt when scratching an itch i noticed that there was a wide stripe of mostly dried blood covering my left ear and spreading down my neck must have been a scalp wound they bleed like crazy after some indeterminately fuzzy length of time i looked up to see lara supervising the movement of her two wounded relatives the two vampires were liberally smeared with their own blood and both were senseless when they were carried off in stretchers the medics began helping wounded security guards and lara walked over to me she knelt down in front of me her pale grey eyes concealing whatever thought was behind them can you stand wizard can i said dont want to she lifted her chin slightly and looked down at me one hand on her hip what have you gotten my little brother involved in wish i knew i said im still trying to figure out where the bullets are coming from she folded her arms the doomed warrior the skinwalker meant the fugitive warden i presume its one way to interpret that lara studied me intently and suddenly smiled showing neat white teeth you have him he came to you for help why the hell would you think that i asked because people in hopeless situations come to you for help on a regular basis and you help them its what you do she tapped her chin with one finger now to decide what is more advantageous to play along with the skinwalkers demands or to write thomas off as a loss take the warden from you and turn him into fresh political capital for those who are hunting him there is a rather substantial reward for his capture or death i eyed her dully youre going to play along youre hoping that youll be able to act reluctant and get some concessions from me in exchange for your cooperation but youre going to give it to me anyway and why should i do that lara asked because after the coup attempt in the deeps thomas is a white court celebrity if you let some big bad shagnasty come along and kill him after it openly defies you in your own home you look weak we both know you cant live with that and by giving in to his demands i avoid the appearance of weakness she asked skeptically no dresden damn right no i said youre going to play along set shagnasty up and then take him out in the true treacherous tradition of the white court you get thomas back you lay low a heavyweight you gain status among your own folk she narrowed her eyes at me her expression giving me no hint to the direction of her thoughts then she said and when that is done what if i should take the warden and turn him over to the white council myself it would be a formidable bargaining chip to bring to the table with your folk in the future sure it would but you wont do that wont i lara asked whats stopping me i am i always enjoy dealing with a man possessing a welldeveloped sense of selfworth it was my turn to show my teeth in a smile slugging matches arent your style lara if you play this situation right it will further your reputation and influence why jeopardize that by throwing down with me mmmm she said her eyes wandering over me she idly smoothed her skirt with one hand instantly drawing my eyes to the pale length of thigh showing through the torn seam trickles of blood from her wounds slithered lovingly over smooth flesh i wonder occasionally what it might be like to throw down with you dresden to go to the mat i wonder what might happen i licked my lips and jerked my eyes away with an effort incapable of speech do you know how to really control someone harry she asked her voice a low purr i cleared my throat and rasped how her pale grey eyes were huge and deep give them what they want give them what they need give them what no one else can give if you can do that theyll come back to you again and again she leaned down close and whispered in my ear i know what i can give you harry shall i tell you i swallowed and nodded not daring to look at her surcease she breathed into my ear i can make it stop hurting wizard i can take away the pains of the body of the mind of the heart for a little time i could give you something no one else canfreedom from your burdens of responsibility and conscience she leaned even closer until i could feel the coolness of the air around her lips sweet dresden i could give you peace imagine closing your eyes with no worries no pain no fears no regrets no appetites and no guilt only quiet and darkness and stillness and my flesh against yours i shivered i couldnt stop myself i can give you that lara said her lips slinking into a smile you wear your pain like a suit of armor but one day it will be too heavy to bear and youll remember this moment and youll know who can give you what you need she let out a small sensual sigh i dont require more food dresden i have that in plenty but a partner you and i could do much together that we could not alone sounds swell i croaked barely able to get the words out maybe well start with getting thomas back she straightened her spine and leaned back from me her beautiful pale face full of lust and hunger she closed her eyes and stretched a little in place the way cats sometimes will it was a mindnumbing display of lithe femininity she nodded slowly then rose and regarded me with her usual cool detachment youre right of course business first you want me to help you i want you to help yourself i said weve both got the same problem and that would be she asked traitors within the organization i said inciting conflict and destabilizing the balance of power she arched a raven black eyebrow the warden is innocent only if i can find the guy who set him up you think theres a connection between your traitor and the skinwalker and another connection that led me here i said one of your folk paid that lawyer and rewired her head laras mouth twisted with distaste if thats true then someone was hideously gauche one never leaves such obvious and overt blocks behindand especially not in a contact only one layer removed such things call too much attention to themselves so i said a white court vampire who is gauche overt impatient oh and who did not show up to defend the homestead when the skinwalker broke in and who thomas recently beat and humiliated in public madeline lara murmured madeline i said i think whoever is pulling the strings on this operation is using her i think we need to find her and follow the strings back to the puppeteer how i reached into my duster pocket and took out the sheet of paper with morgans supposed account on it along with a photocopy of the huge deposit check find out who set up this account find out where the money came from i passed her the pages after that see if you cant find some way to track down where thomass cell phone is his cell phone shagnasty said we could contact him by calling thomass phones isnt there some way that they can track where those things are it depends on a number of factors well im betting the skinwalker doesnt have a subscription to popular science hell probably have some kind of countermeasure for a tracking spell but he might not even realize that its possible to physically trace the phone ill see what i can find out she said one of the medics approached us and stood back respectfully lara turned to the young man yes he held up a clipboard the triage report you wanted she held out her hand he passed her the clipboard as if he didnt want to move his feet too close to her lara scanned over the topmost page and murmured hennesy and callo both have broken backs itll take an xray to confirm it the medic said nervously but from what i was told the uh the attacker just broke them over his knee and threw them down theyre paralyzed probably permanently and wilson lost both eyes lara murmured the medic avoided looking at her yes maam very well lara said take hennesy to natalias chambers callo will go to elisa yes maam should i send wilson to the infirmary lara stared at him with absolutely no expression on her lovely face then she said no andrew ill come for him in a moment she held out the clipboard and the medic took it and hurried away i watched lara for a moment and said youre going to kill those men when elisa and natalia wake up they will feed and their lives will be spared annoying as it may be to lose what i invested in those men i can replace hired guns she said i cannot so easily replace members of my family and my house as their leader it is my responsibility to provide adequate care and sustenance in times of needparticularly when loyalty to the house is what created that need theyre your own men i said that was before they became useless to the house she replied they know too much of our internal affairs to be allowed to leave lives must be lost if my kin are to survive their injuries rather than inflict that upon one who can still be of use to us i preserve lives by seeing to it that these men serve us one last time yeah youre a real humanitarian a regular mother teresa she turned that flat empty gaze to me again at what point did you forget that i am a vampire dresden a monster a habitually neat polite civil and efficient monster her eyes drifted down the hallway to where a wellmuscled young man was being helped to sit down while a medic secured bandages over his eyes lara stared intently at him the color of her eyes lightening to silver and her lips parted slightly i am what i am i felt sick to my stomach i pushed myself to my feet and said so am i she glanced obliquely at me is that a threat dresden i shook my head just a fact one day im going to take you down her eyes went back to the wounded man her lips shifting to one side in a smirk one day she murmured but not today no not today is there anything else i can do for you wizard mine yeah i said she glanced at me and raised an eyebrow i need a car chapter twentyeight i sort of shambled up one floor and down a wing to the châteaus infirmary escorted there by a guard who was being very careful not to limp on a wounded leg the skinwalker had smacked my bean against hardwood and knocked something loose i felt fairly confident that if i jumped up and down and wiggled my head my brain would slosh squishily around the inside of my skull not that i was going to be doing any of those things walking was hard enough in the infirmary i found a whitecoated young woman tending to the wounded she moved with the brisk professional manner of a doctor and was just finishing seeing to justines injuries the young woman was laid out on a bed her midsection swathed in bandages her eyes glazed with the distant peaceful expression of someone on good drugs anastasia sat on the bed next to justines her back straight her expression calm her right arm was bound up close against her body in a black cloth sling she came to her feet as i entered the room she looked a little pale and shaky but she stood without leaning on her slender wooden staff were leaving now yeah i said i moved to her side to support her you okay to walk she leaned her staff toward me stopping me from coming any closer though she smiled slightly as she did ill bloody well walk out of here she said and she said it in an atrocious scottish accent i lifted both eyebrows at her in shock you told me you fell asleep during highlander her dark eyes sparkled i always say that when i find myself at a vintage movie showing at a drivein theater while in the company of a man two centuries younger than me and not because you didnt want to hurt my feelings with your professional opinion of the swordsmanship on display young men can be so delicate she said her dimples making a brief appearance we should get you to a hospital i said nodding at her sling she shook her head the break is set back in place already from here all one can do is wear a sling and wait for it to stop hurting so badly i grimaced ive got some meds at my place she smiled again but this time i could see how much she was straining to keep up appearances that would be lovely harry said a soft voice i turned to face the wounded justine who looked at me with drowsy eyes i turned to the bed and bent down to smile at her hey there we heard that thing talking she said all the hard consonants in her words had blurred rounded edges we heard it talking to you and lara i glanced up at anastasia who gave me a short nod of her head yeah i said to justine i desperately did not want her to say anything she ought not to be saying ill take care of it justine smiled at me though she looked like she could hardly keep her eyes open i know you will he loves you you know i did not look up at anastasia uh yeah justine took my hand in one of hers her eyes reaching for mine he always worried that hed never be able to talk to you that the world he came from was so different that he wouldnt know enough about being human to relate that he wouldnt know about being a br brassplated pain in my ass i said he knows that plenty well i avoided her eyes the last thing i needed was to endure another soulgaze now justine you need to rest ill dig him up dont worry she smiled again and her eyes closed all the way youre like family to me harry you always care i bowed my head embarrassed and settled justines hands back on the bed then tugged the thin hospital blankets up over her anastasia watched me with thoughtful eyes as i did we walked back to the front of the house and past the fairly fresh plaster that might have hidden ridiculously lethal booby traps out over a front porch the size of a tennis court and down several steps to the circular drive where the car lara had lent me was waiting i stopped so suddenly that anastasia nearly walked into my back she caught her balance with a hiss of discomfort and then looked up and caught her breath oh my nearly two tons of british steel and chrome sat idling in the drive its purring engine sounded like a sewing machine the white rolls limo was an old model something right out of a pulpfiction adventure film and it was in gorgeous condition its panels shone freshly waxed and without blemish and the chrome of its grill gleamed sienna in the light of dusk over the château i walked down to peer inside the rolls the passenger seating in the back was larger than my freaking apartment or at least it looked that way the interior was all silvergrey and white leather and similarly colored woodwork polished to a glowing sheen and accented with silver the carpet on the floor of the rolls was thicker and more luxurious than a wellkept lawn wow i said quietly anastasia standing beside me breathed thats a work of bloody art wow i said quietly look at the filigree i nodded wow anastasia gave me a sidelong look and theres plenty of room in back i blinked and looked at her her expression was innocent and bland all im saying is that it is rather crowded in your apartment right now anastasia i said i felt my face getting a little warm the dimples reappeared she was just teasing me of course in her condition it would be some time before she could engage in that kind of activity what model is this she asked um i said well its a rollsroyce its i think its from before world war two its a rollsroyce silver wraith of course said laras voice from behind me at this house what else would it be i looked over my shoulder to see lara raith standing in the shadowy doorway of the house you have special needs obviously she said so i provided you with an appropriate vintage nineteen thirtynine she folded her arms rather smugly i thought and said bring it back with a full tank i tilted my head at her in a gesture that wasnt quite an affirmation and muttered as i opened the passengerside door the loan officer will have to run a check on my credit first whats this thing get about two gallons per mile anastasia slid into the car with a brief sound of discomfort i winced and held out my hands in case she fell back but she managed it without any other difficulty i shut the door and caught a glimpse of lara taking a sudden step forward she focused sharply on anastasia for a momentand then upon me laras eyes flickered several shades paler as her ripe lips parted in dawning realization a very slow smile crept over her mouth as she stared at me i turned away from her rather hurriedly got into the rolls and got it moving and i didnt look back again until the vampires house was five miles behind us anastasia let me get most of the way back to town before she looked at me and said harry hmmm i asked driving the rolls was like driving a tank it had all kinds of momentum behind it no power steering and no power brakes it was a vehicle that demanded that i pay my respects to the laws of physics and think a little bit further ahead than i otherwise might is there something you want to tell me she asked dammit i muttered she watched me with eyes much older than the face around them you were hoping i didnt hear justine yeah but i did i drove for another minute or two before asking are you sure she considered that for a moment before she said more gently are you sure theres nothing you want to tell me i have nothing to say to captain luccio i said it came out harder than i had anticipated she reached out and put her left hand on my right where it rested on the gearshift what about to anastasia she asked i felt my jaw tighten it took me a moment to make them relax and ask do you have any family yes she said technically technically the men and women i grew up with who i knew theyve been dead for generations their descendants are living all over italy in greece and there are a few in algeriabut it isnt as though they invite their greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandaunt to their christmas celebrations theyre strangers i frowned thinking that over and looked at her strangers she nodded most people arent willing to accept a radical fact like the life span of our kind harry there are some families who havemartha liberty for example lives with one of her multiplegreatgranddaughters and her children but mostly it ends badly when wizards try to stay too close to their kin she bowed her head apparently studying her sling as she spoke i look in on them every five or six years without them knowing keep an eye out for any of the children who might develop a talent but you had a real family once i said she sighed and looked out the window oh yes it was a very long time ago i remember my father a little but i was raised an orphan she winced dio harry her fingers squeezed mine you never had anyone did you and if i did find someone i said feeling my throat constricting as i spoke i would do anything necessary to protect him anything anastasia looked out the window letting out a hiss of what sounded like anger margaret you selfish bitch i blinked and looked at her and nearly got us both killed when a passing car cut me off and i almost couldnt stop the monster rolls in time you you knew my mother all the wardens knew her anastasia said quietly she was a warden anastasia was silent for a moment before shaking her head she was considered a threat to the laws of magic what does that mean it means that she made it a point to dance as close to the edge of breaking the laws as she possibly could whenever she got the chance anastasia replied it took her all of a year after she was admitted to the council to start agitating for change i had to focus on the road this was more than i had ever heard from anyone in the council about the enigmatic figure who had given me life my hands were sweating and my heart was thudding what kind of change she was furious that the laws of magic have nothing to do with right and wrong she pointed out how wizards could use their abilities to bilk people out of their money to intimidate and manipulate them to steal wealth and property from others or destroy it outright and that so long as the laws were obeyed the council would do nothing whatsoever to stop them or discourage others from following their example she wanted to reform the councils laws to embrace concepts of justice as well as limiting the specific use of magic i frowned wow what a monster she exhaled slowly can you imagine what would happen if shed had her way i wouldnt have been unjustly persecuted by the wardens for years anastasias lips firmed into a line once a body of laws describing justice was applied to the council it would only be a short step to using that body to involve the council in events happening in the outside world gosh yeah i said youre right a bunch of wizards trying to effect good in the world would be awful whose good anastasia asked calmly no one is an unjust villain in his own mind harry evenperhaps even especiallythose who are the worst of us some of the cruelest tyrants in history were motivated by noble ideals or made choices that they would call hard but necessary steps for the good of their nation were all the hero of our own story yeah it was really hard to tell who the good guys and bad guys were in world war two she rolled her eyes youve read the histories written by the victors of that war harry as someone who lived through it i can tell you that at the time of the war there was a great deal less certainty there were stories of atrocities in germany but for every one that was true there were another five or six that werent how could one have told the difference between the true stories the propaganda and simple fabrications and myths created by the people of the nations germany had attacked might have been a bit easier if thered been a wizard or three around to help i said she gave me an oblique look then by your argument you would have had the white council destroy the united states what your government has drenched its hands in innocent blood as well she replied still calm unless you think the indian tribesmen whose lands were conquered were somehow the villains of the piece i frowned over that one weve gone sort of far afield from my mother yes and no what she proposed would inevitably have drawn the council into mortal conflicts and therefore into mortal politics tell me the truthif the council today declared war upon america for its past crimes and current idiocy would you obey the order to attack hell no i said the us isnt a perfect place but its better than most people have managed to come up with and all my stuff is there she smiled faintly exactly and since the council is made up of members from all over the world it would mean that no matter where we acted we would almost certainly be faced with dissidence and desertion from those who felt their homelands wronged she shruggedand grimaced in pain before arresting the motion i myself would have issues if the council acted against any of the lands where my family has settled they may not remember me but the reverse is not true i thought about what shed said for a long moment what youre saying is that the council would have to turn on some of its own and how many times would that happen before there was no council she asked wars and feuds can live for generations even when there isnt a group of wizards involved settling the conflicts would have required even more involvement in mortal affairs you mean control i said quietly you mean the council seeking political power she gave me a knowing look one of the things that makes me respect you more than most young people is your appreciation for history precisely and for gaining control over others for gathering great power to oneself there is no better tool than black magic which is what the laws of magic cover already she nodded and so the council limits itself any wizard is free to act in whatever manner he chooses with his powerprovided he doesnt break any of the laws without resorting to black magic the amount of damage an individual can inflict on mortal society is limited as harsh an experience as it has created for you harry the laws of magic are not about justice the white council is not about justice they are about restraining power she smiled faintly and occasionally the council manages to do some good by protecting mankind from supernatural threats and thats good enough for you i asked it isnt perfect she admitted but its better than anything else weve come up with and the things ive spent my lifetime building are there touché i said thank you i stroked her fingers with my thumb so youre saying my mother was shortsighted she was a complex woman anastasia said brilliant erratic passionate committed idealistic talented charming insulting bold incautious arrogantand shortsighted yes among a great many other qualities she loved pointing out the areas of grey magic as she called them and constantly questioning their legitimacy she shrugged the senior council tasked the wardens to keep an eye on her which was damn near impossible why the woman had a great many contacts among the fey thats why everyone called her margaret lafey she knew more ways through the nevernever than anyone ive ever seen before or since she could be in beijing at breakfast rome at lunch and seattle for supper and stop for coffee in sydney and capetown in between she sighed margaret vanished once for four or five years everyone assumed that shed finally run afoul of something in faerie she never seemed able to restrain her tongue even when she knew better i wonder what thats like anastasia gave me a rather worn sad smile but she didnt spend all that time in faerie did she i looked up at the rearview mirror back toward château raith and thomas is the son of the white king himself i didnt answer she exhaled heavily you look so different from him except perhaps for something in the jaw the shape of the eyes i didnt say anything until we got to the apartment the rolls went together with the gravel lot like champagne and cracker jacks i turned the engine off and listened to it click as it began to cool down the sun was gone over the horizon by that time and the lengthening shadows began to trigger streetlights are you going to tell anyone i asked quietly she looked out the window as she considered the question then she said not unless i think it relevant i turned to look at her you know what will happen if they know theyll use him she gazed straight out the front of the car i know i spoke quietly to put all the weight i could into each word i spoke next over my dead body anastasia closed her eyes for a moment and opened them again her expression never flickered she took her hand slowly reluctantly from mine and put it in her lap then she whispered i pray to god it never comes to that we sat in the car separately it seemed larger and colder for some reason the silence seemed deeper luccio lifted her chin and looked at me what will you do now what do you think i clenched my fists so that my knuckles popped rolled my neck once and opened the door im going to find my brother chapter twentynine two hours and half a dozen attempted tracking spells later i snarled and slapped a stack of notepads off the corner of the table in my subbasement laboratory they thwacked against the wall beneath bob the skulls shelf and fell to the concrete floor it was to be expected bob the skull said very quietly orange lights like the flickers of distant campfires glittered in the eye sockets of the bleached human skull that sat on its own shelf high up on one wall of my lab bracketed by the remains of dozens of melted candles and half a dozen paperback romances the parenttochild blood bond is much more sympathetic than that shared by half siblings i glared at the skull and also kept my voice down you just cant go a day without saying that you told me so i cant help it if youre wrong all the time yet continually ignore my advice sahib im just a humble servant i couldnt scream at my nonmaterial assistant with other people in the apartment above me so i consoled myself by snatching up a pencil from a nearby work shelf and flinging it at him its eraser end hit the skull between the eyes jealousy thy name is dresden bob said with a pious sigh i paced up and down the length of my lab burning off frustrated energy it wasnt much of a walk five paces turn five paces turn it was a dank little concrete box of a room work benches lined three of the walls and i had installed cheap wire shelving above them the work benches and shelves were crowded with all manner of odds and ends books reagents instruments various bits of gear needed for alchemy and scores of books and notebooks a long table in the middle of the room was currently covered by a canvas tarp and the floor at the far end of the lab had a perfect circle of pure copper embedded in it the remains of several differently structured tracking attempts were scattered on the floor around the circle while the props and foci from the most recent failure were still inside it one of them should have gotten me something i told bob maybe not a full lock on thomass positionbut a tug in the right direction at least unless hes dead bob said in which case youre just spinning your wheels he isnt dead i said quietly shagnasty wants to trade uhhuh bob scoffed because everyone knows how honorable the naagloshii are hes alive i said quietly or at least im going to proceed on that assumption bob somehow managed to look baffled why because you need your brother to be all right whispered a quiet voice in my head because anything else isnt particularly useful toward resolving this situation i said aloud whoever is behind the curtains is using the skinwalker and probably madeline raith too so if i find thomas i find shagnasty and madeline and ill be able to start pulling threads until this entire mess unravels yeah bob said drawing out the word do you think itll take long to pull all those threads because the naagloshii is going to be doing something similar to your intestines i made a growling sound in my throat yeah i think i got its number really i keep trying to punch shagnasty out myself i said but its defenses are too goodand its fast as hell hes an immortal semidivine being bob said of course hes good i waved a hand my point is that ive been trying to lay the beating on it myself next time i see it im going to start throwing bindings on it just to trip it up and slow it down so whoever is with me can get a clean shot it might work bob admitted thank you if hes such an idiot that he only bothered to learn to defend himself from violentenergy attacks bob continued as if i hadnt spoken which i think is almost as likely as you getting one of those tracking spells to work hell know how to defend himself from bindings harry i sighed ive got gender issues bob blinked slowly uh wow id love to say something to make that more embarrassing for you boss but im not sure how not my augh i threw another pencil it missed bob and bounced off the wall behind him with the skinwalker is it actually a male do i call it a he bob rolled his eyelights its a semidivine immortal harry it doesnt procreate it has no need to recombine dna that means that gender simply doesnt apply thats something only you meat sacks worry about then why is it that you stare at naked girls every chance you get i said but not naked men its an aesthetic choice bob said loftily as a gender women exist on a plane far beyond men when it comes to the artistic appreciation of their external beauty and they have boobs i said and they have boobs bob agreed with a leer i sighed and rubbed at my temples closing my eyes you said the skinwalkers were semidivine youre using the english word which doesnt really describe them very precisely most skinwalkers are just peoplepowerful dangerous and often psychotic people but people theyre successors to the traditions and skills taught to avaricious mortals by the originals the naagloshii originals like shagnasty i said hes the real deal all right bob replied his quiet voice growing more serious according to some of the stories of the navajo the naagloshii were originally messengers for the holy people when they were first teaching humans the blessing way messengers i said like angels or like those guys on bikes in new york maybe bob said not all couriers are created identical mr lowestcommondenominator anyway the original messengers the naagloshii were supposed to go with the holy people when they departed the mortal world but some of them didnt they stayed here and their selfishness corrupted the power the holy people gave them voila shagnasty i grunted bobs information was anecdotal which meant it could well be distorted by time and by generations of retelling there probably wasnt any way to know the objective truth of itbut a surprising amount of that kind of lore remained fundamentally sound in oral tradition societies like those of the american southwest when did this happen tough to say bob said the traditional navajo dont see time the way most mortals do which makes them arguably smarter than the rest of you monkeys but its safe to assume prehistory several millennia yikes thousands of years of survival meant thousands of years of accumulated experience it meant that shagnasty was smart and adaptable the old skinwalker wouldnt still be around if it wasnt i upgraded the creature in my thoughts from very tough to damned near impossibly tough but since it still had my brother that didnt change anything dont suppose theres a silver bullet we can use i asked no boss bob said quietly sorry i grimaced did a halfassed job of cleaning up the mess id made and began to leave the lab i paused before i left and said hey bob yeah any thoughts as to why when lafortier was being murdered by a wizard no one threw any magic around people are morons its damned peculiar i said irrationality isnt bob said wizards just arent all that stable to begin with given what i had done with my life lately i could hardly argue with him it means something i said yeah bob asked what i shook my head tell you when i figure it out i went back up into my living room through the trapdoor in its floor the door was a thick one sound didnt readily travel up from the lab when it was closed luccio was loaded with narcotics and asleep on my couch lying flat on her back with no pillow and covered with a light blanket her face was slack her mouth slightly open it made her look vulnerable and even younger than she already appeared molly sat in one of the recliners with several candles burning beside her she was reading a paperback carefully not opening the thing all the way to avoid creasing the spine pansy i went to the kitchen and made myself a sandwich as i did i reflected that i was getting really tired of sandwiches maybe i ought to learn to cook or something i stood there munching and molly came to join me hey she said in muted tones how are you shed helped me bandage the fairly minor cut on my scalp when i had returned strips of white gauze bandage were wound around my head to form a lopsided offkilter halo i felt like the fife player in willards iconic spirit of still in one piece i replied how are they drugged and sleeping she said morgans fever is up another half of a degree the last bag of antibiotics is almost empty i clenched my jaw if i didnt get morgan to a hospital soon he was going to be just as dead as he would be if the council or shagnasty got hold of him should i get some ice onto him molly asked anxiously not until the fever goes over one hundred and four and stays there i said thats when it begins to endanger him until then its doing what its supposed to do and slowing the infection i finished the last bite of sandwich any calls she produced a piece of notebook paper georgia called heres where andi is theyre still with her i took the paper with a grimace if i hadnt let morgan in my door half an eternity ago he wouldnt have been in chicago shagnasty wouldnt have been tailing me to find him andi wouldnt be hurtand kirby would still be alive and i hadnt even tried to call and find out how she was how is she they still arent sure molly said i nodded okay did you find thomas i shook my head total bust mouse came shambling over he sat down and looked up at me his expression concerned she chewed on her lip what are you going to do i my voice trailed off i sighed i have no idea mouse pawed at my leg and looked up at me i bent over to scratch his ears and instantly regretted it as someone tightened a vise on my temples i straightened up again in a hurry wincing and entertained wild fantasies about lying down on the floor and sleeping for a week molly watched me her expression worried right harry youre still teaching your apprentice show her what a wizard should do not what you want to do i looked at the paper the answer isnt obvious which means that i need to put some more thought into it and while im doing that ill go look in on andi molly nodded what do i do hold down the fort try to reach me at the hospital if anyone calls or if morgan gets any worse molly nodded seriously i can do that i nodded and grabbed my gear and the key to the rolls molly went to the door ready to lock it behind me when i left i started to do just thatand then paused i turned to my apprentice hey yeah thank you she blinked at me um what did i do more than i asked of you more than was good for you i leaned over and kissed her on the cheek thank you molly she lifted her chin a little smiling well she said youre just so pathetic how could i turn away that made me laugh if only for a second and her smile blossomed into something radiant you know the drill i said she nodded keep my eyes open be supercareful dont take any chances i winked at her you grow wiser grasshopper molly started to say something stopped fidgeted for half a second and then threw her arms around me in a big hug be careful she said okay i hugged her back tight and gave the top of her head a light kiss hang in there kid well get this straightened out okay she said we will then i headed out into the chicago night wondering howor ifthat was possible chapter thirty i dont like hospitalsbut then who does i dont like the clean cool hallways i dont like the stark fluorescent lights i dont like the calm ring tones on the telephones i dont like the pastel scrubs the nurses and attendants wear i dont like the elevators and i dont like the soothing colors on the walls and i dont like the way everyone speaks in measured quiet voices but mostly i dont like the memories ive collected there andi was still in intensive care i wouldnt be able to go in to see herneither would billy and georgia if they hadnt arranged for power of attorney for medical matters a few years back it was long after standard visiting hours but most hospital staffs stretch rules and look the other way for those whose loved ones are in icu the world has changed a lot over the centuries but death watches are still respected billy had come to me on the down low to set up power of attorney for me in case he should be hospitalized without georgia being nearby to handle matters though neither of us said so we both knew why he really did it the only reason georgia wouldnt be there is if she was deadand if billy was in no shape to make decisions for himself he didnt want to hang around and find out what his world would be like without her in it he wanted someone he could trust to understand that billy and georgia are solid id spent some endless hours in strogers icu waiting room and it hadnt changed since id been there last it was empty except for georgia she lay on the sofa sleeping still wearing her glasses a book by what was presumably a prominent psychologist lay open on her stomach she looked exhausted i bypassed the waiting room and went to the nurses desk a tiredlooking woman in her thirties looked up at me with a frown sir she said its well after visiting hours i know i said i took my notepad out of my pocket and scribbled a quick note on it ill go back to the waiting room the next time you go past miss macklins room could you please give this to the gentleman sitting with her the nurse relaxed a little and gave me a tired smile certainly it will just be a few minutes thanks i went back to the waiting room and settled into a chair i closed my eyes leaned my head back against the wall and drowsed until i heard footsteps on tile billy entered with a rolledup blanket under his arm glanced around the room and nodded to me then he went immediately to georgia he took her glasses off very gently and picked up the book georgia never stirred he put the book on the end table and her glasses on top of it then he took the blanket from under his arm and covered her up she murmured and stirred but billy shushed her quietly and stroked his hand over her hair she sighed and shifted onto her side then snuggled down under the blanket i reached up a hand and flicked the light switch beside my head it left the room dim if not really dark billy smiled his thanks to me and nodded toward the door i got up and we walked out into the hallway together should have tried to call you sooner i said im sorry he shook his head i know how it is man no apology needed okay i said without actually agreeing with him how is she not good he replied simply there was internal bleeding it took two rounds of surgery to get it stopped the blocky young man shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans they told us if she makes it through the night shell be out of the worst of it how are you holding up he shook his head again i dont know man i called kirbys folks i was his friend i had to the police had already contacted them but it isnt the same no it isnt they took it pretty hard kirby was an only child i sighed im sorry he shrugged kirby knew the risks hed rather have died than stand by and do nothing georgia id have lost it without her pillar of strength and calm billy said he glanced back toward the waiting room and a smile touched the corners of his eyes shes good at setting things aside until theres time to deal with them once things have settled out shell be a wreck and itll be my turn to hold her up like i said solid the thing that did kirby took thomas raith i said the vampire you work with sometimes yeah as soon as i work out how to find it im taking it down the vampires are probably going to helpbut i might need backup i can trust billys eyes flickered with a sudden fire of rage and hunger yeah i nodded its part of something bigger i cant talk to you about everything thats going on and i know andi needs you here i understand if you dont billy turned his eyes to me those same dangerous fires smoldering harry im not going to move forward blind anymore what do you mean i mean that for years ive been willing to help you even though you could barely ever tell me what was actually happening youve played everything close to the chest and i know you had your reasons for that he stopped walking and looked up at me calmly kirbys dead maybe andi too my conscience wouldnt let me meet his gaze even for an instant i know he nodded so if id had this conversation with you sooner maybe they wouldnt be maybe if wed had a better idea about whats actually going on in the world it would have changed how we approached things they follow my lead harry i have a responsibility to make sure that i do everything in my power to make them aware and safe yeah i said i can see your point then if you want my help things are going to change im not charging ahead blindfolded again not ever billy i said quietly this isnt stuff you can unlearn right now youre insulated from the worst of what goes on because youre i dont want to be insulting but youre a bunch of amateurs without enough of a clue to be a real threat to anyone his eyes darkened insulated from the worst he asked in a quiet dangerous voice tell that to kirby tell that to andi i took several steps away pinched the bridge of my nose between thumb and forefinger and closed my eyes thinking billy had a point of course id been careful to control what information he and the alphas had gotten from me in an effort to protect them and it had workedfor a while but now things were different kirbys death had seen to that youre sure you dont want to back out i asked once youre part of the scene you arent getting out of it i clenched my jaw for a second and believe it or not billy yes youhave been insulated from the worst im not backing off on this one harry i cant out of the corner of my eye i saw him fold his arms youre the one who wants our help i pointed a finger at him i dont want it i dont want to drag you into whats going on i dont want you walking into more danger and getting hurt i sighed but theres a lot at stake and i think i might need you okay then billy said you know what it will cost he stood facing me solidly tired eyes steady and i realized something i hadnt ever made into a tangible thought before he wasnt a kid anymore not because hed graduated and not even because of how capable he was hed seen the worstdeath heartless and nasty come to lay waste to everything it could he knew in his heart of hearts beyond a shadow of a doubt that it could come for him take him as easily as it had taken kirby and he was making a choice to stand his ground billy borden kid werewolf was gone will was choosing to stand with me i couldnt treat him like a child anymore will was ignorant of the supernatural world beyond the fairly minor threats that lurked around the university of chicago he and the other werewolves had been kids who learned one really neat magic trick almost ten years before i hadnt shared more with them and the paranormal community in general is careful about what they say to strangers he had at best only a vague idea of the scope of supernatural affairs in general and he had not the first clue about how hot the water really was around me right now will had picked his ground i couldnt keep him in the dark and tell myself that i was protecting him i nodded to a few chairs sitting along the wall at a nearby intersection of hallways lets sit down i dont have much time and theres a lot to cover ill tell you everything when i get a chance but for now all i can give you is a highlights reel by the time i got done giving will the cliffsnotes version of the supernatural world i still hadnt come up with a plan so working on the theory that the proper answers just needed more time to cook and that they could do so while i was on the move i went back to my borrowed car and drove to the next place i should have visited sooner than i had murphy used to have an office at the headquarters of cpds special investigations department then shed blown off her professional duty as head of the department to cover me during a furball that went bad on an epic scale shed nearly lost her job altogether but murph was a thirdgeneration cop from a cop clan shed managed to gain enough support to hang on to her badge but she had been demoted to detective sergeant and had her seniority revokeda dead end for her career now her old office was occupied by john stallings and murphy had a desk in the large room that housed si it wasnt a new desk either one leg was propped up with a small stack of triplicate report forms it wasnt unusual in that room si was the bottom of the chute for cops who had earned the wrath of their superiors or worse had taken a misstep in the cutthroat world of chicago city politics the desks were all battered and old the walls and floor were worn the room obviously housed at least twice as many work desks as it had been meant to contain it was late the place was quiet and mostly empty whoever was on the night shift must have been out on a call of some kind of the three cops in the room i only knew one of them by namemurphys current partner a blocky mildly overweight man in his late fifties with hair going steadily more silver in sharp contrast to the dark coffee tone of his skin rawlins i said he turned to me with a grunt and a polite nod evening what are you doing here this late giving my wife ammunition for when she drags my ass to court to divorce me he said cheerfully glad you made it in murph around i asked he grunted interrogation room two with the british perp go on down thanks man i went down the hall and around the corner to my left was a security gate blocking the way to the buildings holding cells to the right was a short hallway containing four doorstwo to the bathrooms and two that led to the interrogation rooms i went to the second room and knocked murphy answered it still wearing the same clothes shed been in at the storage park she looked tired and irritated she grunted almost as well as rawlins had despite her complete lack of a ychromosome and stepped out into the hall shutting the door behind her she looked up and studied my head for a second what the hell harry got a visit from shagnasty the skinwalker when i went to talk to lara raith any trouble with binder she shook her head i figured hed have a hard time doing whatever he does if he cant get out of his chair or use his hands ive been sitting with him too in case he tried to pull something i lifted an eyebrow impressed there hadnt been time to advise her how to handle binder safely but shed worked it out on her own yeah thats a pretty solid method i said whats he in for officially officially i havent charged him yet she said if i need to stick him with something i can cite trespassing destruction of property and assault on a police officer she shook her head but we cant keep this close an eye on him forever if i do press charges it wont be long before hes under lighter security i dont even want to think about what could happen if he got to turn those things loose inside a precinct house or prison yeah i said nodding long term i dont think you can hold him her mouth twisted bitterly hate it when i have to let pricks like that walk happen much all the time she said legal loopholes incorrect procedures crucial evidence declared inadmissible a lot of perps who are guilty as hell walk out without so much as a reprimand she sighed and twitched her shoulders into something like a shrug ah well its a messedup world whatcha gonna do i hear that i said want to compare notes sure she said what did you get i gave her the rundown of what had happened since id last seen her she grunted again when i finished isnt that sort of dangerous involving the vampires yeah i said but its thomas i think lara is probably sincere about getting him back besides why worry about smoking in bed when your building is already on fire point she said i got the photos they dont tell me anything new i ran those account numbers you gave me through the system to see if anything came up brick wall dammit it was a long shot anyway she said binder give you anything her mouth scrunched up as if she wanted to spit out something that tasted terrible no hes a hard case career criminal hes been grilled before yeah i said and he knows that you cant do anything but make him sit still for a little while if he gives us anything on his employer hell lose his credibility with clientsassuming that he lives that long she leaned her shoulders back against the wall you say this shagnasty thing has thomass cell phone yeah think you can track it as part of what investigation she asked i dont have the kind of freedom to act that i used to if i wanted to get what amounts to a wiretap id have to get approval from a judge and i dont know any of them who would take my friend the wizards vampire brother was kidnapped by a demonic navajo shapeshifter as a valid justification for such a measure i hadnt really thought of it like that i said she shrugged honestly i suspect laras resources and contacts are better than mine given the time constraints i couldnt quite suppress a growl of frustration if she learns anything if shes honest about what she learns murphy frowned scrunching up her nose where was thomas taken from im not certain but i think he was at the storage park his rental van was there and he said something about not being able to handle all of them on his own them the grey suits i nodded most likely but since thomas never pitched in during the fight i figure shagnasty probably snuck up on him and grabbed him while he was being distracted by binder and his pets and you cant track him down with magic no i growled through clenched teeth shagnasty is countering it somehow how is that possible i took a moment to assemble my thoughts tracking spells are like any kind of targeted thaumaturgy you create a link a channel to the target and then pour energy into that channel in the case of a tracking spell youre basically just setting up a continuous trickle of energy and then following it to the targetkind of like pouring water on a surface when you want to see which way is downhill okay she said i get that mostly the way to stymie a tracking spell is to prevent that channel from ever being formed if it never gets created then it doesnt matter when the water gets poured theres nothing to cause it to start flowing and the way you prevent the channel from forming is to shield the target away from whatever focus youre using to create the link like what well for example if i had one of your hairs and wanted to use it as part of a tracking spell you might beat it by shaving off your hair if the hair in my spell doesnt match up to an end somewhere on your head no link gets created so unless i had a hair that had been torn out from the roots and fairly recently youd be hidden and thats the only way to beat a tracking spell nah i said a good circle of power could probably screen you off if you took the time and money to give it serious juice theoretically you could also cross into the nevernever thaumaturgy originating on the earth doesnt cross into the spirit world very efficientlyand before you ask yeah i tried it from the nevernever side too it was failed spell number three murphy frowned what about justine she asked justine was able to find him once before i grimaced she was able to give us a vague direction a few hours after thomas had ripped most of the life out of her it isnt the same this time why not because she wasnt sensing thomas so much as the missing part of her own life force they havent been together like that in years thomasdigested i guess you could sayall of that energy a long time ago murphy sighed ive seen you do some neat stuff harry but i guess magic doesnt fix everything magic doesnt fix anything i said thats what the person using it is for i rubbed at my tired eyes speaking of she said any thoughts as to why these wizards didnt seem to be using magic not yet i said any thoughts as to the nature of our perpetrator a couple i said there are all these disparate elements in playshagnasty binder madeline raith there is serious money moving around and if we dont find this cockroach and drag him into the light things are going to be bad for everyone i dont know what that tells us about him that hes really smart murphy said or really desperate i arched an eyebrow how do you figure if hes superbrilliant its possible that we havent even seen the shape of his plan yet all of this could be one big boondoggle to set us up for the real punch you dont sound like you think thats the case she gave me a faint smile criminals arent usually the crispiest crackers in the box and you have to remember that even though were flailing around looking for answers the perp is in the same situation he cant be sure where we are what we know or what were doing next fog of war i said thoughtfully she shrugged i think its a much more likely explanation than that our perp is some kind of james bond supergenius villain slowly unfolding his terrible design theyve shown too much confusion for that like what shagnasty was following you a couple of nights ago right yeah well so was this pi you told me about why stick you with two tails maybe because the right hand didnt know what the left one was doing hngh i agreed from what you say shagnasty isnt exactly an errand boy no it isnt but its apparently coordinating with the perp taking orders it didnt absolutely need to deliver its demand in person i think its pretty obvious that it smashed its way into the château to provide a distraction so that madeline could make her getaway i blinked once id alerted lara to the probability of madelines treachery she most certainly would have taken steps to detain her madeline must have known that i tried to remember how long it had been between the time luccio and i arrived and when the naagloshii attacked time enough for madeline to hear about our presence assume that the worst had happened and make a phone call for help maybe murphy peered at me i mean it is obvious right i got hit on the head okay she smirked at me hells bells i muttered yes its obvious but not necessarily stupid not stupid but i dont think it would be unfair to call it a desperation move i think shagnasty was the perps ace in the hole i think that when morgan escaped the perp figured out where he was headed the pressure got to him and he played his hole card only when shagnasty found you you werent actually with morgan he got spooked when you and the werewolves nearly pinned him down and ran off the perp grabs one of his other tools i said nodding madeline tells her to find me and take me out make me talk whatever only thomas beats her senseless instead makes sense murphy said doesnt mean thats how it happened had to happen some way she said say were in the right ballpark what does that tell us not much i said some very bad people are in motion theyre tough the one guy weve managed to grab wont tell us a damned thing the only thing were certain we know is that weve got nothing i was going to continue but a thought hit me and i stopped talking i gave it a second to crystallize then i started to smile murphy tilted her head watching and prompted weve got nothing i looked from murphy to the door to the interrogation room forget it she said he isnt going to put us on to anyone oh i drawled im not so sure about that chapter thirtyone murphy went back into the interrogation room twenty minutes later i came in and shut the door behind me the room was simple and small i a table sat in the middle with two chairs on each side there was no long twoway mirror on the wall instead a small security camera perched up high in one corner of the ceiling binder sat on the far side of the table his face had a couple of bruises on it along with an assortment of small cuts with dark scabs his odd green eyes were narrowed in annoyance a footlong hoagie sat on the table in front of him its paper wrapper partially undone hed have been able to reach it easilyif he could have moved his arms they were cuffed to the arms of the chair a handcuff key rested centered on the edge of murphys side of the table in front of her chair i had to suppress a smile bloody priceless binder said to murphy as i entered now you bring this wanker its police torture is what it is my solicitor will swallow you whole and spit out the bones murphy sat down at the table across from binder folded her hands and sat in complete silence spearing him with an unfriendly stare binder sneered at her and then at me presumably so i wouldnt feel left out oh i get this now he said good cop bad cop is it he looked at me stonecold bitch here makes me sit for bloody hours in this chair to soften me up then you come in here polite and sympathetic as you please and i buckle under the stress yeah he settled more comfortably into the chair somehow conveying an insult with the motion fine dresden he said knock yourself out good cop me i looked at him for a second then i made a fist and slugged his smug face hard enough to knock him over backward in the chair he just lay there for a minute on his side blinking tears out of his eyes blood trickled from one nostril one of his shoes had come off in the fall i stood over him and glanced at my hand it hurts to punch people in the face not as much as it hurts to get punched in the face granted but you know youve done it my knuckles must have grazed his teeth theyd lost a little skin dont give me this lawyer crap binder i said we both know the cops cant hold you for long but we also both know that you cant play the system against us either you arent an upstanding member of the community youre a hired gun wanted for questioning in a dozen countries he looked up at me with a snarl think youre a hard man do you i glanced at murphy should i answer that one or just kick him in the balls seeing is believing murphy said true i turned to binder and drew back my foot bloody hell binder barked theres a bloody camera watching your every move you think you wont get dragged off for this an intercom on the wall near the camera clicked and buzzed hes got a point said rawlins voice i cant see it all from here move him a couple of feet to the left and give me about thirty more seconds before you start on his nads im making popcorn sure i said giving the camera a thumbsup odds were good that it would fold if i was in the room for any length of time but wed made our point i sat down on the edge of the table maybe a foot away from binder and quite deliberately reached over to pick up the hoagie i took a bite and chewed thoughtfully mmm i said i glanced at murphy what kind of cheese is that gouda beef tastes great too teriyaki murph said still staring at binder i was really hungry i told her my voice brimming with sincerity i havent eaten since like this morning this is excellent binder muttered darkly under his breath all i caught was buggering little bastard i ate half the hoagie and put it back on the table i licked a stray bit of sauce off of one finger and looked down at binder okay tough guy i said the cops cant keep you so that leaves the sergeant here with only a couple of options either they let you walk murphy made a quiet growling sound it was almost as impressive as her grunt she just hates that idea i got off the table and hunkered down beside binder or i said we do it the other way he narrowed his eyes youll kill meis that it aint no one gonna miss you i said youre bluffing binder snapped shes a bloody cop yeah i said think about that one for a minute you think a police detective couldnt work out a way to disappear you without anyone being the wiser he looked back and forth between us his cool mask not quite faltering what do you want your boss i said give me that and you walk he stared at me for half a minute then he said set my chair up i rolled my eyes and did it he was heavy hells bells binder i get a hernia and the deals off he looked at murphy and jiggled his wrists murphy yawned bloody hell he snarled just one of them i havent eaten since yesterday i snorted looks to me like you arent in any immediate danger of starvation you want cooperation he spat youre going to have to show me some give me the bloody sandwich murphy reached out picked up the handcuff key and tossed it to me i unlocked his left wrist binder seized the sandwich and started chomping on it all right i said after a moment talk what he said through a mouthful of food no soda i swatted the last inch or two of hoagie out of his hand scowling binder watched me unperturbed he licked his fingers clean picked a bit of lettuce out of his teeth and ate it all right then he said you want the truth yeah i said he leaned a bit toward me and jabbed a finger at me the truth is that you aint killing no one biggun you aint and neither is the blond bird and if you try to keep me ill bring down all manner of horrible things he leaned back in his chair openly wearing the smug smile again so you might as well stop wasting my valuable time and cut me loose thats the truth i turned my head to murphy frowning she got up walked around the table and seized binder by his closecut head it didnt provide much of a grip but she used it to shove his head roughly down to the top of the table then she took the key back from me undid the other set of cuffs and released him get out she said quietly binder stood up slowly straightening his clothes he leered at murphy winked and said im a professional so theres nothing personal love maybe next time we can skip business and give pleasure a go maybe next time youll get your neck broken resisting arrest murphy said get out binder smirked at murphy then at me and then sauntered out of the room well i asked her she turned and held out her hand several short hairs some dark and some grey clung to her fingers got it i grinned at her and took the hairs depositing them in a white envelope id taken from rawlins desk give me about a minute and ill have it up hubba hubba rawlins said through the intercom speaker i like this channel this is a great way of chasing down the bad guy murphy said half an hour later she gave me a pointed look from her chair at her desk sit here and dont do anything i sat in a chair next to her desk my hand extended palm down in front of me holding a bit of leather thong that ended in a simple quartz crystal in a copperwire setting my arm was getting tired and i had gripped it under my forearm with the other hand to support it the crystal didnt hang like a plumb line it leaned a bit to one side as if being supported by a steady silent puff of wind patience i said binder might not be a crispy cracker but hes been in business for a couple of decades he knows why you grabbed him by the hair hes learned to shake off something like this murphy gave me an unamused look she glanced at rawlins who sat at his desk the desks were set up backtoback so that they faced each other dont look at me he said without glancing up from his sudoku puzzle i dont run as fast as i used to i could get used to chasing down bad guys like this the crystal abruptly dropped and began swinging back and forth freely ah i said there there you see i let them look for a second and then lowered my arm i rubbed my sore muscles for a moment what did i tell you he shook it off oh good murphy said now we have no clue where he is i put the crystal into my pocket and grabbed murphys desk phone yet i said i punched in a number and found out that you had to dial nine to get out i started over added a nine to the beginning of the number and it rang graver vince said its dresden i said tell me what he just did like thirty seconds ago be patient vince said and hung up on me i blinked at the phone murphy looked at me for a second and then smiled i just love it when i dont know part of the plan and the guy who does is all smug and cryptic she said dont you i glowered at her and put the phone down hell call back he who the pi who is following binder i said guy named vince graver murphys eyebrows went up youre kidding rawlins began to chortle still working on his puzzle what i said looking back and forth between them he was a vice cop in joliet a couple of years ago murphy said he found out that someone was beating up some of the call girls down there he looked into it word came down to tell him to back off but he went and caught a chicago city councilman who liked to pound on his women for foreplay whatshisname dornan rawlins supplied right ricardo dornan murphy said huh i said took some guts hell yeah rawlins said and some stupid its a fine line murphy said anyway he pissed off some people next thing he knows he finds out he volunteered for a transfer to cpd three guesses where rawlins said so he resigns murphy said yeah rawlins said without even giving us a chance to meet him murphy shook her head went into private practice theres a guy who is a glutton for punishment rawlins grinned he drives a mercedes i said has his own house too rawlins put his pencil down and they both looked up at me i shrugged im just saying he must be doing all right for himself hngh rawlins said then he picked up his pencil and went back to the puzzle aint no justice murphy grunted with nighmasculine skill a couple of minutes later the phone rang and murphy answered it she passed it to me your guys a nut vince said i know that i told him whats he doing took a cab to a motel on the highway north of town vince said stopped at a convenience store on the way then he goes to his room shaves himself bald comes out in his skivvies and jumps in the damn river goes back inside takes a shower how do you know that i asked i broke into his room while he was doing it vince said maybe you could save your questions until the end of the presentation hard to imagine you not fitting in with the cops i said vince ignored the comment he takes a shower and calls another cab tell me you followed the cab i said tell me your check cleared im good for it yeah im following the cab right now vince said but i dont need to hes headed for the hotel sax who are you the amazing kreskin listened in on the cabbies cb he said eta eighteen minutes eighteen i asked usually found between seventeen and nineteen he said i cant guarantee i can stay on him at the hotel especially if he tumbles to the tail too many ways out ill take it from there do not get close to him man you get an instinct hes looking in your direction run for the hills this guys dangerous yeah vince said hell im lucky i havent wet my pants already im serious i know you are its cute seventeen minutes ill be there with my check ive got a twoday minimum you know that right right right i said ill be there what have we got murphy asked as i put the phone down binder thinks he shook me i said hes headed for a meeting at hotel sax she stood up and grabbed her car keys how do you know its a meeting because hes been made if he was here alone hed be on his way out of town right now i nodded hes running back to whoever hired him who is that murphy asked lets find out chapter thirtytwo the hotel sax is a pretty good example of its kind in the beating heart of downtown chicago its located on dearborn just across the street from the house of blues and if you look up while standing outside of the place it looks like someone slapped one of those fisheye camera lenses on the sky buildings stretch up and up and up at angles that seem geometrically impossible many similar sections of chicago have wider streets than you find in other metropolises and it makes them feel slightly less claustrophobic but outside of the sax the street was barely three narrow lanes across curb to curb as murphy and i approached looking up made me feel like an ant walking along the bottom of a crack in the sidewalk it bugs you doesnt it murphy said we walked under a streetlight our shadows briefly equal in length what those big things looming over you i wouldnt say it bothers me i said im just aware of them she faced serenely ahead as we walked welcome to my life i glanced down at her and snorted quietly we entered the lobby of the hotel a place with a lot of glass and white paint with rich red accents given how late it was it was no surprise only one member of the staff was visible a young woman who stood behind one of the glassfronted checkin counters one guest reading a magazine sat in a nearby chair and even though he was the only guy in the room it took me a second glance to realize that he was vince vince set the magazine aside and ambled over to us his unremarkable brown eyes scanned over murphy he nodded to her and offered me his hand i shook it and offered a check to him with my left as we did he took it glanced at it noncommittally and put it away in a pocket he took an elevator to the twelfth floor vince said hes in room twelve thirtythree i blinked at him how the hell did you get that ride up with him good way for me to get hurt i stayed down here he shrugged you said he was trouble he is howd you do it he gave me a bland look im good at this you need to know which chair hes in too no thats close enough i said vince looked at murphy again frowned and then frowned at me jesus he said you two look pretty serious yeah i said i told you this guys dangerous he have anyone with him one person he said a woman i think murphy suddenly smiled how the hell do you know that i asked him room service she said vince smiled in faint approval at murphy and nodded his head could have been someone else on twelve who ordered champagne and two glasses two minutes after he got off the elevator but this late at night i doubt it vince glanced at me ill take the bill i duked the steward out of my fee appreciated i said he shrugged that it yeah thanks vince as long as the check clears he said youre welcome he nodded to me to murphy and walked out of the hotel murphy eyed me after vince left and smiled the mighty harry dresden subcontracting detective work theyre expecting me to be all magicky and stuff i said and i gave them what they expected to see binder wouldnt have been looking for someone like vince youre just annoyed because they pulled that trick on you murphy said and youre taking your vengeance i sniffed i like to think of it as symmetry that does make it sound nobler she said we obviously cant just go up there and haul them off somewhere for questioning whats the plan get more information i said im gonna listen in and see what theyre chatting about murphy nodded glancing around hotel security is going to have an issue with you lurking about the hallways ill go have a word with them i nodded ill be on twelve dont kick down any doors without someone to watch your back she warned me no kicking at all i said not until i know enough to kick them where its going to hurt i went up to the twelfth floor left the elevator and pulled a can of silly string out of my duster pocket i shook it up as i walked down the hallway until i found room twelve thirtythree then without preamble i blasted a bit of the silly string at the door it slithered cheerfully through the air and stuck then i turned and walked back down the hall until i found a door that opened onto a tiny room containing an ice dispenser and a couple of vending machines i sat down drew a quick circle around me on the tile floor with a dryerase marker and got to work i closed the circle with an effort of will and it sprang up around me in a sudden invisible screen it wasnt exactly a heavyduty magical construct but such a quick circle would still serve perfectly well to seal away external energies and allow me to gather my own and shape it for a specific purpose without interference i took the silly string and sprayed a bunch of it into the palm of my left hand so that it mounded up sort of like shaving cream then i set the can down held the mound of silly string out in front of me closed my eyes and gathered my will working magic is all about creating connections earlier id taken binders hairs to create a link back to him and used it for a tracking spell i could have done any number of things with that connection including some that were extremely nasty and dangerous id seen it happen before generally from the receiving end this time i was creating a link between the silly string in my hand and the bit stuck to the door down the hall theyd both come from the same can and theyd been part of one distinct amount of liquid when theyd been canned that meant i would be able to take advantage of that sameness and create a connection between them i focused my will on my desired outcome gathered it all up together and released it with a murmur of finiculus sonitus i reached out and smeared away a section of the circle id drawn breaking it and instantly began feeling a buzzing vibration in the palm of my left hand then i tilted my head far to my right and slapped a bunch of silly string into my left ear dont try this at home folks i muttered im a professional the first thing i heard was hecticsounding hyperactive music a singer was screaming tunelessly and drums were pounding and someone was either playing electric guitars or slowly dipping partially laryngitic cats in boiling oil none of the supposed musicians appeared to be paying attention to anything anyone else in the band was doing christ came binders accented voice not even you could dance to that tripe there was a lowthroated female laugh and a slurred and very happysounding madeline raith replied this music isnt about skill and precision my sweet its about hunger and passion and i could dance to it to make your eyes fall out i am not your sweet binder said his voice annoyed i am not your anything ducks excepting your contracted employee im not sure id emphasize that if i were you binder madeline said since youve been a crushing disappointment as a hireling i told you when i got started that if anyone from the white council showed up i couldnt make you any promises he shot back his voice annoyed and lo and behold what happens that buggering lunatic harry dresden shows up with backupand with the support of the local constabulary to boot im getting so sick of this madeline said hes only one man one bloody member of the white bloody council binder countered bear in mind that someone like him can do everything i can do and considerable besides and even people on the bloody council are nervous about that one well im sick of him spat madeline did you find out where hes got morgan hidden maybe you didnt hear love but i spent my day chained to a chair getting popped in the mouth madeline laughed a cold mocking sound there are places youd have to pay for that not bloody likely did you find morgan binder growled dresden had him stashed in rental storage for a bit but he hared off before the cops could pick him up probably took him into the nevernever they could be anywhere not if dresden is back in chicago madeline said hed never let himself be too far from morgan so check his bloody apartment binder said dont be an idiot madeline said thats the first place anyone would look hes not a total moron yeah i wasnt ahem binder snickered youre money raith money never really gets it madelines voice turned waspish whats that supposed to mean that not everyone has a bloody string of mansions around the world that they live in or extra cars that they never really drive or cash enough to not think twice about dropping two hundred bloody dollars on a bottle of fortydollar room service champagne so so dresdens a bloody kid by council standards lives in that crappy little hole and pays for an office for his business to boot he aint had a century or two of compounded interest to shore up his accounts now has he and when he set himself up an emergency retreat did he buy himself a furnished condo in another town no he rents out a cruddy little storage unit and stacks some camping gear inside all right madeline said her tone impatient suppose youre right suppose hes got morgan at his apartment he wont have left him unprotected naturally not binder replied hell have a bloody minefield of wards around the place might have some conjured guardians or some such as well could you get through them give me enough time and enough of my lads and yeah he said but it wouldnt be quick quiet or clean theres a simpler way which is burn the bloody place down binder said promptly the apartments got one door if morgan comes scurrying out we bag him if not we collect his bones after the ashes cool identify him with dental records or something and claim the reward i felt a little bit sick to my stomach binder was way too perceptive for my comfort level the guy might not be overly smart but he was more than a little cunning his plan was pretty much exactly the best way to attack my apartment defensive magicks notwithstanding whats more i knew he was capable of actually doing it it would kill my elderly neighbors the other residents of the building but that wouldnt slow someone like binder down for half of a second no madeline said after a tense moment of silence i have my instructions if we cant take him ourselves we at least see to it that the wardens find him the wardens havefound him binder complained dresdens a bloody warden your boss should have paid up already there was a quiet deadly silence and then madeline purred youve been modestly helpful to him in the past binder but dont start thinking that you would survive telling him what he should or should not do the moment you become more annoying than useful you are a dead man no sin to want money binder said sullenly i did my part to get it no madeline said you lost a fight to one overgrown boy scout and one pintsized mortal woman got yourself locked up by thepolice of all the ridiculous things and missed your chance to earn the reward sheets rustled and soft footsteps whispered on the carpet a moment later a lighter flickedmadeline smoked binder spoke again in a tone of voice that indicated he was changing the topic of conversation you going to clean that up thats exactly why its there madeline said she took a drag and said cleaning up its too bad you didnt get here five minutes sooner and why is that because i probably would have waited to make the call i felt myself leaning forward slightly and holding my breath what call binder said to the wardens naturally madeline said i told them that morgan was in town and that dresden was sheltering him they should be here within the hour i felt my mouth drop open and my stomach did a cartwheeling backflip with an integrated quadruple axle oh crap chapter thirtythree murphy looked at the rolls and said youre kidding wed driven down to the sax separately and she hadnt seen the wheels i was using i was parked closer to the hotel so we were about to get into the silver wraith together its a loaner i said get in i am not a material girl she said running a hand over the rollss fender but damn can we focus here i said the worlds coming to an end murphy shook her head and then got in the car with me well at least youre going out in style i got the rolls moving it got plenty of looks even in the dead of night and the other motorists out so late gave it a generous amount of room as if intimidated by the wraiths sheer artistry actually i said im kind of finding the rolls to be irrationally comforting murphy glanced aside at me whys that i know how im going to die you know one of these days maybe real soon im going to find out ive bitten off more than i can chew i swallowed i mean i just cant keep from sticking my nose in places people dont want it and i always figured it would be the council who punched my ticket regardless of who believed what about me because theres a bunch of assholes there and i just cant let them wallow in their own bull and pretend its an air of nobility murphys expression became more sober she listened in silence now the councils coming and theyve got good reason to take me out or it looks like it to them which is the same thing i swallowed again my mouth felt dry but i somehow just have the feeling that when i go out it isntgoing to be in style i gestured at the rolls with a vague sweep of one hand this just isnt the car i drive to my death you know murphs mouth tucked up at one corner though most of the smile was in her eyes she took my hand between hers and held it her hands felt very warm maybe mine were just cold youre right of course harry you think definitely she said this car just isnt you youll die in some badly painted hideously recycled piece of junk that seems to keep on running despite the laws of physics that say it should be melted scrap by now whew i said i thought i might be the only one who thought that her fingers tightened on mine for a moment and i clung back the council was coming and there wasnt anything i could do to fight them oh sure maybe i could poke someone in the nose and run but they would catch up to me sooner or later there would be more of them than me some of them every bit as strong as i was and all of them dangerous it might take a day or a week or a couple of weeks but i had to sleep sooner or later theyd wear me down and that pissed me off my sheer helplessness in the face of this whole stupid mess was infuriating it wasnt as if i didnt have options mab still held a job offer open to me for example and it was more than possible that lara raith might have the resources to shield me or broker me a better deal than the council was going to offer when i thought of how unfair the whole thing was i had more than a passing desire to grab whatever slender threads i could reach until i could sort things out later put that way it almost sounded reasonable noble even i would after all be protecting other wrongly persecuted victims of the council who littered the theoretical landscape of the future it didnt sound nearly so much like entering bargains that went against everything i believed so that i could forcibly impose my will over those who were against me i knew the truth but just because it was true didnt make it any less tempting what the hell was i going to do i had a hideyhole planned out but it had already been compromised there was nowhere even a little bit safe i could take morgan but my apartment and the wardens were going to find him there and on top of all that i still had no freaking clue as to the identity of our mysterious puppet master maybe it was time to admit it this one was too big for me it had been from the very start murph i said quietly i dont know how im going to get out of this silence filled the beautiful old car whens the last time you slept murphy asked i had to take my hand back from hers to work the clutch i gestured at my bandaged head i can barely remember what day of the week it is this morning a couple hours i think she nodded judiciously you know what your problem is i eyed her and then started laughing or at least making an amused wheezing sound i couldnt help it problem singular i choked out finally no what you like to come off like youre the unpredictable chaos factor in any given situation but at the end of the day you obsess about having everything ordered the way you want it have you seen my lab again with the inappropriately timed comeons murphy said im serious harry i know some people who would really disagree with you like whatshisface peabody hes council yeah says i have no place in his bastion of order she smirked the problem is that your bastion of order is sort of tough to coexist with i have no bastions i am bastionless hah murphy said you like the same car the same apartment the same restaurant you like not needing to answer to anyone and doing the jobs your conscience dictates you should do without worrying about the broader issues they involve you hang out fairly happy without much in the way of material wealth and follow your instincts and be damned to anyone who tells you otherwise thats your order i eyed her is there some other way it should be she rolled her eyes i rest my case and how is this my problem youve never really compromised your order for someone elses which is why you drive the wardens nuts they have procedures they have forms they have reportsand you ignore them unless someone twists your arm to make you do it am i right still dont see how thats a problem she rolled down the passengerside window and let one hand hang out its a problem because you never learned how to adjust inside someone elses order she said if you had youd realize what an incredible force you have working on your side the ateam bureaucracy murphy said i would rather have the ateam listen and learn maverick murphy said the wardens are an organization right yeah lots of members almost three hundred and growing i said lots of members who all have many obligations who live in different areas who speak different languages but who have to communicate and work together somehow yeah behold murphy said bureaucracy organization to combat the entropy that naturally inhibits that kind of cooperative effort is there going to be a quiz later or she ignored me bureaucracies share common traitsand i think youve got more time to move in than you realize if you werent tired and hurting and an obnoxious fly in the ointment to anyones order but your own youd see that i frowned how so do you think madeline raith called up the white council on her home phone identified herself and just told them you were helping morgan murphy shook her head hello im the enemy let me help you for no good reason i sucked thoughtfully on my lower lip the wardens would probably assume that she was trying to divert their resources during a manpowercritical situation murphy nodded and while they will look into it theyll never really believe it and it will go straight to the bottom of their priority list so she calls in an anonymous tip instead so so how many tips do you think the wardens have gotten murphy asked cops go through the same thing some big flashy crime goes down and we have a dozen nuts claiming credit or convinced their neighbor did it another dozen jerks who want to get their neighbor in trouble and three times that many wellmeaning people who have no clue whatsoever and think theyre helping i chewed on that thought for a moment murphy wasnt far off the mark there were plenty of organizations and lord only knew how many individuals who would want to stay on the wardens good side or who would want to impress them or who would simply want to have a real reason to interact with them murph was probably right there probably were tips flooding in from all over the world theyll check the tip out murphy said but im willing to bet you real money that depending on their manpower issues it wont happen until several hours after the tip actually makes it into the hands of the folks running the showand with any luck given the councils issues with technology and communicationthat will take a while as well i mulled that one over for a minute what are you saying she put her hand on my arm and squeezed once im saying dont give up yet theres still a little time i turned my head and studied murphys profile for a moment really i asked her quietly she nodded yeah like love hope is one of those ridiculously disproportional words that by all rights should be a lot longer i resettled my grip on the rollss steering wheel murph mmm youre one hell of a dame sexist pig she said she smiled out the windshield dont make me hurt you yeah i said it wouldnt be ladylike she shook her head as we neared my apartment if you like she said take him to my place you can hide out there i didnt actually smile but her words made me feel like doing it not this time the wardens know where you live remember if they start looking hard at me theyll check me out too murphy said but you cant keep him at your place i know that i also know that i cant drag anyone else into the middle of this clustthis mess theres got to be somewhere she said someplace quiet and not wellknown and away from crowds she paused and where you can protect him from tracking magic and where youd have the advantage if it did come to a fight i didnt say anything okay murphy said i guess maybe there arent any places like that around here i snapped my head up straight hells bells i breathed i felt a grin stretch my mouth i think maybe there is chapter thirtyfour i came through my apartment door took one look around the candlelit place and half shouted hells bells what is wrong with you people morgan sat slumped against the wall with the fireplace and fresh spots of blood showed through his bandages his eyes were only partly open his hand lay on the floor beside him limp the fingers half curled a tiny little semiautomatic pistol lay on the floor beneath his hand it wasnt mine i have no idea where hed been hiding it molly was on the floor in front of the sofa with mouse literally sitting on her back she was heaving breaths in and out making the big dog rise and settle slightly as she did luccio lay where id left her on the couch flat on her back her eyes closed obviously still unconscious mouse had one of his paws resting lightly on her sternum given the nature of her recent injury it seemed obvious that he would need to exert minimal pressure on her to immobilize her with pain should she awaken the air smelled of cordite mouses fur all down his left foreleg was matted and caked with blood when i saw that i rounded on morgan in a fury and if murphy hadnt stepped forward and grabbed my arm with both hands i would have started kicking his head flat against my wall i settled for kicking the gun away instead if i got a couple of his fingers too it didnt bother me much at the time morgan watched me with dull hardly conscious eyes i swear i snarled i swear to god morgan if you dont explain yourself im going to strangle you dead with my own hands and drag your corpse back to edinburgh by the balls harry murphy shouted and i realized that she had positioned her entire body between me and morgan and she was leaning against me like a soldier struggling to raise a flag morgan bared his teeth more rictus than smile your warlock he said his voice dry and leathery was trying to enter captain luccios mind against her will i surged forward and murphy pushed me back again i weighed twice what she did but she had good leverage and focus and so you shot my dog i screamed he interposed himself morgan said he coughed weakly and closed his eyes his face turning greyer never meant to hit i swear to god i snarled thats it that is it molly and i are going right to the wall for you and this is how you repay us i am pushing your paranoid ass out my door leaving you there and starting a pool on who comes for you firstthe black council the wardens or the goddamn buzzards hharry molly said in a weak nauseated and shamedvoice barely more than a whisper i felt my anger abruptly drain away to be replaced by a wave of denial and a slowly dawning sense of horror i turned slowly to look at molly he was right she wheezed not looking at me struggling to speak over the burden of mouses weight i could hear the tears reflected in her voice as they began to fall im sorry im so sorry harry he was right i leaned my shoulders back against the wall and watched as mouse looked at me with grave pained eyes and stayed right where he wasboth holding molly down and shielding her body with his we got morgan put back into bed and then i went over to mouse okay i said move only then did mouse remove himself from mollys back limping heavily to one side i knelt down by him and examined his leg he flattened his ears and leaned away from me i said firmly stop that hold still mouse sighed and looked miserable but he let me poke at his leg i found the wound up near his shoulder and a hard lump under the skin get up i said to molly my tone steady go to the lab get the medical kit under the table then get the little scissors and a fresh razor from the cabinet in my bathroom she pushed herself up slowly move i said my voice quiet and level and unyielding she was obviously still recovering from being pinned to the floor but she moved quicker and staggered down to my lab murphy knelt down next to me and ruffled mouses ears he gave her a miserable look she held up morgans gun twentyfive caliber she said big as he is wouldnt have been easy to kill him with it even on purpose she shook her head or molly for that matter meaning what i asked her meaning maybe morgan didnt intend the attack to be lethal maybe he used the smaller weapon for that reason he used the smaller weapon because it was the only one he had i said my voice harsh hed have killed molly if he could have murphy was quiet for a moment before she said thats attempted murder i glanced up at her for a second then i said you want to arrest him it isnt an issue of what i want she said im an officer of the law harry i thought about that for a moment the council mightthey mightrespect it i said quietly in fact im certain they would it would be the merlins call and hed love nothing better than to buy more time to work out how to get morgan out of this mess but others wouldnt she said madeline and shagnasty sure wouldnt i said and if morgans in jail theres no way to force shagnasty into a confrontation where i have a chance to take thomas back i looked at mouses wound or trade him youd do that she asked morgan for thomas i shook my head i hells bells it would make a mess the council would go berserk but but thomas is my brother i didnt say it i didnt need to murphy nodded molly reappeared with the things id sent her for plus a bowl and a pair of needlenose pliers smart girl she poured rubbing alcohol into a bowl and started sterilizing the suture needle the thread the scalpel and the pliers her hands moved like they knew what they were doing without need for her to consciously direct them that probably shouldnt have surprised me michael and charity carpenters eldest daughter had probably been taught to deal with injuries since the time she was physically large enough to do so mouse i said theres a bullet inside you do you know what that is the thing that a gun shoots that hurts mouse looked at me uncertainly he was shaking i put my hand on his head and spoke steadily weve got to take it out of you or it could kill you its going to hurt a lot but i promise you that it wont take long and that youre going to be all right ill protect you okay mouse made a very soft noise that only the ungracious would have called a whine he leaned his head against my hand trembled and then very slowly licked my hand once i smiled at him and leaned my head against his for a second it will be all right lie down boy mouse did stretching slowly carefully out on his side the wounded shoulder up here harry molly said quietly gesturing at the tools i looked at her my face hard youre doing it she blinked at me what but what i did i dont even i i mouse just took a bullet for you miss carpenter i said my words precise he wasnt thinking of himself when he did it he was putting his life at risk to protect you if you want to remain my apprentice you will stop saying sentences that begin with i and repay his courage by easing his pain her face went white harry i ignored her and moved around to kneel by mouses head holding him down gently stroking my hands over his thick fur my apprentice looked from me to murphy her expression uncertain sergeant murphy stared back at her with calm cop eyes and molly averted her gaze hurriedly she looked from her own hands to mouse and started crying then she got up went to the kitchen sink and put a pot of water on the stove to boil she washed her hands carefully all the way to the elbow then she came back with the water took a deep breath and settled down beside the wounded dog taking up the instruments she cut and shaved the area around the injury first making mouse flinch and quiver several times i saw her cringe at each pained movement from the dog but her hands stayed steady she had to widen the tear in the dogs flesh with the scalpel mouse actually cried out when the knife cut him and she closed her eyes tight for a long count of three before she went back to work she slid the pliers into the shallow injury and pulled out the bullet it was a tiny thing smaller than the nail on the end of my pinky a distorted oblong bit of shiny metal mouse groaned as she tugged it free she cleaned the site of the wound again using the boiled water and disinfectant mouse flinched and cried out when she did sothe most agonized sound i had ever heard him make im sorry molly said blinking tears out of the way im sorry the injury was big enough to need a trio of stitches molly did them as swiftly as she possibly could drawing more shudders of pain from mouse then she cleaned the site again and covered it with a small pad that she cut to the proper size affixing it to the bareshaved skin around the injury with medical tape there she said quietly she leaned down and buried her face in the thick ruff of fur around mouses throat there youll be all right mouse moved very gingerly moving his head to nudge against her hand his tail thumped several times on the floor murph i said give us a minute sure she said quietly i need to make a call anyway she nodded to me and walked quietly to the apartment doorpointedly pausing to close the door from the living room to my small bedroom shutting morgan out of the conversation i sat with mouse stroking his head gently okay i said to molly what happened she sat up and looked at me she looked like she wanted to throw up her nose was running now i it occurred to me harry that well if the traitor wanted to really set the council at one anothers throats the best way to do it would be to force one of them to do something unforgiveable like maybe force morgan to kill wizard lafortier gee i said that never once occurred to me though i am older and wiser than you and have been doing this for most of your life whereas youve been in the business for just under four years she flushed yes well then i thought that the best way to use that sort of influence wouldnt be to use it on morgan she said but on the people who would be after him i lifted my eyebrows okay i said at this point i have to ask you if you know how difficult it is to manipulate the mind and will of anyone of significant age most wizards who are eighty or a hundred years old are generally considered more or less immune to that kind of gross manipulation i didnt know that molly said humbly but what im talking about wouldnt be a severe alteration to anyone it wouldnt be obvious she said you wouldnt make someone turn into a raving lunatic and murderer i mean thats sort of noticeable instead you make sure that you just sort of nudge the people who are chasing after morgan into being a little bit more like you want them to be i narrowed my eyes it was an interesting line of thought such as well she said if someone is naturally quick to anger and prone to fighting you highlight that part of their personality you give it more importance than it would have without intervention if someone is prone to maneuvering politically to take advantage of a situation you bring that to the forefront of their personality if someone is nursing a grudge you shine a spotlight on it in their thoughts their emotions to get them to act on it i thought about that one for a second its how id do it molly said quietly lowering her eyes i looked at the young woman id been teaching when i saw molly i always saw her smile her sense of humor her youth and her joy she was the daughter of a close friend i knew her family and was often a guest in their home i saw my apprentice the effort she put into learning her frustrations and her triumphs i had never until that very moment thought of her as someone who might one day be a very very scary individual i found myself smiling bitterly who was i to throw stones maybe i said finally it would be one hell of a difficult thing to prove she nodded but if it was going to be used theres one person who would without doubt be a target i glanced at luccio her mouth was open slightly as she slept she was drooling a little it was ridiculous and adorable yeah molly said but she would never have let me look you know she wouldnt have for good reason i said mollys jaw tensed up for a second i know so you thought youd look while everyone was unconscious i said when you wouldnt get caught she shrugged her shoulders you told yourself that you were doing the right thing i said just a peek in and out she closed her eyes i was harry what if she isnt being honest with you what if all this time shes been getting close to you because she doesnt trust you what if shes just like morganonly a lot better at hiding it you dont know what youre talking about i said no she met my eyes whose apprentice was he harry who taught him to be the way he is who did he idolize so much that he modeled himself after her i just sat there for a second molly pressed the issue do you honestly think that she never knew how morgan treated you i took a deep breath then i said yeah i think that she shook her head you know better no i said i dont you should she said fiercely i couldnt take the chance that she would let you go down with morgan i had to know i stared at her for a minute then i said in a very quiet voice i always know when im being tempted to do something very very wrong i start sentences with phrases like i would never ever do thisbut or i know this is wrong but its the but that tips you off harry molly began you broke one of the laws of magic molly willfully even though you knew it could cost you your life even though you knew that it could also cost mine i shook my head and looked away from her hells bells kid i choose to trust anastasia luccio because thats what people do you dont ever get to know for sure what someone thinks of you what they really feel inside but i could no i said gently even psychomancy doesnt give you everything we arent meant to know whats going on in there thats what talking is for thats what trust is for harry im sorr i lifted a hand dont apologize maybe im the one who let you down maybe i should have taught you better i petted mouses head gently looking away from her it doesnt matter at the moment people have died because ive been trying to save morgans life thomas might still die and now if we do manage to save morgans crusty old ass hes going to report that youve violated your parole the council will kill you and me she stared at me helplessly i didnt mean to get caught i said quietly jesus christ kid i trusted you she wept more heavily now her face was a mess she bowed her head if morgan goes down for this i said theres going to be trouble like you wouldnt believe and even more people are going to die i stood up slowly so im going to do everything in my power to save him she nodded without looking up so youve got a choice to make grasshopper you can come with me knowing the cost if we succeed or you can go go she whispered go i said leave now run for as long as you can hell it looks a lot like im going to get myself killed anyway probably morgan too in that case things will go to hell but the wardens will be way too busy to chase you youll be able to ignore whats right all you want do whatever you likeas long as you dont get caught she pressed her arms against her stomach she sounded like she was about to throw up through the sobs i put a hand on her head and said or you can come with me you can do something right something that has meaning she looked up at me her lovely young face discolored in anguish everyone dies honey i said very quietly everyone theres no if theres only when i let that sink in for a moment when you die do you want to feel ashamed of what youve done with your life feel ashamed of what your life meant she stared at my eyes for a minute and a half of silence broken only by the sound of her muted weeping then her head twitched in a single tiny shake i promise that ill be beside you i said i cant promise anything else only that ill stand beside you for as long as i can okay she whispered she leaned against me i put my hand on her hair for a minute then i said gently were out of time the wardens will know morgan is in chicago within a few hours at most they might be on their way already okay she said whwhat are we going to do i took a deep breath among other things im going to attempt a sanctum invocation i said her eyes widened but you said that kind of thing was dangerous that only a fool would take such a chance i agreed to help donald freaking morgan when he showed up at my door i sighed i qualify she wiped at her eyes and nose what do i do get my ritual box put it in the car murphys cuddling up with outside okay molly said she turned away but then paused and looked back over her shoulder at me harry yeah i know it was wrong but i looked at her sharply and frowned she shook her head and held up her hands hear me out i know it was wrong and i didnt get much of a look but i swear to you i think someone has tampered with captain luccio id bet my life on it i ignored the little chill that danced down my spine could be that you have i said quietly and mine too go get the box molly hurried to comply i waited until she was outside to look at mouse the big dog sat up his eyes gravely concerned he wasnt favoring his shoulder at all and his movement was completely unimpaired mouse got hit by the driver of a minivan once he got back up ran it down and returned the favor the foo dog was very very tough i doubted hed really needed the medical attention to recover though i was also sure it would help speed things along but i hadnt been completely certain the injury wasnt as serious as it looked in other words the freaking dog had fooled molly and me both you were acting i said to make it hit molly harder his tail wagged back and forth proudly damn i said impressed maybe i should have named you denzel his jaws opened in a doggy grin earlier tonight i said when i was trying to figure out how to find thomas you interrupted me i didnt think about it before now but you helped him track me down when madrigal raith was auctioning me off on ebay his tail wagged harder could you find thomas woof he said and his front paws bounced a couple of inches off the floor i nodded slowly thinking then i said ive got another mission for you one that could be more important you game he shook his fur out and padded to the door then he stopped and looked back over his shoulder at me okay i told him walking to the door myself listen up things are about to get sort of risky chapter thirtyfive i looked at luccios stillunconscious form the stress of coordinating the search for morgan for who knows how long before he showed up coupled with the pains of her injuries and the sedative effect of the painkillers id given her meant that shed never stirred not when the gun went off not when wed been talking and not when wed all had to work together to get morgan back up the stairs and out to the silver rolls i made sure she was covered with a blanket the moment i did mister descended from his perch atop one of my bookcases and draped himself languidly over her lower legs purring i scratched my cats ears and said keep her company he gave me an inscrutable look that said maybe he would and maybe he wouldnt mister was a cat and cats generally considered it the obligation of the universe to provide shelter sustenance and amusement as required i think mister considered it beneath his dignity to plan for the future i got a pen and paper and wrote anastasia im running out of time and visitors are on the way im going someplace where i might be able to create new options youll understand shortly im sorry i didnt bring you too in your condition youd be of limited assistance i know you dont like it but you also know that im right help yourself to whatever you need i hope that well talk soon harry i folded the note and left it on the coffee table where shed see it upon waking then i bent over kissed her hair and left her sleeping safe in my home i parked the rolls in the lot next to the marina if we hurried we could still get there before the witching hour which would be the best time to try the invocation granted trying it while injured and weary with absolutely no preritual work was probably going to detract more than enough from the ritual to offset the premium timing but i was beggared for time and therefore not spoiling for choice allow me to reiterate murphy said that i feel that this is a bad idea so noted i said but will you do it she stared out the rollss windshield at the vast expanse of lake michigan a simple and enormous blackness against the lights of chicago yes she said if there was anything else you could do i said id ask you to do it i swear i know she said it just pisses me off that theres nothing more i can add well if it makes you feel any better youre going to be in danger too someone might decide to come by and try to use you against me and if word gets back to the council about how much you know theyre going to blow a gasket she smiled a bit yes thank you i feel less left out now that i know someone might kill me anyway she shifted settling her guns shoulder harness a little more comfortably i am aware of my limits that isnt the same thing as liking them she looked back at me how are you going to reach the others id really rather not say the less you know the safer i am no actually i said the less you know the safer i am dont forget that we might be dealing with people who can take information out of your head whether you want to give it or not murphy folded her arms and shivered i hate feeling helpless yeah i said me too hows he doing molly still asleep molly reported from the back of the limo i dont think his fever is any higher though she reached out and touched morgans forehead with the back of one hand morgans arm rose up and sharply slapped her arm away at the wrist though he never changed the pace of his breathing or otherwise stirred christ it was literally a reflex action i shook my head and said lets move people molly and i wrestled the wounded warden into his wheelchair again he roused enough to help a little and sagged back into sleep as soon as he was seated molly slung the strap of my ritual box over her shoulder and started pushing morgan across the parking lot to the marina docks i grabbed a couple of heavy black nylon bags and what do we have in there murphy asked me party favors i said youre having a party out there i turned my eyes to the east and stared out over the lake you couldnt see the island from chicago even on a clear day but i knew it was there a sullen and threatening presence yeah i said quietly a real party practically everyone whod wanted to kill me lately would be there murphy shook her head all of this over one man over a hero of the council i said quietly over the most feared man on the wardens morgan nearly took out the red king himselfa vampire maybe four thousand years old surrounded by some disgustingly powerful retainers if he hadnt bugged out morgan would have killed him you almost said something nice about him murphy said not nice i said but i can acknowledge who he is morgan has probably saved more lives than you could count over the years and hes killed innocents too im certain of it hes been the councils executioner for at least twenty or thirty years hes obsessive and tactless and ruthless and prejudiced he hates with a holy passion hes a big ugly vicious attack dog murphy smiled faintly but hes your attack dog hes our attack dog i echoed hed give his life without hesitation if he thought it was necessary murphy watched molly pushing morgan down the dock god its got to be awful to know that youre capable of disregarding life so completely someone elses yours doesnt really matter which to know that youre so readily capable of taking everything away from a human being thats got to eat away at him for so long theres not a lot left maybe i said i think youre right about the killer acting in desperation this situation got way too confused and complicated for it to be a scheme its just a big confluence of all kinds of chickens coming home to roost maybe that will make it simpler to resolve world war one was kind of the same deal i said but then it was sort of hard to point a finger at any one person and say that guy did it world war two was simpler that way youve been operating under the assumption that there is someone to blame murphy said only if i can catch him i shook my head if i cant well murphy turned to me she reached up with both hands put them on the sides of my head and pulled me down a little then she kissed my forehead and my mouth neither quickly nor with passion then she let me go and looked up at me her eyes worried and calm you know that i love you harry youre a good man a good friend i gave her a lopsided smile dont go all gushy on me murph she shook her head im serious dont get yourself killed kick whatsoever ass you need to in order to make that happen she looked down my world would be a scarier place without you in it i chewed my lip for a second feeling very awkward then i said id rather have you covering my back than anyone in the world karrin i cleared my throat you might be the best friend ive ever had she blinked quickly several times and shook her head okay this is going somewhere awkward maybe we should take it from whatsoever ass i suggested she nodded find him kick his ass that is the plan i confirmed then i bent down and kissed her forehead and her mouth gently and leaned my forehead against hers love you too i whispered her voice tightened you jerk good luck you too i said keys are in the ignition then i straightened hitched up the heavy bags and stalked toward the docks i didnt look at her as i walked away and i didnt look back that way we could both pretend that i hadnt seen her crying my brother owned an ancient battered commercial fishing boat he told me it was a trawler or maybe he said troller or schooner it was one of thoseunless it wasnt apparently nautical types get real specific and fussy about the fine distinctions that categorize the various vesselsbut since im not nautical i dont lose much sleep over the misuse of the proper term the boat is fortytwo feet long and could have been a stunt double for quints fishing boat in jaws it desperately needed a paint job as the white of its hull had long since faded to grey and smokesmudged black the only fresh paint on it was a row of letters on the bow that read water beetle getting morgan on board was a painliterally in his case we got him settled onto the bed in the little cabin and brought all the gear aboard after that i climbed up onto the bridge started the engines with my copy of the water beetles key and immediately realized i hadnt cast off the lines i had to go back down to the deck to untie us from the dock look i just told youim not nautical leaving the marina wasnt hard thomas had a spot that was very near the open waters of the lake i almost forgot to flick on the lights but got them clicked on before we got out of the marina and onto the open water then i checked the compass next to the boats wheel turned us a degree or two south of due east and opened up the engine we started out over the blackness of the lake the boats engines making a rather subdued throaty lub lub dub lub sound the boat had originally been built for charter use in the open sea and it had some muscle the water was calm tonight and the ride remained smooth as we rapidly built up speed i felt a little nervous about the trip over the past year thomas and i had gone out to the island several times so that i could explore the place hed been teaching me how to handle the boat but this was my first solo voyage after a few minutes molly came partway up the short ladder to the bridge and stopped do i need to ask permission to come up there or something why would you i asked she considered its what they do on star trek good point i said permission granted ensign aye aye she said and came up to stand next to me she frowned at the darkness to the east and cast a wary glance back at the rapidly fading lights of the city so were going out to the weird island the one with that big ley line running through it yep i said where my dad got i tried not to remember how badly michael carpenter had suffered when he had gone there with me crippled i said yeah she frowned quietly i heard him talking to my mom about the island but when i tried to go look it up i couldnt find it on any of the maps not even in the libraries yeah i said from what i hear bad things happened to everyone who went out there there used to be some kind of port facility for fishing and merchant traffic big as a small town but it was abandoned sometime in the nineteenth century the city completely expunged the place from its records why didnt want anyone to go out there i said if they merely passed a law they knew that sooner or later some moron would go there out of sheer contrariness so they pretty much unmade the place at least officially and in more than a century no ones ever seen it that dark ley line puts off a big field of energy i said it makes people nervous not insane or anything but its enough to make them subconsciously avoid the place if they arent making a specific effort to get there plus there are stone reefs around a big portion of the island and people tend to swing wide around it she frowned couldnt that be a problem for us im pretty sure i know where to get through them pretty sure pretty sure maybe she looked a little paler oh she said good and were going there why the sanctum invocation i said the island has a kind of spirit to it an awareness a genius loci she said i nodded approval exactly that and fed by that ley line its a big strong one it doesnt much care for visitors either its arranged to kill a bunch of them molly blinked and you want to do a sanctum invocation there oh hell no i said i dont want to but ive got to find some way to give myself an edge tomorrow or its all over but the crying she shook her head slowly then she fell silent until we actually reached the island a little while later it was dark but i had enough moonlight and starlight to find the buoy thomas and i had placed at the entry through the reef i swung the water beetle through it and began following the coastline of the island until i passed a second buoy and guided the boat into the small floating dock wed constructed i managed to get the vessel next to the dock without breaking anything and hopped off with lines in hand to tie it off i looked up to find molly holding my ritual box she passed it to me and i nodded to her if this works it should take me an hour or so i told her stay with morgan if im not back by dawn untie the boat start the engine and drive it back to the marina its not too different from a car for what youll be doing she bit her lip and nodded what then she asked get to your dad tell him i said that you need to disappear hell know what to do what about you she asked what will you be doing i slipped the strap to the ritual box over one shoulder took up my staff and started toward the interior of the island not much i said over my shoulder ill be dead chapter thirtysix grimms fairy tales a compilation of the most widely known scary stories of western europe darn near always feature a forest as the setting monstrous and terrifying things live there when the hero of a given story sets out the forest is a place of danger a stronghold of darknessand theres a good reason for it it can be freaking frightening to be walking a forest in the dark and if that isnt enough its dangerous to boot you cant see much there are sounds around you from the sigh of wind in the trees to the rustle of brush caused by a moving animal invisible things touch you suddenly and without warningtree branches spiderwebs leaves brush the ground shifts and changes constantly forcing you to compensate with every step as the earth below you rises or dips suddenly stones trip up your feet so do groundhugging vines thorns branches and roots the dark conceals sinkholes embankments and the edges of rock shelves that might drop you six inches or six feet in stories you read about characters running through a forest at night its a load of crap oh maybe its feasible in really ancient pine forests where the ground is mostly clear or in those vast oak forests where they love to shoot robin hood movies and adaptations of shakespeares work but if you get into the thick native brush in the us youre better off finding a big stick and breaking your own ankle than you are trying to sprint through it blind i made my way cautiously uphill passing through the ramshackle decaying old buildings of what had been a tiny town just up the slope from the dock the trees had reclaimed it long since growing up through floors and out broken old windows there were deer on the island though god knows how they got there its big enough to support quite a few of the beautiful animals id found signs of foxes raccoons skunks and wildcats plus the usual complement of rabbits squirrels and groundhogs there were a few wild goats there as well probably descendants of escapees from the former human residents of the island i began to sense the hostile presence of the island before id gone twenty steps it began as a low sourceless anxiety one i barely noticed against the backdrop of all the perfectly rational anxiety i was carrying but as i continued up the hill it got worse maturing into a fluttery panic that made my heart beat faster and dried out my mouth i steeled myself against the psychic pressure and continued at the same steady pace if i let it get to me if i wound up panicking and bolted i could end up a victim of the normal threats of a forest at night in fact that was probably what the island had in mind so to speak i gritted my teeth and continued while my eyes slowly adjusted to the night revealing the shapes of trees and rocks and brush and making it a little easier to move safely it was a short hike to the mountains summit the final bit of hill was at an angle better than fortyfive degrees and the only way one could climb it safely was to use the old steps that had been carved into the rock face they had felt weirdly familiar and comfortable the first time i went up them that hadnt changed noticeably in subsequent visits even now i could go up them in the dark my legs and feet automatically adjusting to the slightly irregular spacing of the steps without needing to consult my eyes once at the top of the stairs i found myself on a bald crown of a hilltop a tower stood there an old lighthouse made of stone well about threequarters of it stood there anyway some of it had collapsed and the stones had been cannibalized and used to construct a small cottage at the foot of the tower the silent presence of the island was stronger here a brooding and dangerous thing that did not care for visitors i looked around the moonlit hilltop nodded once marched over to the flat area in front of the cottage and planted my ritual box firmly on the ground what i was about to attempt had its beginnings in ancient shamanic practice a given tribes shaman or wise one or spirit caller or whatever would set out into the wild near home and seek out a place of presence and power such as this one depending on the culture involved the practitioner would then invoke the spirit of the place and draw its full attention the ritual that happened next wasnt quite an introduction or a challenge or a staking of a claim on the land or a battle of wills but it incorporated elements of all of those things if the ritual was successful it would form a sort of partnership or peerage between the shaman and the genius loci in question if it wasnt successful well its a bad thing to have the full attention of a dangerous spirit that can exert control over the environment around you this spirit bolstered by the dark energy of the ley line that ran beneath the tower was more than capable of driving me insane or recycling me into food for its animals and trees and yet here i am about to pop you in the nose i muttered am i daring or what i set my staff down and opened the box first the circle using a short whisk broom i quickly cleared dirt and dust from the rock shelf beneath me in an area about three feet across then i used a woodenarmed chalk compass like those used in geometry classrooms to draw out a perfect circle on the stone in faintly luminescent glowinthedark chalk the circle didnt have to be perfectly round in order to work but it was a little bit more efficient and i wanted every advantage i could get next i got five white candles out of the box and checked a magnetic compass so that i could align them properly the compass needle spun wildly and aimlessly the turbulence of the nearby ley line must have been throwing it off i put the thing away and sighted on the north star setting the candles out at the five points of a pentagram its tip aligned with due north after that i got out an old and genuine kabar us marine combat knife along with a plain silver chalice and a silver former salvation army bell with a black wooden handle i doublechecked each of the objects and the circle then stepped a few feet away and undressed completely losing my rings bracelet and all my other magical gear except for the silver pentacle amulet around my neck i didnt have to do the ritual sky clad but it reduced the chances of any of the enchantments on my gear causing interference by a small if significant amount all the while the pressure from the islands awareness kept doubling and redoubling my head started pounding which was just lovely in combination with the fresh bumps on it the hairs on the back of my neck stood up mosquitoes began to whine and buzz around me and i shuddered to think of the places that were going to get bitten while i did this i went to the circle checked everything again got a box of matches out of the ritual box and then knelt down in the circle yes i could have lit them with a spellbut again that would have left an energy signature on the candles that could potentially interfere so i did it the oldfashioned way as i struck the first match and leaned down to light the northernmost candle a screech owl let out an absolutely aliensounding cry from so nearby that i almost jumped out of my skin i barely kept from losing my balance and smudging the circle cheap shot i muttered then i lit a fresh match and began again i lit the five candles then turned to face the north and reached out to gently touch the chalk circle a mild effort of will closed it and the psychic pressure id been feeling for the last half hour or more abruptly vanished i closed my eyes and began to regulate my breathing relaxing my muscles group by group focusing my thoughts on the task at hand i felt my will begin to gather outside my circle the owl shrieked again a wildcat let out an earsplitting yowl a pair of foxes set up a yipping howling chorale in the brush i ignored them until i felt that i had gathered all the strength i could then i opened my eyes and picked up the bell i rang it sharply once and filled my voice with the power of my will i am not some clueless mortal you can frighten away i said to the hilltop i am magi one of the wise and i am worthy of your respect a wind came rushing up from the lake the trees muttered and sighed with the force of it a sound like angry surf enormous and omnipresent i rang the bell again hear me i called i am magi one of the wise and i know your nature and your strength the wind continued to rise around me making the candles flicker with an effort of will i steadied their flames and felt the temperature of my body drop a couple of degrees in reaction i set the bell down took up the knife and drew it along the knuckles of my left hand opening a thin line in my flesh blood welled up immediately i put the knife down took up the chalice and let my blood trickle into the cup and as it did i used the one thing that made me think it was possiblejust possibleto pull this thing off soulfire during a case a little more than a year ago an archangel had decided to invest in my future uriel had replaced the power id lost when i resisted the temptations offered me by one of the fallen the demons hellfire had been literal hell on wheels for destructive purposes soulfire was apparently the angelic equivalent of the same force the flip side of the coinfires of creation rather than those of destruction i hadnt experimented with it much soulfire used my own life force as its source of energy if i poured too much into any given working it could kill me as the blood dripped down into the chalice i reached out to the place in my mind where the archangels gift resided and poured soulfire into my blood silverwhite sparks began to stream from the cuts and accompanied the blood down into the chalice filling it with supernatural power far in excess of what my blood a common source of magical energy contained on its own i lifted the chalice in my right hand and the silver bell in my left droplets of blood and flickering sparks of soulfire fell on the silver and when it rang again the sound was piercing the tone so perfect and pure that it could have shattered glass hear me i called and my soulfireenhanced voice rang out in a similar fashion sharp and precise strong and resonant small stones fell from a broken section of the tower wall i am magi one of the wise i make of my blood this gift to you to honor your strength and to show my respect come forth i set the bell down and prepared to break the circle and release the spell come forth i bellowed even louder come forth i simultaneously broke the circle released my will and poured out the scarlet and silver fire of my enhanced blood onto the stone of the hilltop animals of the forest erupted into screams and howls birds exploded from their sleeping places to swarm in the skies above me half a dozen tree branches snapped all together in the rushing wind the sounds crackling over the stony hilltop like rifle shots and an instant later a bolt of viridian lightning crashed down out of a completely clear sky and struck the ground in the center of the empty shell of the old lighthouse there was little enough in the lighthouse that could burn but some brush and grasses grew there their light danced and flickered on the walls if only for a few secondsand then suddenly revealed an indistinct and solid shape inside i took a slow breath and rose to my feet facing the lighthouse it was a rare thing for such an entity to take material form and i had thought it so unlikely to happen that i had scarcely bothered to plan for it the woods all around me rustled and i darted my eyes left and right without moving animals had appeared deer were the largest and most obvious the stags horns wicked in the moonlight foxes and raccoons were there too as well as rabbits and squirrels and all manner of woodland creatures predator and prey alike they were all staring at me with obvious awareness that was far more than they should have had and all of them were eerily still i did my best not to think about what it might be like to be overrun and chewed to death by hundreds of small wild animals i turned my eyes back to the tower and waited the dark shape indistinct in the heavy shadows moved and came closer until it looked like something that was not quite human its shoulders were too wide its stance too crooked and it walked with a slow limping gait dragthump dragthump it was covered with what appeared to be a voluminous dark cloakoh and it was eleven or twelve feet tall yikes green eyes the same color as the bolt of unnatural lightning burned inside the darkness of the cloaks hood they faced me and flashed brighter once and a gust of wind washed down onto me almost taking me from my feet i gritted my teeth against it and endured until a moment later it died away i looked at the dark shape for a moment and then nodded right i said i get you i reached for my will infused it with a meager portion of soulfire and hurled my right hand forward calling ventas servitas wind festooned with ribbons of silver light rushed from my outstretched hand crashing into the figure it didnt move the thingthe entity was far too massive for thatbut the wind cast the grey cloak back as sharply as a ships flag caught in a gale making the fabric snap and pop my evocation died away and the entitys cloak settled down again once more its eyes flashed and the earth beneath my feet and slightly behind me erupted solid rock splitting and cracking sharp shards flew up from the supernatural impact and i instantly felt half a dozen hot stinging cuts on my legs and back ow i muttered at least they werent in any tender spots i guess then again i summoned my will and soulfire this time focusing on the earth near the entity geodas i shouted and the earth beneath the entity twisted and screamed suddenly opening into a sinkhole the entity never moved it just stood there on empty air as if i hadnt literally pulled the ground out from under it the entitys eyes kindled to life again but this time i had anticipated it flame gathered before it in a lance and rushed toward me leaving a coating of sudden frost and ice on the ground beneath it as it came but my own will had reached down into the ground below me and found the water from the stream that fed the cottages little well i drew it up through the cracks the entity had created in the rock taking advantage of the work it had done with a shout of aquilevitas a curtain of water rose up to meet the onrushing flame and they consumed one another leaving only darkness and a cloud of steam i lifted a hand and my soulfireenhanced will and shouted fuego a column of silverandblue flame as thick as my chest roared across the ground and struck the entity hard in the center of its mass it rocked back at the impact not much maybe half an inch though that column of fire would have blown apart a brick wall but ihad moved it that half an inch there was no doubt about that weariness was slowly seeping into my limbs as the entity stared at me i forced myself to stand straight and face the being without blinkingand without looking weak you want to keep it up i asked it aloud i could do this all night the entity stared at me then it walked closer dragthump dragthump i was not at all scared even a little the only reason my mouth was so dry was all that fire that had been flying around it stopped five feet away towering over me and i realized that it was waiting it was waiting for me to act my heart pounded harder as i bowed my head respectfully i dont know why i said what i did exactly i just know that my instincts screamed at me that it was the right thing to say my voice infused with my will i am harry dresden and i give thee a name honored spirit from this day on be thou called demonreach its eyes flashed burning more brightly sending out tendrils and streams of greenish fire in a nimbus around its head then demonreach mirrored my gesture bowing its own head in reply when it looked up its head turned briefly toward the cottage then the wind rose again and darkness fluttered over the hilltop when it passed i was alone the hilltop empty of entity and animal alike i was also freezing i staggered toward my clothes and gathered them up shaking so hard that i thought i might just collapse on the ground as i rose with my gear in my arms i saw a light flickering in the cottage i frowned and shambled over to it the door like the windows had long since rotted away and there was very little roof to speak ofbut the cottage did have one thing in it that still functioned a fireplace a neat stack of fallen wood was burning in the fireplace putting off a cheery warmth its golden flames edged with flickers of green at their very edges i blinked at the fire for a moment and then made my way over to it reveling in the warmth as i dressed again i glanced up searching for that alien presence i found it immediately still there still alien still dangerous though it no longer seemed determined to drive me away i slid will into my voice as i said simply thank you the gentle wind that sighed through the trees of demonreach may have been a reply or maybe not chapter thirtyseven i didnt return to the dock by the same route id taken to the tower there was a much shorter easier way down what looked like a sheer rock wall it proved to have an ancient narrow gully worn into the stone almost completely hidden by brush the gullys floor had a thin layer of silt in it leaving little room for plants to grow and was as easy to traverse as a sidewalk even in the dark following it brought me back to the islands shoreline in half the time it had taken to go up i didnt wonder how id known about the path until i stepped out of the woods and saw the dock again i hadnt been that way before i hadnt known it existed yet when i decided to take that trail the knowledge had come to me as completely and immediately as if i had lived there for years pure information i paused and looked around me i knew not to walk directly to the dock from where i stood there was a large hornets nest in the earth at the base of a fallen tree and i would risk arousing their anger if i accidentally crushed it while walking by i also knew that a grumpy old skunk was trundling its way back to its den thirty yards in the other direction and that it would happily douse me with musk if i came anywhere close i glanced over my shoulder back toward the tower casting out my supernatural senses the islands awareness continued being that same constant presence id felt ever since leaving the tower i considered going back taking the old stairs this time to see what would happen and immediately i understood that there was a cottonmouth that made its home in a large crack on the twentysixth step if i delayed the trip until later in the morning the snake would be out on the stones sunbathing to build up its body heat for the day the dawn was approaching and the sky had begun to lighten from black to blue i could see the tower standing lonely and wounded but unbowed a black shape against the sky demonreach began to awaken to the first trills of songbirds i walked down to the dock thoughtfully and walked out to where the water beetle was moored molly i called feet pounded on the deck and molly burst up out of the ships cabin she flew across the distance between us and nearly tackled me into the water on the far side of the dock with the enthusiasm of her hug molly the daughter of two ferocious warriors was no wilting violet my ribs creaked you came back she said i was so worried you came back hey hey i need my rib cage kid i said but i hugged her in return for a quiet moment before straightening did it work she asked im not exactly sure god i need something to drink we both boarded the water beetle and i went below and removed a can of coke from a cabinet it was warm but it was liquid and more important it was coke i guzzled the cans contents and tossed it into the trash bin hows morgan i asked awake morgan rumbled where are we demonreach i said its an island in lake michigan morgan grunted without emphasis luccio told me about it oh i said oh good miss carpenter says you were attempting a sanctum invocation yeah morgan grunted youre here it worked i think so i said im not sure why not i shook my head i thought that when a bond was formed with the land in question it gave you access to its latent energy yes which meant that my magic would be subsidized by the island whenever i was here id get a lot more bang for my buck so to speak i thought that was all it did generally morgan said i saw him turn his head toward me in the dim cabin why what else has happened i took a deep breath and told him about the hidden trail the hornets and the skunk morgan sat up in his bunk by the time i got to the end he leaned forward intently youre sure you arent mistaken confrontations with a genius loci can leave odd aftereffects behind hang on i said i went back to the woods where i knew the hornets were and found their nest in short order i retreated without crushing anything and went back to the boat yeah i said im sure morgan sank back onto the bunk as if he was being slowly deflated merciful god he said intellectus i felt my eyebrows go up youre kidding molly muttered a couple of candles to light so that we could see each other clearly intellwhatsis she asked me intellectus i said um its a mode of existence for a very few rare and powerful supernatural beingsangels have it im willing to bet old mother winter and mother summer have it for beings with intellectus all reality exists in one piece one place one moment and they can look at the whole thing they dont seek or acquire knowledge they just know things they see the entire picture im not sure i get that molly said morgan spoke a being with intellectus does not understand for example how to derive a complex calculus equationbecause it doesnt need the process if you showed him a problem and an equation he would simply understand it and skip straight to the answer without need to think through the logical stages of solving the problem its omniscient molly asked her eyes wide morgan shook his head not the same thing the being with intellectus has to be focused on something via consideration in order to know it whereas an omniscient being knows all things at all times isnt that pretty close molly asked intellectus wouldnt save you from an assassins bullet if you didnt know someone wanted to kill you in the first place i said to know it was coming youd first need to consider the question of whether or not an assassin might be lurking in a dark doorway or on top of a bell tower morgan grunted agreement and since beings of intellectus so rarely understand broader ideas of cause and effect they can be unlikely to realize that a given event might be an indicator of an upcoming assassination attempt he turned to me though thats a terrible metaphor dresden most beings like that are immortal theyd be hardpressed to notice bullets much less feel threatened by them so molly said nodding it might be able to know anything it wants to knowbut it still has to ask the right questions which is always harder than people think it is yeah i said exactly and now youve got this intellectus too i shook my head its demonreach that has it it stopped when i got out over the water i tapped my finger against my forehead ive got nothing going on in here at the moment i realized what i had said just as the last word left my mouth and glanced at morgan he lay on the bunk with his eyes closed his mouth was turned up in small smile too easy molly fought not to grin morgan pursed his lips thoughtfully can the entity feed you any other information dresden the identities of those behind lafortiers murder for example i almost hit myself in the head with the heel of my hand i should have thought of that already ill let you know i said and went back to the shore demonreach sensed me at the same time as i perceived it and the mutual sensation felt oddly like a hand wave of acknowledgment i frowned thoughtfully and looked around the island concentrating on the issue of lafortiers killer nothing sprang to mind i tried half a dozen other things who was going to win the next world series could i get the blue beetle out of impound yet how many books had mister knocked off my shelves in my absence zip so i thought about hornets nests and instantly felt certain that there were thirtytwo of them spread around the hundred and fifty or so acres of the island and that they were especially thick near the grove of apple trees on the islands northern side i went back to the boat and reported then it only exists upon the island itself morgun rumbled like any other genius loci this one must be bloody ancient to have attained a state of intellectus even if it is limited to its own shorelines could be handy i noted morgan didnt open his eyes but bared his teeth in a wolfs smile certainly if your foes were considerate enough to come all the way out here to meet you could be handy i repeated firmly morgan arched an eyebrow and gave me a sharp look come on grasshopper i said to molly cast off the lines youre about to learn how to drive the boat by the time we made it back to the marina the sun had risen i coached molly through the steps of bringing the water beetle safely into dock even though i wasnt exactly horatio hornblower myself we managed to do it without breaking or sinking anything which is what counts i tied off the boat and went onto the dock molly followed me anxiously to the rail no problem here grasshopper take her out for about ten minutes in a random direction that you choose then turn off the engine and wait ill signal you when im ready for you to pick me up are you sure we shouldnt stay together or something she asked anxiously i shook my head tracking spells cant home in too well over water i said and youll know if someones coming for you from a mile away literally keep morgan out there and you should be as safe as anywhere she frowned what if he gets worse use your noggin kid do whatever you think is most likely to keep you both alive i started untying the line i shouldnt be gone more than a couple of hours if i dont show the plan is the same as when i went up to the tower get yourself vanished she swallowed and morgan make him as comfortable as you can and leave him she stared at me for a minute really if i get taken out i dont think youll be able to protect him i said as matteroffactly as i could or catch the real bad guy so run like hell and let him look out for himself i saw her think that over then she smiled slightly it would really humiliate him if he found himself under the protection of a girl an apprentice and a possible warlock to boot i nodded true molly pursed her lips thoughtfully that might be worth staying for kid i said the smart thing for you to do if it all goes sour is to run smart she said but not right i studied her soberly you sure because theres a world of hurt waiting to fall she nodded her face pale ill try and she would i could see that in her eyes she knew better than most exactly how dangerous such a thing would be for her and it clearly terrified her but she would try then if im taken off the board see murphy i said she knows everything i do about the case listen to her shes smart and you can trust her all right she said i tossed the mooring lines back onboard get a move on i started walking down the dock behind me molly called harry what signal are you going to use youll know it i called back i left the docks in search of the tool that could rip apart this tangled web of suspicion murder and lies i found it in the marinas parking lot a pay phone lara answered on the second ring raith dresden i said what have you got for me oh to have straight lines like that more often she said her tone wry what makes you think i have anything for you cause ive got something to trade men generally seem to think that way most of them tend to overestimate the value of their wares pheromone lass i said can we have the rest of this conversation above the waistline she let out that rich throaty laugh of hers and my hormones sounded the charge i ignored them stupid hormones very well she said it should interest you to know that the money deposited in warden morgans account came from a dummy corporation called windfall dummy organization i asked who owns it i do she said calmly i blinked since youre sharing this information i take it that it happened without your knowledge you are quite correct she said a mr kevin aramis is the corporations manager he is the only one other than myself with the authority to move that much money around i thought furiously whoever aced lafortier hadnt just intended the council to implode he or they had also gone to a lot of trouble to incite hostility with the white court hells bells my imagination treated me to a prophetic nightmare morgan fights against the injustice of his frame hostilities erupt creating strife between various factions of wizards the council eventually runs down the money trail discovers lara on the other end and the council seizes upon the opportunity to unify the factions again thanks to a common enemy hostilities with the vampires start fresh the red court sees the poorly coordinated council exposing itself in battle with the white court and pounces breaking the back of the council and after that it would all be over but the heroic last stands hells bells indeed were being played against one another i said that was my conclusion as well a couple more pieces clicked into place madeline i said she got to this aramis guy and coerced him into betraying you yes lara hissed barely suppressed wholly inhuman rage filled her level controlled voice when i catch up to her im going to tear out her entrails with my bare hands which took care of my hormone problem i shivered id seen lara in action i could never decide if it had been one of the most beautiful terrifying things id ever seen or if it was one of the most terrifying beautiful things id ever seen you might try looking at the hotel sax room twelve thirtythree i said if im right youre going to find mr aramiss body there madelines working for someone a man she didnt say anything that would help identify him you should also know that she has hired the services of a mercenary named binder not exactly a rocket scientist but smart enough to be dangerous lara was silent for a second then she said how did you learn this shockingly with magic i heard her speaking to someone in the room with her then she got back on the phone and said if aramis is dead madeline has tied up the loose end in her plan it will be impossible to provide credible evidence that i did not in fact pay for lafortiers murder yeah thats why she did it i heard her make a displeased sound but it was still ladylike what do we intend to do about this harry do you have a nice dress pardon i found myself grinning maniacally im throwing a party thomass phone rang four times before the connection opened there was a moment of silence then thomas spoke his voice raw and ragged harry my heart just about stopped beating to hear my brothers voice thomas hows it going oh he rasped im just hanging around ive seen thomas in agony before he sounded exactly like this the phone emitted random noises and then the yowlpurring voice of the skinwalker came over the line he is here he is alive for now give me the doomed warrior okay i said there was a moment of silent consternation from the far end of the line bring him to me it said nah that isnt going to happen what youre coming to me do you wish me to end his life this instant frankly shaggy i dont give a damn i said forcing boredom into my voice itd be nice to be able to return one of the vampires to his own get myself a marker i can call in some day but i dont need it i paused you on the other hand need thomas to be alive if you expect me to trade morgan for him so this is how its going to go down at dusk you will be contacted on this phone you will be told where our meeting will take place when you arrive you will show me the vampire alive and well and when he is returned to me you will take morgan without contest i am not some mortal scum you can command mageling shagnasty seethed no youre immortal scum you blind fleshfeeding worm shagnasty snarled who are you to speak to me so the worm whos got what you need i said dusk keep the phone handy i hung up on him my heart hammered against my chest and cold sweat broke out over my upper body i felt myself shaking with terror for thomas with weariness with reaction to the conversation with shagnasty i leaned my aching head against the earpiece of the phone and hoped that i hadnt just ended my brothers life one more call the white council of wizards uses telephone communications like everyone else albeit with a lot more service calls i gave headquarters a ring gave them the countersign to their security challenge and got patched through to one of the administrative assistants an earnest young woman not quite finished with her apprenticeship i need to get a message to every member of the senior council i told her very well sir she said what is the message get this verbatim okay yes sir i cleared my throat and spoke be advised that i have been sheltering warden donald morgan from discovery and capture for the past two days an informant has come to me with details of how warden morgan was framed for the murder of senior council member lafortier warden morgan is innocent and whats more i can prove it i am willing to meet with you tonight on the uncharted island in lake michigan east of chicago at sundown the informant will be present and will produce testimony that will vindicate warden morgan and identify the true culprit of the crime let me be perfectly clear i will not surrender warden morgan to the alleged justice of the council come in peace and we will work things out but should you come to me looking for a fight be assured that i will oblige you the assistant had started making choking sounds after the very first sentence then sign it harry dresden i said um yes sir shshall i read that back to you please she did id heard sounds of movement in the background around her but as she read aloud all of those sounds died to silence when she finished she asked in a rather small squeaky voice do i have that down correctly sir murmurs burst out in the background over the phone excited and low yeah i told her perfect chapter thirtyeight i figured i had an hour maybe before someone was going to show up from edinburgh it was time enough to grab a cab and head to the hospital back in the icu will was sacked out in the waiting room and georgia was the one sitting with andi a middleaged couple who looked as if they hadnt slept much was in there with her i knocked on the glass georgia said something to the couple and rose to come out into the hallway with me she looked tired but alert and had her long rather frizzy hair pulled back into a ponytail harry she said hugging me i returned the hug cutting it off a little early how is she georgia studied me for a second before she answered in bad shape the doctors dont seem to be willing to say whether or not shell recover better that way i said if one of them said shed be fine and then she wasnt georgia glanced at the couple sitting beside andis bed holding each others hands i know it would be cruel to offer false hope but but youre still irrationally angry that the docs havent saved her yet you know better but youre upset anyway she nodded yes irrationality is not something im comfortable with it isnt irrational i said its human she gave me a small smile will and i talked and youre in a hurry i nodded i need you both and right now ill get him georgia said we took georgias suv back down to the marina and arrived with ten minutes to spare on my estimated time window i definitely wanted to be out over open water by the time members of the council started showing up the water wouldnt be a perfect protection from incoming magic but it would make it a lot harder for anyone to target me solidly and it was a hell of a lot better than nothing okay i said you guys wait here for a minute will frowned why i need to talk to someone who can be a little shy around strangers one minute i hopped out of the suv and walked down the rows of cars until i found two vans parked together i slipped between them put the fingers of one hand to my lips and let out a sharp whistle there was a whirring sound and toottoot streaked down from overhead came to a hover in front of me drew his little sword and saluted yes my liege toot i have two missions for you at once my lord no i want you to do them one at a time toot lowered his sword his expression crestfallen oh first i want you to find the boat out on the lake that my apprentice is in shes not more than a mile or two from shore i took off my silver pentacle amulet wrapped the chain around it and handed it to toottoot leave this where she will notice it right away toot accepted the amulet gravely tucking it under one arm it will be done thank you toottoots chest swelled out and he stood a little bit straighter second i told him i need to know how many of the little folk you could convince to join the guard for one night he frowned and looked dubious i dont know lord harry the pizza ration is already stretched as far as it can go i waved a hand the guards pay wont change ill order extra to pay for the new guys service call them the zalords militia we only need them sometimes how many do you think would agree to that toot buzzed in an excited circle for you every sprite and pixie and dewdrop faerie within a hundred miles knows that you saved our kind from being imprisoned by the lady of the cold eyes theres not a one who didnt have comrade or kin languishing in durance vile i blinked at him oh i said well tell them that there may be great danger tell them that if they wish to join the militia they must obey orders while they serve and i will pay them one large pizza for every fourscore volunteers thats less than you pay the guard harry toot said smugly well theyre amateurs not fulltime veterans like you and your men are they yes my lord i looked at him seriously if you can recruit a militia and if they perform as asked theres a promotion in it for you toot his eyes widened does it come with cheese in the crust and extra toppings it isnt a pizza i said its a promotion get this work done and from that time forward you will be i paused dramatically majorgeneral toottoot minimus commanding the zalords elite toots body practically convulsed in a spasm of excitement had a giant yellow exclamation point suddenly appeared in the air over his head i would not have been surprised a majorgeneral i couldnt resist yes yes i said solemnly a majorgeneral he let out a whoop of glee and zipped up and down the little space between vans what do you wish us to do when i have them my lord i want you to play i said heres what were going to do i rejoined will and georgia and ten minutes later the water beetle came chugging back toward the marina the grasshopper got my brothers boat into dock with only a mildly violent impact i secured lines quickly and will and georgia jumped on almost before wills feet were on the deck i was already untying the lines and following them onto the boat molly for her part already had the engine in reverse now what she called down to me from the wheel atop the cabin use the compass on the dashboard one to two degrees south of due east and call me when you spot the island aye aye will squinted at molly and then at me aye aye i shook my head sadly landlubbers im going to go shiver timbers or something i havent slept in a while go ahead harry georgia said well wake you if anything happens i nodded shambled down to the second bunk and passed out immediately someone shook me two seconds later and i said go away sorry harry will said were here i said several uncouth and thoughtless things then manned up and opened my eyes always the hardest part of waking up i sat up and will retreated from the cramped cabin with a glance at morgans unconscious form i sat there with my mouth feeling like it had been coated in turtle wax it took me a second to identify a new sound rain raindrops pattered onto the deck of the boat and the roof of the cabin i shambled out onto the deck unconcerned about the rain ruining my leather duster one handy side effect of going through the painfully precise ritual of enchanting it to withstand physical force as if it had been plate steel was that the thing was rendered waterproof and stainproof as wellyet it still breathed lets see bermans or wilsons do that sufficiently advanced technology my ass i climbed up to the bridge keeping an eye on the sky as i did lowering clouds of dark grey had covered the sky and the rain looked to be a long steady soakera rarity in a chicago summer which usually went for roughandtumble thunderstorms the heat hadnt let up much and as a result the air was thick and heavy enough to swim through i took the wheel from molly oriented myself by use of the compass and the island now only a few minutes away and yawned loudly well this makes things less pleasant the rain molly asked she passed me my pentacle i slipped it back over my head and nodded id planned on lying off the island until closer to dark why mostly because i just challenged the senior council to a brawl there at sundown i said molly choked on her gum i ignored her i didnt want to make it easy for them to slip up on me oh and ive arranged to trade thomas for morgan with shagnasty he wont get word of where to go until later though i think otherwise hed cheat and show up early he looks like a shifty character the pun went past molly or maybe she was just that good at ignoring it youre trading morgan for thomas nah i just want to get shagnasty out here with thomas in one piece so that the white court can take him down molly stared at me the white court too i nodded happily theyve got a stake in this as well um she said why do you think the senior council will take you up on your challenge because i told them i was going to be producing an informant who would give testimony about who really killed lafortier do you have someone like that molly asked i beamed at her no she stared at me for a moment clearly thinking then she said but the killer doesnt know that my smile widened why no miss carpenter he doesnt i made sure word got around headquarters of my challenge to the senior council hes got no choice but to show up here if theres any chance at all that i might actually have found an informant ready to blow his identitywhich by the way would also provide substantial proof of the existence of the black council her golden brows knitted what if theres no chance of such an informant existing i snorted kid groups like these guys the ones who maim and kill and scheme and betraythey do what they do because they love power and when you get people who love power together theyre all holding out a gift in one hand while hiding a dagger behind their back in the other they regard an exposed back as a justifiable provocation to stick the knife in the chances that this group has no one in it who might believably have second thoughts and try to back out by bargaining with the council for a personal profit are less than zero molly shook her head so he or she will call in the black council to help i shook my head i think this is happening because the killer slipped up and exposed himself to lafortier he had to take lafortier out but with all the security at edinburgh there was every chance something could go wrong and it did everything else hes done has smacked of desperation i think that if the black council finds out that their mole has screwed up this thoroughly theyd kill him themselves to keep the trail from leading back to them i stared at the glowering mass of demonreach his only chance is to tie off any loose ends that might lead back to him hell be here tonight molly and hes got to win he has nothing to lose but youre putting everyone together in a confined space harry molly said this is going to be a huge mess pressure cooker padawan i said nodding the perp is already desperate enough to be acting hastily and making mistakes especially the mistake of taking things a step too far and trying to incriminate the white court in lafortiers death as well molly stared out at the water thoughtfully so you put him together in a confined space with two major groups of power who will want to kill him his worst nightmare has got to be the wizards and the white court being drawn into a closer alliance because of what hes done and with as much power as they have theres no way hes going to be able to fight them all i smiled at her yeah it sucks to feel helpless i said especially for a wizard because we usually arent or at least were usually able to convince ourselves that we arent you think hell crack she said i think hell be there i think that with enough pressure something is going to pop loose somewhere i think hell try something stupid maybe a preemptive spell something to take everyone down before they know a fight is on a sneak attack molly said which wont be a sneak attack if you know where he is and what hes doing intellectus i tapped my temple with a finger capital thinking grasshopper thunder rumbled far away i sighed thomas can sail in bad weather but i dont know how to do it intelligently something like this could turn ugly fast were going to have to head into the dock and take our chances i navigated sheesh listen to me navigated the boat had a steering wheel and a lever to make it go faster it was about as complicated to make move as a bumper car granted simple isnt the same thing as easy but even so the actual process of pointing the boat and making it go is not complicated enough to deserve to be called navigation i drove the water beetle around to the safe passage through the reef and pulled her into the dock much more smoothly this time will was waiting by the rail and ready he hopped onto the dock and georgia threw him the mooring lines dont step onto the land until i get a chance to get there first i called to them i want to ah sort of introduce you billy gave me an oblique look um okay harry i climbed down from the bridge and was just about to hop to the dock when a tall slender figure in a black robe black cape and black hood appeared from behind a veil standing at the very end of the dock he lifted his old runecarved staff muttered a word and then brought it smashing down onto the wooden planks a disk of sparkling blue light washed out from the point of impact i had time barely to draw in my will cross my arms at the wrists holding them against my chest and slam will into both my shield bracelet and into strengthening my mental defenses smears of deep blue purple and dark green appeared like puffs of smoke where the expanding ring struck molly will and georgia and the three of them simply collapsed dropping into sprawling heaps on the dock and the deck of the boat my vision darkened and for an instant i felt unbearably tiredbut in a panic i forced more energy into my defenses and the instant passed the robed figure stood staring at me for a few seconds then it spoke in a deep voice put the staff down dresden swirling narcotic colors gathered around his staff and he pointed it at me like a gun it is over chapter thirtynine the rain came down steadily i risked a glance at the others they were all down but breathing mollys head shoulders and arms hung off the side of the boat wet her sapphiredyed hair looked like a much darker hue each rock of the boat made her hands swing she was in danger of falling into the water i turned back to the cloaked figure and peered at him big billowy cloaks and robes are nicely dramatic especially if youre facing into the windbut under a calm soaking rain they just look waterlogged the outfit clung to the figure looking rather miserable the rain also made the cloth look darker than it was looking closer i could see faint hints of color in the cloth which wasnt actually black it was a purple so deep that it was close wizard rashid i asked the gatekeepers staff never wavered as he faced me he lifted a hand and drew back his hood his face was long and sharpfeatured and weathered like old leather he wore a short beard that was shot through with silver and his silver hair was short stiff brush one of his eyes was dark the other had a pair of horrible old silver scars running through it from his hairline down to his jaw the injury had to have ruined his natural eye it had been replaced with something that looked like a stainlesssteel ball bearing indeed he said calmly should have seen it sooner there arent many wizards taller than me lay aside your staff wizard dresden before anyone else is hurt i cant do that i said and i cannot permit you to openly challenge the white council to battle no i asked thrusting out my jaw why not his deep resonant voice sounded troubled it is not yet your hour i felt my eyebrows go up not yet he shook his head places in time this is not the time or the place what you are about to do will cost livesamong them your own i wish you no harm young wizard but if you will not surrender so be it i narrowed my eyes at him and if i dont do this an innocent man is going to die i dont want to fight you but im not going to stand by and let the black council kill morgan and dance off behind the curtains so that they can do it again in the future he tilted his head slightly black council whatever you want to call them i said the people the traitor is working for the ones who keep trying to stir up trouble between the powers who keep changing things the gatekeepers expression was unreadable what things the weirdness weve been seeing mysterious figures handing out wolf belts to fbi agents red court vampires showing up to fights with outsiders on the roster faerie queens getting idealistic and trying to overthrow the natural order of the faerie courts the unseelie standing by unresponsive when they are offered an enormous insult by the vampires trespassing on their territory the attack on arctis tor i can think of half a dozen other things to go with those and those are just the things ive personally gotten involved with i made a broad gesture with one hand back toward chicago the world is getting weirder and scarier and weve been so busy beating on one another that we cant even see it someones behind it he watched me silently for a long moment then he said yes i frowned at him and then my lips parted as i realized what was going on and you think im with them he paused before speakingbut then he damn near always did perhaps there is reason add to your list of upset balances such things as open warfare erupting between the red court and the white council a seelie crown being passed from one young queen to the next by bloody revolt and not the will of titania wardens consorting with white court vampires on a regular basis college students being taught magic sufficient to allow them to become werewolves the little folk wyld fae banding together and organizing the most powerful artifacts of the church vanishing from the worldand as some signs indicate being kept by a wizard who does not so much as pay lip service to the faith much less believe i scowled yeah well when you put it like that he smiled faintly i held up my hand palm out i swear to you by my magic that i am not involved with those lunatics except for trying to put out all these fires they keep starting and if questionable things surround me its because thats the kind of thing that happens when youre as outclassed as i usually am you have to find solutions where you can not where convenient the gatekeeper pursed his lips thoughtfully considering me look can we agree to a short truce to talk this out i said and so that i can keep my apprentice from drowning his gaze moved past me to molly he frowned and lowered his staff at once five minutes he said thanks i said i turned around and got molly hauled back onto the boat she never stirred once she was safely snoozing on deck i went down the dock to stand in front of the gatekeeper he watched me quietly holding his staff in both hands leaning on it gently so i said wheres the rest of the senior council on the way i should think he said theyll need to secure transportation to the island in chicago and then find their way here but not you you came through the nevernever he nodded his eyes watching me carefully i know a way ive been here before yeah i shook my head i thought about trying to find a way out here but i didnt want to chance it this isnt exactly mayberry i doubt it hooks up to anything pleasant in the nevernever the gatekeeper muttered something to himself in a language i didnt understand and shook his head i cannot decide he said whether you are the most magnificent liar i have ever encountered in my lifeor if you truly are as ignorant as you appear i looked at him for a minute then i hooked my thumb up at my ridiculous head bandage dude he burst out into a laugh that was as rich and deep as his speaking voice but more somehow im not sure how to explain it the sound of that laugh was filled with a warmth and a purity that almost made the air quiver around it as if it had welled up from some untapped source of concentrated unrestrained joy i think maybe it had been a while since rashid had laughed you he said barely able to speak through it up in that tree covered with mud i found myself grinning at him yeah i remember he shook his head and actually wiped tears away from his good eye it took him another moment or two to compose himself but when he spoke his living eye sparkled an echo of his laughter youve endured more than most young people he said and tasted more triumph than most as well it is a very encouraging sign that you can still laugh at yourself well gosh i said im just so ignorant i dont know what else to do he stared at me intently you dont know what this place is its out of the way of innocent bystanders i said and i know it better than most of the people who are on the way he nodded frowning i suppose that is logical so hmm i sighed wizards so what is this place he considered his words for a moment what do you think it is beyond the obvious physical and tactical terrain well i said i know theres a ley line that comes through here very dark and dangerous energy i know that theres a genius loci present and that it is real strong and isnt very friendly i know that they tried to start up a small town here linked with the shipping interests in the great lakes but it went sour demonreach drove them away or insane apparently demonreach he asked couldnt find a name on the books i said so i made up my own demonreach the gatekeeper mused its certainly fitting so he gave me a tight smile it wouldnt help you for me to say anything moreexcept for this one of your facts is incorrect the ley line you speak of does not go throughthe island he said this is where it wells up the island is its source ah i said wells up from what in my opinion that is a very useful question i narrowed my eyes and you arent going to give me anything else he shrugged we do have other matters to discuss i glanced back at my unconscious friends yeah we do i am willing to accept that your intentions are noble he said but your actions could set into motion a catastrophic chain of events i shrugged i dont know about that i said what i do know is that you dont kill a man for a crime he didnt commit and when someone else tries to do it you stop them and you think that this will stop them the gatekeeper asked i think its my best shot you wont succeed he said if you press ahead it will end in violence people will die you amongst them you dont even know what i have in mind i said youre laying a trap for the traitor he said youre trying to force him to act and reveal himself a lesser man might have felt less clever than he had a moment before oh and if i can work it out the gatekeeper said then so can the traitor well duh i said but hell show up anyway he cant afford to do anything else and hell come ready the gatekeeper said hell choose his moment let him ive got other assets then he did something strange he exhaled slowly his living eye closing the gleaming steel eye tracked back and forth as if looking at something though i could only tell it was moving because of the twitches of his other eyelid a moment later the gatekeeper opened his eye and said the chances that youll survive it are minimal yeah i asked him i stepped around him and hopped off the dock and onto the island immediately feeling the connection with demonreach as i turned to face him how about now he frowned at me and then repeated the little ritual then he made a choking sound blood of the prophet he swore opening his eyes to stare at me you youve claimed thisplace as a sanctum uhhuh how i punched it in the nose now were friends i said the gatekeeper shook his head slowly harry he said his voice weary harry you dont know what youve done ive given myself a fighting chance yes today he replied but there is always a price for knowledge always his left eyelid twitched as he spoke making the scars that framed the steel orb quiver but it will be me paying the price i said not everyone else yes he said quietly we were both silent for several minutes standing in the rain been longer than five minutes i said how do you want it to be the gatekeeper shook his head may i offer you two pieces of advice i nodded first he said do not tap into the power of this places well you are years away from being able to handle such a thing without being altered by it i hadnt planned on touching it i said second he said you must understand that regardless of the outcome of this confrontation someone will die preferably it would be the traitorbut if he is killed rather than captured no one will be willing to accept your explanation of events no matter how accurate it may be morgan will be executed odds are excellent that you will be as well im sure as hell not doing this for me he nodded dont suppose youd be willing to lend a hand i cannot set foot on the island he said why not because this place holds a grudge he said i suddenly thought of the dragthumplimp of the islands manifest spirit damn he turned to the dock behind him and flicked a hand at the air a neat perfectly circular portal to the nevernever appeared without a whisper or flicker of wasted power the gatekeeper gave me a nod your friends will awaken in a moment i will do what i can to help you thank you i said he shook his head do not it may be that true kindness would have been to kill you today then he stepped through the portal and was gone it vanished an instant later i stood there in the rain and watched the others begin to stir then i sighed and walked back to them to help them up and explain what was going on we had to get moving the day wasnt getting any younger and there were a lot of things to do before nightfall chapter forty we worked for three hours before i started dropping things tripping on nice flat ground and bumping into other people because id forgotten to keep an eye out for them thats it harry georgia said firmly your sleeping bag is in the cottage get some more sleep ill be all right i said harry if anything happens to you we arent going to have anyone we know looking out for us you need to be able to focus go rest it sounded awfully good but my mouth opened on its own weve still got to lay out the will had come up behind me in complete silence he pulled my arm behind my back in a capable strong grip and twisted carefully it didnt hurt until he leaned gently into me and i had to move forward to keep the pressure off you heard the lady he said we can finish the rest of it on our own well wake you up if anything happens i snorted twisted at the waist bumping will off balance with my hip and broke the lock will could have broken my arm and kept hold of me but instead he let go before it could happen all right all right i said going i shambled into the cottage and collapsed onto a sleeping bag that lay on top of a foam camp pad four hours later when will shook me awake i was lying in the exact same position lateafternoon light slanted into the halfruined cottage from the west morgan lay on his own pallet made by stripping the foam mattress from the bunk on the water beetle his eyes were closed his breathing steady will must have carried him up from the boat okay i slurred im up im up georgia has been patrolling the shoreline he said she says theres a boat approaching my heart began beating a little faster and my stomach fluttered i swallowed closed my eyes for a moment and imagined a tranquil tropical beach in an effort to calm my thoughts but the beach kept getting overrun by shapeshifting zombie vampires with mouths on the palms of their hands well thats useless i said in sleepy disgust i got to my feet and gathered my things wheres it coming from west hell have to sail a third of the way around the island then to get through the reefs i yawned wheres georgia claws scraped on hardpacked earth and a large tawny wolf appeared in the doorway she sat down and looked at me her ears perked forward good work i told her molly here harry she called as she hurried into the cottage she held a crystal of white quartz about two inches thick and a foot long in her hands get to work grasshopper dont hesitate to use the crystal if things get dicey and good luck to you she nodded seriously and went to morgans side she reached out and took his limp hand frowned in mild concentration and they both vanished behind one of her wonder veils god be with you harry she said her voice coming out of nowhere will i said get your game face on i turned to will to find the young man gone and a burly darkfurred wolf sitting in his place next to a pile of loose clothes oh i said good i checked my gear my pockets my shoelaces and realized that i had crossed the line between making sure i was ready and trying to postpone the inevitable i straightened my back nodded once and began to stride toward the cottage door lets go people party time it was getting darker over the enormous expanse of the lake twilight is a much different experience when youre far away from the lights of a city or town modern civilization bathes us in light throughout the hours of darknesslighted billboards streetlights headlights airplane lights neon decorations the interior lights of homes and businesses floodlights that strobe across the sky theyre so much a part of our life that the darkness of night is barely a factor in our daily thinking anymore we mock one anothers lack of courage with accusations of being afraid of the dark all the while industriously making our own lights brighter more energy efficient cheaper and longerlasting theres power in the night theres terror in the darkness despite all our accumulated history learning and experience we remember we remember times when we were too small to reach the light switch on the wall and when the darkness itself was enough to makes us cry out in fear get a good ways out from civilizationsay miles and miles away on a lightless lakeand the darkness is there waiting twilight means more than just time to call the children in from playing outside fading light means more than just the end of another day night is when terrible things emerge from their sleep and seek soft flesh and hot blood night is when unseen beings with no regard for what our people have built and no place in what we have deemed the natural order look in at our world from outside and think dark and alien thoughts and sometimes just sometimes they do things i walked down the ancient hillsides of demonreach and felt acutely aware of that fact night wasnt falling so much as sharpening its claws i walked out to the end of the floating dock alone billy and georgia remained behind in the woods you would not believe how sneaky a wolf is capable of being until youve seen one in action wolves acting with humanlevel intelligenceand exceptional human intelligence at thatare all but invisible when they choose to be a boat was rounding the buoy that marked the opening in the reef it was a white rental boat like any number available to tourists in the area a craft about twenty feet long and rigged for waterskiing the wind had risen coming in from the southwest and the lake was getting choppier the rental boat was wallowing a little and bouncing irregularly against the waves throwing up small shocks of spray i watched it come in over the last few hundred yards until i could see who was on board the boat was fairly new its engine made an odd clattering noise which served to identify the occupants the white council it seemed had arrived on time ebenezar mccoy was at the wheel of the boat his bald head shiny in the rain listenstowind sat in the passenger seat wearing a rain poncho one hand gripping the side of the boat the other holding on to the dashboard in front him his weatherseamed face was grim in the center of the rear bench was a tiny figure in white silk embroidered with red flowers ancient mai was chinese and looked as delicate and frail as an eggshell teacup her hair was pure white and long held up with a number of jade combs though she was now old even by the standards of the white council she was still possessed of a sizable portion of what would have been a haunting ethereal beauty in her youth her expression was serene her dark eyes piercing and merciless she frightened me veteran wardens sat on either side of ancient mai dour in their grey cloaks and three more were sitting or crouching elsewhere in the boatall of them from the hardbitten squad that had been on standby back in edinburgh they were all armed to the teeth and their expressions meant business apparently mai scared them at least as much as she did me one of them was holding an umbrella for her i waited at the end of the dock inviting ebenezar by gesture to pull up on the side opposite the water beetle he brought the boat in with considerably more skill than i had shown killed the ailing engine while it was still moving and got up to toss me a line i caught it and secured the boat to the dock without taking my eyes off of anyone in the boat no one spoke once the engine had fallen silent the only sound was rain and wind evening i ventured nodding to ebenezar he was staring hard at me frowning i saw his eyes scan the shoreline and come back to me hoss he said he rose and stepped out onto the dock one of the wardens tossed him another line and he secured the back end of the craft then he got off walked up to me and offered me his hand i shook it rashid he whispered so low i could barely hear it over the rain with us i replied as quietly trying not to move my lips his head tipped me a tiny nod and then he turned to beckon the others wardens and senior council members began clambering out of the boat i walked down the dock beside ebenezar watching the wardens over my shoulder they were the sort of men and women who had no illusions about violence magical or otherwise if they decided that the best way to deal with me would be to shoot me in the back they wouldnt hesitate i stepped off the dock and onto the island again and immediately felt the presence of demonreach at the moment the only persons on the island were those i had brought with me ebenezar followed me and i felt it the instant he stepped onto the shore it wasnt as if someone had whispered in my ear i simply knew felt it the way you know it when an ant is crawling across your arm he stopped a step later and i kept going until i was about ten feet away i turned to face them as their group came down the dock to stand on the shore i kept close track of them through the link with the island making sure that there werent any wardens hiding behind veils so that they could sneak up behind me and start delivering rabbit punches ebenezar ancient mai and listenstowind his expression bearing a faintly greenish cast stood side by side facing me the wardens fanned out behind them wary eyes watching every possible route of approach including from the lake well wizard dresden ebenezar said he leaned on his staff and regarded me blandly we got your note i figured i said did you get as far as the part where i said if you wanted a fight i would oblige you the wardens didnt actually bare their teeth and start snarling but it was close aye aye ebenezar said i thought it might be more profitable if we could talk about things first indeed said ancient mai her voice was too smooth and too confident to match the tiny fragile person speaking in it we can always kill you afterward i didnt actually break out into rivulets of sweat but it was close obviously the disrespect you have offered the white council merits some form of response she continued do not flatter yourself by thinking that we have come to you because we lack other options ebenezar gave mai a mild look at the same time he said your reputation as an investigator is unrivaled within the council that added to the nature of your relationship with the alleged murderer is reason enough to hear what you have to say wizard dresden listenstowind said you said you had proof of morgans innocence you said you had a witness and more i replied and where are they we need to wait a moment i said until everyone arrives ancient mais eyes narrowed the wardens got even more alert and spread out a bit hands on their weaponry what others hoss ebenezar asked everyone directly involved in this plot i said warden morgan wasnt the only one being set up as a patsy when you manage to track down the source of the money found in morgans account youll find that it comes from a corporation owned by the white court listenstowind frowned how do you know this i investigated i said after further investigation i concluded that the money had probably been moved without the knowledge of the white courts leaders the guilty party not only wished lafortier dead and warden morgan to take the blame for it he also wanted to manipulate the council into renewing hostilities with the vampire courts the wardens traded looks with one another when i said that it was getting darker and i had trouble making out their expressions listenstowinds face became thoughtful though and there is proof of this he asked i believe there will be i replied but it might take time to findlonger than the duration of morgans unjust trial and undeserved execution anyway ancient mai suddenly smiled an expression with all the joy and life of frozen porcelain in other words she said whatever measures being taken to veil morgan from our tracking spells were near their limits forcing you to seek this meeting i had to work hard to keep from twitching the only thing worse than scary is smart and scary mai turned to ebenezar it seems obvious that dresden was involved in this plot on some level and if dresden is here morgan is probably nearby arrest dresden and resume attempting to track morgan immediately we can attend to the business in a proper and orderly fashion back at edinburgh ebenezar eyed mai and then looked at listenstowind the old medicine man stared at me for a time and then reached up an inkstained finger to pull back a few loose hairs that had been plastered to his face by the rain he leaned on his staff and looked around the island for a long minute his expression distant no mention was made of other parties being present he said finally this is council business and no one elses adding representatives of the white court to this meeting could prove as disastrous as the war you claim to be trying to avoid wizard dresden ebenezars jaw tensed up thats not the same thing as saying we should arrest him listenstowind faced ebenezar stolidly if what he says is so the truth will come out we can postpone a trial so that if this evidence exists it can be found you know as well as i do ebenezar said that the outcome of the trial is not going to be changed by the truth listentowinds voice became hard and rough holding a deep and burning anger that i had never heard from the old man before there is the world that should be he growled and the world that is we live in one and must create the other ebenezar retorted if it is ever to be listenstowind looked down and shook his head he looked very old and very tired there are no good paths to choose old friend he said quietly all we can do is choose if many die or a few he looked up at me his face hard i am sorry hoss dresden but i must agree arrest him chapter fortyone demonreach allowed me to sense billy and georgia slinking closer and to feel an uncertain sense of excitement that could have been tension or fear or anger coming from them it had a much more vague idea of the emotions of the wardens but i could tell that they werent eager to start a fight with me which made me want to laugh i mean seriously one on one sure maybe i could have been a handful for any of them but there were three members of the senior council there any one of which could have tied me in knots and they had me outnumbered five to one beyond that and then it hit me they were dealing with something far more dangerous than me harry dresden whose battered old volkswagen was currently in the city impound they were dealing with the potential demonic dark lord nightmare warlock theyd been busy fearing since i turned sixteen they were dealing with the wizard who had faced the heirs of kemmler riding a zombie dinosaur and emerged victorious from a fight that had flattened morgan and captain luccio before they had even reached it they were dealing with the man who had dropped a challenge to the entiresenior council and who had then actually showed apparently willing to fighton the shores of an entirely too creepy island in the middle of a freshwater sea granted i technically was that person but they had no idea how close several of those calls had been they didnt know the small details the quirks of fate or the assists from allies i probably didnt deserve that allowed me to shamble out of those clouds of insanity in more or less one piece they just knew that i was the one still standingand that fact inspired a healthy and rational fear more than that they were afraid of what they didnt know i could do and none of them knew that i would so much rather be back in my apartment reading a good book and drinking a cold beer i didnt move when listenstowind made his statement i just stood there as if i wasnt much impressed the council had evidently sent the three senior members as a kind of quorum and i would think that the word of two of them would be enough to decide a course of actionbut the oldest of the wardens there a large man with a big black beard whose name was beorg or yorg or bjorndefinitely scandinavianturned to look at ebenezar the wizard of the ozarks stood looking at me a small smile on his face i recognized the smile when id first gone to live with him after id killed my foster father we would go into town every week for supplies a gang of teenage boys bored reacted to the presence of a new boy with typical adolescent thoughtlessness one of them had tried to get me to fight him at the time i remember being annoyed at the distraction from my day because i had just wiped out a major demon and a former warden of the white council in a pair of fair fights local teenage bullies were really kind of beneath my notice they were kids playing a game and i had grown older very quickly i could have killed them all of them without too much trouble but the very idea was laughable it would have been like using a flamethrower to clean cobwebs out of the house id stood there just looking at them while they tried to tease me into fighting i hadnt moved or said anything or done anything i just stood there in a wall of silence and stillness until that silence had become heavier and heavier they had eventually been pushed back by it and i had simply walked past them and i was doing the same thing again letting the silence fuel their uncertainty i met ebenezars gaze and we both smiled faintly in acknowledgment of the memory well gentlemen ebenezar said turning to face the wardens youve heard the will of the council such as it is but you should be advised that since youd be doing something foolish at the behest of someone acting foolish i wont be assisting you mais head snapped around to focus on ebenezar mccoy ebenezar bowed his head to her wizard mai i would advise you not to seek a quarrel with the young man hes a fair hand in a fight the old woman lifted her chin haughtily he was not truly your apprentice you kept watch over him for a mere two years and came to know him ebenezar said he turned to eye listenstowind what did that raccoon pup you had think of him you go on about what good judges of character young animals can be is he the sort of man who would involve himself in that kind of plot you know the answer listenstowind shook his head tiredly it isnt about that and you know it if you do not assist us in subduing him mai said her voice crisp and thrumming with tension it could be considered treason wizard mccoy i am assisting you ebenezar said by advising you to avoid conflict he paused and said you might try asking him excuse me mai said asking him ebenezar said he hooked a thumb in one strap of his overalls ask him politely to come with you back to edinburgh maybe hed cooperate dont bother sir i said i wont ancient mai rumbled warden bjork if you would please return to the boat we will see to this i remained just as id been standing and hoped that the others would be arriving soon i didnt want to start up the dance music until everyone had taken the floor but if the wardens pressed me i might need to ancient mai warden yorgi repeated do you wish us to he didnt get to finish the phrase before there was a deafening roar and a helicopter swept over the hillside behind us flying about an inch and a half above the treetops it soared past us and then banked around in a turn over the lake only to return and hover thirty feet above the shoreline maybe a hundred yards away in the movies special forces guys come zipping down on lines ive even been the guy on a line once sort of though i was more sack of meal than navy seal but when the people jumping off the helicopter are vampires you dont bother with a lot of lines or any lines at all three figures in white leapt from the hovering chopper neatly flipped once on the way down and landed together in a dancers crouch then they all rose the movement as beautiful smooth and coordinated as anything youd see at the cirque du soleil lara and her two sisters walked toward us and they were good at it lara was wearing a white sundress that showed off her curves with two black leather belts that crossed on her hips a handgun in a holster hung from one of the belts the other belt supported a sword a genuine rapier whose worn handle looked as if it had seen actual use her long black hair was pulled up in a net and the top of her head was covered in a white cloth a very gypsy sort of look she wore a choker made of pure platinum the metal seeming to hold its own glow even in the failing light and a single large bloodred ruby hung from it as she walked it was impossible not to notice the gorgeously feminine curves of her body the casual sway of her hips from side to side each movement emphasizing the fact that she carried deadly weapons and since it was raining on her white dress it was impossible not to notice a whole lot of other things about larasuch as the fact that other than the weapons and her shoes it was all she was wearing i concentrated on keeping my tongue from hanging down past my chin and forced my eyes to look elsewhere her sisters were wearing much different gear though they also wore white they had both donned what looked like motorcycle leathersnot like archetypical american bikers but more like the gear you see professional racing motorcyclists wearing it looked very hightech and was obviously armored in standard gear the armor was heavy plastic there to protect the rider in the event of a collision or a fall i was willing to bet that it had been upgraded to something a lot stronger in the raiths gear they too were equipped with sidearms of both the past and present their hair was tied up and back and like lara their skin was pale their eyes were wide and grey their lips dark and inviting i watched the three raith sisters come and thought to myself that if there was any justice in the universe i would get to watch that in slow motion alas out of the corner of my eye i saw mai calmly lift a hand to warden berserkergang motioning him to stand down it didnt surprise me ancient mai had very strong notions of proper behavior and how it ought to be followed she would never condone observable division amongst members of the council where outsiders could witness it lara stopped twenty feet away and her sisters stopped a couple of feet behind her their eyes were on the wardens who returned the vampires stares with calm attention harry she said her voice warm as if wed just run into one another at a soiree you are a wicked wicked man you didnt tell me id have to share you with others tonight what can i say i asked turning to face lara i smiled at her and bowed my head without taking my eyes off her it was a more enjoyable paranoia than id observed for the wardens if no less wary i used to be a trusting gentle soul but the rigors of the cruel world have made me cynical and cautious lara looked from the wardens to me her expression speculative then she gave them a smile that could have melted plate steel and walked to me somehow making a swagger look perfectly feminine she extended both hands to me as she came i smiled in return though mine was a lot stiffer and more artificial and whispered through my smiling teeth you have got to be kidding she cast her eyes down demurely toning the smile down to a smirk and breathed be nice to me wizard mine and ill return the favor i dont think i hesitated very long before i offered her my hands in return we clasped them her fingers were silkensmooth and very cold she smiled radiantly and inclined her head to me a slow graceful formal gesture then faster than i could blink much less move she smacked me in the kisser she used her open hand which prevented the blow from being a lethal one even so it hit like a club it knocked me several steps back spinning me as i went and i wound up caught in a drunken corkscrew that ended with my ass hitting the ground ten feet away once again you have lied to us lara snarled used us i have had my fill of your deceits wizard i sat there with my mouth open wondering if my jaw would start wobbling bonelessly in the rising breeze fury radiated from her in a cold sphere and every fiber of her body looked ready to do violence she faced me with the members of the council on her left the darkness of the forest on her right i focused on my shield bracelet certain that there was every possibility that she might be about to draw her gun and plug me if my brother is not returned to me whole this night she continued her voice cold and deadly there will be blood between us and my honor will not be satisfied until one of us lies dead on the dueling ground and then she winked at me with her right eye do you understand she demanded uh i said trying to move my jaw it was apparently whole yeah message received arrogant child she spat on the ground in my direction then she turned and walked purposefully toward the senior council members she stopped about ten feet from ancient mai just before the wardens standing behind her would have snapped and started hurling thunder and fury she came to a graceful stance of attention and then bowed rather deeply to ancient mai mais face revealed nothing she returned the gesture bowing less deeply it is a pleasure to meet you in the flesh lara said you must be ancient mai lara raith mai replied i had not anticipated your presence at this meeting nor i yours she gave me a rather disgusted glance courtesy it seems is a devalued commodity in this world she bowed again to ebenezar and listenstowind and greeted them by name your reputations gentlemen precede you injun joe nodded without speaking lady raith ebenezar said calmly touch that boy again and the only things left for your kin to bury will be your fivehundreddollar shoes ai ya ancient mai said in a flat tone lara paused at ebenezars statement it didnt rattle her precisely but she gave ebenezar another look and then inclined her head to him gentlemen lady obviously we both have urgent concerns that must be addressed equally obviously none of us anticipated the presence of the other and a violent incident would benefit no one on behalf of the white court i propose a formal agreement of nonaggression for the duration of this meeting ancient mai gave ebenezar a hard look then lifted her chin slightly and turned away somehow giving the impression that she had formally dismissed him from reality agreed she said on behalf of the council i accept the proposal i managed to stagger back to verticality my wounded head felt like lara had split it open and id have a handshaped bruise on my cheek but i wasnt going to sit there moaning about getting slapped by a girl granted the girl was hundreds of years old and could change a fire trucks tires without using a jack but there was a principle at work here i got to my feet and then walked carefully over to stand beside ebenezar facing the vampires one of the wardens there made a little room for me all his attention focused forward on lara and her sisters heh they were much more comfortable with me when i was aimed at an enemy i tried to keep a running portion of my awareness focused on demonreach i had done as much as i could in assembling this group i was counting on my estimate of the killer to take it to the next level and until he showed up i had to keep stringing both lara and the council along the best way to do that for the moment was to keep quiet and let them talk i suppose the first thing we must do is share knowledge lara said to ancient mai would you prefer it if i went first mai considered that for a moment and then bowed her head in a slight acknowledgment lara proceeded without further ado my brother thomas raith has been taken by a skinwalker one of the ancient naagloshii the skinwalker has offered an exchange my brother for warden donald morgan mai tilted her head to one side how is dresden involved in this matter he claims that he is attempting to establish warden morgans innocence in some sort of matter internal to the council as a gesture of goodwill to the council and to help keep the peace within chicago i have instructed my brother to offer reasonably lowrisk aid and assistance to dresden she glanced at me he has abused my good intentions repeatedly this time he somehow involved my brother in his investigation and thomas was ambushed by the skinwalker and that is all mai asked lara glared at me again and seemed to visibly force herself to take a moment to think he claims that a third party was behind warden morgans predicament and attempting to set the court against the council to my surprise my own investigation did not immediately disprove his statements as lies it seems possible that one of my financial managers may have been somehow coerced into embezzling the contents of a considerable account dresden claims the money was sent to an account that was made to appear to belong to warden morgan mai nodded was it lara shrugged elegantly it is possible my people are working to find evidence that will establish what happened more precisely mai nodded and was still for several seconds before she said despite how carefully you have danced around the subject you know exactly why we are here lara smiled very slightly the tale dresden tells us lacks the credibility of simplicity mai continued despite how carefully you have danced around saying the actual words it seems that you wish us to believe that the white court was not involved in the matter of lafortiers death thus your story too lacks the credibility of simplicity in my experience matters of state are rarely simple ones lara responded mai moved a hand a tiny gesture that somehow conveyed acknowledgment yet given recent history the actions of a known enemy seem a far more likely source for lafortiers murder than those of some nameless faceless third party of course you are after all wizards lara said without a detectable trace of irony you are the holders of great secrets if such a group existed you would surely know of it it is possible that i am unfairly judging your people in accusing them of plotting lafortiers death mai replied her voice utterly tranquil you are after all vampires and wellknown for your forthright and gentle natures lara inclined her head smiling faintly regardless we find ourselves here that seems incontrovertible i seek the safe return of my brother mai shook her head firmly once the white council will not exchange one of our own it seems to me lara said that warden morgan is not in your company a transitory situation mai said she didnt look at me but i felt sure that the steel in her voice was aimed in my direction then perhaps a cooperative effort lara said we need not allow the skinwalker to take the warden those who ally themselves with the white court come to regret it mai replied the council has no obligation to assist you or your brother despite the recent efforts made on your behalf by my king and his court lara asked mai faced her without blinking and said nothing more he is my blood lara said quietly i will have him returned i appreciate your loyalty mai said in a tone that suggested she didnt however this matter of the skinwalker wishing an exchange is hardly germane to where we stand at the moment actually i said it kind of is ancient mai i had someone tell shagnasty where to meet me tonight depending on how he crosses the water he could be here any moment ebenezar blinked then he turned his face to me his expression clearly asking whether or not i was out of my damned mind wile e coyote i said to him soberly suuuuuuper genius i saw him thinking and i recognized it when my old mentor got it when he understood my plan i could tell because he got that look on his face ive only seen when he knows things are about to go spectacularly wrong and he wants to be ready for it he let his staff fall to rest against his chest and idly dug in a pocket his eyes flicking across the woods around us i dont know where mais head was or if she worked out anything at all i had a feeling that she wouldnt since her thought processes would all have to start from given assumptions that were incorrect she didnt have much of a chance of coming to a correct conclusion all that means she said to me is that it would be wise to finish our business here and retreat from this place sadly i am reaching a similar conclusion lara said deliberately perhaps it is time for this meeting to adjourn behind her one of her sisters shifted one hand very slightly lightning flashed overhead and thunder forced a pause into the conversation the wind picked up again and listenstowind suddenly lifted his head his gaze snapped around to the north and his eyes narrowed an instant later i sensed a new presence on the island more people had just touched down onto the far side of the bald hill where demonreach tower stood there were twelve of them and they began moving toward the hilltop at inhuman speed white court vampires they had to be seconds later another pair of humanlike presences simply appeared in the woods four hundred yards away and if that wasnt enough two more people arrived on the northwest shore of the island mai took immediate note of injun joes expression and tilted her head staring hard at lara what have you done she demanded i have signaled my family lara replied calmly i did not come here to fight you ancient mai but i willrecover my brother i focused on the two smaller groups both of them pairs of new presences and found that their numbers were growing on the beach many many more pairs of feet had begun beating the ground of demonreach thirty of them or more in the forest nearby a presence that the island had never before encountered appeared followed by more and more and more of the same there was only one explanation for thatthe new arrivals were calling forth muscle from the nevernever i was betting that the pair on the beach was madeline and binder and that he had begun calling out his grey men the moment his feet hit the ground the two who had simply appeared in the forest had to have taken a way and emerged from the nevernever onto the island directly it was possible a second summoning like binders was under way but i thought it far more likely that someone had gathered up support and brought it with them through the way meanwhile mai and lara were beginning to bare their claws is that a threat vampire mai said in a flat tone i would prefer that you regard it as a truth lara replied her own tone losing the charm and conviviality it had contained in some measure throughout the conversation the wardens behind me started getting nervous i could feel it both for myself and through demonreach i heard leather creak as hands were put to the grips of holstered guns and upon hilts of swords lara in response rested her fingertips lightly upon her own weapons her two sisters did the same wait i snapped wait everyone turned to look at me i must have looked like a raving madman standing there with my eyes half focused looking back and forth out of pure instinct and force of habit as the islands intellectus informed me of the rapidly transpiring events the white court reinforcements had bypassed the tower hill and were headed for the beach to support larawhich was something at least laras helicopter hadnt dropped them up there specifically to look for morgan it must have come up low from the north using the terrain of the hilltop to mask the sound of its arrival i forced my attention back to the scene around me holy crap i knew this would put the pressure on him but this guys gone to war what listenstowind asked what are you talking about dont start in on one another i snapped lara we need to work together or were all dead she turned her head a little to one side staring at me why because better than a hundredone hundred ten nowbeings have just arrived at different points of the island and they arent here to cater the little mixer weve got going there are only nine of us and fifteen of you were outnumbered five to one six to one now mai stared at me what howls slithered into the air muffled by the falling rain but were made all the more eerie by the lack of direction to them i recognized them at oncebinders grey men they were coming moving with mindless purpose that cared nothing for the danger of a forest at night the second group was nearer theyd stopped growing at a hundred and twentyfive and were already on the move toward us they werent as fast as the grey men but they were moving steadily and spreading out into an enormous curved line meant to sweep the forest and then encircle their quarry when they found it red light began to pour through the trees in their direction casting eerie black shadows and turning the rain to blood i forced myself to think to ask demonreach the right questions a seconds consideration revealed that the two forces would converge on us at exactly the same timethey were working together the numbers disadvantage was too great the wardens might get some spells off and the senior council members would probably leave mounds of corpses piled around thembut outnumbered six to one on a dark night when they would have trouble seeing their targets before they were within a few steps they wouldnt prevail the large group would hit them from one side and the smaller one would come from the other boxing us in unless unless we could get to one of the two groups first and eliminate it before its partner reached us and hit us from behind outnumbered as hideously as we were the smartest thing would have been to run like hellbut i knew that no one would the council still had to recover morgan lara still had to recover thomas neither of them enjoyed the advantage i did to them the danger was only a vague threat some howls in the dark and it would remain so until it was too late to run which left us only one option we had to attack the grey men howled again from much closer i gave ebenezar a desperate glance and then stepped forward lifting my staff theyve got us boxed in our only chance is to fight our way clear everyone with me lara and her sisters stared at me in confusion the wardens did the samebut the fear in my voice and on my face was very real and when one human being displays a fear response those nearby it tend to find it psychologically contagious the wardens eyes immediately went to ancient mai i started jogging beckoning as i went and ebenezar immediately fell in with me you heard the man ebenezar roared wardens lets move at his bellow the dam broke and the wardens surged forward to join us lara stared at me for another half a second and then cried go go to her sisters they began running with us effortlessly keeping pace their motion so graceful and light that it hardly seemed possible that they would leave footprints i looked over my shoulder as i slowly increased the pace ancient mai had turned toward the hateful red glare coming from the forest to the south facing it calmly wizard listenstowind with me let us see if we can slow the progress of whatever is coming this way injun joe went to her side and the two of them stood there gathering their will and muttering to each other i consulted demonreach for the best route to follow toward the enemy put my head down and charged the demons that were coming to kill us wardens and vampires alike at my side chapter fortytwo adrenaline does weird things to your head you hear people talk about how everything slows down that isnt the case nothing is happening slowly its just that you somehow seem to be able to fit a whole lot more thinking into the time and space thats there it might feel like things have slowed down but its a transitory illusion for example i had time to reflect upon the nature of adrenaline and time while sprinting through the woods at night it didnt make me run any faster though although if i wasnt actually moving my arms and legs faster than normal then why was i twenty feet ahead of everyone else the vampires included i heard someone curse in the dark behind me as they tripped over an exposed root i didnt trip it wasnt that i had become more gracefuli just knew where to put my feet it was as if every step i took was over a path that i had walked so many times that it had become ingrained in my muscle memory i knew when to duck out of the way of a lowhanging branch when to bound forward at an angle to my last step in order to clear an old stump exactly how much i needed to shorten a quick pair of steps so that i could leap a sinkhole by pushing off my stronger leg lara raith herself was hardpressed to keep pace with me though she managed to close to within three or four yards her pale skin all but glowing in the dark the whole time i tried to keep track of the position of the enemy it wasnt a simple matter i didnt have a big map of the island in my head with glowing dots marking their positions i just knewwhere they were as long as i concentrated on keeping track of them but as the number of enemies continued to increase it got harder to keep track the nearest of the hostile presences was about forty yards away when i lifted my fingers to my lips and let out a sharp whistle out there in front of me i shouted now toot it had been an enormous pain in the ass to wrap fireworks in plastic to waterproof them against the rain and even more of a pain to make sure that a waterproof match was attached to each of the rockets roman candles and miniature mortars when i had molly and will scatter them around the woods in twenty separate positions id gotten those is he crazy looks from both of them after all it isnt as if fireworks are heavyduty weaponry capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm and wholesale destruction theyre just loud and bright and distracting which under the circumstances was more or less all i needed toottoot and half a dozen members of the guard came streaking out of nowhere miniature comets flashing through the vertical shadows of the trees they went zipping ahead alighting on low branches and then tiny lights flickered as waterproof matches were set to fuses a second later a tiny shrill trumpet shrieked from somewhere ahead of us and a dozen roman candles began shooting balls of burning chemicals out into the darkness illuminating the crouched running forms of at least ten of binders grey men in their cheap suits not fifty feet away they froze at the sudden appearance of the flashing pyrotechnics attempting to assess them as threats and determine where they were coming from perfect i dropped to one knee lifting my blasting rod as the humanseeming demons shrieked at the sudden appearance of the bright lights i trained it on the nearest hesitating grey man slammed my will down through the wooden haft and snarled fuego it was more difficult to do than it would have been if it hadnt been raining but it was more than up to the task a javelin of redgold flame hissed through the rain leaving a trail of white steam behind it it touched the nearest of the grey men on one flank and his cheap suit went up as readily as if it was lined with tar instead of rayon the grey man yawled and began thrashing furiously the fire engulfed him throwing out light for a good thirty yards in every direction and illuminating his companions i dropped flat and an instant later the forest behind me belched forth power and death guns roared on full automatic fire that would be the raiths lara and her sisters sidearms had been modified submachine guns with an enlarged ammunition clip given the superhuman strength perception and coordination the vampires had at their disposal they didnt suffer the same difficulties a human shooter would have faced running at full speed in the dark firing a weapon meant to be braced by a shooters entire upper body in one handand their left hands at that bullets chewed into three different grey men ten or eleven rounds each all of them hitting between the neck and temple blasting the demons back to ectoplasm then it was the wardens turn fire was the weapon of choice when it came to combat magic though it was taxing upon the will and physical stamina of the wizard it got a lot of energy concentrated into a relatively small space it illuminated darkness something that was nearly always to a wizards advantageand it hurt every living thing had at least a healthy respect if not an outright fear of fire even more to the point fire was a purifying force in its nonphysical aspect dark magic could be consumed and destroyed by fire when used with that intent the wardens used the zipping little fireballs from the roman candles and my own improvised funeral pyre to target their own spells and then the realfireworks started each individual wizard has his own particular quirks when it comes to how he uses his power there is no industrial standard for how fire is evoked into use in battle one of the wardens coming up behind me sent forth a stream of tiny stars that slewed through the night like machinegun fire effortlessly burning holes through trees rocks and grey men with equal disdain another sent a stream of fire up in a high arc and it crashed down among several grey men splashing and clinging to any moving thing it struck like napalm lances of scarlet and blue and green fire burned through the air reminding me for a mad moment of a scene from a star wars movie steam hissed and snarled everywhere as a swath of woodland forty yards across and half as deep vanished into light and fury hells bells i mean id seen wardens at work before but it had all been fairly precise controlled work this was pure destruction wholesale industrialstrength and the heat of it was so intense that it sucked the air out of my lungs the grey men though werent impressed either they werent bright enough to attempt to preserve their own existence or they just didnt care they scattered as they advanced spreading out some of them rushed forward low to the ground and half hidden by the brush others bounded into the trees and came leaping and swinging forward branch by branch still more of them darted to the sides out of the harsh glare of the fires spreading out around us toot i screamed over the roaring chaos go after the flankers a tiny trumpet added its own notes to the din and the pizza patrol zipped out into the woods two or three of the little faeries working together to carry fresh roman candles they gleefully kept on with the fireworks sending the little sulfurous balls of flame chasing the grey men trying to slip around us through the shadows marking their positions lara let out a piercing call and came up to my side gun in hand snapping off snarling bursts every time a target presented itself i pointed to either side and said theyre getting around us weve got to stop them from taking mai and injun joe from behind laras eyes snapped left and right and she said something to her sisters in ancient etruscan the tongue of the white court one of them went in either direction vanishing into the dark a grey man came crashing out of the flame twenty feet away from me blazing like a grease fire he showed absolutely no concern for the flame he just sprinted forward and leapt at me hands spread wide i made it up to my knees and braced one end of my quarterstaff against the ground aiming the other at the grey mans center of mass the staff struck it but not squarely it twisted to one side at the impact bounced off the ground took a fraction of a second to reorient itself on me and erupted into a cloud of ectoplasm as rounds from laras gun took its head apart the next attacker was already on the way out in the darkness beyond the firelight i came to my feet and on pure instinct snapped off another blast of fire at the empty air twenty feet beyond lara and about ten feet up there was nothing there as i released the blast and i knew it but as the fire hissed through the falling rain it illuminated the form of a grey man in the midst of a spectacular leap that would have ended at the small of laras back the blast struck him and hammered him to one side so that he came down like a burning jet crashing across a dozen yards of ground before dissolving into flamelicked mounds of swiftly vanishing transparent jelly lara didnt see the attacker until hed tumbled past oh she said her voice conversational that was gentlemanly of you dresden ive been known to pull out chairs and open doors too i said how very unfashionable lara said her pale eyes gleaming and endearing ebenezar stumped up to us staff in hand his eyes narrow and flickering all around us while wardens continued to send blasts of power hammering into targets off in the woods behind us submachine guns chattered apparently laras sisters were still hunting the grey men who had gotten around us weve got one warden down ebenezar said how bad one of those things came out of a tree above her and tore her head off he said i tracked a slight motion in a nearby treetop and swiveled to point a finger sir up there ebenezar grunted a word reached out a hand and made a sharp pulling motion the grey man who had been clambering toward us was seized by an unseen force ripped out of the tree and sent sailing on an arc that would land it in lake michigan a quarter of a mile from the nearest shore where is the second group ebenezar asked i thought about it theyre at the dock at the edge of the trees theyre closing on mai and injun joe i glanced at lara i think the vampires have been holding them off ebenezar spat a curse that summoner is still out there somewhere his pets wont last long in this rain but we cant afford to give him time to call up more can you find him i checked there was so much confusion and motion on the island that demonreach had trouble distinguishing one being from another but i had a solid if nonspecific idea of where binder was yeah i sensed more movement and pointed behind us to where a trio of grey men had managed to close on a pair of wardens who were standing on either side of a still redspattered form on the ground there ebenezar stopped talking to make another swift gesture spoke a word and one of the approaching grey men was suddenly and literally pounded flat by an invisible anvil ectoplasmic ichor flew everywhere the two wardens warned by the magical strike and now facing even odds made short work of the remaining two ebenezar turned back to me and said shut down that summoner hoss im taking the wardens back to support injun joe and mai lets go vampire no lara said if binder is nearby then so is my sweet cousin madeline ill stay with dresden ebenezar didnt argue with her he just snarled made a fist and lifted it up and lara let out a short choking cry and rose up ten feet into the air her arms and legs snapping down straight locking her body into a rigid board i put a hand against his chest wait he glanced at me from beneath shaggy grey brows let her down she can come along ebenezar had no way of knowing that i wasnt out there alone georgia and will were lurking nearby and could be at my side in a couple of seconds if necessary between the two of them they had accounted for three grey men too i tried to put that knowledge behind a very slight emphasis in my tone and told him ill be fine ebenezar frowned at me then shot a glance out at the woods and gave me a reluctant nod he turned back to lara and released her from the grip of his will she didnt quite manage to fall gracefully and landed in a sprawl that gave me a great look at her long intriguingly lovely legs the old man eyed her and said you just remember what i told you missy she rose to her feet her expression unreadablebut i knew her well enough to know that she was furious my old mentor had just insulted her on multiple levels not the least of which was pointing out to her exactly how easy it would be for him to make good on his previous threat ill remember she said her tone frosty wardens ebenezar said on me the old man broke into a woodsmans lope a shufflefooted loosekneed gait that managed unpredictable terrain well and covered ground with deceptive speed the four remaining wardens fell into a wedge shape behind him and they moved out heading south back toward the docks and the confrontation with whoever had come forth from the nevernever with his own army lara turned to me and nodded her head once gesturing me to lead i tried to fix binders presence firmly in mind and was certain he was ahead of us and to the north probably trying to circle widely around the scene of the battle with his minions i started out through the woods again pushing myself to move faster this time lara stayed close behind me she mimicked my movements down to the length of my stride taking advantage of my instinctive knowledge of demonreach i have little interest in this mercenary she said to me as we ran she wasnt even breathing hard do with him as you would but madeline is mine she might know something i said i cant believe anyone with half a mind would entrust her with knowledge of any importance and i cant believe the treacherous bitch wouldnt steal every bit of information she could find to use against whoever shes working with i replied glancing back lara didnt dispute the statement but her eyes hardened like silver mirrors reflecting the dancing flames that were still burning here and there as we moved through the site of the battle and out the other side madeline has betrayed me my house and my court she is mine i prefer you remained a living breathing ally you will not interfere what do you say to something like that i shut my mouth and concentrated on finding binder it took us about five minutes to reach the piece of shoreline where binder and his companion had come ashore a pair of jet skis lay discarded on the beach so thats how theyd done it the tiny craft would have no problems at all skimming over the stone reefs surrounding the island though they would have been hellish to ride in the rough water we swung past the discarded equipment and up a little ridgeline running along a deer trail i knew we were getting close and suddenly lara accelerated past me supernaturally fleet of foot on the even ground i dont know what triggered the explosion it might have been a tripwire stretched across the trail its possible that it was detonated manually too there was a flash of light and something hit me in the chest hard enough to knock me down an ugly asymmetrical shape was burned into my vision as i lay on my back trying to sort out what had just happened then my body tingled and madeline raith appeared over me i realized that she was straddling me there was a fire burning somewhere close by illuminating her she was wearing a black surfers wet suit with short arms and legs unzipped past her navel she held a mostly empty bottle of tequila in one hand her eyes were wide and shining with a disorienting riot of colors as she leaned down and kissed me on the forehead and and hells freaking bells the pleasure that surged through me from that simple touch was delicious to the point of pain every nerve ending in my entire body lit up as though someone had run up the wattage on my pleasure centers or injected their engines with nitrous i felt my body arch up and shudder a purely sexual reaction to a physical bliss that went far beyond sexuality i stayed that way locked into a quivering arch of ecstasy it took maybe ten or fifteen seconds to subside from a kiss on the forehead god no wonder people came back to the vampires for more i could barely register what was happening around me so i only dimly noticed when madeline produced a gun of her own the other favorite model of those with more than human strengtha desert eagle good night sweet wizard madeline purred her hips grinding a slow rhythm against mine she drew the halfinchwide mouth of the gun over my cheek as she took a slug of tequila and then rested the guns barrel gently on the spot shed just kissed it felt obscenely good like a caress on skin that has just been shaved smooth but hasnt yet been touched i knew that she was about to kill me but i couldnt stop thinking how good it felt and flights of angels she panted her breath coming faster her eyes alight with excitement sing thee to thy rest chapter fortythree i was still sorting things out after the titanic wallop the explosion had given the inside of my skull when a darkfurred wolf emerged from the shadows of the night and slammed into madeline raith like a loaded armored car i heard bones breaking under the impact and she was ripped off me by the force of the dark wolfs rush will didnt stop there hed already hammered her once and he knew better than to try his strength infighting with a vampire even if the members of the white court were physically the weakest of the breed he hit the ground and bounded away into the dark madeline screamed in surprised rage and her gun went off several times but im not sure you could call it shooting she was on her knees firing that big old desert eagle with one delicate hand and holding the nowbroken tequila bottle in the other when a sandy brown wolf swept by on silent paws and ripped at madelines weapon hand with her fangs the rip went deep into the muscles and tendons of madelines forearm an almost surgically precise attack the gun tumbled from her fingers and she whirled to swing the broken bottle at georgia but she was no more eager for a fair fight than will had been and by the time madeline turned georgia was already bounding awayand will unnoticed was on his way back in again fangs flashed pale raith blood flowed the two wolves rushed back and forth in perfect rhythm never giving the vampire a chance to pin one of them down when madeline finally realized how they were working her she attempted to reverse herself suddenly the same instant georgia began to retreat to meet wills rush squarelybut will and georgia had learned their trade from a real wolf and theyd had eight years of what amounted to lowintensity but deadly earnest combat duty defending several square blocks around the university from the depredations of both supernatural and mortal predators they knew when the reverse was coming and georgia simply pirouetted on her paws and blindsided madeline again the vampire screamed in frustrated rage she was furiousand she was slowing down the members of the white court were flesh and blood beings they bled bleed them enough and they would die i forced myself to start using my head again finally shaking off the effects of both madelines psychotically delicious kiss and the concussion of whatever had exploded i realized that i was covered with small cuts and scratches that i was otherwise fine and that binder was less than twenty feet away will georgia i screamed gun the wolves leapt out of sight and vanished into the forest with barely a leaf disturbed by their movements half a second before binder came out of the woods a semiautomatic assault shotgun pressed against his shoulder the mercenary was dressed in a wet suit as well though hed put on a combat jacket and equipment harness over it and wore combat boots on his feet binder aimed the weapon after will and georgia and started rapidly hammering the woods with shells more or less at random everyone thinks that shotgun pellets spread out to some ridiculous degree and that if you aim a shotgun at a garage door and pull the trigger youll be able to drive a car through the resulting hole that isnt so even when a shotgun has a very very short barrel which allows the load of pellets to spread out more a longerbarreled weapon like binders will only spread the pellets out to about the size of my spread fingers at a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards odds were good that he hadnt hit a damned thing and given his experience he probably knew it he must have kept up the salvo to increase the intimidation factor and force the wolves to stay on the run in the heat and adrenaline of a battle gunshots can be hard to count but i knew he fired eight times i knew because through demonreach i could feel the eight brass and plastic shell casings lying on the ground around him he stood protectively over madeline as he reached into his pockets presumably to reload the weapon with fresh shells i didnt give him the chance i pulled my out of my duster pocket sat up and tried to stop wobbling i sighted on his center mass and pulled the trigger the revolver roared and binders left leg flew out from beneath him as if someone had hit it with a twentypound mallet he let out a yelp of what sounded more like surprise than pain and hit the ground hard in the odd little beat of heavy silence that came after the shot i almost felt sorry for the guy hed had a tough couple of days i heard him suck in a quick breath and clench his teeth over a howl of pain madeline whirled toward me her dark hair gone stringy and flat in the rain her eyes burned pure white as the hunger the demon inside her fed her more and more of its power and asserted more and more control her wet suit had been torn open in several places and palerthanhuman blood smeared her palerthanhuman flesh she wasnt moving as well as she should have been but she stalked toward me in a hunters crouch deliberate and steady my bells were still ringing hard and i didnt think i had time or focus to pull together a spell and besides my gun was already right there it seemed like it would be a waste not to use it i sighted on the spot where madelines heart should have been and shot her in the belly which wasnt terrible marksmanship under the circumstances she cried out and staggered to one knee then she looked up her empty white eyes furious and stood up continuing toward me i shot again and missed then repeated myself i gripped the gun with both hands clenching my teeth as i did knowing i only had two more rounds the next shot ripped a piece of meat the size of a racquetball out of one of her biceps sending her down to one knee and drawing another scream before she could start moving again i aimed and fired the last round it hit her in the sternum almost exactly between her wet suit contoured breasts she jerked her breath exploding from her in a little huff of surprise she swayed her eyelids fluttering and i thought she was about to fall but she didnt the vampires empty white eyes focused on me and her mouth spread into a maniacs sneer she reached down and picked up her own fallen weapon she had to do it lefthanded the right was covered in a sheet of blood and flopped limply running low on options i threw my empty gun at her face she batted my revolver aside with the desert eagle you madeline said her voice hollow and wheezing are a bad case of herpes wizard youre inconvenient embarrassing no real threat and you simplywill not go away bitch i replied wittily i still hadnt gotten my head back together everythings relative right dont kill him binder rasped madeline shot him a look that could freeze vodka what binder was sitting on the ground his shotgun was farther away than he could reach he must have tossed it there because when he had fallen it was still in his hands binder had realized precisely how badly the fight had gone for his side that he had been lamed and therefore probably could not escape and he was making damned sure that he didnt look armed and dangerous death curse he said breathing hard he could level the island with it i drew in my breath lifted my chin and tried to keep my eyes from slipping out of focus boom i said solemnly madeline looked bad one of the bullets might have opened an artery it was hard to tell in the neardarkness perhaps youre right binder she said if he was a better shot i suppose i might be in trouble as it is im inconvenienced her eyes widened slightly and her tongue lashed quickly over her lips and i need to feed if im to repair it she lowered the gun as if it had suddenly become too heavy to keep supporting dont worry binder she said when hes screaming my name he wont be cursing anyone and even if he tries it she shivered ill bet it will taste incredible she came closer all pale skin and mangled flesh and my body suddenly went insane with lust stupid body it had a lot more clout at the moment than it usually did with my mind still reeling from the blast i aimed a punch at madelines face she caught my hand as the weak blow came in and kissed the inside of my wrist sweet silver lightning exploded up my arm and down my spine whatever was left of my brain went away and the next thing i knew she was pressing her chest against mine her mouth against mine slowly sensuously overbearing me and then a burned corpse came out of the woods that was all i could think of to describe it half the body was blacker than a hamburger that had fallen through the bars of a charcoal grill the rest was red and purple and swollen with bruises and bloody blisters with very very occasional strips of pale white skin a few wisps of dark hair were attached to her skull i say her because technically the corpse was female though that hardly mattered amongst all the burned and pulverized meat that smelled slightly of tequila the only things i really recognized were the cold silver eyes lara raiths eyes were bright with an insane rage and a terrible hunger as she snaked her bruised swollen left arm around madelines windpipe and tightened it with a horrible strength madeline cried out as her head was jerked back sharplyand then she made no sound at all as the wind was trapped inside her lungs the burned blackened corpse that was lara raith dug one fireruined hip into madelines upper back using madelines own spine as a fulcrum against her lara spoke and her voice was something straight from hell it was lower smokier but every bit as lovely as it ever was madeline she purred ive wanted to do this with you since we were little girls laras burned black right hand withered it seemed down to bones and sinew reached slowly sensually around madelines straining abdomen slowly very slowly lara sunk her fingertips into flesh just beneath the floating rib on madelines left flank madelines face contorted and she tried to scream lara shuddered her shoulders twisted and she ripped an open furrow as wide as her four fingers across madelines stomach pale flesh parting as wet red and greythings slithered out laras tongue emerged from her mouth bright pink and touched madelines earlobe listen to me she hissed her burned hand continued pulling things out of madelines body a hideous intimacy listen to me power shuddered in those words i felt an insane desire to rush toward laras ruined flesh and give her my ears ripped off with my own fingers if necessary madeline shuddered the strength gone out of her body her mouth continued trying to move but her eyes went unfocused at the power in laras voice for once in your life lara continued kissing madelines throat with her burned broken lips you are going to be useful madelines eyes rolled back in her head and her body sagged helplessly back against lara my brain got back onto the clock i pushed myself away from lara and madelines nauseating horribly compelling embrace binder was sitting with his hands over his ears his eyes squeezed tightly shut i grabbed him under the arms and hauled him away from the entwined raiths maybe fifty yards downhill through some thick brush and around the bole of a large old hickory tree binder was obviously in pain as i pulled himand he was pushing with his unwounded leg doing his best to assist me bloody hell he panted as i set him down bloody hell and brimstone i staggered and sat down across from him panting to get my breath back and to push the sight of lara devouring madeline out of my head no kidding some of the bloody fools ive known binder said cant stop talking about how tragic they are the poor lonely vampires how theyre just like us bloody idiots yeah i said my voice raw we sat there for a few seconds from up the slope there was a low soft and eager cry we shuddered and tried to look as if we hadnt heard anything binder stared at me for a moment and then said why once lara got going she might not be able to stop shed have eaten you too too right binder agreed fervently but that aint the question why somebody has to be human binder looked at me as if i was speaking in a language hed never been very good at and hadnt heard in years then he looked sharply down and away he nodded without looking up and said cheers mate fuck you i told him tiredly how bad are you hit broke the bone i think he said didnt come out didnt hit anything too bad or id be gone by now hed already tied a strip of cloth tightly around the wound his wet suit was probably aiding it in acting as a pressure bandage who was madeline working for i asked he shook his head she didnt tell me think i said think hard all i know he said is that it was some bloke with a lot of money i never talked to him when she was on the phone with him they spoke english he wasnt a native speaker sounded like hed learned it from a continental i frowned television has most people confident that they could identify the nationality of anyone speaking english but in the real world accents could be muddy as hell especially when you learned from a nonnative speaker try to imagine the results for example of a polish man learning english from a german teaching at a belgian university the resulting accent would twist a linguists brain into knots i eyed binder can you get out of here on your own he shivered this place i bloody well can i nodded binder was responsible for the death of a warden but it wasnt as though it had been personal i could bill that charge to madeline raiths corpse do business in my town or against the council again and ill kill you clear crystal mate crystal i got up and started to go i didnt have my staff my blasting rod or my gun they were back up the hillside id come back for them later wait binder said he grunted and took off his belt and i nearly kicked him in the head thinking he was going for a weapon instead he just offered the belt to me it had a fairly normallooking black fanny pack on it whats that i asked him two more concussion grenades he said i put two and two together my brain was back on the job youd rather not be holding the matches to the one that got lara eh too right he said i started to turn away and he touched my leg he leaned toward me a bit and said very quietly waterproof pocket inside has a phone in it boss lady had me hold it for her its powered off maybe the lady cop would find it interesting i stared hard at him for a second and an understanding passed between us if this pans out i said maybe ill forget to mention to the wardens that you survived he nodded and sank back onto the ground never want to see you again mate too right i dont i snapped the belt closed and hung it across one shoulder where i could get to the larger pouch in a hurry if i needed to then i got on to the next point of businessfinding will and georgia they were both lying on the ground maybe sixty yards from where id last seen them it looked like theyd been circling around the site of the battle with madeline planning on coming back in from the far side i moved easily and soundlessly through the woods and found them on the ground back in human form will i hissed quietly he lifted his head and looked around vaguely uh what its harry i said kneeling down next to him i took off my pentacle amulet and willed a gentle light from it are you hurt georgia murmured in discomfort at the light the two of them were twined together rather intimately actually and i suddenly felt extremely um inappropriate i shut off the light sorry he slurred we were gonna come back but it was really nice out here and confusing i lost track georgia said and fell over their pupils were dilated to the size of quarters and i suddenly understood what had happened to them madelines blood theyd been inadvertently drugged while ripping at a succubus with their fangs id heard stories about the blood of the white court but i hadnt been able to find any hard evidence and it wasnt the sort of thing thomas would ever talk about hells bells i muttered frustrated madeline seemed to have a habit of inflicting far more damage by coincidence than intention i heard a short desperately pleasurable cry from nearby in the direction where i knew madeline and lara were on the groundthen silence and madeline wasnt on the island anymore i lifted a hand in the air and let out a soft whistle there was a fluttering sound and then a small faerie hovered in the air beside me suppressing the light that usually gathered around them when they flew i could hear its wings buzzing and sensed its position through the islands intellectus it wasnt toottoot but one of his subordinates put a guard around these two i said indicating will and georgia hide them and try to lead off anyone who comes close the little faerie let its wings blur with blue light twice in acknowledgment of the order and zipped off into the dark a moment later a double dozen of the militia were on the way led by the member of the guard toot and company were generally reliablewithin their limits this was going to be pushing them but i didnt have any other way of helping will and georgia at the moment and the insanity was still in progress putting the little folk on guard duty might not be a foolproof protection but it was the only one i had id just have to hope for the best i reached out to demonreach to find out about ebenezar and the others when a sense of fundamentalwrongness twitched through my brain and sent runnels of fear and rage that did not belong to me oozing down my spine i focused on the source of those feelings and suddenly understood the islands outrage at the presence of a visitor it actively detested it had come ashore on the far side of the island from chicago and was now moving swiftly through the trees dragging a halfdead presence behind it my brother the naagloshii had come to demonreach i stood there without allies without most of my weapons and grew sick with horror as the skinwalker bypassed the battle at the docks and moved in a straight line toward demonreach tower toward molly toward donald morgan and it was moving fast i put my head down found the fastest route up the hill and broke out into a flat sprint praying that i could beat the skinwalker to the tower chapter fortyfour as i ran i tried to keep track of the battle between the white council and the forces of the traitor who had brought them to the island whatever the enemy had brought with him they werent anything close to humanshaped and they were all over the place the councils forces together with the white court were arranged in a half circle at the shoreline their backs protected by the lake the attackers were stacked up at the tree line where they would be able to hide and they were probably making swift attacks at odd intervals the two humanshaped presences who had arrived first were standing together in the forest well back from the fight and i felt a moment of severe frustration if i could only get word to the wardens to tell them where the traitor was they might be able to launch an effective attackbut i was pretty sure it wasnt possible if i used more of the little folk id have to stop to whistle some of them up and dispatch them to the task and it was always possible that they wouldnt find the right target to point out to the council with their fireworks then too a wizard would be a far different sort of threat to the little folk than a vampire or the grey men had been a wizard particularly one smart enough to remain hidden within the council for years without betraying his treacherous goals could swat little folk out of the air like insects killing them by the score whether or not they thought they understood the risks i wasnt going to send them into that but i had to figure out something the fight wasnt going well for the home team there was blood mixed heavily with the rain on the muddy ground in the center of their defensive position i gritted my teeth in frustration i had to focus on my task for my brothers sake if i stopped moving now if i tried to bail the council and laras family out of their predicament it could mean thomass life besides if ebenezar listenstowind and ancient mai couldnt hold off their attackers it was pretty much a given that i wouldnt be able to do any better they would have to manage without me i didnt quite get up to the tower before the skinwalker but it was damn near a tie i guess being a ninefoottall shapeshifter with a nocturnal predators senses and superhuman strength was enough to trump even my alliance with the islands spirit taken as an omen for the rest of the evening it was hardly encouraging but if i did the smart thing every time matters got dangerous the world would probably come to an end as it turned out moving through the forest with perfect surety of where to put your feet is very nearly the same thing as moving in perfect silence i reached the edge of the trees and saw the skinwalker coming up the opposite side of the bald knoll i froze in place behind a screen of brush and shadows the wind had continued to rise and grow cooler coming in from the northeastwhich mean that it was at the skinwalkers back it would warn the creature should anything attempt to come slipping up his back trail but it offered me a small advantage shagnasty wouldnt be able to get my scent he came up the hill all wiry limbs and stiff yellow fur that seemed entirely unaffected by what must have been a long swim or by the rain that was currently falling in intermittent splatters the racing clouds overhead parted for a few seconds revealing a moon most of the way toward being full and a scythe of silver light swept briefly over the hilltop it showed me thomas the naagloshii was dragging him by one ankle his shirt was gone and his upper body was covered in so many fine cuts and scratches that they looked like marked roads in a particularly detailed atlas hed been beaten too one eye was swollen up until it looked like someone had stuck half of a peach against the socket there were dark bruises all over his throat toohed been strangled maybe repeatedly maybe for fun his head shoulders and upper back dragged on the ground and his arms followed limply along when the naagloshii stopped walking i saw his head move a little maybe trying to spot some way to escape his hair was still soaking wet and clinging to his head i heard him let out a weak wet cough he was alive beaten tortured half drowned in the icy water of lake michiganbut he was alive i felt my hands clench as a hot and hungry anger suddenly burned through me i hadnt planned on trying to take the naagloshii alone id wanted lara and her people and every member of the council present to be there too that had been part of the plan establish a common interest by showing them that they had a common enemy then take the naagloshii on with overwhelming force and force it to flee at the very least so that we could recover thomas i just hadnt counted on the traitor showing up in such numerical strength taking the naagloshii on alone would be a fools mistake anger might make a man bolder than he would be otherwise it was possible that i could use it to help fuel my magic as wellbut anger alone wouldnt give a man skill or strength that he didnt have already and it wouldnt grant a mortal wizard undeniable power all it could do was get me killed if i let it control me i swallowed down my outrage and forced myself to watch the naagloshii with cold dispassionate eyes once i had a better opportunity once i had spotted something that might give me a real chance at victory i would strike i promised my rage id hit it with the best sucker punch of my life backed by the ambient energy of demonreach i focused my whole concentration on the skinwalker and waited the skinwalker i realized a moment later was enormously powerful id known that already of course but i hadnt been able to appreciate the threat it represented beyond the purely physical even though id viewed it through my sight that memory welled up again trying to club me unconscious as it had before it was difficult but i shoved it away and ignored it through demonreach i could appreciate its presence in a more tactile sense the skinwalker was virtually its own ley line its own well of power it had so much metaphysical mass that the dark river of energy flowing up from beneath the tower was partially disrupted by its presence in much the same way as the moon causes tidal shifts the island reflected that disruption in many subtle ways animals fled from the naagloshii as they might from the scent of a forest fire insects fell silent even the trees themselves seemed to grow hushed and quiet despite the cold wind that should have been causing their branches to creak their leaves to whisper it paced up to the cottage where morgan and my apprentice were hiding and something odd happened the stones of the cottage began to glimmer with streamers of fox fire it wasnt a lot of light only enough to be noticeable in the darkness but as the naagloshii took another step forward the fox fire brightened and resolved itself into symbols written on each stone in gentle fire i had no idea what script it was written in i had never seen the symbols before the naagloshii stopped in its tracks and another flicker of moonlight showed me that it had bared its teeth it took another step forward and the symbols brightened even more it let out a low snarling noise and tried to take another step suddenly its wiry fur was plastered tight to the front of its body and it seemed unable to take another step forward it stood there with one leg lifted and let out a spitting curse in a language i did not know then it retreated several steps snarling and turned to the tower it approached the ruined tower a bit more warily than it had the cottage and once again those flowing sigils appeared upon the stones somehow seeming to repulse the naagloshii before it could get closer than eight or ten feet to it it let out a frustrated sound muttered something to itself and flicked out a hand sending unseen streamers of power fluttering toward the tower the symbols only seemed to glow brighter for a moment as if absorbing the magic that the skinwalker had presumably meant to disrupt them it cursed again and then lifted thomas idly as though it planned on smashing its way through the stones using thomass skull then it glanced at my brother cursed some more and shook its head muttering darkly to itself it fell back from the tower clearly frustrated and just as clearly familiar with the symbols that allowed the stones to shed the power of a skinwalker as swiftly and as easily as they shed rainwater demonreachs alien presence rarely seemed to convey anything understandable about itselfbut for a few instants it did as the skinwalker retreated the islands spirit allowed itself a brief moment of smug satisfaction what the hellwas that stuff never mind it didnt matter or rather it could wait for further investigation the important thing was that the game had just changed i no longer had to get thomas away from the skinwalker and then find a way to defeat it all i had to do was get thomas away if i could grab my brother and drag him into the circle of the broken tower or into the sheltering walls of the cottage it seemed as though we would be fine if the very stones of the cottage repulsed the skinwalkers presence then all wed need to do is let molly activate the crystal and wait the naagloshii out regardless of the outcome of this nights battle the council would win the day eventuallyand even the worst thing they might do to us would be a better fate than the skinwalker would mete out in an instant of rational clarity i acknowledged to myself that there were about a million things that could go wrong with that plan on the other hand that plan had a significant advantagethere was at least one thing that could go right which was exactly one more right thing than the previous take back my brother away and beat the skinwalker up plan could produce if i tried it unassisted i might actually pull this one off wizard the skinwalker called it faced the cottage and began walking in a slow circle around it wizard come forth give me the doomed warrior i didnt answer him naturally i was busy changing position if he kept pacing a circle around the cottage he would walk between me and the empty doorway if i timed it right i might be able to unleash a kinetic blast that would rip thomas out of its grip and throw him into the cottage of course it might also fail to rip thomas out of the skinwalkers grip in which case it might whiplash his limp body severely enough to break his neck or it might succeed and hit him hard enough to stop his heart or collapse a lung and if my aim was off i might be blasting thomas out of the skinwalkers hands and into a stone wall given how badly off he looked at the moment that might well kill him of course the skinwalker would kill him if i did nothing so i would just have to be perfect i got into position and licked my lips nervously it was harder to work with pure raw kinetic energy with force than almost any other kind of magic unlike using fire or lightning summoning up pure force required that everything in the spell had to come from the wizards mind and will fire once called would behave exactly like fire unless you worked to make it otherwise ditto lightning but raw will had no basis in the natural order so the visualization of it had to be particularly vivid and intent in the mind of the wizard using it that was one reason i usually used my staff or another article to help focus my concentration when i worked with force but my staff was several minutes away and my kinetic energy rings while powerful enough to handle the job were essentially designed to send out lances of destructive energyto hurt things and i hadnt designed the magic that supported them with onthefly modifications in mind i couldnt soften the blow so to speak if i worked with the rings i could kill thomas if i used them wizard the naagloshii growled i grow weary of this i have come to honor the exchange of prisoners do not force me to take what i want just a few more steps and it would be in position my legs were shaking my hands were shaking i stared at them in shock for a second and realized that i was terrified the mind specter of the skinwalker hammered at the doors of my thoughts and raked savagely at my concentration i remembered the havoc it had wrought the lives it had taken and how easily it had avoided or overcome every threat that had been sent its way anything less than a flawless execution of the spell could cost my brother his life what if the skinwalker was good enough to sense it coming what if i misjudged the amount of force i needed to use what if i missed i wasnt even using a tool to help me focus the powerand my control was a little shaky on the best of days what about the seconds after the spell even if i managed to do it right it would leave me out in the open with a vengeful and enraged naagloshii to keep me company what would it do to me the image of the halfcooked lara ripping out madelines intestines burned in my thoughts somehow i knew that the naagloshii would do worse a lot worse then came the nastiest doubt of all what if this had all been for nothing what if the traitor escaped while i flailed around here what if the politics of power meant that morgan would pay the price for lafortiers death despite everything god i really wanted that cold beer and a good book dont screw this up i whispered to myself dont screw it up the skinwalker passed in front of the empty cottage doorway and a second later he dragged thomas into line between the doorway and me i lifted my right hand focusing my will and aligning my thoughts while the constantly shifting numbers and formulae of force calculation went spinning through my head i suddenly spread my fingers and called forzare something approximately the same size and shape as the blade of a bulldozer went rushing across the ground between my brother and me tearing up earth and gravel root and plant the unseen force dug into the earth an inch beneath thomas hammered into his unmoving form and ripped him free of the naagloshiis grip he went tumbling over ten feet of ground to the doorwayand struck his head savagely on the stone wall framing the door as he went through had his head flopped about with a lethally rubbery fluidity after the impact had i just broken my brothers neck i let out a cry of agony and chagrin at the same time the skinwalker whirled to face me crouched and let out a furious roar that shook the air all around sending drops of water that had beaded upon the leaves of the trees raining to the earth in a fresh shower that roar held all the fury of a mortally offended maniacal ego and promised a death that could only be described with the assistance of an encyclopedia of torments a thesaurus and a copy of grays anatomy the naagloshii in my crystalline memory of the recent past and the one standing in front of me in the hereandnow both rushed at me huge and unstoppable determined to hit me from either side and rip me to shreds and suddenly i did not care that this creature was a foe on par with any number of nightmares i would never dare to trade blows with i did not care that i was probably about to die i saw kirbys still form in my head i saw the small broken figure of andi in her hospital room i saw my brothers wounds remembered the agony the thing had caused me when i had seen it through my sight this creature had no place here and if i was to die i was not going to go out in a gibbering heap of terror if i was to die it wouldnt happen because i was half crippled with fear and sight trauma if i was to die it was going to be a bloody and spectacular mess bring it i screamed back at the naagloshii my terror and rage making my voice sharp and high and rough i cupped my right hand as if preparing to throw a baseball drew up my will and filled my palm with scarlet fire i thrust out my left hand and ran my will through the shield bracelet hanging there preparing a defense and as i did i felt the power of the land beneath my feet felt it spreading out around me drawing in supportive energy bring it bring it you dickless freak the naagloshiis form shifted from something almost human to a shape that was more like that of a gorilla its arms lengthening its legs shortening it rushed forward bounding over the distance between us with terrifying speed grace and power roaring as it came it was also vanishing from sight becoming one with the darkness as its veil closed around it utterly invisible to the human eye but demonreach knew where shagnasty was and so did i in some distant corner of my mind where my common sense apparently had some kind of vacation home my brain noted with dismay that i had broken into a sprint of my own i dont remember making the decision but i was charging out to meet the skinwalker screaming out a challenge in reply i ran embracing a rage that was very nearly madness filling the fire in my hand with more and more power that surged higher every time one of my feet hit the ground until it was blazing as bright as an acetylene torch the naagloshi leapt at me horrible eyes burning and visible from within the veil its clawed arms reaching out i dropped into a baseball players slide on my right hip and brought my shield up at an angle oblique to the skinwalkers motion the creature hit the shield like a load of bricks and bounced up to continue in the same direction it had been leaping the instant the naagloshii had rebounded i dropped the shield screaming andi and hurled a miniature sun up at the skinwalkers belly fire erupted in an explosion that lifted the skinwalker another dozen feet into the air tumbling it tail over teakettlean expression that makes no goddamned sense whatsoever yet seemed oddly appropriate to the moment my nose filled with the hideous scent of burning hair and scorched meat and the naagloshii howled in savage ecstasy or agony as it came tumbling down bounced hard a couple of times and then rolled to its feet it came streaking toward me its body shifting again behind its concealing veil becoming something else something more feline maybe it didnt matter to me i reached out to the wind and rain and rumbling thunder around us and gathered a levy of lightning into my cupped hand then instead of waiting for its charge i turned my left hand over and triggered every charged energy ring i had left unleashing their deadly force in a single salvo the naagloshii howled something in a tongue i didnt know and the lances of force glanced off of his veil leaving concentric rings of spreading color where they struck a bare second later i lifted my cupped had and screamed thomas fulminas thunder loud enough to knock several stones loose from the tower shook the hilltop and the bluewhite flash of light was physically painful to the eyes a thorny network of lightning leapt to the naagloshii whose defenses had not yet recovered from deflecting the blasts of the force rings the deadlydelicate tracery of lightning hammered into the exact center of its chest stopping its charge in its tracks smaller strikes spreading out from the main bolt like the branches of a tree snapped into the rocky ground in half a dozen places digging redhot skullsized divots into the granite and flint exhaustion hit me like a hammer and stars swam in my vision i had never thrown punches that hard before and even with the assistance of demonreach the expenditure of energy needed to do so was literally staggering i knew that if i pushed too hard id collapsebut the skinwalker was still standing it stumbled to one side its veil faltering for a second its eyes wide with surprise i could just see it going through the naagloshiis head how in the world was i hitting him so accurately when it knew that its veil rendered it all but perfectly invisible for one quick fraction of a second i saw fear in its eyes and triumphant fury roared through my weary body the skinwalker recovered itself changing again with what looked like trivial effort it reached down and ripped a section of rock shelf the size of a sidewalk paving stone from the rock it flung the stone at me three or four hundred pounds coming at me like a majorleague fastball i dove to the side slowed by exhaustion but fast enough to get out of the way and as i went i gathered my will this time the silverwhite streamers of soulfire danced and glittered around my right hand i lay on the ground too tired to get back up and ground my teeth in determination as it charged me for what would one way or another be the last time i didnt have the breath to scream but i could snarl and this i spat is for kirby you son of a bitch i unleashed my will and screamed laqueus a cord of pure force glittering and flashing with soulfire leapt out at the skinwalker it attempted to deflect it but it clearly hadnt been expecting me to turbocharge the spell the naagloshiis defenses barely slowed it and the cord whipped three times around its throat and tightened savagely the skinwalkers charge faltered and it staggered to one side its veil falling to shreds by degrees it started shifting form wildly struggling to get loose of the supernatural garroteand failing the edges of my vision were blurry and darkening but i kept my will on him drawing the noose tighter and tighter it kicked and struggled wildlyand then changed tactics it rolled up to a desperate crouch extended a single talon and swept it around in a circle carving a furrow into the rock it touched the circle with its will and i felt it when the simple magical construct sprang up and cut off the noose spell from its source of power me the silver cord shimmered and vanished i lay there on the ground barely able to lift my head i looked toward the cottage and the safety it represented standing only forty feet away it might as well have been forty miles the naagloshii ran its talons along the fur at its throat and made a satisfied growling noise then its eyes moved to me its mouth spread into a carnivorous smile then it stepped out of the circle and began to stalk nearer one bloody and spectacular mess coming up chapter fortyfive the naagloshii walked over to me and stood there smiling as its inhuman features shifted and contorted from something bestial back toward something almost human it probably made it easier to talk that was hardly pathetic at all it murmured who gifted you with the life fire little mortal doubt you know him i responded it was an effort to speak but i was used to meeting the rigorous demands of life as a reflexive smartass hed have taken you out the skinwalkers smile widened i find it astonishing that you could call forth the very fires of creationand yet have no faith with which to employ them hells bells i muttered i get sick of sadistic twits like you it tilted its head it dragged its claws idly across the stone sharpening them oh you like seeing someone dangling on a hook i said it gets you off and once im dead the funs over so you feel like you have to drag things out with a conversation are you so eager to leave life mortal the naagloshii purred if the alternative is hanging around here with you i sure as hell am i replied get it over with or buzz off its claws moved pure serpentine speed and my face suddenly caught on fire it hurt too much to scream i doubled up clutching my hands at the right side of my face and felt my teeth grinding together as you wish the naagloshii said it leaned closer but let me leave you with this thought little spirit caller you think youve won a victory by taking the phage from my hands but he was hanging meat for me for more than a day and i left nothing behind you dont have words for the things i did to him i could hear its smile widening it is starving mad with hunger and i smell a young female caller inside the hogan it purred i was considering throwing the phage inside with her before you so kindly saved me the bother meditate upon that on your way to eternity even through the pain and the fear my stomach twisted into frozen knots oh god molly i couldnt see out of my right eye and i couldnt feel anything but pain i turned my head far to the right so that my left eye could focus on the naagloshii crouching over me its long fingers tipped with bloodied black claws twitching in what was an almost sexual anticipation i didnt know if anyone had ever thrown a death curse backed by soulfire i didnt know if using my own soul as fuel for a final conflagration would mean that it never went to wherever it is souls go once theyre finished here i just knew that no matter what happened it wasnt going to hurt for much longer and that i wanted to wipe that grin off the skinwalkers face before i went i wasnt sure how defiant you could look with a oneeyed stare but i did my best even as i prepared the blast that would burn the life from my body as i unleashed it then there was a blur of light and something darted past the naagloshiis back it tensed and let out a snarl of surprise whirling away from me to stare after the source of light its back i saw bore a long and shallow wound straight across its hunched shoulders as narrow and fine as if cut by a scalpel or a box knife toottoot whirled about in midair a bloodied utility knife clutched in one hand like a spear he lifted a tiny trumpet to his lips and piped out a shrill challenge the notes of a cavalry charge in highpitched miniature avaunt villain he cried in a shrill strident tone then he darted at the skinwalker again the naagloshii roared and swept out a claw but toot evaded the blow and laid a nineinchlong slice up the skinwalkers arm it whirled on the tiny faerie in a sudden fury its form shifting becoming more feline though it kept the long forelimbs it pursued toot claws snatchingbut my miniature captain of the guard was always a hairsbreadth ahead toot i called as loudly as i was able get out of there the naagloshii spat out an acidicsounding curse as toot avoided its claws again and slapped a hand at the air itself hissing out words in an alien tongue the wind rose in a sudden spiteful little gale and it hammered toots tiny body from the air he crashed into a patch of blackberry bushes at the edge of the clearing and the sphere of light around him winked out with a dreadfully sudden finality the naagloshii turned kicking dirt back toward the fallen faerie with its hind legs then it stalked toward me again seething in fury i watched him come knowing that there was nothing i could do at least id gotten thomas away from the bastard the naagloshiis yellow eyes burned with hate as it closed the distance and lifted its claws hey said a quiet voice ugly i turned and stared across the small clearing at the same time the skinwalker did i dont know how injun joe managed to get through the ring of attackers and to the summit of the hill but he had he stood there in moccasins jeans and a buckskin shirt decorated with bone beads and bits of turquoise his long silver hair hung in its customary braid and the bone beads of his necklace gleamed pale in the nights gloom the naagloshii faced the medicine man without moving the hilltop was completely silent and still then listenstowind smiled he hunkered down and rubbed his hands in some mud and loose earth that lightly covered the rocky summit of the hill he cupped his hands raised them to just below his face and inhaled through his nose breathing in the scent of the earth then he rubbed his hands slowly together the gesture somehow reminding me of a man preparing to undertake heavy routine labor he rose to his feet again and said calmly mother says you have no place here the naagloshii bared its fangs its growl prowled around the hilltop like a beast unto itself lightning flashed overhead with no accompanying rumble of thunder it cast a harsh eerily silent glare down on the skinwalker listenstowind turned his face up to the skies and cocked his head slightly father says you are ugly he reported he narrowed his eyes and straightened his shoulders facing the naagloshii squarely as thunder rolled over the island lending a monstrous growling undertone to the old mans voice i give you this chance leave now the skinwalker snarled old spirit caller the failed guardian of a dead people i do not fear you maybe you should listenstowind said the boy almost took you and he doesnt even know the diné much less the old ways begone last chance the naagloshii let out a warbling growl as its body changed thickening growing physically thicker more powerfullooking you are not a holy man you do not follow the blessing way you have no power over me dont plan to bind or banish you old ghost injun joe said just gonna kick your ass up between your ears he clenched his hands into fists and said lets go the skinwalker let out a howl and hurled its arms forward twin bands of darkness cascaded forth splintering into dozens and dozens of shadowy serpents that slithered through the night air in a writhing cloud darting toward listenstowind the medicine man didnt flinch he lifted his arms to the sky threw back his head and sang in the wavering highpitched fashion of the native tribes the rain which had vanished almost entirely came down again in an almost solid sheet of water that fell on maybe fifty square yards of hilltop drenching the oncoming swarm of sorcery and melting it to nothing before it could become a threat injun joe looked back down again at the naagloshii that the best you got the naagloshii snarled more words in unknown tongues and began flinging power with both arms balls of fire like the one i had seen at château raith were followed by crackling spheres of blue sparks and wobbling green spheres of what looked like jello and smelled like sulfuric acid it was an impressive display of evocation had a kitchen sink gone flying toward listenstowind conjured from who knows where it wouldnt have startled me the naagloshii pulled out all the stops hurling enough raw power at the small weathered medicine man to scour the hilltop clean to the bedrock i have no idea how the old man countered it all even though i watched him do it again he sang and this time shuffled his feet in time with the music bending his old body forward and back again the motions obviously slowed and muted by his age but just as obviously part of a dance he was wearing a band of bells on his ankles and another on each wrist and they jingled in time with his singing all of that power coming at him seemed unable to find a mark fire flashed by him as his feet shuffled and his body swayed without so much as singeing a hair crackling balls of lightning vanished a few feet in front of him and resumed their course a few feet beyond him apparently without crossing the space between globes of acid wobbled in flight and splattered over the earth sizzling and sending up clouds of choking vapors but not actually doing him any harm the defense was elegant rather than trying to match force against force and power against power the failure of the incoming sorcery to harm listenstowind seemed like part of the natural order as if the world was a place in which such a thing was perfectly normal reasonable and expected but as the naagloshii hurled agony and death in a futile effort to overcome listenstowinds power it was also striding forward closing the distance between them until it stood less than twenty feet from the old medicine man then its eyes glittered with a terrible joy and with a roar it hurled itself physically upon the old man my heart leapt into my throat listenstowind might not have come down on my side in this matter but he had helped me more than once in the past and was one of the few wizards to hold ebenezar mccoys respect he was a decent man and i didnt want to see him get hurt in my defense i tried to cry out a warning and as i did i caught the look on his face as the naagloshii pounced injun joe was smiling a fierce wolfish smile the naagloshii came down its mouth stretching into a wolflike muzzle extending claws on all four of its limbs as it prepared to savage the old man but listenstowind spoke a single word his voice shaking the air with power and then his form melted and shifted changing as fluidly as if hed been made of liquid mercury that until that moment had only been held in the shape of an old man by an effort of will his form simply resolved itself into something different as naturally and swiftly as taking a deep breath when the naagloshii came down it didnt sink its claws into a leathery old wizard instead it found itself muzzle to muzzle with a brown bear the size of a minibus the bear let out a boneshaking roar and surged forward overwhelming the naagloshii with raw mass and muscle power if youve ever seen a furious beast like that in action you know that it isnt something that can be done justice in any kind of description the volume of the roar the surge of implacable muscle beneath heavy pelt the flash of white fangs and glaring redrimmed eyes combine into a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts its terrifying elemental touching upon some ancient instinctual core inside every human alive that remembers that such things equal terror and death the naagloshii screamed a weird and alien shriek and raked furiously at the bear but it had outsmarted itself its long elegantly sharp claws perfect for eviscerating softskinned humans simply did not have the mass and power they needed to force their way through the bears thick pelt and the hide beneath much less the depth to cut through layers of fat and heavy muscle it might as well have strapped plastic combs to its limbs for all the good its claws did it the bear seized the skinwalkers skull in its vast jaws and for a second it looked like the fight was over then the naagloshii blurred and where a vaguely simian creature had been an instant before there was only a tiny flash of urine yellow fur a long lean creature like a ferret with oversized jaws it wiggled free of the huge bear and evaded two slaps of its giant paws letting out a defiant mocking snarl as it slid free but injun joe wasnt done yet either the bear lifted itself into a ponderous leap and came down to earth again as a coyote lean and swift that raced after the ferret nimbly fangs bright it rushed after the fleeing ferretwhich suddenly turned jaws opening wide and then wider and wider until an alligator coated in sparse tufts of yellow fur turned to meet the onrushing canine which found itself too close to turn aside the canine form melted as it shot toward the alligators maw and a darkwinged raven swept into the jaws and out the far side as they snapped shut the raven turned its head and let out mocking caws of laughter as it flew away circling around the clearing the alligator shuddered all over and became a falcon golden and swift its head marked by tufts of yellowish fur that almost looked like the naagloshiis ears had in its nearhuman form it hurtled forward with supernatural speed vanishing behind a veil as it flew i heard the ravens wings beat overhead as it circled cautiously looking for its enemyand then was struck from behind by the falcons claws i watched in horror as the hooked beak descended to rip at the captured ravenand met the spiny rockhard back of a snapping turtle a leathery head twisted and jaws that could cut through mediumgauge wire clamped onto the naagloshiifalcons leg and it let out another alien shriek of pain as the two went plummeting to the earth together but in the last few feet the turtle shimmered into the form of a flying squirrel limbs extended wide and it converted some of its falling momentum into forward motion dropping to a roll as it hit the ground the falcon wasnt so skilled it began to change into something else but struck the stony earth heavily before it could finish resolving into a new form the squirrel whirled bounded and became a mountain lion in midleap landing on the stunned confused mass of feathers and fur that was the naagloshii fangs and claws tore and black blood stained the ground to the sound of more horrible shrieks the naagloshii coalesced into an eerie shape four legs and batlike wings with eyes and mouths everywhere all the mouths were screaming in half a dozen different voices and it managed to tear its way free of the mountain lions grip and go flapping and tumbling awkwardly across the ground it staggered wildly and began to leap clumsily into the air bat wings beating it looked like an albatross without enough headwind and the mountain lion was hard on its heels the whole way claws lashing out to tear and rake the naagloshii disappeared into the darkness its howls drifting up in its wake as it fled it continued to scream in pain almost sobbing as it rushed down the slope toward the lake demonreach followed its departure with a surly sense of satisfaction and i couldnt say that i blamed it the skinwalker fled the island its howls drifted on the night wind for a time and then they were gone the mountain lion stared in the direction that the naagloshii had fled for long moments then he sat down his head hanging shivered and became injun joe once more the old man was sitting on the ground supporting himself with both hands he stood up slowly and a bit stiffly and one of his arms looked like it might be broken midway between wrist and elbow he continued to look after his routed opponent then snorted once and turned to walk carefully over to me wow i told him quietly he lifted his chin slightly for a moment pride and power shone in his dark eyes then he smiled tiredly at me and was only a calm tiredlooking old man again you claimed this place as a sanctum he asked i nodded last night he looked at me and couldnt seem to make up his mind whether to laugh in my face or slap me upside the head you dont get into trouble by halves do you son apparently not i slurred i spat blood from my mouth there was a lot of that at the moment my face hadnt stopped hurting just because the naagloshii was gone injun joe knelt down beside me and examined my wounds in a professional manner not lifethreatening he assured me we need your help youre kidding i said im tapped i cant even walk all you need is your mind he said there are trees around the battle below trees that are under strain can you feel them hed barely said the words when i felt them through my link to the islands spirit there were fourteen trees in fact most of them old willows near the water their branches were bowed down sagging beneath enormous burdens yeah i said my voice sounded distant to me and full of detached calm the island can be most swiftly rid of the beings in them injun joe said if it withdraws the water from the earth beneath those trees for a time so i said how am i supposed to i broke off in midsentence as i felt demonreach respond it seemed to seize upon injun joes words but then i understood that nothing of the sort had happened demonreach had understood injun joe only because it had understood the thoughts that those words created in my head communication by sound was a concept so inelegant and cumbersome and alien to the islands spirit that it could never have truly happened but my thoughtsthose it could grasp i could all but feel the soil shifting settling slightly as the island withdrew the water in the ground beneath those trees it had the predictable side effect that i realized injun joe had been going for once the ground around the trees roots had become arid it began to leach water from the trees themselves drawing it back out through the same capillary action that had brought it in it flowed in from the outermost branches most quickly leaving the structures behind it dry and brittle tree branches began to break with enormous popping cracks a lot of branches broke dozens all within a few seconds and it was like listening to packs of firecrackers going off there was a sudden cacophony of thunder and gunfire that rose up from the docks below and flashes of light that threw bizarre shadows against the clouds overhead i tried to focus on my other knowledge of the island and i felt itthe surge in energy being released below the increased flow of strange blood into the ground beneath the affected treesblood that they drank thirstily in their sudden drought conditions the wardens were moving forward into the tree line the vampires were racing ahead of them their steps the light swift stride of predators on the trail of wounded prey strange things were dying in the trees amidst bursts of magic and flurries of gunfire a light rose over the island a bright silver star that hung in the air for a long moment like a flare once he saw that injun joes shoulders sagged a little and he let out a slow relieved breath good good thats done for them he shook his head and looked at me youre a mess boy do you have any supplies here i tried to sit up and couldnt the cottage i blurted molly thomasthe vampire i looked toward the bushes where one loyal little guardian had bought me precious seconds in the thick of the fight and started pushing my way to my feet toot easy listenstowind said easy easy son you cant just the rest of what he had to say was drowned out by a vast roaring noise and everything all my thoughts and fears stopped making any noise at all inside my head it was just quiet gorgeously quiet and nothing hurt i had time to think to myself i could get to liking this then nothing chapter fortysix i heard voices speaking somewhere nearby my head was killing me and my face felt tight and swollen i could feel warmth on my right side and smelled the scent of burning wood a fire popped and crackled the ground beneath me was hard but not cold i was lying on blankets or something really no point to doing anything but waiting ebenezar said sure theyre under a roof but its leaking and if nothing else morning should take care of it ai ya ancient mai muttered im sure we could counter it easily enough not without risk ebenezar said in a reasonable tone morgan isnt going anywhere whats the harm in waiting for the shield to fall i do not care for this place ancient mai replied its feng shui is unpleasant and if the child was no warlock she would have lowered the shield by now no came mollys voice it sounded weirdly modulated as if being filtered through fifty feet of a corrugated pipe and a kazoo im not dropping the shield until harry says its okay after a brief pause she added uh besides im not sure how a voice belonging to one of the wardens said maybe we could tunnel beneath it i exhaled slowly licked my cracked lips and said dont bother its a sphere oh molly said oh thank god harry i sat up slowly and before i had moved more than an inch or two injun joe was supporting me easy son he said easy youve lost some blood and you got a knot on your head that would knock off a hat i felt really dizzy while he said that but i stayed up he passed me a canteen and i drank slowly and carefully one swallow at a time then i opened my eyes and glanced around me we were all in the ruined cottage i sat on the floor near the fireplace ebenezar sat on the hearth in front of the fireplace his old wooden staff leaned up against one shoulder ancient mai stood on the opposite side of the cottage from me flanked by four wardens morgan lay on the bedroll where id left him unconscious or asleep and molly sat crosslegged on the floor beside him holding the quartz crystal in both hands it shimmered with a calm white light that illuminated the interior of the cottage much more thoroughly than the fire did and a perfectly circular dome of light the size of a small camping tent enclosed both morgan and my apprentice in a bubble of defensive energy hey i said to molly hey she said back i guess it worked huh her eyes widened you didnt know if it would the design was sound i said id just never had the chance to fieldtest it oh molly said um it worked i grunted then i looked up at ebenezar sir hoss he said glad you could join us we waste time ancient mai said she looked at me and said tell your apprentice to drop the shield at once in a minute her eyes narrowed and the wardens beside her looked a little more alert i ignored her and asked molly wheres thomas with his family said a calm voice i looked over my shoulder to see lara raith standing in the doorway a slender shape wrapped in one of the blankets from a bunk on the water beetle she looked as pale and lovely as ever though her hair had been burned down close to her scalp without it to frame her face there was a greater sense of sharp angular gauntness to her features and her grey eyes seemed even larger and more distinct dont worry dresden your catspaw will live to be manipulated another day my people are taking care of him i tried to find something in her face that would tell me anything else about thomas it wasnt there she just watched me coolly there vampire ancient mai said politely you have seen him and spoken to him what follows is council business lara smiled faintly at ancient mai and turned to me one more thing before i go harry do you mind if i borrow the blanket what if i do i asked she let it slip off of one pale shoulder id give it back of course the image of the swollen bruised burned creature that had kissed madeline raith as it pulled out her entrails returned to my thoughts vividly keep it i told her she smiled again this time showing teeth and bowed her head then she turned and left i idly followed her progress down to the shore where she walked out onto the floating dock and was gone i looked at ebenezar what happened he grunted whoever came through the nevernever opened a gate about a hundred yards back in the trees he said and he brought about a hundred big old shaggy spiders with him i blinked and frowned spiders ebenezar nodded not conjured forms either they were the real thing from faerie maybe gave us a real hard time some of them started webbing the trees while the others kept us busy trying to trap us in didnt want us getting behind them to whoever opened the gate listenstowind said didnt want anyone to see who it was more likely i said that was our perp that was the killer maybe ebenezar said quietly nodding as soon as those trees and the webbing came down we started pushing the spiders back he ran and once he was gone the spiders scattered too dammit i said quietly thats what all this was about ebenezar said there was no informant no testimony i nodded i told you that to draw the real killer out to force him to act and he did you saw it with your own eyes that should be proof enough that morgan is innocent ancient mai shook her head the only thing that proves is that someone else is willing to betray the council and has something to hide it doesnt mean that morgan couldnt have killed lafortier at best it suggests that he did not act alone ebenezar gave her a steady look then he said so there is a conspiracy nowis what youre saying what was that you were saying earlier about simplicity mai glanced away from him and shrugged her shoulders dresdens theory is admittedly a simpler and more likely explanation she sighed it is however insufficient to the situation ebenezar scowled someones got to hang mai turned her eyes back to him and held steady that is precisely correct it is plausible that morgan was involved the hard evidence universally suggests that he is guilty and the white council will not show weakness in the face of this act we cannot afford to allow lafortiers death to pass without retribution retribution ebenezar said not justice justice is not what keeps the various powers in this world from destroying the white council and having their way with humanity ancient mai responded fear does that power does that they must know that if they strike us there will be deadly consequences i am aware how reprehensible an act it would be to sentence an innocent man to deathand one who has repeatedly demonstrated his dedication to the wellbeing of the council to boot but on the whole it is less destructive and less irresponsible than allowing our enemies to perceive weakness ebenezar put his elbows on his knees and looked at his hands he shook his head once and then said nothing now ancient mai said turning her focus back to me you will instruct your apprentice to lower the shield or i will tear it down might want to take a few steps back before you do i said if anything but the proper sequence takes it apart it explodes itll take out the cottage and the tower and the top of the hill the kid and morgan should be fine though molly made a choking sound hngh finally made that idea work did you ebenezar said i shrugged after those zombies turned up and just hammered their way through my defenses i wanted something that would give me some options how long did it take you to make nights and weekends for three months i sighed it was a real pain in the ass sounds it ebenezar agreed wizard mccoy mai said sharply i remind you that dresden and his apprentice aided and abetted a fugitive from justice from behind me listenstowind said mai thats enough she turned her eyes to him and stared hard enough listenstowind repeated the hour is dark enough without trying to paint more people with the same brush were going to be forced to use on morgan one death is necessary adding two more innocents to the count would be callous pointless and evil the council will interpret dresdens actions as ultimately to the support of the laws of magic and the white council and that will be the end of it there was no expression on mais faceabsolutely none i couldnt have told you a darn thing about what was going on behind that mask she stared at the two older wizards for a time then at me the merlin will not be pleased that is good listenstowind said no one should be pleased with this days outcome ill take morgan into custody mai ebenezar said why dont you take the wardens back to the city in the boat it should give you less trouble without me and injun joe on it well follow along in the other boat your word mai said that you will bring morgan to edinburgh bring him and bring him unharmed ebenezar said you have my word she nodded her head once wardens then she walked calmly out the four wardens fell into step behind her i kept track of them once they were outside they started down the path that would lead them back to the dock i looked up at listenstowind i need your help with something he nodded theres a patch of blackberry bushes out there one of the little folk tried to play guardian angel for me the naaglosh dont say the word listenstowind said calmly it draws power from fear and from spreading its reputation referring to them by name can only increase their power i snorted i saw you send it running you think im giving it any fear not at the moment injun joe said but speaking the word doesnt accomplish anything good besides its a sloppy habit to get into i grunted i could accept that hed probably phrased things that way intentionally besides of the two of us which one had a better track record against naagloshii i decided to not be an idiot and listen to the medicine man the creature i said knocked him out of the air maybe hurt or killed him injun joe nodded his broken arm had been splinted with a field dressing and wrapped in medical tape the wardens had probably brought their own gear i saw the very end of your fight which is why i felt it appropriate to give the creature the same treatment he shook his head it took a lions courage for the little one to do what he did i already went looking for him i felt a little bit sick was he listenstowind smiled faintly and shook his head knocked senseless for a while and wounded by blackberry thorns though his armor protected him from the worst of it i found myself barking out a short little laugh of relief that armor youre kidding he shook his head worst thing hurt was his pride i think his dark eyes sparkled little guy like that taking on something so far out of his weight class that was a sight to see ebenezar snorted yeah wonder where the pixie learned that i felt my cheeks coloring i didnt want to do it i had to you picked a good fight listenstowind said not a very smart fight but that old ghost is as close to pure evil as youll ever see good man always stands against that you had it on the run i said you could have killed it sure listenstowind said would have been a chase and then more fight might have taken hours would have made the old ghost desperate it would have started using innocents as shields obstacles distractions the old medicine man shrugged maybe i would have lost too and while it was going on spiders would be eating fat old hillbillies and picking their fangs clean with their bones ebenezar snorted never would have happened i dont much care for vampires especially not those white court weasels but ill say this much for them they can fight when they have a mind to after the first rush those bugs were a lot more careful yeah i said they didnt have much of a spine when they tried to stop me on the trail to edinburgh both of the old wizards traded a look and then injun joe turned back to me you got jumped by spiders going through the way yeah i said i thought about it and was surprised had it happened so recently two days ago when i came to edinburgh i told you about it the killer must have had some kind of watch put on the chicago end of the way to get them into position in time to intercept me i let out a weary little snigger whats so funny ebenezar asked nothing i said just appreciating irony and getting punchy i guess he didnt want me letting the council know where morgan was sounds like a reasonable theory injun joe said he looked at ebenezar got to be somebody at edinburgh cuts the suspect pool down even more ebenezar grunted agreement but not much were getting closer he exhaled but it wont do morgan any good he stood and his knees popped a couple of times on the way all right hoss he said quietly i guess we cant put this off any longer i folded my arms and looked at ebenezar evenly the old mans face darkened hoss he said quietly i hate this as much as you do but as much as you dont like it as much as i dont like it ancient mai is right about this the real killer will know that morgan is innocentbut the other powers wont theyll only see us doing business hard and quick like always hell it might even get the real killer enough confidence to slip up and make a mistake i told morgan id help him i said and i will son injun joe said quietly no one can help him now i ground my teeth maybe maybe not but im not giving him to you and ill fight you if you make me ebenezar looked at me and then shook his head smiling sadly you couldnt fight one of your little pixie friends right now boy i shrugged ill try you cant have him harry said a quiet voice weirdly mutated by the shield i looked up to see morgan lying quietly on his pallet his eyes open and focused on me its all right he said i blinked at him what its all right he said quietly ill go with them his eyes turned to ebenezar i killed lafortier i deceived dresden into believing my innocence ill give you a deposition morgan i said sharply what the hell are you doing my duty he replied there was i thought a faint note of pride in his voice absent since he had appeared at my door ive always known that it might call for me to give up my life to protect the council and so it has i stared at the wounded man my stomach churning morgan you did your best morgan said quietly despite everything that has gone between us you put yourself to the hazard again and again for my sake it was a worthy effort but it just wasnt to be no shame in that he closed his eyes again youll learn if you live long enough you never win them all dammit i sighed i tried to put my face in my hands and had to flinch back as my right cheek touched my skin and began to burn with pain i still couldnt see out of my right eye dammit after all this dammit the fire popped and crackled and no one said anything hes in a lot of pain listenstowind said quietly breaking the silence at least i can make him more comfortable and you need some more attention too he put a hand on my shoulder take the shield down please i didnt want to do it but this wasnt about me i showed molly how to lower the shield we got morgan settled into a bunk on the water beetle and prepared to leave molly troubled and worried about me had volunteered to stay with morgan listenstowind had offered to show her something of what he did with healing magic i grabbed some painkillers while we were there and felt like i could at least walk far enough to find will and georgia demonreach showed me where they were sleeping and i led ebenezar through the woods toward them how did injun joe know about me claiming this place as a sanctum i asked messenger arrived from rashid ebenezar said hes more familiar with what you can do with that kind of bond so he went up to find you and get you to take those trees out from under the bugs i shook my head ive never seen anyone do shapeshifting the way he did it not many ever have ebenezar said with obvious pride in his old friends skills in his voice after a moment he said hes offered to teach you some if you want to learn with my luck id shift into a duck or something and not be able to come back out of it he snorted quietly and then said not shifting he knows more than any man alive about dealing with rage over injustice and being unfairly wronged dont get me wrong i think its admirable that you have those kinds of feelings and choose to do something about them but they can do terrible things to a man too his face was distant for a moment his eyes focused elsewhere terrible things hes been there i think if you spent some time with him youd benefit by it arent i a little old to be an apprentice stop learning start dying ebenezar said in the tone of a man quoting a bedrockfirm maxim youre never too old to learn ive got responsibilities i said i know ill think about it he nodded then he paused for a moment considering his next words theres one thing about tonight that i cant figure out hoss my old mentor said you went to all the trouble to get everyone here to lure the killer here i give you a perfect excuse to roam free behind the lines with no one looking over your shoulder so you can get the job done but instead of slipping up through the weeds and taking down the killerwhich would clear up this whole businessyou go up the hill and throw down with something you know damn well you cant beat yeah i said i know ebenezar spread his hands why i walked for several tired heavy steps before answering thomas got into trouble helping me thomas ebenezar said the vampire i shrugged he was more important to you than stopping the possible fragmentation of the white council the creature was heading straight for the cottage my apprentice and my client were both thereand he had thomas too ebenezar muttered something to himself the girl had that crystal to protect herself with hell son if it went off as violently as you said it would it might have killed the creature all by itself he shook his head normally i think youve got a pretty solid head on your shoulders hoss but that was a bad call maybe i said quietly no maybe about it he replied firmly hes a friend ebenezar stopped in his tracks and faced me squarely hes not your friend harry you might be his but he isnt yours hes a vampire when alls said and done hed eat you if he was hungry enough its what he is ebenezar gestured at the woods around us hells bells boy we found what was left of that raith creatures cousin after the battle and i figure you saw what it did to its own blood yeah i said subdued and that was her own family he shook his head friendship means nothing to those creatures theyre so good at the lie that sometimes maybe they even believe it themselvesbut in the end you dont make friends with food i been around this world a while hoss and let me tell youits their nature sooner or later it wins out thomas is different i said he eyed me oh he shook his head and started walking again why dont you ask your apprentice exactly what made her drop the veil and use that shield then i started walking again i didnt answer we got back into chicago in the witching hour ancient mai and the wardens were waiting at the dock to escort ebenezar injun joe and morgan to edinburghin case of trouble they left within three minutes of me tying the water beetle to the dock i watched them go and sipped water through a straw listenstowind had cleaned my wounds and slapped several stitches onto my face including a couple on my lower lip he told me that i hadnt lost the eye and smeared the entire thing with a paste that looked like guano and smelled like honey then hed made me a shooin for first place in the international walking wounded idiot competition by covering that side of my face and part of my scalp with another bandage that wrapped all the way around my head added to the one i needed for the damn lump the skinwalker had given me i looked like the subject of recent brain surgery only surlier will and georgia were sleeping it off under a spread sleeping bag on an inflatable mattress on the rear deck of the water beetle when i walked down the dock over to the parking lot and up to a parked mercedes vince rolled down his window and squinted at me did you curse everyone who desecrated your tomb or just the englishspeaking guys you just lost your tip i told him did you get it he passed me a manila envelope without comment then he leaned over and opened his passenger door and mouse hopped down from the passenger seat and came eagerly around the car to greet me wagging his tail i knelt down and gave the big beastie a hug your dog is weird vince said mouse was licking my face yeah whatcha gonna do vince grinned and for just a second he didnt look at all nondescript he had the kind of smile that could change the climate of a room i stood up and nodded to him you know where to send the bill yep he said and drove away i went back down to the boat and poured some coke into the nowempty water bottle i sipped at it carefully so that i wouldnt break open one of the cuts and bleed some more i was too tired to clean it up molly fussed around the boat for a few minutes making sure it was tied down and then took two sets of spare shorts and tshirts from the cabins tiny closet and left them where georgia and will would find them she finally wound up sitting down on the other bunk across the cabin from me the shield i said quietly when did you use it she swallowed the skinwthe creature threw thomas into the cabin and he she shuddered harry hed changed it wasnt it wasnt him she licked her lips he sat up and started sniffing the air like like a hungry wolf or something looking around for me and his body was she blushed he was hard and he did something and all of a sudden i wanted to just rip my clothes off and i knew he wasnt in control and i knew he would kill me but i wanted to anyway it was so intense so you popped the shield she swallowed and nodded i think if id waited much longer i wouldnt have been able to think of it she looked up at me and back down he was changed harry it wasnt him anymore i left nothing behind you dont have words for the things i did to him thomas i put the drink aside and folded my arms over my stomach you did good kid she gave me a tired smile an awkward silence fell molly seemed to search for something to say theyre theyre going to try morgan tomorrow she said quietly i heard mai say so yeah i said they expect us to be there oh i said we will be harry we failed she said she swallowed an innocent man is going to die the killer is still loose that entire battle took place and didnt accomplish anything i looked up at her then moving deliberately i opened the manila envelope vince had given me whats that she asked surveillance photos i said quietly shot through a telephoto lens from a block away she blinked at me what i hired vince to take some pictures i said well technically murphy hired him because i was worried about my phone being bugged but im getting the bill so really it was me pictures what pictures of the way to chicago from edinburgh i said where it opens up into that alley behind the old meatpacking factory i had vince take pictures of anyone coming out of it right after i informed edinburgh about the meeting on the island molly frowned but why didnt give them time to think kid i said i was fairly sure the killer was in edinburgh so i made sure he or she had to come to chicago i made sure he didnt have time to get here by alternate means i drew out the pictures and started flipping through them vince had done a crisp professional job you could have used them for portraits much less identification mccoy mai listenstowind bjorn bjorngunnarson the other wardens were all pictured both in a wide shot walking in a right stuff group and in tight focus on each face and i made sure vince and mouse were there to watch the only fast way into town from scotland while i did that molly puzzled through the logic then that entire scenario on the island the meeting the fight the entire thing was a ploy wile e coyote i said wisely suuuuuper genius molly shook her head but you didnt tell anyone nobody had to look good i said didnt know who the traitor might be so i couldnt afford to give anyone any warning wow obiwan the grasshopper said im sort of impressed the smackdownontheisland plan might have worked i said and i needed it to get a crack at the skinwalker on friendly ground but lately ive started thinking that you dont ever plan on a single path to victory you set things up so that youve got more than one way to win what i really needed was a weapon i could use against the killer i stared at the last photo for a moment and then flipped it over and showed it to her and now i said a snarl coming unbidden into my voice ive got one molly looked at the picture blankly oh she said whos that chapter fortyseven morgans trial was held the next day but since scotland was six hours ahead of chicago i wound up getting about three hours worth of sleep sitting up in a chair my head and face hurt too much when i lay all the way down when i got back to the apartment with molly luccio was gone i had been pretty sure she would be i got up the next morning and took stock of myself in the mirror what wasnt under a white bandage was mostly bruised that was probably the concussion grenade i was lucky if id have been standing where lara had been when binders grenade went off the overpressure would probably have killed me i was also lucky that wed been outdoors where there was nothing to contain and focus the blast i didnt feel lucky but i was it could have been a fragmentation grenade spitting out a lethal cloud of shrapnelthough at least my duster would probably have offered me some protection from that against the blast wave of an explosion it didnt do jack having gained something like respect for binders knowhow when it came to mayhem i realized that he may have been thinking exactly that when he picked his gear for the evening i couldnt shower without getting my stitches wet so after changing my bandages i took a birdbath in the sink i wore a buttonup shirt since i would probably compress my brain if i tried to pull on a tee i also grabbed my formal black council robe with its blue stole and my wardens cape i did my best to put my hair in order though only about a third of it was showing and i shaved wow molly said as i emerged youre taking this pretty seriously she was sitting in a chair near the fireplace running her fingers lightly down misters spine she was one of the few people he deemed worthy to properly appreciate him in a tactile sense molly wore her brown apprentices robe and if her hair was bright blue at least she had it pulled back in a nononsense style she never wore a lot of makeup these days but today she was wearing none at all she had made the very wise realization that the less attention she attracted from the council the better off she would be yup cab here yet she shook her head and rose displacing mister he accepted the situation despite the indignity come on mouse she said well give you a chance to go before we head out the big dog happily followed her out the door i got on the phone and called thomass apartment there was no answer i tried laras number and justine answered on the first ring ms raiths phone this is harry dresden i said hello mr dresden justine replied her tone businesslike and formal she wasnt alone how may i help you today now that the furor of the manhunt had blown over my phone was probably safe to talk on but only probably i emulated justines vocal mannerisms im calling to inquire after the condition of thomas hes here justine said hes resting comfortably now id seen what terrible shape thomas was in if he was resting comfortably it was because he had fed deeply and intently with instinctive obsession in all probability my brother had killed someone i hope hell recover quickly i said his caretaker that would be justine is concerned about complications arising from his original condition i was quiet for a moment how bad is it the businesslike meter of her voice changed filling with raw anxiety hes under sedation there was no choice my knuckles creaked as they tightened on the earpiece of the phone i left nothing behind you dont have words for the things i did to him id like to visit if that can be arranged she recovered shifting back into personal assistant mode ill consult ms raith justine said it may not be practical for several days i see could you let me know as soon as possible please of course my number is we have that information mr dresden ill be in touch soon i thanked her and hung up i bowed my head and found myself shaking with anger if that thing had done my brother as much harm as it sounded like i was going to find the naagloshii and rip him to gerbilsized pieces if i had to blow up every cave in new mexico to do it molly appeared in the doorway harry cabs here okay i said lets go spoil someones day i tried not to think too hard about the fact that wile e coyote super genius pretty near always took a hideous beating at the hands of his foes and finished the day by plunging off a twomilehigh cliff well then harry i thought to myself youll just have to remember not to repeat wile es mistake if he would just keep going after he runs off the cliff rather than looking down at his feet everything would be fine they held the trial in edinburgh there wasnt much choice in that given the recent threats to the senior council and the unexpected intensity of the attack at demonreach they wanted the most secure environment they could get the trial was supposed to be held in closed session according to the traditions of how such things were done but this one was too big better than five hundred wizards a sizable minority of the whole council would be there most of them would be allies of lafortier and their supporters who were more than eager to see justice done which is a much prettier thing to do than to take bloodthirsty vengeance molly mouse and i took the way just as i had before this time when i reached the door there was a doublesized complement of wardens on duty led by the big scandinavian all of them from the old guard i got a communal hostile glare from them as i approached with only a desultory effort to disguise it as indifference i ignored it i was used to it we went into the complex past the guard stationsthey were all fully manned as welland walked toward the speaking room maybe it said something about the mindset of wizards in general that the place was called the speaking room and not the listening room or in the more common vernacular an auditorium it was an auditorium though rows of stone benches rising in a full circle around a fairly small circular stone stage rather like the old greek theaters but before we got to the speaking room i turned off down a side passage with difficulty i got the wardens on guard to allow me mouse and molly into the ostentatiatory while one of them went to ebenezars room and asked him if he would see me molly had never been into the enormous room before and stared around it with unabashed curiosity this place is amazing she said is the food for the bigwigs only or do you think theyd mind if i ate something ancient mai doesnt weigh much more than a bird i said lafortiers dead and they havent replaced him yet i figure theres extra she frowned but is it supposed to be only for them i shrugged youre hungry its food what do you think i think i dont want to make anyone angry at me angrier the kid has better sense than i do in some matters ebenezar sent the warden back to bring me up to his room at once and hed already told the man to make sure molly was fed from the buffet table i tried not to smile at that ebenezar was of the opinion that apprentices were always hungry cant imagine who had ever given him that impression i looked around his receiving room which was lined with bookshelves filled to groaning ebenezar was an eclectic reader king heinlein and clancy were piled up on the same shelves as hawking and nietzsche multiple variants of the great religious texts of the world were shamelessly mixed with the writings of julius caesar and d h lawrence hundreds of books were handmade and handwritten including illuminated grimoires any museum worth the name would readily steal given the chance books were crammed in both vertically and horizontally and though the spines were mostly out it seemed clear to me that it would take the patience of job to find anything unless one remembered where it had been most recently placed only one shelf looked neat it was a row of plain leatherbound journals all obviously of the same general design but made with subtly different leathers and subtly different dyes that had aged independently of one another into different textures and shades the books got older and more cracked and weathered rapidly as they moved from right to left the leftmost pair looked like they might be in danger of falling to dust the rightmost journal looked new and was sitting open a pen held the pages down maybe thirty pages in i glanced at the last visible page where ebenezars writing flowed in a strong blocky style seems clear that he had no idea of the islands original purpose i sometimes cant help but think that there is such a thing as fateor at least a higher power of some sort attempting to arrange events in our favor despite everything we in our ignorance do to thwart it the merlin has demanded that we put the boy under surveillance at once i think hes a damn fool rashid says that warning him about the island would be pointless hes a good judge of people but im not so sure hes right this time the boys got a solid head on his shoulders generally and of all the wizards i know hes among the three or four id be willing to see take up that particular mantle i trust his judgment but then again i trusted maggies too ebenezars voice interrupted my reading hoss he said hows your head full of questions i replied i closed the journal and offered him the pen my old mentors smile only touched his eyes as he took the pen from me hed intended me to see what hed written my journal he said well the last three are the ones before that were from my master master huh didnt used to be a dirty word hoss it meant teacher guide protector professional expertas well as the negative things but its the nature of folks to remember the bad things and forget the good i suppose he tapped the three books previous to his own my masters writings he tapped the next four his masters writings and so on back to here he touched the first two books very gently cant hardly read them no more even if you can make it through the language who wrote those two merlin ebenezar said simply he reached past me to put his own journal back up in place one of these days hoss i think ill need you to take care of these for me i looked from the old man to the books the journals and personal thoughts of master wizards for more than a thousand years ye gods and little fishes that would be one hell of a read maybe ebenezar said youd have a thought or two of your own someday that youd want to write down always the optimist sir he smiled briefly well what brings you here before you head to the trial i passed him the manila envelope vince had given me he frowned at me and then started looking through pictures his frown deepened until he got to the very last picture he stopped breathing and i was sure that he understood the implication ebenezars brain doesnt let much grass grow under its lobes stars and stones hoss ebenezar said quietly thought ahead this time didnt you even a broken clock gets it right occasionally i said he put the papers back in the envelope and gave it back to me okay how do you see this playing out at the trial right before the end i want him thinking hes gotten away with it ebenezar snorted youre going to make ancient mai and about five hundred former associates of lafortier very angry yeah i hardly slept last night i was so worried about em he snorted ive got a theory about something oh i told him ebenezars face darkened sentence by sentence he turned his hands palm up and looked down at them they were broad strong seamed and callused with workand they were steady there were scabs on one palm where he had fallen to the ground during last nights melee ink stained some of his fingertips ill need to take some steps he said youd best get a move on i nodded see you there he took his spectacles off and began to polish the lenses carefully with a handkerchief aye the trial began less than an hour later i sat on a stone bench that was set over to one side of the stage floor molly at my side we were to be witnesses mouse sat on the floor beside me he was going to be a witness too though i was the only one who knew it the seats were all filled that was why the council met at various locations out in the real world rather than in edinburgh all the time there simply wasnt enough room wardens formed a perimeter all the way around the stage at the doors and in the aisles that came down between the rows of benches everyone present was wearing his or her formal robes all flowing black with stoles of silk and satin in one of the various colors and patterns of trim that denoted status among the councils members blue stoles for members red for those with a century of service a braided silver cord for acknowledged master alchemists a goldstitched caduceus for master healers a copper chevron near the collar for those with a doctorate in a scholarly discipline some of the wizards had so many of them that they had stretched the fabric of the stole an embroidered white seal of solomon for master exorcists and so on i had a plain blue stole with no ornaments whatsoever though id been toying with the idea of embroidering ged on it in red white and blue thread molly was the only one in the room wearing a brown robe people were avoiding our gazes the white council loved its ceremonies anastasia luccio appeared in the doorway in her full regalia plus the grey cloak of the wardens her arm was still in a sling but she carried the ceremonial staff of office of the captain of the wardens in one hand she entered the room and the murmuring buzz of the crowd fell silent she slammed the end of the staff three times upon the floor and the six members of the senior council entered in their dark robes and purple stoles led by the merlin they proceeded to the center rear of the stage and stood solemnly peabody appeared carrying a lapsized writing desk and sat down on the far end of the bench from molly and me to begin taking notes his pen scratching i put my hand on mouses head and waited for the show to beginbecause thats all this was a show two more wardens appeared with a bound figure between them morgan was brought in and stood as all accused brought before the council didwith his hands bound in front of him and a black hood over his head he wasnt in any shape to be walking the idiot but he was managing to limp heavily along without being physically supported by either warden he must have been on a load of painkillers to manage it the merlin speaking in latin said we have convened today on a matter of justice to try one donald morgan who stands accused of the premeditated murder of senior council member aleron lafortier conspiracy with the enemies of the white council and treason against the white council we will begin with a review of the evidence they stacked things up against morgan for a while laying out all the damning evidence they had a lot of it morgan standing there with the murder weapon in his hand over the stillwarm corpse the bank account with slightly less than six million dollars suddenly appearing in it the fact that he had escaped detention and badly wounded three wardens in the process and subsequently committed sedition by misleading other wizardsmolly and i were just barely mentioned by nameinto helping him hide from the wardens donald morgan the merlin said have you anything to say in your defense that part was sort of unusual the accused were very rarely given much of a chance to say anything it clouded issues so i do not contest the charges morgan said firmly through his black hood i and i alone am responsible for lafortiers death the merlin looked like hed just found out that someone had cooked up his own puppy in the sausage at breakfast that morning he nodded once if there is no other evidence then the senior council will now pass i stood up the merlin broke off and blinked at me the room fell into a dead silence except for the scratch of peabodys pen he paused to turn to a new page and pulled a second inkwell out of his pocket placing it on the writing desk anastasia stared at me with her lips pressed together her eyes questioning what the hell was i doing i winked at her then walked out into the center of the stage and turned to face the senior council warden dresden ebenezar said have you some new evidence to present for the senior councils consideration i do i said point of order ancient mai injected smoothly warden dresden was not present at the murder or when the accused escaped custody he can offer no direct testimony as to the truth or falsehood of those events another point of order listenstowind said warden dresden earns a living as a private investigator and his propensity for ferreting out the truth in difficult circumstances is well established mai looked daggers at injun joe warden dresden the merlin said heavily your history of conflict with warden morgan acting in his role as a warden of the white council is wellknown you should be advised that any damning testimony you give will be leavened with the knowledge of your history of extreme sometimes violent animosity the merlin wasnt the merlin for nothing he had instincts enough to sense that maybe the game wasnt over yet after all and he knew how to play to the crowd he wasnt warning me so much as making sure that the wizards present knew how much i didnt like morgan so that my support would be that much more convincing i understand i said the merlin nodded proceed i beamed at him i feel just like hercule poirot i said in my reasonably functional latin let me enjoy this for a second i took a deep breath and exhaled in satisfaction the merlin had masterful selfcontrol his expression never changedbut his left eye twitched in a nervous tic score one for the cartoon coyote i first became suspicious that morgan was being framed well basically when i heard the ridiculous charge against him i said i dont know if you know this man but i do hes hounded me for most of my life if hed been accused of lopping off the heads of baby bunny rabbits because someone accused them of being warlocks i could buy that but this man could no more betray the white council than he could flap his arms and fly working from that point i hypothesized that another person within the council had killed lafortier and set morgan up to take the blame so i began an independent investigation i gave the senior council and the watching crowd of wizards the rundown of the past few days leaving out the overly sensitive and unimportant bits my investigation culminated in the theory that the guilty individual was not only trying to fix the blame upon morgan but planting the seeds of a renewed outbreak of hostilities with the vampire white court by implicating them in the death in an effort to manipulate this person into betraying himself i continued i let it be known that a conspirator had come forward to confess their part in the scheme and would address members of the white council at a certain place and time in chicago working on the theory that the true killer was a member of the councilindeed someone here at headquarters in edinburghi hypothesized that he would have little choice but to come to chicago through the way from edinburgh and i had the exit of that way placed under surveillance i held up the manila envelope these are the photographs taken at the scene of everyone who came through the way during the next several hours i opened the envelope and began passing the senior council the photos they took them looking at each in turn ebenezar calmly confirmed that the images of the wardens exiting the way together with himself mai and listenstowind were accurate other than this group i said i believe it is highly unlikely that anyone from edinburgh should have randomly arrived at the way in chicago given that the group was indeed assaulted by creatures with the support of a wizard of councillevel skill at that meeting i believe it is reasonable to state that the killer took the bait i turned drawing out the last photo with a dramatic flourish worthy of poirot and held it up so that the crowd could see it while i said so why dont you tell us what you were doing in the chicago area last night wizard peabody if id had a keyboard player lurking nearby for a soapopera organ sting it would have been perfect everyone on the senior council except ebenezar and for some reason the gatekeeper turned to stare slackjawed at peabody the senior councils secretary sat perfectly still beneath his little lap desk then he said i take it that you have proof more convincing than a simple visual image such things are easily manufactured in fact i said i do i had a witness who was close enough to smell you on cue mouse stood up and turned toward peabody his low growl filled the room like a big gentle drumroll thats all you have peabody asked a photo and a dog mai looked as if someone had hit her between the eyes with a sledgehammer that she said in a breathless tone is a foo dog she stared at me where did you get such a thing and why were you allowed to keep it he sort of picked me i said the merlins eyes had brightened mai the beasts identification is reliable she stared at me in obvious confusion entirely there are several other wizards present who could testify to the fact yes rumbled a stocky bald man with an asian cast to his features its true said a middleaged woman with skin several tones darker than my own maybe from india or pakistan interesting the merlin said turning toward peabody there was something almost sharklike about his sudden focus working on the evidence dresden found ebenezar said warden ramirez and i searched peabodys chambers thoroughly not twenty minutes ago a test of the inks he used to attain the signatures of the senior council for various authorizations revealed the presence of a number of chemical and alchemical substances that are known to have been used to assist psychic manipulation of their subjects it is my belief that peabody has been drugging the ink for the purpose of attempting greater mental influence over the decisions of members of the senior council and that it is entirely possible that he has compromised the free will of younger members of the council outright listenstowinds mouth opened in sudden surprise and understanding he looked down at his inkstained fingertips and then up at peabody peabody may not have seen the man turn into a grizzly but he was bright enough to know that injun joe was getting set to adjust another relative asstoears ratio the little secretary took one look around the room and then at my dog the expression went out of his face the end he said calmly and clearly is nigh and then he flung his spare pot of ink onto the floor shattering the glass mouse let out a whuffing bark of warning and knocked molly backward off of the bench as a dark cloud rose up away from the smashed bottle swelling with supernatural speed tendrils reaching out in all directions one of them caught a warden who had leapt forward toward peabody it encircled his chest and then closed everything the slender thread of mist touched turned instantly to a fine black ash slicing through him as efficiently as an electric knife through deli meat the two pieces of the former warden fell to the floor with wet heavy thumps id seen almost exactly the same thing happen once before years ago get back i screamed its mordite then the lights went out and the room exploded into screams and chaos chapter fortyeight the truly scary part wasnt that i was standing five feet away from a cloud of weaponsgrade deathstone that would rip the very life force out of everything it touched it wasnt that i had confronted someone who was probably a member of the black council probably as deadly in a tussle as their members always seemed to be and who was certainly fighting with his back to the wall and nothing to lose it wasnt even the fact that the lights had all gone out and that a battle to the death was about to ensue the scary part was that i was standing in a relatively small enclosed space with nearly six hundred wizards of the white council men and women with the primordial powers of the universe at their beck and calland that for the most part only the wardens among them had much experience in controlling violent magic in combat conditions it was like standing in an industrial propane plant with five hundred chainsmoking pyromaniacs doublejonesing for a hit it would only take one dummy to kill us all and we had four hundred and ninetynine to spare no lights i screamed backing up from where id last seen the cloud no lights but my voice was only one amongst hundreds and dozens of wizards reacted in the way iand peabodyhad known they would theyd immediately called light it made them instant easy targets cloudy tendrils of concentrated death whipped out to strike at the source of any light spearing directly through anyone who got in the way i saw one elderly woman lose an arm at the elbow as the morditeladen cloud sent a spear of darkness flying at a wizard seated two rows behind her a darkskinned man with gold dangling from each ear roughly pushed a younger woman who had called light to a crystal in her hand the tendril missed the woman but struck him squarely instantly dissolving a hole in his chest a foot across and all but cut his corpse in half as it fell to the floor screams rose sounds of genuine pain and terrorsounds the human body and mind are designed to recognize and to which they have no choice but to react it hit me as hard as the first time id ever heard it happenthe desire to be away from whatever was causing such fear combined with the simultaneous engagement of adrenaline the need to act to help calmly said a voice from right beside my right earexcept that it couldnt have been there because bandages covered that side of my head completely and it was physically impossible for a voice to come through that clearly which meant that the voice was an illusion it was in my head furthermore i recognized the voiceit was langtrys the merlins council members get on the ground immediately said the merlins calm unshakable voice assist anyone who is bleeding and do not attempt to use lights until the mistfiend is contained senior council i have already engaged the mistfiend and am preventing it from moving any farther away rashid prevent it from moving forward and disintegrating me if you please mai and martha liberty take its right flank mccoy and listenstowind its left its rather strongwilled so lets not dawdle and remember that we must also prevent it from moving upward the entire length of that dialogue though i could have sworn it was physically audible was delivered in less than half a secondspeech at the speed of thought it came accompanied with a simplified image of the speaking room as if it had been drawn on a mental chalkboard i could clearly see the swirling outline of the mistfiend surrounded by short blocks with each block labeled with the names of the senior council and drawn to represent a section of threedimensional dome that would hem the cloudy terror in hells bells the merlin had in the literal length of a second and a half turned pure confusion into an ordered battle i guess maybe you dont get to be the merlin of the white council by saving up frequentflier miles id just never seen him in motion before warden dresden the merlin said or thought or projected if you would be so good as to prevent peabody from escaping warden thorsen and his cadre are on the way to support you but we need someone to hound peabody and prevent him from further mischief we do not yet know the extent of his psychic manipulations so trust none of the younger wardens i love being a wizard every day is like disneyland i ripped off my ridiculous stole robe and cloak as i turned toward the doorway the frantic motions of panic made the two or three light sources that had not been instantly snuffed into independent stroboscopes running toward the rooms exit was a surreal experience but i was certain that peabody had planned his steps before hed begun to move and hed had plenty of time to sprint across the room in the darkness and leave the auditorium i tried to think like a wizard who had just been outed as black council and marked for capture interrogation and probable death given that i had been fairly sure it was going to happen to me over the past few days id already given consideration to how to get out of council hq and i figured peabody had taken more time to plan than i had if i was him id rip open a way into the nevernever and close it behind me id find a good spot to get out and then id make sure it was prepared to be as lethally hostile to pursuers as i could make it the centuries upon centuries of wards placed upon the edinburgh tunnels by generations of wizards though prevented any opening to the nevernever from inside the security checkpoints so peabody would have to get through at least one wardenmanned security gate before he enacted his plan i had to stop him before he got that far i plunged through the doorway and noted that both wardens on guard outside were of the younger generation who had risen to the ranks since the disastrous battle with the red court in sicily both young men were standing blankly at attention showing no reaction whatsoever to the furor in the speaking room a corner of a black formal robe snapped as its wearer rounded a corner in the hallway to my right and i was off and running i felt like hell but for a refreshing change of pace i had an advantage over an older more experienced wizardi was younger and in better shape wizards might stay alive and vigorous for centuries but their bodies still tend to lose physical ability if they do not take great pains to stay in training even then they still dont have the raw capabilities of a young personand running at a dead sprint is as raw as physical activity gets i rounded the corner and caught a glimpse of peabody running up ahead of me he turned another corner and by the time i rounded that one i had gained several steps on him we blew through administration and passed the warden barracks where three wardens who were still freaking teenagers the dangerous babies wed hurried through military training for the war emerged from the doors twenty feet ahead of peabody the end is nigh he snarled all three of them froze in their tracks their expressions going blank and peabody went through the group puffing and knocked one of them down i pushed harder and he started glancing over his shoulder his eyes wide he ducked around the next corner and my instincts twigged to what he was about to try i came around the corner and flung myself into a diving roll and a spray of conjured liquid hissed as it went by overhead it smacked against the wall behind me with a frantic chewing noise like a thousand bottles of carbonated soda all shaken and simultaneously opened i hadnt had time to recharge my energy rings and they were still on my dresser back home but i didnt want peabody to get comfortable taking shots at me over his shoulder i lifted my right hand snarled fuego and sent a basketballsized comet of fire flying down the hallway at him he spat out a few words and made a onehanded defensive gesture that reminded me of doctor strange and my attacking spell splashed against something invisible a good three feet short of him even so some of it wound up setting the hem of his formal robes on fire and he frantically shucked out of it as he continued to flee i made up even more distance on him and as he turned into one of the broad main hallways of the complex i wasnt twenty feet away and the first security checkpoint was right in front of us four wardens all of them young manned the gatewhich was to say that since all the grownups grandpas and fussbudgets who might object were at the trial they were sitting on the floor playing cards stop that man i shouted peabody shrieked obviously terrified dresdens gone warlock hes trying to kill me the young wardens bounced to their feet with the reaction speed of youth one of them reached for his staff and another drew his gun a third turned and made sure the gate was lockedand the fourth acted on pure instinct whipping her hand around her head in a tight circle and making a throwing gesture as she shouted i brought up my shield in time to intercept an invisible bowling ball but the impact hit the shield with enough force to stop me cold my legs werent ready for that and i staggered bouncing a shoulder off of one wall peabody s eyes gleamed with triumph as i fell and he snapped the end is nigh freezing the young wardens in place as hed done before he ripped the key on its leather thong from around the neck of one of the wardens opened the gate then turned with a dagger in his hand and sliced it along the thigh of the young woman who had clobbered me she cried out and her leg began spurting blood in rhythm with her heart a telltale sign of a severed artery i got back to my feet and hurled a club of raw force at peabody but he defeated it as he had the fireball leapt through the gate and ripped at the air peeling open a passage between this world and the next he plunged through it son of a bitch i snarled none of the young wardens were moving not even the wounded girl if she didnt get help she would bleed to death in minutes dammit i swore dammit dammit dammit i threw myself onto the girl ripping the belt off of my jeans and praying that the wound was far enough down her leg for a tourniquet to do any good footsteps hammered the floor and anastasia luccio appeared gun in her good hand her face white with pain she slid to a halt next to me breathing hard set the weapon on the floor and said ive got her go on the other side of the security gate the way was beginning to close i rose and rushed it diving forward there was a flash of light and the stone tunnel around me abruptly became a forest of dead trees that smelled strongly of mildew and stagnant water peabody was standing right in front of the way as he tried to close it and i hit him in a flying tackle before he could finish the job he went over backward and we hit the ground hard for a stunned half second neither of us moved and then peabody shifted his weight and i caught the gleam of the bloodied dagger at the edge of my vision he thrust the point at my throat but i got an arm in the way he opened a vein i grabbed at his wrist with my other hand and he rolled gaining the upper position and gripping the dagger with both hands leaning against my one arm with all of his weight drops of my own blood fell onto my face as he forced the point slowly toward my eye i struggled to throw him off me but he was stronger than he looked and it was clear that he had more experience in closequarters fighting than i did i clubbed at him with my wounded arm but he shrugged it off i felt my triceps giving way and watched the tip of the knife come closer the breaking point was at hand and he knew it he threw more effort into his attack and the daggers tip suddenly stung hot against my lower eyelid then there was a huge noise and peabody went away i remained still for a stunned moment and then looked up morgan lay on the ground just inside the stillopen way luccios gun smoking in his hand his wounded leg a mass of wet scarlet how hed managed to run after us given his injury i had no idea even with painkillers it must have hurt like hell he stared at peabodys body with hard eyes then his hand started to shake and he dropped the gun to the ground he followed it down with a groan i went to him breathing hard morgan i turned him over and looked at his wound it was soaked in blood but it wasnt bleeding much anymore his face was white his lips looked grey he opened his eyes calmly got him yeah i said you got him he smiled a little thats twice i pulled your ass out of the fire i choked out a little laugh i know theyll blame me he said quietly theres no confession from peabody and im a better candidate politically let them pin it on me dont fight it i want it i stared down at him why he shook his head smiling wearily i stared down at him for long seconds and then i got it morgan had been lying to me from the very start because you already knew who killed lafortier she was there when you woke up in his chambers you saw who did it and you wanted to protect her anastasia didnt do it morgan said his voice intense and low she was a pawn asleep on her feet she never even knew she was being used he shuddered should have thought of that she got put in that younger body made her mind vulnerable to influence again what happened i asked woke up lafortier was dead and she had the knife took it from her veiled her and pushed her out the door morgan said didnt have time to get both of us out so you took the blame thinking youd sort things out in the aftermath but you realized that the frame was too good for anyone to believe you when you tried to tell them what was up i shook my head morgan hadnt given a damn about his own life hed escaped when he realized that anastasia had still been in danger that he wouldnt be able to expose the real traitor alone dresden he said quietly yeah i didnt tell anyone about molly what she tried to do to ana i i didnt tell i stared at him unable to speak his eyes became cloudy do you know why i didnt why i came to you i shook my head because i knew he whispered he lifted his right hand and i gripped it hard i knew that you knew how it felt to be an innocent man hounded by the wardens it was the closest hed ever come to saying that hed been wrong about me he died less than a minute later chapter fortynine thorsen kept me from bleeding to death from the cut peabody had given me the swede and his backup squad had been faced with a long run to catch up a lot of locked gates and the confusion wed left in our wake they reached me about three minutes after morgan died they did their best to revive morgan but his body had taken enough torment and lost too much blood they didnt even bother with peabody morgan had doubletapped the traitors head with luccios pistol they bundled me off to the infirmary where injun joe and a crew of healerssome of whom had gone to medical school when the efficacy ofleeches was still being debatedwere caring for those wounded in the attack after that things fell into place without requiring my participation the senior council managed to contain and banish the morditeinfused mistfiend a rare and dangerous gaseous being from the far reaches of the nevernever before it had killed more than forty or fifty wizards all things considered it could have been a lot worse but the fact that it had been the gathering of lafortiers former political allies who had been subject to the attack occasioned an enormous outcry of suspicion with the offended parties claiming that the merlin had disregarded their safety been negligent in his security precautions etc etc the fact that the attack had occurred while unmasking lafortiers true killer was brushed aside there was political capital to be had basically the entire supernatural world had heard about lafortiers death the ensuing manhunt for morgan and the dustup during his trial though most of the details were kept quiet though there was never any sort of official statement made word got out that morgan had been conspiring with peabody and that both of them had been killed during their escape attempt it was a brutal and callous way for the council to save face the merlin decided that it was ultimately less dangerous for the wizards of the world if everyone knew that the council responded to lafortiers murder with a statement of deadly strength and powerie the immediate capture and execution of those responsible but i knew that whoever peabody had been in bed with the people who had really been responsible knew that the council had killed an innocent man and one of their largest military assets at that to get the job done maybe the merlin was right maybe its better to look stupid but strong than it is to look smart but weak i dont know im not sure i want to believe that the world stage bears that strong a resemblance to high school the councils investigators worked more slowly than laras had but they got to the same information by following the money eventually the council confronted the white court with the information lara sent them the heads of the persons responsible literally leave it to lara to find a way to get one last bit of mileage out of madeline and the business managers corpses she told the council to keep the money too by way of apology the next best thing to six million in cash buys a lot of oil to pour on troubled waters he might have wound up with his brains splattered all over a desolate little hellhole in the nevernever but peabody had inflicted one hell of a lot of damage before he was through a new age of white council paranoia had begun the merlin the gatekeeper and injun joe investigated the extent of peabodys psychic infiltration in some ways the worst of what hed done was the easiest to handle damn near every warden under the age of fifty had been programmed with that gotosleep trance command and it had been done so smoothly and subtly that it was difficult to detect even when the master wizards were looking and knew where to find it ebenezar told me later that some of the young wardens had been loaded up with a lot more in the way of hostile psychic software though it was impossible for one wizard to know exactly what another had done several of them apparently had been intended to become the supernatural equivalent of suicide bombersthe way luccio had been repairing that kind of damage was difficult unpredictable and often painful to the victim it was a long summer and autumn for a lot of the wardens and a mandatory psychic selfdefense regimen was instituted within weeks it was tougher for the members of the senior council in my opinion all of whom had almost certainly been influenced in subtle ways they had to go back over their decisions for the past several years and wonder if they had been pushed into making a choice if it had been their own action or if the ambiguity of any given decision had been natural to the environment the touch had been so light that it hadnt left any lasting tracks for anyone with half a conscience it would be a living nightmare especially given the fact that they had been leading the council in time of war i tried to imagine secondguessing myself on everything id done for the past eight years i wouldnt be one of those guys for the world i was in the infirmary for a week i got visits from mccoy ramirez and molly mouse stayed at my bedside and no one tried to move him listenstowind was a regular presence since he was pretty much my doctor several of the young wardens i had helped train stopped by to have a word though all of them were looking nervous anastasia never visited though listenstowind said she had come by and asked after me when i was asleep the gatekeeper came to see me in the middle of the night when i woke up he had already created a kind of sonic shield around us that made sure we were speaking in privacy it made our voices sound like our heads were covered with large tin pails how are you feeling he asked quietly i gestured at my face which was no longer bandaged as listenstowind had promised my eye was fine i had two beautiful scars though one running down through my right eyebrow skipping my eye and continuing for an inch or so on my cheekbone and another one that went squarely through the middle of my lower lip and on a slight angle down over my chin like herr harrison von ford i said dueling scars and beauty marks the girls will be lining up now the quip didnt make him smile he looked down at his hands his expression serious ive been working with the wardens and administrative staff whose minds peabody invaded i heard it appears he said choosing his words carefully that the psychic disruption to anastasia luccio was particularly severe i was wondering if you might have any theories that might explain it i stared across the darkened room quietly for a moment then asked did the merlin send you i am the only one who knows he said seriously or who will know i thought about it for a moment before i said would my theory make any difference in how she gets treated potentially if it seems sound it might give me the insight i need to heal her more quickly and safely give me your word i said i wasnt asking you have it before he died i said morgan told me that when he woke up in lafortiers room luccio was holding the murder weapon i described the rest of what morgan had told me of that night the gatekeeper stared across the bed at the far wall his face impassive he was trying to protect her i guess he figured the council might do some wacky thing like sentencing an innocent person to death he closed his eyes for a moment and then touched the fingertips of his right hand to his heart his mouth and his forehead it explains some things like what he held up his hand in a moment i told you that the damage to anastasia was quite extensive not because she had been persuaded to do violencethat much came easily to her i believe her emotional attitudes had been forcibly altered emotional attitudes i said quietly you mean her and me yes because she always believed in keeping her distance i said quietly until recently yes he said she never cared about me he shrugged his shoulders there had to have been some kind of foundation upon which to build its entirely possible that she genuinely felt fond of you and that something might have grown from it but it was forced into place instead who would do that i shook my head no thats obvious why would he do that to keep tabs on you perhaps the gatekeeper replied perhaps to have an asset in position to remove you if it became necessary you were after all virtually the only younger warden who never gave peabody an opportunity to exploit you since you never came to headquarters youre also probably the most talented and powerful of your generation the other young wardens like to associate with you generally so there was every chance you might notice something amiss taken as a whole you were a threat to him i felt a little sick thats why she showed up in chicago when she should have been back at headquarters helping with the manhunt almost certainly he said to give peabody forewarning if you should get closer to his trail and to locate morgan so that peabody could make him disappear morgan dead at the hands of white council justice is one thing had peabody succeeded killed morgan and gotten rid of the body then as far as we knew the traitor would be at large in the world and uncatchable it would have been a continuous stone around our necks and a perfect cover for peabody i said he could off whoever he wanted and given the slightest excuse everyone would assume that it had been morgan not only peabody the gatekeeper said any of our enemies might have taken advantage of it the same way and it also explains why he came to chicago after i dropped that challenge on the council he probably thought that the fake informant was anastasia he had to go there to find out if his brainlock was holding i shook my head i mean he never needed to come through that way since he already knew one out to demonreach christ i got lucky also true the gatekeeper said though i would suggest that your forethought allowed you to make your own luck he shook his head if morgan had not acted so quickly things might have been even worse luccio would have stood accused as well and neither of them would have had any idea what had happened accusing morgan was bad enoughthe wardens would not have stood for both the captain and her second to be placed under arrest it might have begun a civil war all on its own morgan he loved luccio i said the gatekeeper nodded he wore his heart on his sleeve for quite a while when he was younger but she never let anyone close in retrospect it was a personality shift that should have been noted though she kept her relationship with you discreet i snorted quietly easy to expect tampering when someone turns into a foaming maniac i said when someone changes by becoming happy its sort of hard not to be happy for them he smiled a brief flash of warmth very true so shes i mean when you help her start fixing the damage its already begun her subconscious has been struggling against the bindings placed in her mind for some time even if shed felt something before the fact that it was forced upon her will cause a backlash yeah i said things got sort of tense between us i guess after this whole situation got going i mean i sort of figured wed already broken up but but this wasnt a case of having loved and lost she had never loved me madelines kiss when shed buried me in an avalanche of bliss while she took a bite from my life force had proved that anastasia hadnt ever been in love maybe she hadnt ever really liked me or maybe she had or maybe it was all of the above whatever it had been it was over now before it could grow into anything else and neither of us had been given much of a choice in the matter i hadnt expected it to hurt quite as much as it did rashid put his hand on my shoulder im sorry he said i thought you deserved to know yeah i said my voice rough thank you i guess i found myself letting out a bitter little laugh the gatekeeper tilted his head ive been trying to work out why no one used magic on anyone at lafortiers murder what is your conclusion you cant do anything with magic that you dont really truly believe in i said some part of luccio had to recognize that killing lafortier was wrong so she used a knife morgan could no more have unleashed magic upon a lawfully serving senior council member or onto his commanding officer than he could have apologized for how hes treated me and lafortier never saw it coming from anastasia he probably died confused never had a chance to use a spell i looked up at the gatekeeper it wasnt some big arcane mysterious reason it was because everyone was human in my experience he said that is more than mystery enough i was gathering my things to leave and go back home when ebenezar appeared in the doorway hoss he said calmly figured i would walk you home appreciated sir i told him i had already sent mouse home with molly and it was always a good idea to avoid walking the ways alone we started walking through the tunnels i was heartily sick of them im not claustrophobic or anything but i think youd need some kind of groundhog gene to enjoy living at white council hq we hadnt gone far when i realized that ebenezar was taking a roundabout route to the way through tunnels that were largely unused and unlit he conjured a dim red light to his staff just enough to let us see our way and in the color least likely to be noticed well he said we filled lafortiers seat on the senior council today klaus the toymaker i asked ebenezar shook his head slowly klaus didnt say it but i suspect the merlin asked him to decline gregori cristos got the seat i frowned the seats on the senior council were awarded geriocratically whoever had the most years of service in the council was offered the position of leadership though there was nothing that required a wizard to accept a seat when it was available who the hell is that hes not up at the top of the seniority list my mentor grimaced aye a greek and an unpleasant bastard hes lived all through southern asia over the past couple of centuries distinguished himself in the battle with that rakshasa raja the council took on recently i remember when it happened i said i heard it was pretty crazy ebenezar grunted he was lafortiers protégé i took that in processing the logic i thought that bloc had been appeased when someone wants power you cant buy him off ebenezar said hell take what you offer and keep on coming and cristos as much as told the merlin that he and his allies would secede from the council if he didnt get the seat jesus i said quietly he nodded might as well give the red court the keys to all our gates and let them kill us in our sleep fewer bystanders would get hurt so the merlin made a deal i said didnt have a lot of choice cristoss people gained a lot of support after they lost so many at the trial hed have taken a third of the council with him screw the selection process huh ebenezar grimaced its never been codified by anything but tradition oh the merlin made a show of adhering to it but i guarantee you it was arranged behind the scenes hoss he shook his head the senior council has issued official positions on lafortiers assassination let me guess i said lone gunman he frowned at that for a moment and then nodded oh kennedy yes it was an act of individuals motivated by profit there is no evidence to suggest the presence of an organized conspiracy there is no black council i stared blankly at ebenezar thats stupid damn right he said but they had a majority the merlin cristos mai martha liberty and the gatekeeper i shook my head what the hell does he think hes accomplishing ebenezar shrugged hes never been easy to read and ive known him since i was sixteen years old two or three explanations come to mind like maybe hes black council ebenezar walked for several steps in silence then he said aye or maybe peabody got to him harder than we all think i said improbable ebenezar said the drugs he slipped the senior council let him nudge them us but were all too crusty to bend more than that what then well hoss he said maybe langtrys worried about the consequences of officially acknowledging the black council i felt a little chill glide over the nape of my neck hes worried that if enough people knew that the black council was real they wouldnt line up to fight them theyd join everyone loves a winner ebenezar said and we havent been looking too good lately people are afraid cristos is building his influence on it i stopped in my tracks and all but threw up on the cold stone floor ebenezar stopped putting his hand on my arm and frowned in concern what is it boy sir i said hearing my voice shake when peabody came to the island yes he wasnt alone someone else came with him someone we never saw we said nothing for a long minute thats only one explanation hoss ebenezar said its not even a calculated estimate its a flatout guess there was no conviction in his voice though ebenezar felt the same thing i did a hard gut feeling that left me certainnot pretty sure but certainthat i was right besides we were talking in whispers in an outoftheway corridor of our own damn stronghold if that didnt tell you something was seriously wrong with the white council i dont know what would theyre inside i whispered my mentor faced me gravely thats why they whacked lafortier to get their own man into position i leaned against the wall and shook my head they won they won the round he said fight isnt over it is for morgan i said but not for you he said with harsh intensity morgan thought that saving your life was worth losing his own ebenezar took a deep breath then he said very quietly hoss it aint over some of us are going to do something about it i looked at him sharply do something its just a few for now some wizards some key allies people we know we can trust im the only one who knows everyone involved weve got to take this fight to the enemy learn more about them determine their goals shut them down fight fire with fire eh ebenezar smiled wryly in denying the existence of one conspiracy langtry has necessitated another and got himself a twofer with a side order of irony i said if the black council finds out about us theyre going to jump for joy theyll expose us call us the black council and go on their merry way us already is it his eyes gleamed as he nodded and given what well be doing if the white council finds out theyre going to call it sedition theyll execute us see what i mean just like disneyland i thought about it for a minute you know that in every objective sense were making a black council of our own aye so where does that leave us with pure hearts and good intentions he answered our strength shall be the strength of ten i snorted loudly ebenezar smiled wearily well hoss were not going to have much choice other than to be walking down some mighty dark alleys and doing it in mighty questionable company maybe we should think of ourselves as a grey council grey council i said we started walking again and after a few minutes i asked him the worlds gotten darker and nastier even in just the past few years do you think what we do will make a difference i think the same thing you do ebenezar said that the only alternative is to stand around and watch everything go to hell his voice hardened were not going to do that damn right were not i said we walked the rest of the way to chicago together murphy drove me down to get my car out of impound and i caught her up on most of what had happened on the way youre holding out on me she said when i finished some i said sort of necessary she glanced at me as she drove and said okay i lifted my eyebrows it is you are beginning to deal with some scary people harry she said quietly and people are trusting you with secrets i get that thanks murph she shook her head i dont know harry it means im trusting you to come to me when youve got something that intersects with my responsibilities im a cop if you screw me on something i should know she shrugged i dont know if we could ever patch something like that up i hear you i said she shook her head i never really cared for morgan but i wish it hadnt ended that way for him i thought about that for a minute and then said i dont know he went out making a difference he took out the traitor who had gotten hundreds of wizards killed he kept him from getting away with god only knows what secrets i shrugged a lot of wardens have gone down lately as exits go morgans was a good one i smiled besides if hed been around any longer he might have had to apologize to me that would have been a horrible way to go he had courage murphy admitted and he had your back yeah i said did you go to his funeral no one did i said officially he was corpus non gratus but we had a kind of a wake later unofficially told stories about him and came to the conclusion that he really was a paranoid intolerant gradea asshole murphy smiled ive known guys like that they can still be part of the family you can still miss them when theyre gone i swallowed yeah tell me you arent blaming yourself no i said honestly i just wish something id done had made more of a difference you survived she said under the circumstances i think you did all right maybe i said quietly i went through that phone you sent me she meant madelines phone the one binder had given me what did you find i asked the phone numbers to a lot of missing persons she said wheres the owner with them she pressed her lips together there were a lot of calls to a number i traced back to algeria and another in egypt a couple of restaurants apparently she took an index card out of her pocket and passed it to me it had the names and addresses of two businesses on it what are they she asked no clue i said maybe madelines contacts in the black council maybe nothing important no clue i guess well file this under wait and see i hate that file she said hows thomas i shrugged and looked down at my hands no clue my apartment was a wreck i mean its never really a surgical theaterexcept for right after morgan had shown up i guess but several days of frantic comings and goings various injuries and serving as morgans sickbed had left some stains not even my faerie housekeepers could erase the mattress wasnt salvageable much less the bedding or the rug wed transported his unconscious body on it was all soaked in blood and sweat and the various housekeeping faeries apparently didnt do dry cleaning theyd taken care of the usual stuff but there was considerable work still to be done and moving mattresses is never joyful much less when youve been thoroughly banged up by a supernatural heavyweight and then stabbed just for fun on top of it i set about restoring order though and i was hauling the mattress out to tie onto my car so that i could take it to the dump when luccio arrived she was dressed in grey slacks and a white shirt and carried a black nylon sports equipment bag which would hold i knew the rather short staff she favored and her wardens blade among other things the clothes were new i realized belatedly that theyd been the sort that shed favored when i first met her wearing another body hey i panted give me a second ill give you a hand she replied she helped me maneuver the mattress onto the top of the blue beetle and then we tied it off with some clothesline she checked the knots making sure everything was just so and then leaned on the car studying my face i looked back at her rashid said he talked to you she said i nodded didnt want to push i appreciate that quite a bit actually she looked off to one side mouse now that the work was done came out of a shamelessly lazy doze hed been holding in the doorway and trotted over to luccio he sat down and offered her his paw she smiled quietly and took it then she ruffled the fur behind his ears with her fingers the way she knew he liked and stood up i ah i wanted to be sure you were recovering thats very responsible of you i said she winced ah dammit to hell dresden she shook her head i spent almost two hundred years not getting close to anyone for damn good reasons as can be evidenced by what happened here can it she shook her head i was distracted by you by us i suppose maybe if i hadnt been id have seen something noticed something i dont know i kind of thought that you were distracted by the mind mage who had you twisted in knots she grimaced theyre separate things and i know that but at the same time i dont know that and here im talking like some flustered teenager she put her hands on her hips her mouth set in annoyance im not good at this help well i said i take it that you came here to let me know that you werent going to keep pursuing whatever it is we had its not because of you she said i know i said never was was it she exhaled through her nose a slow sigh her eyes lingered on me ive always liked you dresden for a long time i thought you were dangerous then i saw you in action against the heirs of kemmler and i respected you she smiled slightly youre funny i like that but i asked but someone pushed me toward you she said and that pisses me off and she started weeping though her posture and her voice didnt waver and i thought that maybe i had broken through some kind of scar or old wound or something that i had grown closer to you and maybe would keep growing closer to you and it made me feel she shook her head as her voice finally broke young it made everything feel new i walked around the car to stand in front of her i reached a hand toward her shoulder but she raised hers in a gesture of denial but it was a lie im not young harry im not new ive seen and done things that that you cant understand that i pray to god youll never need to understand she took a deep breath this is ridiculous i should be better at handling this whats wrong i asked quietly i mean other than the obvious i got to have sex again she snarled and i liked it i really liked it i had forgotten exactly how mindnumbingly incredible sex is and right now im having trouble forming complete sentences because i want to rip your shirt off and bite your shoulder while youre still sweating while you she broke off abruptly her cheeks turning bright red youre not even forty i leaned against the car looking at her and started laughing quietly she shook her head scowling ferociously at me her dark eyes bright how am i supposed to give you orders now she asked when you and i have done all the things weve done well what if i promise not to put the pictures on the internet she blinked at me pictures you are joking dresden arent you i nodded because i had quite enough of that during my first young adulthood she said italy may not have had an internet back then but youd be shocked how quickly pictures can circulate even when theyre painted on canvas ana i said quietly she bit her lip and looked at me i reached out and took her hands i squeezed them then i lifted them to my lips and kissed them each once gently whatever the reason im happy to remember the time we had she blinked her eyes several times looking up at me i get it i said things have changed and maybe that time is over but youll be okay and ill be okay you dont have to feel guilty about that she lifted my hands to her lips and kissed them once each just as i had a tear fell on my knuckle im sorry she said itll be okay i said its okay she nodded and looked up at me i could see the calm collected strength of the captain of the wardens ready to assume its guiding role i could see the uncertainty of anastasia who hadnt been close to anyone in a long time and maybe i could see something lonely and sad that was a part of who she had been when she was a young woman well over a century before i was born goodbye harry she whispered goodbye ana i said she squeezed my hands and turned to walk away she stopped after half a dozen paces and looked back dresden i looked at her rashid doesnt talk much about the night morgan died i barely remember anything myself after peabody said what he said i knew what she was after he wasnt alone i said i was with him and he knew that hed found the traitor he was content something tight in her shoulders eased thank you she said sure then she turned and strode purposefully away i looked at the bloodstained mattress on the blue beetle and sighed i didnt feel like driving it anywhere it was early it could wait a few hours i turned to mouse and said come on boy i need a beer we descended out of the summer heat into the relative cool of my basement apartment maybe i needed two it took justine more than two weeks to get me that meeting with thomas when she called she was speaking in her official secretary tone again she stipulated a public meeting place where both of us would have the protection of the need to maintain a low profile it was a precaution that the white court had required of me given how tense things had been between the council and the white courts leadership of late i met thomas on a saturday afternoon outside the great cat house at the lincoln park zoo as i came up i spotted a pair of laras security guys trying to blend in thomas was leaning on the rail that looked into this big pit where they keep a couple of tigers he was wearing tight blue jeans and a big loose white shirt every woman there and a large chunk of the guys were looking at him with various degrees of lust longing interest and seething hatred i walked up and leaned on the rail beside him hey i said hey we stood there watching the tigers for a few minutes you asked for the meeting he said what do you want i arched an eyebrow thomas i want to see you talk to you be sure youre okay youre my brother man he didnt react to my words not at all i studied his profile for a few moments then i said whats wrong he moved one shoulder in a careless gesture nothing is wrong per se unless it was me you were wrong i was an idiot to try to live the way ive been living he said i looked at him sharply what he rolled a hand in a lazy gesture the boutique the constant nibbling never sating myself the he shrugged all of it i stared hard at him then i asked very quietly what did the skinwalker do to you he reminded me of what i really am oh thomas turned to look at me with calm deep grey eyes yes it didnt take him long once he set about it i felt sick to my stomach what happened he hung me up by my heels thomas said and ripped strips of skin off of me one at a time i shuddered its agonizing he said not terribly dangerous to one of us my demon didnt really have any trouble regenerating the skinbut it did become hungry very very hungry his eyes suddenly gleamed paler silver and he looked back at the tigers which were now restlessly prowling the pit hed taken a female kine to the lair where he had me prisoner and he fed her to me hells bells i breathed thomas watched the tigers pace she was lovely sixteen or so i dont know exactly i didnt ask for her name he spread his hands it was a fatal feeding of course i dont think ive ever really explained to you exactly what that is like what is it like i asked in a quiet rasp like becoming light he said his eyes drifting closed like sinking into the warmth of a campfire when youve been shivering for hours like a hot steak after a day of swimming in cold water it transforms you harry makes you feel his eyes became haunted hollow whole i shook my head thomas jesus once she was gone and my body was restored the skinwalker tortured me again until i was in the same desperate condition then he fed me another doe he shrugged rinse and repeat perhaps half a dozen times he gave me young women and then put me in agony again i was all but chewing out my own innards when he took me to the island to tell you the truth i barely remember it he smiled i remember seeing molly but youve taught her enough to protect herself it seems thomas i said gently he smirked if you ever get tired of her i hope youll let me know i stared at him sickened thomas he looked at me again still smirkingbut he couldnt hold it once again his eyes looked hollow touched with despair he looked away from me you dont get it harry then talk to me i said urgently thomas jesus christ this is not you yes it is he spat the words a bladed hiss thats what it taught me harry at the end of the day im just an empty place that needs to be filled he shook his head i didnt want to kill those girls but i did it i killed them over and over and i loved how it felt when i think back on the memory of it it doesnt make me horrified he sneered it just makes me hard thomas i whispered please man this isnt what you want to be i know you man ive seen you youve seen who i wanted to be he said who i thought i was he shook his head and looked around at the people around us play a game with me what game he nodded toward a pair of young women walking by holding icecream cones what do you see when you look at them your first thought i blinked i looked uh blonde and brunette too young for me not bad to look at i bet the blonde paid too much for those shoes he nodded and pointed at an old couple sitting on a bench them theyre fighting with each other over something and enjoying it theyve been together so long its comfortable for them later theyll hold hands and laugh over the fight he pursed his lips and pointed at a mother chivvying a trio of small children of various sizes along the zoo them shes got an expensive ring but shes here at the zoo alone her kids all have matching outfits her husband works a lot and she doesnt look as good as she used tolook how the shoes are biting into her feet shes worried that shes a trophy wife or maybe an exwife in progress shes about to start crying uhhuh he said can i give you my first thoughts i nodded frowning at him thomas pointed a finger at the young women food he pointed a finger at the old couple food he pointed a finger at the mother and her children food i just stared at him he rolled his head inhaling deeply and then exhaling maybe it was all those kills together like that maybe he drove me insane with the torment he shrugged honestly i dont know i just know that things seem a lot simpler now what are you trying to tell me i asked that youre happy now happy he said scorn ringing lightly in his voice im not wandering around blind anymore not trying desperately to be something that im not he looked back down at the tigers something i can never be i just stood there shaking my head oh empty night harry he said rolling his eyes im not some kind of ravaging monster im not some kind of psychotic rampaging around the city devouring virgins he waved a hand in a casual gesture killing when you feed feels fantastic but its stupid there are far too many advantages in ensuring that the kine survive not only survive but grow and prosper he smiled a bit you know i really think i might have something to offer the world i never could have exerted any kind of influence on my kin as a moping exile trying to be human maybe this way i actually can accomplish something promote a more responsible standard of relations between humanity and my kind who knows i stared at him and said gosh thats noble he eyed me i hit him with my heaviest sucker punch what does justine think of it he straightened and turned toward me and there was imminent violence in the set of his body what he asked what did you say to me you heard me i said without changing posture or rising to the threat his hands closed into fists knuckles popping still stings doesnt it i said quietly still burns you when you try to touch her he said nothing and you still remember what it was to hold her like you did the night you trashed madeline at zero jesus christ harry he said he turned to face out away from the tigers and his voice was full of weariness i dont know i just know that it doesnt hurt so bad all the time anymore he was quiet for a long time then he said in a very quiet voice i have bad dreams i wanted to put my hand on his shoulder to give him some support but some instinct warned me that it wouldnt be welcomed you took a beating i said quietly what that thing did to you thomas it knew exactly how to get to you how to torment you the most but it wont last you survived youll get past it and go back to that miserable half life i had he whispered maybe i said quietly i dont know he looked at me youre my brother i said nothing will ever change that im here for you youre a damn fool he said yeah it would be easy to use you part of me thinks its a fantastic idea i didnt say you werent an asshole i said you were my brother the bodyguards stirred nothing big they just sort of animated and moved toward the exits thomas grimaced lara thinks ive made great progress shes he shrugged proud of me i liked you better the other way i said so did justine maybe that should tell you something ive got to go shes afraid youll think im all brainwashed didnt want to risk you trying to deprogram me when i havent been programmed i confess the idea occurred to me if someone had gotten into my head i dont think thered be so many doubts he said this isnt something you can help me with harry maybe i said maybe not either way youre still my brother broken damn record he said i held up a fist he stared at it for a couple of silent beats before he made a fist of his own and rapped my knuckles against his dont call me he said ill be patient i said but not forever he hesitated and then nodded once more then he thrust his hands into the hip pockets of his jeans and walked quickly away the bodyguards fell in behind him one of them said something while he had one hand pressed against his ear purely from petty malice i waved a hand and hexed his radio or phone sparks flew out of his ear and he all but fell over trying to get the earbud out thomas looked back he grinned not long but real after he was gone i turned to regard the tigers i wondered if i knew them for what they really were or if all i could see were the stripes id missed kirbys funeral while i was in the infirmary in edinburgh a couple of weeks had gone by after that and id talked to will and georgia by phone occasionally gaming night came along and as i had most weeks for the past several years i showed up at will and georgias place i had my arcanos rule book with me and a crown royal bag filled with dice i was wearing a black tshirt that had a monochrome image of several multisided dice and said in block print come to the dork side do not make me destroy you will answered the door and smiled at me hey harry wow your face is manly chicks dig scars i said who is it came andis voice it sounded limp lifeless it is i harry dresden i said solemnly georgia appeared behind will smiling harry she looked at my shirt and my gaming stuff oh we werent really going to kirby had been the one who ran the game for us i stepped aside grabbed the geek standing behind me and tugged him forward this is waldo butters i said and his geek penis is longer and harder than all of ours put together butters blinked first at georgia and will and then at me oh he said um thank you will looked from butters to me his eyes searching what is this he asked gently life i said it keeps going butters says he can handle an arcanos game or he can run a bunch of other ones if we want to try something new i cleared my throat if you like we can go over to my place change of view and so on georgia looked at me and gave me a small and grateful smile will looked at me uncertainly then he turned back into the apartment andi she appeared beside georgia andi looked absolutely withered multiple broken ribs and major surgery will do that to you she was on her feet and moving but it was clear that shed been staying with will and georgia so that they could help care for her until she recovered i smiled at andi and said i dont think kirby would want us to stop playing completely what do you think i mean it wont be the same game but it might be fun she looked at me and then at butters then she gave me a little smile and nodded will swung the door open wide and we went inside where i introduced butters to everyone and produced several bottles of macs best ale see heres the thing morgan was right you cant win them all but that doesnt mean that you give up not ever morgan never said that parthe was too busy living it i closed the door behind me while life went on authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of strep throat and was out of school for a whole week during that time my sisters bought me my first fantasy and scifi novels the boxed set of lord of the rings and the boxed set of han solo adventure novels by brian daley i devoured them all during that week from that point on i was pretty much doomed to join sff fandom from there it was only one more step to decide i wanted to be a writer of my favorite fiction material and here we are i blame my sisters my first love as a fan is swordsandhorses fantasy after tolkien i went after c s lewis after lewis it was lloyd alexander after them came fritz leiber roger zelazny robert howard john norman poul anderson david eddings weis and hickman terry brooks

writing swordsandhorses fantasy novelsand seemed to have little innate talent for it but i worked at my writing branching out into other areas as experiments including sf mystery and contemporary

and excitement one day i got a call from my agent and found out that i was going to get to share my newest swordsandhorses fantasy novel with other fans the codex alera is a fantasy series set within
