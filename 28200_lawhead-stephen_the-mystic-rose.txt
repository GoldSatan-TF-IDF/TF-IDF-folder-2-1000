stephen lawhead the mystic rose part i august edinburgh scotland a young woman of my acquaintance saw a ghost ordinarily i would not have given such a melodramatic triviality even passing notice save for two pertinent facts one the ghost appeared in broad daylight at the same country house where my wife and i had been staying that very weekend and two the ghost was pemberton what made this eerie curiosity more peculiar still was the fact that the spectre materialized in the room we would have occupied if my wife had not come down with a cold earlier that day thus necessitating our premature departure we returned to the city so she might rest more comfortably in her own bed that night otherwise we would surely have witnessed the apparition ourselves and spared miss euphemia gillespie a young lady of twenty and the daughter of one of the other guests who was staying that weekend with whom my wife and i were reasonably well acquainted rumour had it that miss gillespie was woken from her nap by a strange sound to find a tall gaunt figure standing at the foot of her bed dressed in a dark suit of clothes and holding his hat in his hands he was she reported soaking wet as if he had been caught in a fearsome shower without his brolly the young lady took fright and issued a cry of surprise whereupon the apparition introduced himself apologized and promptly vanished with a bewildered expression on his face be that as it may the full significance of this event did not truly strike home until word of pembertons death reached us two days later along with news of the loss of rms lusitania in the early afternoon of th may roughly the time when his ghost was seen by miss gillespie this ghostly manifestation might have made a greater stir if it had not been so completely overshadowed by the sinking of the lusitania the daily broadsheets were fall of venomous outrage at this latest atrocity a luxury liner torpedoed without warning by a german uboat taking almost twelve hundred civilian souls to a watery grave the edinburgh evening herald published a list of the missing drawn from the ships manifest among those who had embarked on the trip to liverpool from new york were a few score americans the rest were europeans of several nationalities pembertons name was on the list thus while the rest of the world contemplated the fact that the war had taken a sinister turn i mourned the death of a very dear and close friend i pondered the meaning of the spectral portent and no doubt would have given the matter its due consideration but i was very soon distracted by the precipitous and worrying decline in my wifes health the chill which she contracted that day in the country had grown steadily worse and by the time the doctor diagnosed influenza it was too late my dearest beloved helpmate and partner of fortyfour years passed away two days later within the space of a week i had lost the two most important people in my life i was bereft and broken where i might have expected to rely upon one to help me through the death of the other i had neither both were gone and i was left behind to struggle on as best i could the children were some comfort it is true but they had busy lives of their own and were soon called back to their affairs leaving me to flounder in quiet misery following my dear caitlins funeral i attempted to resume my work at the firm but quickly found that there was no joy or solace to be had in the toing and froing of the legal trade in truth i had for some time been deriving little pleasure from the practice of my profession now however i found the whole enterprise so grindingly tedious that it was all i could do to maintain civil relations with my younger colleagues i endured the daily agony for three months and then retired all through this time i had been wondering over the future of the brotherhood i daily expected the summons but it never came i suppose i began to feel as if the death of our leader had dealt a killing blow to our clandestine organizationin my sorry state of mind it would not have surprised me greatly i confess however the wheels of our order may grind slowly but they grind exceedingly fine owing to the unfortunate circumstances surrounding pembertons death we of the inner circle could not officially recognize our leaders demise until certain protocols had been observed i understand that now i didnt then also owing to the war evansour esteemed second principaladopted a cautious and conservative policy it would not have been the first time a passenger listed as missing at sea later turned up alive and well so we waited until there could be no doubt and prepared to mourn the death of our inestimable leader in our own way meanwhile i became a man of enforced leisure with plenty of idle hours on my hands i filled my time with little tasks and such chores as i deemed needful or pleasing and kept an increasingly anxious eye out for the dally postwaiting for the summons i knew must come at some point spring passed into summer and the days lengthened news of the war in europethe great war the newspapers were calling itgrew more and more dismal by degrees i forced myself to read the accounts and was sickened by them the more so i suppose because my own life was sliding into a season of desperate unhappiness i naturally found myself pondering the recent tragic events time and again i wrapped myself in melancholy recalling some happy time i had shared with my wife and brooding ruefully on the cruelty of time and the manifold weaknesses of the human frame still i did not descend entirely into the slough of despond i reviewed often pembertons attempt to communicate with me on the threshold of eternity as it were that was how i came to see it that fateful weekend in the country had been planned for some timepart of a confirmation celebration for the young son of a mutual acquaintance and pemberton knew about it indeed i had been surprised that he was acquainted with the fiamily in question and we discussed it if caitlin had not become ill we would have been in that room to see him thus he had appeared in the place he reckoned i was to be found but why me why not genotti decardou zaccaria or kutch why not evans our number two what had he been trying to tell me the quesnon gnawed at me until i decided one day to go and interview miss gillespie in the hope of finding an answer i wrote to her and established a place and time to meet kerwoods tea house on castle street a quiet place where we could discuss the matter discreetly my guest turned out to be one of those modem emancipated young women for whom conventions of dress and manner are dictated by personal taste and not by tradition or propriety or indeed modesty she appeared wearing one of those shimmery sheaths with little rows of tassels up and down its short shapeless length complete with spangled yellow hat and gloves confident educated and indifferent to matters domestic she proudly disclosed that she was soon to take up training as a nurse in order to assist in the war effort despite her deliberately provocative ways i soon discovered in miss gillespie a competent capable levelheaded young person not at all given to flights of fancy she also had a fine sense of humouras i quickly learned once the tea had come and we had settled into the discussion which was the purpose of my visit to tell the truth mister murray i do not know which of us was the more frightened if you could have seen the startled look he gave me the poor chapif he had been a haddock plucked from the sea and tossed into the middle of waverley station he could not have looked more surprised he was the most polite ghost you could imagine oh i can well imagine she looked at me over the rim of her cup daddy told me you knew the gentleman in question i knew him quite well and i can tell you that finding himself in a ladys bedroom would certainly have given him cause for alarm she smiled her pleasant round face lighting the dullness of a rainy saturday afternoon i really didnt mean to startle him but waking up and seeing him standing there at the foot of the bed all tall and rumpled and dripping like a drainpipewell im afraid i shouted at him terribly you were frightened i expect i was at first but that passed in an instant for i could see he was perplexed perplexed yes she said nodding thoughtfully that is the word he didnt seem to know what he was about you know how it isyoull be going on about your business absorbed in your thoughts and then you look up where am i she laughed happens to me all the timedont tell me its never happened to you it has been known i confessed enjoying the pleasure of her lively company i once found myself in the royal museum with no recollection of how id got there well thats how he looked to melike he didnt quite know where he was or how he got there did you know he was aboard the ship that was sunk by the german torpedo so daddy told me she shook her head gravely and was silent for a moment then said that would explain the dripping water did he say anything did he make any sound at all he did indeed he said he was sorry for disturbing me he told me his name and begged my pardon then he wished me a good dayat least thats what i thought he said i cant be at all certain why is that he was already vanishing by then you see he didnt go all of a snap she clicked her fingers he began to fade awaylike when a cloud passes over the sun and the day goes dim i see well i regarded the young woman as much as i appreciated the information it carried me no closer to the solution of the mystery which so exercised my mind a frown of concentration appeared on miss gillespies face there was one more thing yes i leaned forward eager to pounce on the smallest scrap of information i had quite forgotten until just now she said slowly as if trying to remember precisely just before he faded away completely he looked at me and saidif i recall it correctlysomething like the pain is swallowed in peace and grief in glory the message was obscure it made no sense to me and of all the things he might have wished to say i could not think this had any importance whatsoever forgive me miss gillespie but youre certain that is what he said she shook her head vehemently no mister murray im not at all sure it was very faint and by then he had mostly vanished nevertheless thats what it sounded like to me she regarded me with a hopeful expression does it mean anything to you i fear not i sighed but perhaps something will yet come of it we finished our tea then and made our farewells i thank you my dear for taking the time to speak to an old busybody i said as we parted please give my kind regards to your parents the rain had stopped and so i walked with her to the comer whereupon we went our separate ways as the day had come clear and bright and i had nothing pressing for my attention i decided to take a turn or two around the park i walked to the little square just down the street and entered by the iron gate a few children had come out to play their voices jiggled as they skipped and ran to the accompaniment of a barking terrier a young mother pushed her baby in a large black pram stopping every now and then to tuck up the blankets all the while doting on the face of her infant i strolled awhile along the fresh rainwashed gravel paths taking the air and watching the clouds as they broke apart and drifted eastward towards the north sea after a time i sat down on a bench and dozed only a moment it seemed to mebut i awoke to find the lowering sun had disappeared and a wind was blowing stiff and chill out of the west where darker more ominous clouds had gathered they were it seemed to me clouds of war shadows of the great evil rushing eastward to feed and strengthen the darkness already rampant there the political quagmire of the european noble houses was inexorably sucking one government and power after another deeper and deeper into the ruinous morass the fighting which had now spread on many fronts grew continually sharper more brutal and vicious by the day as yet there was no end in sight the splendour of the summer day was i reflected like our own lives upon the earth shortlived and bounded by darkness on every side it was in this sombre mood that i turned my steps towards home by the time i reached the house the weather had turned foul i unlocked the front door just as the first drops of rain spattered on to the pavement behind me i quickly stepped inside and as i turned to close the door behind me my eye fell upon a small buffcoloured envelope lying on the mat i turned it over and saw my name neatly lettered in black ink my heart began beating faster as i opened the envelope and saw the single word tonight chapter one at the pronouncement of the patriarch of constantinople the bride was carried from the cathedral on a silver bed draped with cloth of gold alone on that wide and glittering expanse she looked frightened cowed and far younger than her thirteen years before her went a hundred blackrobed monks chanting the gloria followed by the stiffly dignified metropolitan in his highcrowned ruby and ivorybeaded red satin hat the imposing prelate carried a large silver frame containing the sacred mandelion the cloth bearing the indelible image of christ one of byzantiums most highly valued treasures veiled in delicate silver netting from the top of her golden wedding crown to the tips of her whitestockinged toes the young womans slender form shimmered in the light of ten thousand candles as she passed through the standing congregation borne aloft on the shoulders of eight black ethiopians in yellow tunics the noble groom followed his new bride on a white horse leading a dovegrey mare both animals were caparisoned in scarlet edged with silver and both wore white ostrich plumes attached to their silver headpieces from her place in the gallery high above the floor caitriona mute with amazement gazed upon the dazzling spectacle and knew she had never seen anything half so magnificent and probably never would again everything from the golden crowns to the purple clouds of incense drifting like the mists of heaven worked an enchantment of wealth and power that left her breathless when the wedding procession passed beneath the upper gallery of ayia sophia all the onlookers rushed to the opposite side and leaned over the marble balustrade to see the towering ironclad doors of the great church flung open wide and the newly married couple depart on billows of pink rose petals the crowds which had been waiting outside the church since dawn roared with delight to see the royal party as it began the parade through the city to the triconchos palace where the official marriage banquet would be held amidst the marble columns of the hall of pearl well dear heart said duncan to his daughter what did you think of that you were very brave to bring me here caitriona replied i have always admired that in you papa indulgent perhaps but why do you say brave because she said her lips curving with sardonic glee now that i have seen how a lowly niece of the emperor is feted on her wedding day i shall accept nothing less on mine duncan clucked his tongue and said if i thought there was even the slightest chance you would deign to marry i swear this cathedral would witness a ceremony far more grand than that which just took place bring on the king and golden bed snipped cait let us get it done here and now is it too much for a father to hope the treasure of his life might find a little happiness in wedlock and ensure the continuance of the noble line yes she frowned dangerously look at me papa and tell me the truth who in their right mind would want to marry me any number of men dear heart given half a chance papa there are fairer women perhaps allowed duncan delicately but the beauty of the soul far outlasts the charms of the flesh show me a man enraptured with the beauty of the soul and i will show you a eunuch duncan sighed his daughters refusal to consider a suitable marriage had long been a thorn in his flesh while cait herself imagined it was her lack of loveliness which kept acceptable men at a distance her father strongly suspected it was the quick daggerlike edge of her tongue why oh why did she have to be so hardheaded and immovable it was he realized the family curse poor poor papa she cooed sliding her arm through his lumbered with a thankless wench of a daughter who makes his life a dreary cavalcade of suffering from dawn to dusk oh will this unendurable misery never cease leaving their places at the marble rail they began following the other nobles from the gallery once in the outer corridor they entered the slowmoving stream of people shuffling towards the wide staircase leading down to the main floor of the cathedral i suppose mused duncan philosophically there are worse things than having a daughter who thinks she is king of caithness cait laughed the sound delighted her father who heard in it the echo of her mothers voice alas that was all she had inherited from her mother caitrionas green eyes and long black hair were hers alone tall and longlimbed like her forefathersher stature made the vaunted grecian beauties seem scrawny and underfed she was a fully fleshed woman whose imposing presence easily dominated the more demure members of her sex few men could match his wilful daughter for strength of resolve and cold cleareyed reckoning he admitted to himself fewer still were keen to try the ancestral blood which flowed through her veins contained too much wild celt and too little refined nobility it was he knew often remarked that she was more at ease with a spear in her hand than a spindlebut what of that when cait passed by one caught the scent of sea air and rainmisted heather the bracing blustery wind off the highland moors was in her hair and in her impetuous exuberant nature cait herself was not unaware of what people thought of her but if other women were more comfortable in costly silks and satins than rough boots and riding trews more content to sit mooneyed beside the hearthfire with their needlework than hunt with the hounds so be it to caits way of thinking these shrinking swooning sisters had no one to blame for their drab and insipid lives but themselves papa were you and sydoni married here she asked gazing up at a glittering mosaic of the holy family resplendent in purple robes and gilded halos herein ayia sophia duncan glanced at her to see if she were teasing him but saw that she was in earnest no not here such splendour was far beyond our scanty means he paused remembering also i seem to remember that to be married in the cathedral required a tenmonth delay i fear neither one of us would have survived the waitthe fires of passion would have consumed us to cinders cait pretended shock presented with such a lacklustre jewel of virtue as yourself dear papa i am amazed they allowed you to be married at all so where did you find a priest to proclaim the banns we were married at the church of christ pantocrator padraig knew of it but then he knows everything as it happens it is not far from here we might go there this evening if you would like to see it if i would she chided it is the sole and entire purpose of this journey to drag your dutiful daughters over every last footprint of your great pilgrimage and well you know it duncan took her hand from his arm and kissed it you are a very treasure my light i wish sydoni were here cait said padraig too i am certain they would have a few tales to tell oh indeed agreed duncan somewhat wistfully remembering the day more than twenty years ago when he and sydoni had been married in this city and that night had celebrated their union well he continued after a moment pressing his daughters hand we must enjoy our brief stay all the more for their sake and hear what they have to say when we get home they reached the staircase and started down following the crowds and eventually joined the throng in the huge halllike vestibule just as the royal family emerged from the sanctuary imperial varangian guards moved with silent efficiency into the crowd and swiftly formed a double rank stretching from the sanctuary entrance to the outer doors whereupon they turned and stood shouldertoshoulder behind their goldrimmed shields ceremonial lances upraised the blades of their spears were gold and dressed with scarlet pennons but sharp nonetheless once this protective corridor was established other guardsmen marched through it clearing the crowds before them the emperor and empress said cait in spite of herself she was enjoying the imperial display go my dear he said urging her forward i will wait here cait released his arm and darted forward she threaded her way through the gathered horde and peered over the shoulders of the varangians to catch a glimpse of emperor manuel and empress irene and their sallowfaced daughter as they swept from the church they were followed by the patriarch and the archbishop and a long triple row of priests holding lanterns and chanting their voices rising and falling in rhythmic waves as soon as the priests passed the twin ranks of imperial bodyguards took three paces towards one another turned and marched from the church instantly there was a rush behind them as the congregation surged for the door to see the emperor flinging handfuls of gold coins to the crowds caitriona was momentarily caught up in the flow and quickly found herself outside the church the royal party moved on the clamouring populace with them and cait turned against the stream to make her way back inside the church to rejoin her father darting and sliding between closepacked clumps and clusters of people hurrying to follow the procession she made for the place where she had left himbut he was no longer in the vestibule she paused and looked around but could not see duncan anywhere and was at the point of going back outside to look for him when she caught sight of him in the dimly lit sanctuary lord duncan was standing next to one of the gigantic porphyry columns so as to be out of the way of the departing masses cait forced her way through the streaming multitude at the door and struggled to reach her father as she came nearer she saw that he was talking to someone she could not see who it might be for the stranger was hidden behind the column but from the expression on her fathers face the conversation was far from cordial duncans brow was lowered and his jaw was tight his chin thrust forward defiantly his eyes glinted cold fire which although fearsome was not easily kindled indeed caitriona had seen him this way but once in her life when an uninvited party of danes after setting up camp on the beach below the stronghold had stolen butchered and roasted three good breeding cows when duncan found out about it he marched down and confronted them in their camp the roistering danes got off lightly she thought with an apology and double payment for the cows he was not facing marauding danes now but the expression was the samehis noble features were alight with righteous wrath the sudden strangeness of the situation sent a thrill of alarm thrdugh her cait felt her scalp tingle with dread anticipation and her stomach tighten into a hard knot she put her head down and forced her way through the oncoming stream of people drawing near she called her fathers name he heard and turned his head at that instant another mans face moved out from the shadow of the pillar and cait saw it clearly he was bearded the beard grey but neatly trimmedin contrast to the stark white hair of his head which was long and brushed into an untidy nimbus around his highdomed forehead a long thin scar puckered the flesh above his left eye lifting the eyebrow into an expression of scorn which married to the ferocity glaring from his dark eyes gave him an aspect of ruthless malice that chilled cait to the bone then as if having seen the young woman hastening towards them the bearded man moved behind the pillar again she saw the glint of his bared teeth as he slid back into the shadows duncan turned towards him and the two continued their conversation cait sidestepped one group of noisy celebrants and shoved her way through another reaching her father at last by the time she rejoined him the bearded man was gone she looked where he had been standing and caught the fleeting glimmer of a long white surcoat with a red cross on the back as it disappeared into the crowd papa who was that she asked steppmg in beside him duncan staring fixedly ahead seemed to be concentrating most intently on her question he strained for the words which caught in his throat papa her voice became urgent duncan turned towards his daughter and forced a sickly smile his face suddenly grey he lost his balance and stretched his hand to the polished column to steady himself instinctively cait stepped in to bear him up what is wrong even as she spoke the words she glanced down at his other hand clutched at his side just below the ribs where a ribbon of blood seeped between his fingers papa cait he replied absentlyhe he duncan looked down at his wound and shuddered ah for the love of god he said his teeth clenched against the pain ah here she slid her arm under his and took his weight on to herself sit down and rest looking up she cried out help me someone please he is wounded but caits cry was swallowed in the general crush and confusion and the nearer passers by if they heard paid no attention she eased him to the floor and sat him down on the plinth which formed a step at the base of the column he slumped back resting his shoulders against the purple stone do not move she told him i will get help she made to dart away but he seized her wrist and held tight no cait he said his voice shaking stay i will be back before you know it she stood but he held her tight in his grasp no time my light stay with me father please she said let me find help she removed his hand and started off once more caitriona no he said his voice recovering something of its former strength there is only one who can help me now and i will soon stand before him stay and pray with me she turned and knelt beside him slipping her arm behind his head fighting down the panic clawing at her heart and blurring her vision listen cait i love you very much oh papa i love you too then promise me you will not seek to avenge me he said cold sweat beading on his ashen face let it end here i do not understand who was that man why did he do this promise me he insisted raising himself up again the effort brought a spasm of pain which made him cough blood trickled from the corner of his mouth i know you cait promise you will not avenge me very well i promise she dabbed away the blood with the hem of her blue satin mantle now lie back and rest a little having received her promise duncan slumped against the base of the column good he sighed settling back against the cool stone good cait put her hand to her fathers cheek please papa she persisted i need to understand pray for me caitriona he closed his eyes i will every day but i need to understand renaud he coughed again more blood came up staining his teeth and chin she wiped it away at first the name meant nothing then the memory suffaced renaud de bracineaux the templar she searched her fathers face for a clue to the meaning of this mystery why he opened his eyes and tried to smile poor alethea i am glad she is not here she is not as strong as you he coughed and slumped further down take care of her cait hush she put her cheek next to his and held him tight as it to hold off death through the strength of her embrace i will watch over her he raised his hand and cupped his palm to her chin holding her face so that he could see her his eyes were hazy and his voice wavered take my heart he gulped air his voice tight with pain and forced out the words take it home tell padraig bury it in the church he will know what to do unable to speak caitriona simply nodded sydoni he rasped tell sydoni my last thought was of her his voice had grown suddenly soft and tenuous as spidersilk tell her i thanking god i will tell her the tears spilled freely down her cheeks and on to her fathers hand duncan raised his hand and kissed the tear with bloodstained lips caitriona clutched his hand and pressed it to her cheek dear heart he said his voice a fading whisper i go he slumped back against the column base with a sigh in that last exhalation cait thought she saw a light flicker briefly in his eyes and heard him say her mothers name ah rhonathe most delicate ghost of an utterance a word spoken from the threshold of another world and he was gone chapter two the dull iron glow of a new day was staining the dark waters of the bosphorus by the time cait finally returned to the ship she stood at the rail and stared with redrimmed eyes at the dirty yellow gleam burning through the grey cloudwrack like a hot poker singeing through sackcloth after a time she turned her unblinking gaze to the famed seven hills of byzantium all hung in purple mist and smoke as if in mourning for her murdered father she heard a footfall on the deck behind her but did not turn good morrow my lady the voice was that of haemur their aged orkneyjar pilot a loyal and trusted servant and the one person in the world duncan would allow to captain persephone to the holy land a skilled but uneducated man haemur spoke only norse peppered with a smattering of gaelic when you did not return last night i was worried that she turned and he saw the look on her face his hands fluttered like distracted birds lady caitriona he gasped what has happened then as if realizing for the first time that she was alone he said but where is my lord duncan he is gone haemur she replied in a voice as brittle and empty as a dry husk the seaman gazed uncomprehendingly at the young woman he is coming later perhaps no she shook her head he is dead haemur the elderly sailor rubbed his red face with a rough hand tears came to his pale blue eyes i see he turned away abruptly and started towards his bench at the stern dabbing at his eyes she called him back i am sorry haemur she moved to him and taking one of his thickcallused hands in both her own explained what had taken place at the cathedral it was quickly and simply told and then she said the body will be buried later today and we will attend the rites right now i want you to wake your men and move the ship he regarded her without understanding dead are you certain yes she confirmed we must move the ship at once i have arranged for a berth in the bucoleon harbourthe one below the lighthouse the greek harbourwhere the grain ships call the same they will not think to look for us there who he asked but she was already moving away iam going to my quarters now to wash and change my clothes she descended the wooden steps into the hold which was divided into three sections the first near the bow was shared by the two crewmen who helped haemur the middle and largest section was the hold proper where all the supplies provisions and dry goods for the voyage were kept the third section in the stern was divided into two small compartments for the passengers cait and alethea shared one and the other belonged to duncan cait put her hand to the wooden latch and quietly opened the door pale dawnlight showed in the small round window over the boxed pallet where alethea lay sleeping cait sat down the edge of the bed and regarded the young woman fifteen years oldalthough she looked and often behaved as one younger than her yearsshe had sydonis thick dark lustrous hair and smooth tawny skin nor did the similarity between the young lady and her mother end there alethea was slender and lanky with a high smooth brow and large dark eyes cait was nearly twelve years old when alethea was born and though at first she thought a baby sister a fine and wonderful thing the joy quickly palled alethea considered cait too harsh and strict on her always nagging and chastising in caitrionas forthright opinion thea was flighty and inconsiderate too easily taken with whims and capricious fancies and alltoooften indulged when she should have been corrected indeed alethea should not have been aboard the ship in the first placeexcept that when she found out that duncan was planning to take caitriona to the holy land to see all the places he and padraig had visited during his long pilgrimage the younger girl had moped and whined and sulked until her father relented and agreed to take her too cait sat listening to aletheas deep regular breathing for a moment and then reached out and rested her hand on the girls shoulder where the thin coverlet had slipped aside the skin was warm beneath her palm and theas face appeared so peaceful and content cait was loath to disturb her rest no she thought let her enjoy the last serenity she will know for a very long time the grieving will come soon enough she rose moved silently to the sea chest at the foot of her bed opened it withdrew a clean mantle and smallclothes and then left alethea to her rest she crossed the narrow companionway to her fathers quarters and went inside she stood for a long while just looking at the room but apart from the sea chest and a pair of boots in one corner there was nothing of duncan to be seen cait lifted a large shallow brass bowl from its peg and placed it on the sea chest then filled it with water from the jar she undressed then and washed herself over the basin letting the cool water sluice away the previous days sweat and anguish and tears the water felt good on her skin and she wished the bowl was big enough for her to submerge her entire bodylike the great enamelled basins of the caliphs hareem her father had told her about once long ago when she finished she dried herself with the linen cloth from the peg and then succumbing to her exhaustion at last lay down in her fathers bed she moulded herself to the depression left by his body in the soft pine shavings of the box pallet and closed her eyes on the grim nightmare of the day that had been but there was neither rest nor sleep nor less yet any respite from the outrageous succession of misfortune that she had suffered in all that followed her fathers death to recall the stinging injustice of her predicament made her blood seethe for presented with a corpse in their cathedral the ecclesiastical authorities had fetched the scholae when questioned by the leader of the troop cait had named the killer and was immediately brought before a court magister who listened politely to her story and then conducted her forthwith to the consul of constantinople a blunt practical man with a shortshaved head of bristly grey hair he sat in a thronelike chair beside a table prepared for his dinner and listened while she repeated her charge she told him everything just as it happenedonly to be informed that it was not remotely possible you must be mistaken woman the consul said frankly his greek like that of the others she had spoken to although different could be understood readily enough renaud de bracineaux is grand commander of the templar knights of jerusalem he is a priest of the church a protector of pilgrims upholder of the faith that may be cait allowed but i saw him with my own eyes and my father named him before he died so you say it is a pity your father died without repeating his accusation to anyone elseone of the priests perhaps he glanced at the table and stretched his hand towards his cup i am sorry you mean that you intend to do nothing she felt as if the ground were crumbling beneath her and she was plunging into a dark bottomless pit helpless to prevent it the consul gave her a thin dismissive smile even if what you allege was in some way possible i could not take action against this man based solely on what you have told me because i am a woman because you are alone the consul frowned and then sighed with exasperated pity truly i am sorry but the law is clear without the corroboration of at least two witnesses i can do nothing the church was full of people caitriona pointed out someone must have seen what happened where are these people the consul enquired lifting a hand to the empty chamber where are they to be found do not mock me sir snarled cait her voice growing cold i know what i saw and there was no mistake taking up the skirt of her mantle she spread it before her this she said shaking the cloth angrily this is my fathers blood i am wearing de bracineaux stabbed him if you will not do anything about it then i will i urge you to reconsider angry now the consul rose from his chair renaud de bracineaux is a man of great esteem and even greater renowna friend and favourite of both king baldwin of jerusalem and emperor manuel he is a guest of the basileus and i would not presume to trouble him on the basis of the scant evidence you provide furthermore i warn you should you persist in repeating this accusation you will certainly be dealt with most harshly oh i am through with accusations cait informed the official icily i may accept your judgement but i will not suffer the injustice with that she turned her back and strode from the room she wept in the street as she walked back to the cathedral and then again as she sat with her dear fathers body and waited for a hired cart to come and collect his remains then to be taken to the church where he and sydoni had been married following a short negotiation an agreement was reached where for a generous gift to the monastery the brothers were persuaded to allow duncan to be buried on holy groundand according to caitrionas specific conditions she left the body to be prepared for burial and hired a chair and asked to be taken to bucoleon harbour after waiting a considerable time she had struck a bargain with the overbusy harbour master allowing her two days berthingagain for a tidy fee daylight was fading by that time and so she returned to the church of christ pantocrator to pray and wait with her fathers corpse which had been washed and wrapped in a clean linen shroud and placed on a low board before the altar she stayed through the night lighting candles and listening to the monks chant the prayers for the dead when the watch service was over she left the church waking the bearers she had paid to wait for her outside they carried her through the stilldark streets down to the venetian quay where she roused a boatman who had ferried her to the waiting ship as day broke in the east now she lay and listened to the sounds of the crewmen clumping around on deck as they set about moving the ship she remembered the day duncan had hired the handstwo brothers from hordaland in west norway the elder called otti was a large hardworking fellow rendered simple by a fearsome blow on the skull which although cutting short his apprenticeship as a viking no doubt saved his life the younger called olvir was a dark quiet goodnatured boy a year or so older than alethea since the death of their parents he had the responsibility of keeping himself and his older sibling fed clothed and out of trouble after a time she heard a splash followed by the clunk of the anchor on to the deck and soon sensed a change in the slow rhythmical rocking of the ship they were moving for the briefest instant she was tempted to go back on deck and order haemur to sail for home but no not yet soon but not yet cait slept for a while but rose unsettled and unrested she washed her face again dressed in a clean undershift and mantle and wrapped a handsome woven girdle around her waist into this she tucked her fathers purse filled with silver and a slender dagger which had once belonged to her greatgrandmother and which her grandfather murdo had carried with him on the great pilgrimage she then put on a gown of exquisite thin materialdark for mourningand chose a long scarf which she folded over the crown of her head and wrapped around her throat so that the ends hung down her back then she went up on to the deck to break fast and wait for alethea to rise and join her but her sister was already awake little more than halfdressed as usual cait noticed sourly she wore neither hat nor shoes but merely a sleeveless shift which exposed her slender upper arms and shoulders she was standing at the prow tapping her palms on the rail in an attitude of agitation she whirled on her sister as caitriona approached where is papa whats happened she demanded haemur would tell me nothing why are they moving the ship thea said caitriona reaching towards her sister listen haemur said he was not to come with us she blurted her face suddenly blotching with colour why would he say that come and sit with me cait put her hand to the young womans arm and started towards the covered platform before the mast alethea took two steps and then pulled away no tell me now why are you doing this her shout made the crewmen turn from their work to look at the two women please alethea this is not seemly now come and tell me she demanded crossing her arms over her breast very well cait snapped losing patience papa is not coming with us because he was attacked when we were leaving the church yesterday papa hurt where is he i must go to him no cait shook her head gently papa was attacked and he was killed but where is he if he is hurt we must go to him you are not listening thea you should not have left him you should alethea she said sharply father is dead he was attacked and killed i was with him when he died you left me behind deliberately the young woman shouted tears starting to her eyes stepping close caitriona took hold of her sisters arm and gripped it above the elbow stop it when alethea did not respond she shook her hard listen to what you are saying if you cannot speak sensibly shut your mouth this is your doing alethea wailed and now i will never see him again cait was instantly furious do you think i brought about fathers death just to spite you she snapped for once in your life thea think the darkhaired young womans face seemed to crumple inwardly he cannot be dead the tears spilled over her long lashes and her shoulders began to shake oh cait what are we going to do she sobbed what are we going to do thea put her face in her hands and leaned into her sisters embrace cait put her arms around the young woman and felt aletheas warm tears seeping through her mantle we will mourn him she murmured rubbing aletheas smooth bare shoulder as she stared dryeyed upon the great looming city spread out before her on its fabled hills and we will see him buried then she added to herself we will avenge him chapter three tell me whined thea using her most irritating tone i am not taking another step until you do the less you know the less you have to remember the two young women walked together along the wide avenue as a deep winecoloured dusk gathered around them the streetall but deserted when they had started outwas quickly returning to life once more as the heat of the day gave way to a velvet soft evening everywhere the imperial city was shaking off its languor and reviving itself in the splendid midsummer night tell me cait i want to know if i tell you she replied wearily will you promise to keep quiet until we get there where where are we going am not telling you a thing until you promise along the verges meat vendors hunched over filthy black charcoal braziers which filled the air with blue smoke and the aroma of burning olive oil and roasting spices day labourers and wives late from the markets jostled them as they passed hurrying home with their suppers wrapped in oiled cloth and large flat round loaves of bread tucked under their arms gangs of young men dressed in short blue tunics caroused laughing loudly to call attention to themselves several caught sight of the two unescorted women and made obscene gestures with their hands which cait saw thea however remained blissfully unaware cait moved with solemn purpose immune to the charms and curiosities around her to alethea who had not ventured into the city before everything appeared fantastic and enchanting she had to force herself to remember that just this day they had buried their father and that she should as a loving daughter assume a mournful and sombre step like her sister but it was difficult when every few paces some strange new marvel presented itself to her easily dazzled eyes they passed through a street dominated by the tall wellmade houses of the wealthy each of which boasted elaborate carved wooden balconies veritable outdoor rooms which overhung the streeton which the families of spice timber and gold merchants ship owners and moneychangers gathered to eat their evening meal and watch the pageant below meanwhile the inhabitants of more humble dwellings fled the close confines of dark stuffy rooms and gathered in the streets and deserted marketplaces to exchange the news of the day men stood in huddled conclaves around jugs of raw country wine and nibbled green olives spitting the pits into the air old women squatted in doorways their wrinkled faces shrewd and silent watching all around them with small dark eyes dirtyfaced children clutching bits of food snatched from the table stood stifflegged and stared while hungry dogs tried to cadge morsels from their hands every now and then they passed a walled garden and caught a fragrance on the airjasmine lemon blossom hyacinth or sandalwoodor heard the music of pipes and lute played to the accompaniment of the tambour sticks and hand drum although they recognized the instruments the melodies seemed quaint and plaintive and strange to the ear unlike anything they had heard before after a time they arrived at a crossroads which formed a common square here the commerce of the day was far from concluded women whose companionship could be obtained for the price of a meal strolled idly along jangling the silver bracelets on their arms as an unobtrusive means of promoting their wares across the square a potter had set up his wheel beside a low wall on which he presented examples of his work and nearby stood a man with bits of painted wood dangling from strings in his hand by pulling the strings the carved pieces seemed to dancemuch to the delight of the spectators gathered around him there were also chairs for hire lined up alongside a wall beneath the overhanging boughs of a huge sycamore tree the bearers were huddled around a small fire in the street resting after their days work talking and laughing as they passed a jar around alethea took one glance at the row of chairs and instantly felt the strain of having walked so far she stopped in midstep could we she said tugging on caits sleeve i am just exhausted cait moved on inclined to ignore her sisters entreaty oh cait please we have been walking all day my feet are sore caitriona hesitated she turned back and looked at the chairs her vacillation was all that one of the more enterprising chair owners needed leaping to his feet he hurried to where the two young women were standing my friends he called you wish to hire a chair mine is best dark and thin he smiled at them as he spoke in rough rustic greek i am philippianous come with me i will show you now very well said cait when she had examined the chair and found it satisfactory how much where you wish to go asked the eager philippianous you tell me that i tell you how much blachernae palace at this the young mans eyes grew wide you have business there tonight perhaps yes said cait how much thirty denarii he said growing sly ten my lady complained philippianous it is getting dark we are tired and have nothing to eat twentyfive denarii it is a good price fifteen denariifor both of us ten apiece countered the chair owner very well relented cait slipping a small leather purse from beneath her girdle she began counting small silver coins into her hand ten apieceto take us there and return my lady whined philippianous we are poor and hungry we have had nothing to eat all day we cannot work all night with nothing to eat then take your rest replied cait regarding the group of bearers who were listening to the negotiation with undisguised interest i am certain one of your friends would be more than happy to oblige cait please whispered alethea embarrassed that her sister should haggle like a fishwife over such a trivial matter sensing victory the bearer pointed to his chair it is a nice chair very comfortable we will take good care of you if you do well cait promised i will give you extra for a meal but you must take us to the palace first done the chair owner spun on his heel and clapped his hands he called to his labourers who rose from among the men gathered around the fire one of them took a last gulp from the jar before passing it along and then he and his three companions shuffled to a wide redpainted chair with a green cushion on its wooden bench seat alethea nudged her sister in the ribs and pointed at a green chair it was newer slightly larger the pole rings were shiny brass and the cushion was yellow satin cait nodded wait she said and pointed to the green chair that one my sister complained the owner that one is very specialfor the empress herself eh if the empress wishes to hire it we will gladly give it to her replied cait stepping into the chair she held out the little stack of coins philippianous sighed but gave his men the nod to go ahead taking up two long brasstipped wooden poles from among those leaning against the wall they slipped them through the rings lifted the chair and started off enjoy your journey my friends you come too i will give you an extra ten to announce us at the palace cait said adding a few more coins to the stack in her hand philippianous is at your service empress said the chair owner accepting his payment with a polite bow the bearers moved out and the owner ran on ahead leading the way and clearing idlers from the path alethea was instantly ecstatic this is wonderful cait we should travel like this everywhere she said almost hugging herself cait made no reply she turned her eyes to the slowly darkening street ahead and thought about what had been accomplished this day and what was still to come why did you not say we were going to the palace asked alethea brightly some surprises are best kept secret caitriona replied alethea snuggled closer enjoying the mysteriousness of it is the royal family there no replied cait i have to see someone who a man called renaud de bracineaux it is to do with papas death yes cait turned once more to her meditation on the days events as soon as the ship had been secured in its new berth in bucoleon harbour they returned to the church where duncan was lying on his bier in the sanctuary waiting for burial she allowed haemur to accompany them more for haemurs sake than for her own the old sea captain had liked and admired her father very much and it would have been a needless cruelty to have denied him the consolation of attending the burial so leaving olvir and otti to look after the vessel they had proceeded to the church where they were received by the abbot himself and conducted into the darkened sanctuary where burned but two tall candles one either end of the shroudwrapped corpse upon entering the chapel alethea had begun to cry once they were seated the cleric had read a simple service for the dead at the conclusion of which the body of their father had been taken up by the brothers and carried to a small burial ground in a portion of the garden outside the monastery scriptorium where a fresh grave had been dug in the dry rocky earth after a lengthy prayer in greek cait said another in gaelic whereupon alethea weeping uncontrollably now had placed on the body a handful of summer flowers and foliage wrapped in a length of white silk the monks lowered the body into the hole and while the abbot read a passage from the holy scripture the brothers slowly filled in the grave haemur stood with bowed head and folded hands and both caitriona and alethea knelt as the monks heaped the dirt high over the bundled corpse tamped it down and then planted a newmade wooden cross in the mound the service concluded the abbot led the little funeral party to the refectory where they were given some wine and honey cakes with raisins to refresh themselves afterwards cait delivered the monetary gift they had agreed upon together with an additional sum for the grave to be continually maintainedwhereupon the chapters infirmarer was summoned a stoopshouldered man of middle age with sad dark eyes the infirmarer presented the women with a small box made of lead a chirho had been embossed in the soft metal and the container sealed with solder i thank you brother cait said accepting the small casket from his hand she then thanked the abbot for his care and kindness and the three were conducted by the porter through the gates of the monastery and out into the light of a hot summer day cait moved out into the sunbright street in a thoughtful mood haemur solemn and silent beside her alethea who had dried her tears walked along the treelined streets with a buoyant step the great tide of sorrow which surged over her unexpectedly now and again had ebbed for the time being and she felt lightheadedas if the heavier humours had been drained off and now she might float away on the breeze it was a fine funeral she observed once they were through the gate do you not think so cait it served a purpose you could have done better i suppose not wishing to argue with her sister she merely said papa wished padraig to conduct his funeral oh said alethea she had not thought of that of course a cele de funeral was a very sacred and special occasion combining not only prayers and hymns but stories songs and special readings it culminated in a feast at which family and friends gathered at the banquet table to celebrate the life of the departed and share their fondest recollections the feast generally began at dusk and continued through the night finishing at dawn when everyone went out to witness the breaking of the new day and sing their brother and fellow pilgrim on his journey home cait felt sorry that her father had not been able to receive such a funeral it was his due still she meant to do what she could what is in the box asked alethea strange they should give us a gift it is not a gift said cait quietly what is it then the younger woman snatched away the box which cait held reverently in her hands she turned it this way and that looking for a way to open it thea please cait put her hand on her sisters arm and turned her around she held out her hand for the box give it to me now no the young woman sulked jerking the box away not until you tell me whats inside cait frowned regarding her sister with sour disapproval it is papas heart she said softly what shrieked alethea cait held out her hand and thea shoved the box into it with disgust you had them cut out his heart she cried tears welling at once you cruel and thoughtless creature how could you do vsuch a thing it was his dying wish caitriona explained simply he wanted his heart to be buried in the church at home alethea put her face in her hands and wept despite her aggravation cait felt sorry for her sisteralways getting things twisted round and making herself look foolish she passed the box to haemur who was standing awkwardly to one side shifting his weight from one foot to the other in embarrassment take this back to the ship put it in a safe place and wait for us there cait told the grizzled old pilot remember what i told you it will likely be very late when we return so keep a light burning at the prow haemur accepted the lead box with a little bow and said as you will my lady return when you like you will find the ship in order and awaiting your command cait smiled the old seaman seemed to be going out of his way to demonstrate his acceptance of her as the new master of the vessel for that she was grateful she thanked him and sent him on his way and then she had begun her work of revenge the previous day the consul had told her that de bracineaux was a friend of king baldwin and a guest of the emperor to find the templar commander all she had to do was discover which of the many imperial residences was being used by the friends relations and entourage of the newly wedded couple with thea in tow she had then begun the tedious and tiring inquiry a delicate investigation which necessitated shrewdness tact and a finely honed sense of diplomacy particular skills which cait possessed in fair measure when she cared to use them it was late when they left the magnaura palace precinct where cait had at last been able to tease out the information she required they had stopped to buy a little fruit and bread and cheese at a market they happened by and then continued on their way to the blachernae palace where the members of the royal wedding entourage were staying as guests of emperor manuel comnenus now as evening descended around them cait settled back in the chair and allowed herself to think about what lay ahead she closed her eyes and rehearsed the decisive moment in her mind trying to imagine it down to the smallest detail so that she should not be taken by surprise they were closer to the palace than they knew and soon philippianous halted the chair and pointed to an enormous square structure in brick and stone rising from behind a stout wall the palace my lady he said as if he were the proud owner caitriona observed the flat undistinguished facade with its alternating colours of brickwork and its highpeaked roof shingled with red tile and decided that it looked more like the earls great house in orkney than the favourite residence of the holy roman empires exalted ruler this is the palace wondered alethea aloud like cait she had imagined something far more grand and imposing indeed yes philippianous assured them the palace of blachernae is renowned people come from all over the world to see it there were four soldiers standing in the street before a gate wide enough and high enough to allow the royal carriages of kings and princes to pass through with ease be so kind as to announce us cait instructed it would be a pleasure my lady replied their expansive guide say that ladies deborah and constance de payens have arrived for their audience with commander de bracineaux at this alethea who had been daydreaming about the rich pearlstudded gowns the empress reputedly wore sat up sharply her greek was not as good as her sisters but she understood this last without any difficulty what are you saying she demanded those are not our names quiet thea snapped cait do as you are told philippianous smiling features arranged themselves into a knowing smirk he opened his mouth but cait cut him off before he could comment announce us she commanded cait turned on her sister now listen thea she warned keep your mouth shut and do what i tell you or i will leave you here by yourself understand i still cannot see why we have to mean it cait raised a threatening finger alethea nodded sourly good i will explain everything later philippianous had made their names known to the porter a hulking drone who waved the chair and its occupants through the gateeyeing the nubile younger woman lustfully as the two passed inside the palace grounds they proceeded at once to the courtyard and the palace entrance where they were halted by guards and where once again the doors were opened without further question when the commanders name was given be so kind as to wait here cait told the bearers god willing we may not be long if you are ready to depart the moment we return i will double your fee most gracious lady replied philippianous grandly we will await your appearance with confident expectation he led them to the massive coppergilded iron doors where they were escorted into the palace without delay once inside they were met by an ageing courtier who demanded to know their business we are invited to an audience with commander de bracineaux caitriona replied crisply the courtier cocked his head to one side and gave the two young women a long dubious glance even so the invitation was issued by the master himself cait leaned forward and placed her hand on the mans arm putting her mouth close to his ear he said to tell anyone who asked that we are she paused precisely long enough to leave no doubt in the courtiers mind that it was a lie and then added his nieces the elderly courtier pulled away as if burned by her touch he drew himself up to speak and cait thought he might refuse them then and there instead he merely turned on his heel and led them across the entrance hall to a long flight of wooden stairs without a word he indicated that they were to ascend cait thanked the servant and taking the dumbstruck aletheas hand proceeded up the stairs without looking back they emerged on the next floor and stepped into a large woodpanelled vestibule connecting three long corridors lined with doors two yawning servants leaning against a gilded column regarded the newcomers lazily but made no move to help them cait presented herself and asked in which of the apartments the templar de bracineaux might be found the chamberlain raised a hand indicated the central corridor and said sixth door thea close behind cait proceeded down the corridor drawing a deep breath to calm herself it was going better than she had hoped but an instants carelessness would ruin everything they passed several doors and heard coarse singing emanating from behind one of them from behind another came a loud crash followed by raucous laughter and stamping feet so the local gossip is true she thought the franks sleep when they should work eat when they should sleep and roister when they should pray they rarely wash talk too loud blow their noses on their clothing and rut like pigs as they approached the sixth door alethea squeezed caits hand someone is coming she whispered caitriona looked quickly down to the far end of the corridor where a figure had just appeared in the passageway as the figure approached she saw the tray of cups in her hand it is just a serving girl she waited until the girl drew near and paused at the sixth door whereupon cait approached her quickly and asked whether the cups and jar were bound for the commanders chamber indeed my lady replied the girl leave it with me said cait taking the tray from her we were just about to join him you may go the girl looked at the two women and then surrendered to their unarguably superior rank she delivered the tray with a tight bow and retreated quickly the way she had come as soon as the girl was gone cait laid the tray on the floor she quickly shrugged off her costly mantle and handed it to her sister next she removed the dagger from its sheath at her side and tucked it into her girdle at the back so that it would be out of sight yet ready to hand what are you doing asked alethea eyeing the dagger i told you i have to talk to someone cait picked up the tray stay here and keep watch knock on the door if anyone should come alethea made to protest but caits raised eyebrow persuaded her to hold her tongue glancing nervously both ways along the corridor she said hurry then balancing the tray with one hand cait reached for the latch and taking a deep steadying breath to calm her pounding heart pushed the door open and stepped quickly inside chapter four the room was large and dark and opened on to a smaller inner chamber which in turned opened on to a balcony overlooking a garden court the double doors separating the rooms were thrown wide and two men were sitting at a small round table on the balcony enjoying the soft evening air even by fitful torchlight she recognized the broad shoulders and untidy mane of white hair belonging to renaud de bracineaux with a glance at alethea who made a last anxious plea to hurry cait closed the door behind her and stepped inside at the sound of the door closing commander de bracineaux called here girl steadying the tray she moved through the darkened room towards the balcony de bracineauxs back was to her and the other mana younger fellow with a large beaklike nose fair straight hair and a fine silky wisp of a beardwas leaning on the table with his arms crossed neither man was armed and both were deep in conversation a quick strike from behind and she would be gone again before the templar knew what had happened think what it is worth de bracineaux was saying more than i can imagine the fairhaired one replied i should think the pope will give you anything you want the reward will be yours to name ha de bracineaux sneered if you think that conniving old lecher is going to get his poxy hands on it then you my friend are an even bigger ass than his high holiness one step and another and she would be in position before she could reach the table however the second man looked up i have not seen you before he said rising abruptly cait halted let me help you with that heavy thing he grinned and stepped towards her but the templar grabbed his arm and pulled him back to his chair sit down danjou he growled plenty of time for that later the younger man lowered himself to his seat again and cait proceeded to the table remaining behind de bracineaux and out of his sight she placed the tray on the table and made to step away her right hand reaching for the hilt of the slender dagger at her back as her fingers tightened on the braided grip the templar cast a hasty glance over his shoulder she saw his lowered brow and the set of his jaw and feared the worst silently she slipped the dagger from its sheath ready to strike but the light of recognition failed to illumine his eyes well he demanded get to your work now light the lamps and leave us cait hesitated waiting for him to settle back in his chair when she did not move the templar turned on her do as i say girl and be quick about it startled cait stepped back a pace almost losing her grip on the weapon peace renaud said his companion reaching out he took the templars sleeve and tugged him around come i have poured the wine he raised his cup and took a long deep draught de bracineaux swung back to the table picked up his cup and tilting his head back let the wine run down his gullet now thought cait rising on to the balls of her feet do it now her hand freed the knife and she moved forward at that instant without warning the door burst open and a thickset bullnecked templar strode into the room behind her cait whipped the dagger out of sight and backed away ah here is gislebert now said danjou loudly the templar paused as he passed regarding cait with dull suspicion she ducked her head humbly and quickly retreated into the darkened room come sergeant called the fairhaired man raise a cup and give us the good news are we away to jerusalem at last my lord baron said gislebert turning his attention to the others good to see you sir you had a pleasant journey i trust as the men began talking once more cait was forgottenher chance ruined she might cut one or even two men before they could react but never three and the sergeant was armed still she was close the opportunity might never come again reluctant to give up she busied herself in the adjoining room steeling herself for another attempt fetching some straw from the corner of the hearth she stooped and lit it from the pile of embers there was a lamp on the table two candles in a double sconce on the wall by the bed and a candletree in the corner she lit the candles first taking her time hoping that gislebert would leave she moved to the table and as she touched the last of the straw to the lamp wick became aware that someone was watching her from the doorway fearing she had been discovered at last she took a deep breath steadied herself and cast a furtive glance over her shoulder she did not see him at first her eyes went to the men who were still at the table on the balcony cups in hand their voices a murmur of intimate conversation they were no longer heeding her but as she bent once more to the task at hand she caught a movement in a darkened corner of the room and turned just as a man stepped from the shadows she stifled a gasp dressed in the long white robe of a priest he held up his hand palm outward in an attitude of blessingor to hold her in her place perhaps both she thought a man of youthful appearance his hair and beard were black without a trace of grey and the curls clipped like the shorn pelt of a sheep his eyes though set deep beneath a dark and heavy brow were bright and his glance was keen he stepped forward into the doorway placing himself between cait and the men when he moved she felt a shudder in the air as if a gust of wind had swept in through the open door but the candles did not so much as quiver at the same time she smelled the fresh clean scent of the heathered hills after a storm has passed do not be afraid said the man his voice calm and low i merely wish to speak to you cait glanced nervously beyond him to where the templar and his companions sat at their wine blind guides he said indicating the men they have neither eyes to see nor ears to hear who are you as she asked the question she glanced again at de bracineaux and his companions now laughing heartily they appeared oblivious to both her and the stranger call me brother andrew he said at the name cait felt her throat tighten she gulped down a breath of air know about you she said struggling to keep her voice steady my father told me your family has been in my service for a long time that is why i have cometo ask if you will renew the vow of your father and grandfather what vow is that i asked young murdo to build me a kingdom where my sheep could safely graze build it far far away from the ambitions of smallsouled men and their ceaseless striving cait said repeating the words she had learned as a child on her grandfathers knee make it a kingdom where the true path can be followed in peace and the holy light can shine as a beacon flame in the night he smiled there you see you do know it he did that he built you a kingdom she said bluntly and died an old man waiting for you to come as you promised truly his faith has been rewarded a thousandfold the white priest told her but now it is your turn in each generation the vow must be renewed i ask you sister will you serve me at the question cait felt a hardness rise up in her like a rock in her chest she hesitated and looked away not daring to meet the white priests commanding gaze caitriona chided brother andrew gently i know what is in your heart when she did not answer the monk shook his head sadly and moved a step closer thus says the lord of hosts as surely as i live for ever when sharpen my fiery sword and my hand grasps it in judgement i will take vengeance on my enemies and repay those who hate me she set her jaw and clung to her silence i ask you sister do you believe that the great king is able to perform justice for his servants her answer was quick and biting if his justice is as ready as his protection his servants had better sleep with a shield in one hand and a sword in the other his ways are not our ways whatever misfortune befalls one of his own the allwise creator is able to bend it to his will he will not suffer evil to prevail he replied she could feel his eyes on her but she was determined not to be swayed by anything he said and yet it does prevail look at me caitriona the monk commanded she raised her eyes slowly he was watching her with an intensity which burned across the distance between them i ask but once more will you serve me both her father and her grandfather had stood before the white priest and both had answered his call how could she do less i will she replied at last then put aside your wrath and believe for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord in due time their foot will slip the day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them behold he said pointing to the table behind her this is the work i am giving you when it is finished you shall receive the desires of your heart she turned to look where he was pointing and saw a parchment documenta formallooking communication in latin the image on the broken seal looked regal and the signature at the bottom of the document was in red inkas were the words rosa mystica cait picked up the letter and turned to ask what it was the white priest wanted her to do but he was gone and she was alone once more she looked at the letter in her hand but before she could read any of it de bracineaux shouted from the other room here you get away from there for the love of god de bracineaux leave the wench be said danjou i will see her off said gislebert he rose from the table and lumbered in from the balcony taking up the tray once more cait whipped the folded parchment out of sight beneath it she turned and made a slight bow towards the men then bolted from the room gislebert watched her go and then moved to the door closing it firmly after her she stepped out into the corridor once more alethea was hovering in the passageway wringing her hands and looking as if she had swallowed a mouse are you all right she asked as cait emerged from the chamber no thanks to you snapped cait you were supposed to warn me he surprised me yes he surprised me too now you are angry pouted alethea he came up behind me and caught me lingering by the door and told me to get about my business what could i do they moved quickly off along the corridor returning to the vestibule cait laid the tray aside and while thea kept watch drew on her mantle once more and tucked the parchment away then the two women descended the stairs and retraced their steps outside where as arranged the chair and bearers were still waiting they climbed into the chair and cait instructed philippianous to take them to the bucoleon harbour well demanded alethea as they passed through the gate and back into the street once more what happened did you see him i saw him muttered cait well what did he say nothing you were in there a long time he must have said something insisted alethea out of the corner of her eye cait caught philippianous leaning towards them so as to overhear their discussion not now cait told her sister later i want to hear it now shut up you stupid girl cait blurted changing to gaelic they are listening to us all very well for you squeaked alethea indignantly lady caitriona gets to do whatever she likes while i have to be her dutiful slave cait turned away from her sister and watched the activity in the streets instead fires bright in iron braziers and countless oil lamps illumined the night with a garish glow in some of the broader avenues musicians playedpipe and lute tambour and lyreand people danced hands upraised stepping lightly as they spun and turned occasionally an enterprising merchant would approach the passing chair and offer his wares bangles and necklaces of coloured glass beads pots of perfumed unguent satin ribbons and tiny bunches of dried flowers for the ladies hair the variety and charm of the baubles distracted alethea from her sisters stinging rebuke and she would have stopped and bought trinkets from them all but cait instructed philippianous and his bearers to move on as they neared the seafront the streets became quieter and darkerthe houses meaner the people more furtive sinister arriving at the harbour however the seamen and sailors drinking wine and playing dice on the wharf gave the quayside a less threatening atmosphere more than one lonely seafarer licked his lips hopefully as the two women stepped from the chair one or two of the younger men called to them offering wine and an evenings entertainment as agreed said cait dropping a stack of small silver coins into philippianous outstretched hand and as promised a little extra for your trouble she dropped a few more coins into his hand this she said taking out a single gold solidus is for forgetting you ever saw us do you think you can do that most certainly gracious lady he reached for the coin eagerly she snatched it back i beg your pardon a sly smile appeared on his face is someone speaking i see no one here she let the coin slip through her fingers excuse me i think you must have dropped something how clumsy of me replied philippianous bending to retrieve the coin when he straightened the two women were already hurrying away cait and alethea moved quickly towards the ship persephone at the end of the wharf ignoring the shouted pleas and propositions their presence provoked once aboard they were met by haemur thank god you are safe he said hurrying from his place at the stern it grew dark and when you did not return i feared something ill had befallen you cait thanked the pilot for his concern and said we are perfectly well as you see but now i want you to wake otti and olvir and move the ship away from the wharf and into the bay now haemur thrust out his hands but my lady it is too dark we cannot enough haemur cait stopped him with an upraised hand i would not insist if it was not important with that she went to the brass lamp hanging from a hook on the mast lit a candle from the basket on the deck and proceeded to her quarters below leaving an unhappy pilot staring after her i am sorry haemur alethea offered sympathetically you had best do as she says or there will be the devil to pay very well replied the seaman he hurried off to rouse his crew and alethea joined her sister in their quarters you could try to be a little more she began and then stopped as she saw cait bring out the folded parchment from beneath her girdle where did you get that she asked then guessed you stole it hush cait snapped opening the letter she sat down on the edge of the box bed to read it alethea watched her sister for a moment then indignation overcome by curiosity she joined her on the bed what is it what does it say cait ignored her and continued to read silently to herself when she finished she looked up from the page thea do you know what this is how can i you tell me nothing cait made no reply she was reading the document again well demanded thea after a moment what does it say they have found a very great treasure who the greatest treasure in the worldthat is what he says who says who wrote it a cleric called bertrano he calls it the rosa mystica the mystic rose mused thea none the wiser what does that mean cait shook her head scanning the document again he says only that it is beyond pricesee she pointed to the letters in the tight latin uncials of the scriptorium and read out the words that which is beyond all price the treasure of the ages our very real and manifest hope for this present age and the kingdom to come the mystic rose thea shrugged obviously it is a name employed to conceal the true nature of the treasure and this letter tells where to find it it does i think she pointed to the portion of the document written in a different language i cannot read the rest but i think it must tell where the treasure is to be found the younger woman regarded her sister suspiciously why did we go to the palace tonight and do not say it was to steal this letter because you did not even know it was there cait stood and began folding the letter carefully you are going to have to tell me sooner or later thea pointed out you might as well tell me now we must hide this where no one can find it cait said alethea adopting a disagreeable whine tell mewhy did we go to the palace cait sat down again placing the parchment square on her knees she held it in both hands as if she was afraid it might unfold itself and fly away listen carefully i will say this but once we went there to confront fathers murderer and hold him to justice she gazed steadily at alethea and added i was going to kill him alethea gaped in amazement at her sisters audacity the knife it is trueyou were going to stab him her voice trailed off as the full impact of her sisters ruthlessness broke upon her oh cait renaud de bracineaux murdered our father she continued papa named him before he died the magistrate refused to accept the word of a woman he refused to do anythingso i had to do it myself oh cait thea whispered her voice made small by the magnitude of her sisters coldblooded confession god help us caitriona gazed down at the document she held in her lap i think she said he already has chapter five is that the one demanded renaud de bracineaux squinting at the rank of hire chairs across the square it is my lord commander answered the porter of blachernae palace he comes to the palace sometimes bring him here the commander sat on his horse in the middle of the street sweating in the bright sunlight his head hurt from last nights wine and he felt bilious from too much rich food baron felix danjou he thoughtand not for the first timewas a profligate toad and his usefulness was swiftly coming to an end also the sooner he had his hand on the thieving bitch who had stolen his letter the better he would feel he had not discovered the theft until this morning when he rose and went to wash himself passing the table he had noticed the square of parchment was missing he had summoned gislebert at once the letter he said pointing to the table what happened to it i thought you put it away if i had put it away would i be asking you what happened to it think man that serving girl last night gislebert began oh very good sergeant roared the commander pushing gislebert towards the door instead of standing like a lump of ripe cheese go and find her gislebert had scurried off and returned a short while later with word that although no one knew the servant in question the porter had seen two women arrive in a hired chair he says the chair came from tzimisces squarenot far from here the sergeant reported he has seen it before have horses readied barked de bracineaux we are going to get that letter back what of the porter asked gislebert he is waiting outside bring him with us now he sat sweltering in the saddle and watched the porcine gateman waddle across the square leading a slender young greek with the air of a jovial pirate these people these greeksa supremely deceitful race thought de bracineaux darkly naturalborn thieves and cutthroats each and every one the easy carefree grace of the young manthe insufferable indifference of his long loping stride and the subtle expression of superiority on his swarthy features filled the commander with a rank and bitter loathing it seems he decided an example is in order here the thought made him feel better perhaps all was not lost after all the thief could not possibly know what it was she had taken could not possibly imagine its unrivalled importance its inestimable value it had been the rash act of an ignorant and opportunistic slut and she would pay for her impudencehe would see to that first however he would teach the sly young greek a lesson he would never forget do you recognize him grunted the sergeant as the porter trundled nearer i have seen him before he is the one greetings my lord a splendid day for a ride in a chair where would you like to go shut up you said gislebert sharply you will speak when spoken to understand that is not necessary sergeant said de bracineaux wearily he is not to blame regarding the slim dark youth before him he said what is your name boy the youth bristled at the derisory word but considering the angrylooking men before him swallowed his pride and said i am philippianous how can i help your majesty the commanders eyes narrowed he could not tell if the youth was making fun of him more likely he decided at last the young fool really thought he was a king you brought two women to blachernae palace last night where did you take them when they left i do not recall liar snarled gislebert drawing back his hand philippianous glared at the templar sergeant is it my fault if a man cannot remember where he put his whores gislebert gave out a growl and swung at the young man who jerked back his head letting the blow sail harmlessly by before the sergeant could regroup for another swing his commander called him off saying that will do sergeant he is used to being paid for his service so we will pay de bracineaux put his hand into the leather purse at his belt withdrew it and flipped a gold solidus to the young man i trust that will help restore your memory he said philippianous caught the coin in his fist and examined it before replying they must be very important to you where did you take them i brought them here he sighed as if the conversation no longer interested him because that was all the money they had he turned to go a moment said de bracineaux i think you may be of further service to me i will pay you for your trouble never fear to the porter he said take him back to the palace and wait with him there when the two had gone the templars continued on he was lying gislebert said no doubt replied the commander placidly i could have made him tell us we will but not here the boy is well known hereabouts and too many people have seen us already if the women are close by i do not want them warned off by a street fight what do you intend commander give him inducement enough to consult his memory and we will soon have the letter in our possession once more they rode on to the church of the holy apostles which was no great distance from the square attended a lengthy mass and then broke fast at an inn which was frequented by many of the templars who were now more or less permanently stationed in the city they met several of their order and entertained them with a meal of fresh bread flavoured with caraway and honey soft cheese and wine diluted with lemon water after breaking their fast they returned to the palace to find a very irritated philippianous who had been made to stand in the courtyard in the hot sun while he waited here you are said the commander strolling into the courtyard i had almost forgotten about you do forgive me i would have left long ago but that pig of a porter would not let me go what do you want from me i have already told you all i know this for your trouble said de bracineaux holding up a gold coin and two more if you can remember where those two young women went after they left here keep your filthy money philippianous spat i am leaving he pushed past the sergeant and started towards the courtyard entrance no replied the commander calmly i do not think we are finished yet he made a gesture with his hands and three templar soldiers appeared in the doorway behind him take hold of him philippianous made to dart away but the templars seized him and bore him up i am a citizen he shouted struggling ineffectually in their grasp i have done nothing wrong to his sergeant the commander said bring me some coals as gislebert hurried away he added if danjou is still abed rouse him he would not thank us to miss this commander de bracineaux went to his room and removed his spotless white tabard picking up his leather gauntlets he tucked them into his belt and then attached the hanger for his dagger he drew the knife from its scabbard and tried the edge admiring the fine craftsmanship of the weapon as he ran his thumb along the honed and polished blade and thought back to the first time he had seen it along with five others in a box delivered to the ship by a young lord he had tried to recruit in rouenthe same selfrighteous fool of a young nobleman whose meddling had caused him so much trouble all those years ago at long last that old debt was settled a thin smile touched his lips for until that very moment he had not considered the fact that it was none other than duncan who had brought him the knife when it had been left behind he had been so eager to please the commander replaced the dagger and as he walked from the room he wondered if duncan as he lay dying had fully appreciated the grim irony of the situation had he as his life ebbed away savoured the delicious absurdity of being slain by the very weapon he had supplied the shrine of mary the virgin served as a private chapel for the residents of blachernae palace and the crypt below it was a labyrinth of connecting vaults which housed tombs for minor royalty it was a suitably dark and private place where the proceedings would not be disturbed commander de bracineaux made his way down the narrow steps leading to the first and largest chamber of the crypt he paused at the small altar with its gilded crucifix and its everburning lamp making a haphazard sign of the cross then setting aside the crucifix and lamp he took up the altar stolea narrow strip of cloth with a sturdy cord bindingand proceeded to the chamber beyond where three templars were holding an extremely agitated philippianous while a fourth stood guard at the doorway release me shouted philippianous as the commander stepped into the room i have done nothing i am a citizen and i demand that you release me at once save your breath de bracineaux replied handing the altar stole to the templar at the doorway he said bind him and put him over there he pointed to a low flattopped sarcophagus of grey stone then leave us the soldiers bound their captive securely hand and foot and quit the chamber when they had gone de bracineaux moved to the head of the sarcophagus many noble and illustrious men are interred in this crypt he said leaning on his elbows of course they were dead before taking up residence herebut i do not think anyone will mind if we make an exception for you what do you want me to tell you said philippianous you want to know where the women went i will tell you let me go and i will tell you everything in gods good time gislebert arrived just then carrying a small iron brazier filled with burning coals and suspended by a length of chain ah here is sergeant gislebert now de bracineaux said put the coals there he indicated a place on the stone beside the young mans head where is danjou danjou is here said a voice from the doorway and a blearyeyed baron staggered into the room gods wounds but my head hurts de bracineaux what is so almighty urgent that a man must be wakened and dragged from bed at the crack of noon we have an interesting problem before us replied the commander i thought you might like to see how we solve it the baron tottered to the sarcophagus for a closer look what has he done stolen the keys to the palace i have done nothing shouted philippianous in the name of god and all the saints i beg you release me i will tell you anything i do not even know the women i never saw them before the commander drew the goldhandled dagger and handed it to danjou exquisite is it not i took them to the harbour philippianous said i remember now it is a very fine weapon the baron agreed i took them to bucoleon harbour that is where they wanted to go it was made by an armourer in ariesa very artist with steel de bracineaux said taking up the knife once more it has served me well so many times over the years yet still looks as good as new de bracineaux thrust the dagger into the burning coals you know he said as if imparting a closely held secret one must be very careful not to allow the blade to grow too hotgold melts more readily than steel or so i am told in any case it would be a shame to damage the handle i think they had a ship waiting for them shouted the young greek growing frantic for gods sake let me go i can find them for you it never ceases to amaze me danjou said the templar commander pulling on his gauntlets one after the other how very talkative people become when they finally grasp the utter hopelessness of their position positively garrulous replied the baron with a yawn but then it is too late de bracineaux pulled the knife from the burning coals the blade shone with a dull bluered glow the problem now he continued is turned completely on its head turned on its head enquired danjou idly yes he spat on the blade and the spittle sizzled as it struck the hot metal they simply will not shut up listen to me said philippianous his voice tight with desperation sweat rolled from his face and neck in great fat beads wherever they went i can find them i have friends in many places they hear things let me go i will talk to them i can find these women for you you see said de bracineaux a very fountain of information he nodded to sergeant gislebert who stepping quickly around the sarcophagus seized the greeks hands which were bound at the wrist and jerked his arms up over his head the young man pleading for his life began to thrash and wail in the end there is only one way to assure silence said the templar commander lowering the knife to the young mans chest the hot blade seared the thin fabric of his mantle the cloth began to smoulder they went to bucoleon harbour shouted philippianous please spare me listen my uncle owns many ships his name is stakis ask anyone they will tell you he is a very wealthy trader he will reward you handsomely to let me go whatever you aski swear before god he will pay it but we do not need your money he drew a line with the hot blade down the centre of the young mans chest searing the skin the air filled with the stench of burning flesh philippianous screamed in the name of god i beg you spare me i do not think god can hear you said the templar pressing the hot knife deeper blood oozed up from the wound spitting and sputtering as it touched the hot metal oh why not let him go said danjou i have not had a thing to eat or drink and the stink you are making turns my stomach very well replied de bracineaux he lifted the knife away and plunged it back into the coals still it would not do to have our glorious and renowned order ridiculed by the filth of the street once people find out the templars can be lied to with impunity we will be mocked from rome to jerusalemand we cannot allow that so i think an example is in order no shrieked philippianous no please i will not tell a soul i will not breathe a word to anyone for once i believe you said the commander his hand snaked out and snatching the knife from the brazier he pressed the glowing tip hard against the young mans teeth forcing his jaws open the hot blade slid into his mouth searing his tongue a puff of smoke rolled up and the blade hissed philippianous gave a strangled scream and passed out his body slumped only then did de bracineaux remove the knife he has soiled himself he observed wiping the blade on the young mans clothing he stinks get him out of here sergeant he turned away from the inert body on the grey stone slab come danjou i am thirsty i think i would enjoy some more of the emperors excellent wine my thoughts exactly de bracineaux the baron turned and shuffled from the chamber followed by the commander gislebert regarded the unconscious greek what do you want me to do with him throw him back in the street replied the commander over his shoulder he will serve as a mute yet nonetheless persuasive reminder to all who think to defy the order of the temple chapter six she pressed the hem of her mantle to her nose and paused putting a hand to the mildewed wall as her stomach heaved so the saracens would not think her weak she swallowed back the bile steadied herself and walked on into the suffocating stench of the dungeon for the first time since leaving constantinople caitriona doubted whether she was doing the right thing that first night aboard ship with the vision of the white priest still burning in her mind her course had appeared obvious the way clear ignoring aletheas pestering and petulance she had taken the letter to her fathers quarters to examine it alone in greater detail by the gently wavering light of three lamps and four candles she had read the document three timesmost of it was in latin save for a small section in an unknown script she puzzled over the obscure portion trying to make out the curious text it was not latin or greek much less gaelic or norsethe only languages she knew the letter had been written by a portuguese cleric called bertrano archbishop of santiago de compostela and addressed to none other than pope adrian iv after the usual greetings and salutations the archbishop announced that the secret of the ages had been revealeda marvellous treasure had been discovered in aragon a part of eastern iberia which had been until recently a saracen domain his reason for writing he said was to seek the aid of the holy father in the protection of this treasure which he called the rosa mystica owing to the increased instability of the region he greatly feared the mystic rose would be captured or destroyed and the greatest treasure in the world would be lost for evera calamity which he said would never be forgiven the archbishop asked the pope to send faithful and trusted servants guarded by a fearsome company of knights to retrieve the treasure and carry it back to the holy land so that which is beyond all price the treasure of the ages our very real and manifest hope for this present age and the kingdom to come the mystic rose might be reestablished in jerusalem where it rightfully belonged as she pored over the text she wondered what this treasure might be and why the white priest wanted her to become involved in this affair the more she thought about it the more strange and fantastic it all became in de bracineauxs chamber cait had accepted his appearance as normal and natural as meeting a friend in an unexpected place but now it seemed anything but natural put away your wrath and believe he had told her and promised that when she was finished she would receive the desires of her heart well what she desired most was revenge lord she prayed folding the parchment letter carefully make me the instrument of your vengeance she wrapped the letter in a piece of cloth and hid it under her fathers clothing and belongings at the bottom of his sea chest then lifted out her most precious possession it was a bookher book written by her father during his sojourn in the caliphs palace in cairo removing it from the heavy cloth bag she ran her fingers over the tough leather binding with its fine tight rawhide stitchingthe work of the cele de monks of caithness she carefully untied the braided leather cord opened the cover and began turning the heavy closewritten parchment pages the original faithfully rendered by the cypriot monks remained in the abbey church at banvard the everthoughtful padraig had ordered the good brothers of caithness to produce a copy of the lord duncans manuscript which he had then bound on one side and presented to duncan to give as a gift to the daughter for whom it had been written her father had read it aloud to her when she was a little girl but as she grew older and her command of latin increased cait had been able to read more and more of it for herself she could not count the winter nights she had spent before the hearth wrapped in her mothers old shawl tracing the finescripted lines with a fingertip while her body was confined to a draughty windbattered house in snowy scotland in her mind she wandered lost in the labyrinths of the caliphs palace or followed the amirs caravan across burning deserts with the severed head of proud prince bohemond on her back over the years she often found herself going to the book as to an old friend indeed she could recite much of it from memory but this night as she opened the heavy leather cover and felt once more the solace of the familiar there was a fresh urgency to the words she knew so well for though it comforted her to hear again her fathers changeless voice speaking to her across the distance of oceans and years she realized for the first time that these wellknown words could instruct and guide her in these selfsame pages she had first learned of the white priest and tonight this very night she had met him for herself and renewed her familys longheld vow she gazed with increasing excitement on the heavy volume in her lap and understood that it had suddenly become more than the tale of her fathers youth it was a signpost directing her along the paths of her familys destiny she could feel that destiny thickening around her like the tide on the turn when just before it begins to flow the water swells and stills with concentrated force yes and once the tide has begun to run she thought no power on earth can hold it back she closed her eyes and turned the pages letting the book fall open where it would opening her eyes once more they lit upon the word damascus if she was to undertake the pursuit of the mystic rose she would need help and damascus was where she would find it cait had spent the night in a fever of excitement as the plan took shape in her mind just before dawn she had emerged from her quarters to wake haemur and his crew and tell them to prepare the ship to sail at first light are we going home my lady asked haemur olvir and otti looked on hopefully no she replied i have business to conclude first we are going to damascus that was twelve days ago and with the help of favourable winds and several nights of moonlight sailing they had reached the wellprotected port of tyre with its imposing fortress built on a spit of rock extending out into the bay there leaving the ship in olvirs capable hands cait arranged to join a group of venetian traders on their way to damascus to buy cloth and spices for a fee she and her small entourage consisting of alethea haemur and otti were allowed to travel under the protection of the traders the journey through the arid hills passed uneventfully and they had after seven days in the sweltering heat at last reached the gates of the city where her father had languished for a time awaiting a ransom that never came once inside the walls cait held off the myriad distractions of the vendors street hawkers and moneychangers and immediately set about finding a place to stay and hiring the services of an interpreter who could help her conduct negotiations her search quickly produced a young syrian physician by the name of abu sharma who had spent many years studying in cairo and baghdad abu spoke several arabic languages as well as latin and helpfully agreed to take leave of his practice for a few days and place himself at her service my patients are demanding of course he told her but perhaps i can steal a day or two from the sick and dying to help you it would be a pleasure to tell you the truth it would be a blessing i am run off my feet from first light to lastevery day it is the same i would welcome the change cait noticed that despite the pressure of his demanding patients he still found time to sleep in a quiet corner of the bazaar during the day after paying him a token retainer cait had instructed him to meet her at the palace the following morning he was waiting outside the palace gates when she and the two seamen arrived allah be good to you noble lady he said abu sharma is at your service please tell me now how am i to help you cait had taken him aside and explained what she wanted him to do and how they were to proceed simplicity itself remarked abu when she finished you may rest your trust in me completely abu sharma will help you obtain the best possible price do that cait told him and you shall receive double your fee watch and be amazed he made a low bow and they joined the long parade of dignitaries merchants and suppliers of various goods and commodities making their way into the palacea grand if slightly formidable edifice of stone covered in mortar which had been tinted green so that it gleamed in the sun like a massive block of jade they passed through a double set of arched timber gates and into a palmlined courtyard filled with scribes at tables it is because of the earthquake last month abu said and explained that owing to the damaged reception hall all court affairs were taking place in the outer yard where scribes toiled away at their tables busily recording the representations of each visitor wishing to do business of one sort or another with his exalted highness prince mujir eddin the party presented itself to one of the princes many functionaries who upon hearing the reason for their visit conducted them forthwith to his superior wazir muqharik the redturbanned official listened to their request stroked his beard thoughtfully then gave his consent promptly sending them off to the prison in the company of his katib or secretary once inside the prison they were conducted along a row of cells where local malefactors awaited judgement for their crimes and then down a flight of stone steps to the lower prison where the captives of war were kept in perpetual stink and gloom now cait stood retching in the dim halflight of the dungeon feeling the cold sweat on her clammy skin as wave after wave of doubt assailed her eyes watering stomach churning she looked down the narrow corridor at the end of the passage was a barred and locked timber door once across that threshold there would be no turning back this is madness she thought i do not have to go through with it i can let it end here return to the ship and sail for home and no one would blame me but cait was not made that way the dauntless spirit of her clan was her spirit it was their blood that pulsed through her veins her heart beat with the same strong rhythms its destiny was her destiny too she had accepted the charge of the white priest and she would do whatever that service requiredso long as it brought about the destruction of the templar commander failing that she would appeal to the ancient code of justice which demanded an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and a life for a life one way or another she would have her revenge sweeping all doubts aside as if they were straws before the cold gale of her retribution she steadied herself removed the bunchedup hem of her mantle from her nose and mouth and nodded to the jailer who placed the great iron key in the lock the princes secretary turned to address cait through her interpreter as you will see said abu translating the katibs words there are many prisoners from which to choose if you wish to speak to one you have but to point him out and the jailer will have the man brought to you cait nodded to show that she understood whereupon the jailer pushed open the door and stepped through into the cavernous chamber cait followed with abu sharma close behind haemur and otti came next in attendance not because they were any real use in this matter but for proprietys sake cait had quickly learned that the saracens respected only those women who appeared to possess the support and protection of men the lower prison was little more than a dark noisome hole the only illumination came from the grates of the open sluice drains in the floor above despite the stink the cell was cool and dryan acceptable trade cait thought for if one could not have the light at least one did not have to endure the heat in the surrounding gloom the captives lay eighteen or twenty men all knights all of whom had been captured in one battle or another as cait moved into the highvaulted room the captives stared up with hopeful faces and began clamouring for attention the jailer waded in roaring at the prisoners and clouting them with his ring of keys until rough order was restored he then stepped back and beckoned cait forward to examine the goods on offer and make her choice cait had already had plenty of time to decide what she wanted she stepped forward and raising her voice to the hopeful men addressed them in slow distinct latin believe me when i tell you that i am sorry for your plight she said my own father sat in this same cell awaiting ransom and release it came for him eventually and i pray that it will come soon for each and every one of you she paused to allow her words to be relayed by abu to the jailer today however liberation has come to a fortunate few she told the prisoners then changing smoothly to a simple but serviceable norse she asked are there any norsemen among you several voices answered eagerly here said two and over here said another stand please commanded cait three men rose eagerly to their feet pointing to the nearest of them she turned to the jailer who motioned the prisoner to step forward hobbling his hands and feet shackled and chained the man edged into the light tall and gaunt his fair hair and beard hanging in dirty tangles his face grey with despair and lack of light he regarded the young woman with an expectancy almost painful to behold what is your name cait asked in the northern tongue i am yngvar replied the man his voice cracking dry he held himself gingerly favouring one side as if to protect an injury she looked him up and down are you well enough to fight yngvar i am that he replied without hesitation these others she said indicating the knights waiting their turn do you know them he nodded his head once they are my swordbrothers pointing with both hands to the thickshouldered heavybrowed man behind him he said that is svein gristlebone nodding to the young darkhaired man a short distance away he said that is dag stonebreaker she summoned them by name svein dag come here as they shuffled painfully forth she asked where is your lord yngvar was he killed in battle by no means replied the knight he is here with us even now he turned and pointed to a man squatting on the floor a few paces away cait moved to him and he looked up at her impassively his face what she could see of it beneath the foul mat of his hair and beard was broad his chin and cheekbones strong this man here says you are his lord he speaks the truth then why do you refuse to stand with the others you did not say how many would be chosen he replied evenly if any are to gain freedom today i want my men to have first chance cait nodded thoughtfully if i pay ransom for your men will you join them of course he said i am their lord tell me how did you come to be here there was a battle answered the knight we lost is that all nothing more that was enough i mean said cait with exaggerated patience is there nothing more you care to tell me about how you came to be here we are warriors not criminals there is nothing more to tell then let us strike a bargain you and i replied cait satisfied at last the knight climbed slowly to his feet even in chains his clothes little more than filthcrusted rags he held himself straight and tall i am rognvald of haukeland he declared tell me your bargain it is this said cait before she could continue the jailer who had been talking idly to the katib suddenly thrust himself between them shouting and swinging his keys again instantly the knight raised his shackled hands caught hold of the iron ring and held it firm so that cait would not be struck the jailer roared with frustration peace salaam cried abu rushing forward he beseeched and cajoled and by degrees calmed the outraged jailer he says you must not go among them abu informed cait or you will certainly be hurt tell the jailer i thank him for his vigilance and concern cait replied stepping back to show she understood to the knight she said here is my bargain i require the aid and protection of several menatarms for a pilgrimage i intend to make in exchange for your vow of fealty i will pay your ransom serve me well and once i have reached my destination and achieved my purpose you will be paid for your services and released to go your way lord rognvald regarded her with the same indifferent expression with which he had greeted her what say you she asked do you wish to discuss the matter with your men when he still did not reply she demanded well what is your answer i am thinking the other prisoners began shouting just then imploring to be recognized giving cait to understand that if these norwegians were reluctant many another would happily take their place putting out her hand to the clamouring captives cait said you see there are plenty of others ready and willing to volunteer this is what i am thinking replied the knight stroking his beard with a grimy hand it was at that moment that cait knew she had made the right choice lord rognvald i chose you because while i know nothing about fighting men i do know something about norsemen and i know that if a norseman accepts my bargain i can trust him to keep it and i will sleep secure in my bed at night that is true replied the knight how do you know so much about norsemen my greatgrandfather was born in norway and my grandfather came from orkney arhe served king magnus on the great pilgrimage lord rognvalds men stood looking on their faces pinched with desperate hope come let us agree said caitriona i think you will find service in my employ far less onerous than your present occupation a ghost of a smile touched his dry lips my lady i accept cait turned at once to the katib these four men she said how much is the ransom abu translated her words and the wazirs secretary cast his eyes over the standing men he made a mental calculation and announced the price ten thousand dirhams abu said relaying the katibs words each very well said cait tell him i agree with all respect sharifah that i will not do abu replied it is impious to accept the first priceit shows disrespect for the bounty allah has given you also it is an insult to the intelligence and an affront to the spirit of commerce i see then tell him it is too much said cait i will give five thousand abu and the katib held a short spirited discussion whereupon abu turned to cait and announced katib says you are not to offend his master the prince with such a ridiculous offer these are christian knights not camels ten thousand is the price for which noble fighting men are redeemed he will not accept less than eight thousand dirhams while i intend no disrespect to prince mujir eddin cait replied smoothly i must point out that one of these men is injured and all of them suffer from lice starvation dysenteria and god knows what else i doubt whether his highness the prince would buy camels in a similar condition six thousand tell him seven thousand and five hundred dirhams for each man countered the katib when abu had translated her words i think it is still too much abu confided in a low voice these men have been here a long time stay at six six thousand and not one dirham more said cait through her dutiful translator looking around the prison she added i do not see anyone offering a better price therefore she smiled i advise you to accept mine twentyfive thousand for all four countered the katib serenely very well said cait twentyfive thousand for these four she held up a finger and freedom for one more of my choosing she paused and added with a smile twentyfive thousand silver dirhams katib or nothing i leave the choice to you personally i think twentyfive thousand dirhams would be very useful in helping repair the earthquake damage to his majesty the princes reception hall when her words were relayed to him the katib rolled his eyes yuallah he sighed very well which is it to be addressing rognvald she said is there any man here with a young family waiting for him at home the knight thought for a moment there are two that i know of he said and pointed out two knights who eagerly rose and stood expectantly do either of you have a daughter cait asked in latin i do replied one of the men how old is she six years this summer answered the man when did you last see her three years ago i will buy your release on one condition she said you must abandon any claim to wealth or rank in the holy land and return home to your family without delay god smite me if i do not fly from this hellhole the moment i am released replied the knight unable to keep the quaver of excitement from his voice swear it she insisted upon my soul and every hope of eternal salvation i hereby abandon any and all claims to wealth and rank in the holy land and vow to return home by the swiftest means possible very well replied cait if you like you may accompany us to the coast where you will find passage aboard a ship to take you home you kindness shames and overwhelms me replied he knight i thank you my lady i am your devoted servant your safe return to your family is sufficient turning to the katib cait indicated the man and said that one is to be included with the others they are to be allowed to wash and given clean clothes understood the katib bent his head in acknowledgement and the bargain was sealed turning on her heel she walked quickly from the chamber steeling herself against the piteous clamour of the captives as they cried out to be released she did not stop until she was outside the prison and drinking in the fragrant air of the princes courtyard once more please tell prince mujir eddin that i thank him for indulging my request so admirably and i will thank wazir muqharik to command the captives to be readied for their release by midday when i return with the money it shall be done replied the katib when abu had delivered her words the party then left the palace and returned to the inn where caitriona had taken rooms leaving abu and otti to keep watch in the courtyard outside she and haemur brought out the chest containing the items carefully selected for the purpose from among the treasures duncan had assembled to pay for their pilgrimage to jerusalem alethea watched as her sister withdrew a gold bowl rimmed with alternating rubies and sapphires and a ceremonial dagger with pearlstudded handle and crystal blade now what are you doing thea asked yawning with boredom i am selling a few things to pay for knights cait explained passing the objects to the ships pilot who placed them in a cloth bag which he knotted and tied are you going into the city asked alethea i want to go i hate staying here alone if you are going i am going too no replied caitriona crisply we are staying here i cannot see why we need knights anyway grumped alethea i told you it is not safe for us to travel alone replied cait we need the protection of a bodyguard with that she and haemur returned to the courtyard where cait instructed abu sharma to accompany haemur to the principal marketplace in the city and negotiate the best terms possible for the sale of the precious objects we need at least twentyfive thousand dirhams as you know she said bargain well and i will give you a dirham for every ten you receive over the necessary amount done cried the young physician place your full confidence in me sharifah we shall return in triumph otti she said turning to the seaman i want you to go with haemur for protection let no harm come to him understand the simple seafarer nodded dutifully and took his place beside the pilot she watched them depart and then went back to her room and lay down on her bed with eyes closed hoping to escape the heat and noise of the busy streets outside the inn it was no use the barking of dogs the braying of donkeys and the restless fidgeting and sighing of alethea kept her awake so abandoning the attempt she rose and taking her sister with her went to find the innkeeper to arrange for a special meal to be served that evening for her soontobereleased warrior band chapter seven sharifah cried abu sharma his voice loud in the courtyard come quickly cait awakened at the sound the chamber door was open to the courtyard outside thea she muttered rising she pulled on her shoes and hurried out to find the courtyard filled with the horses camels and baggage of a caravan of arab merchants newly arrived in the city the travellers dressed in dark robes and pale yellow turbans were standing in the yard overseeing the unloading of their pack animals while the innkeeper passed among them with cups of lemon water and tiny honey cakes the sun was hovering above the rooftops and the heat of the day slowly fading here sharifah abu called again come and see what i have done for you the young physician and the old pilot stood holding a small wooden casket between them otti loomed behind in an attitude of hovering protection haemur was grinning like a child with a naughty secret and abu was puffed up and strutting like a cockerel alethea stood nearby gawking at the arab travellers in their opulent richly patterned robes the younger men among the merchants were in turn ogling alethea who owing to the heat had put off her mantle and come out wearing only her undershirt her long smooth arms were exposed and her legs bare from her shapely calves to her slender ankles thea get inside cait ordered to abu and haemur she said bring it in there may still be a few people in damascus who have yet to learn our business perhaps we might keep it that way the two men lugged the chest into caits room and lay it at her feet the others crowded around as abu pulled the hook from the hasp and swung the lid back on its hinges behold he cried silver and gold for her majesty indeed the casket was filled with silver dirhams and a scattering of gold dinars how much is here asked alethea excitedly her eyes wide at the sight of so much money thirtythree thousand dirhams replied haemur with unaccustomed enthusiasm it was all abus doing you should have seen him my lady he bargained like a champion that is me abu sharma champion of the bazaar otti laughed out loud he is crazy this one that may well be agreed cait removing a handful of coins from the chest but this is wonderful cait said alethea do you not think so i am delighted she counted out coins amounting to eight thousand dirhams put them in a leather bag which she tied and returned the rest to the box to abu and haemur she said i might have been more delighted if you had accomplished the task in good time taking up a shawl to wrap around her shoulders she said close the box and bring it abus face fell slightly you do not wish to hear how the mighty abu wrestled the demons of avarice greed and desire in the marketplace do said alethea later cait said moving to the door i wish to secure the release of the captives before they close the palace gates motioning otti to help him the young syrian took up the casket i know he said brightening once more i will tell you on the way it will pleasantly pass the time excellent said thea happily cait turned and handed her the bag of coins you are staying here ohhh thea whined in frustration cait please i want to go and keep the door closed until i get back thea frowned i mean it thea i will not have you wandering around outside alone otti could come with me she suggested hopefully i need otti with me at caitrionas command abu hired a small carriage from among those waiting outside the inn she and haemur rode in the carriage guarding the box while otti and abu walked alongside abu eager to aggrandize himself in the eyes of his patroness embellished his story shamelessly however the tale that emerged bore at least a passing resemblance to what had actually taken place as directed the three men had taken the precious objects cait had given them from among the items in her fathers store and they had gone to the marketplace where in the street of goldsmiths they sought out the expert valuation of one of the more highly respected craftsmen there the fellow had examined the items expressed interest and when he asked the reason for the sale had been told the simple truth to raise funds for the ransom of prisoners fifteen thousand offered the goldsmith upon receiving this information abu duly pointed out that the objects were far more valuable than that but the fellow refused to barter the offer remained firm the walls of damascus would be easier to move than that pinchfist abu declared undeterred they took their business to another goldsmith across the street who welcomed them with small glasses of spiced wine sat them down and proceeded to spend a considerable time examining the items they had for sale they were fine pieces exceptional pieces he told them the finest materials and craftsmanship beyond the shadow of a doubt why are you parting with them he asked and was told as before that the money was needed to ransom captives of war fourteen thousand replied the gold dealer each asked abu sharma for both sniffed the dealer and i am doing you a favour at that nor would he improve the offer a rock in the sea would have more compassion haemur asserted with a sorry shake of his head the next goldsmith they visited offered a slightly improved sixteen thousand but only when told they had already received an offer of fifteen from a nearby competitor this is when abu grew angry they went out and walked along the street for a while to give abu time to consider the situation haemur was all for going back and letting cait decide what should be done but the young syrian had the bit between his teeth now and he was determined not to be bested they walked to the end of the street and then down another street and yet another coming to the less respectable dealers of gold gems and precious objectsplaces where formerly wealthy people often found buyers for treasures acquired in more prosperous times abu chose one of the most disreputablelooking of these and told otti to stand across the street and stare very hard at the shabby little shack and not to move next he instructed haemur to accompany him but to stand by the door and say nothing it was agreed abu drew a deep breath and held it until haemur feared he would burst and then gathering up the box he darted across the street and into the dealers dwelling this fellow looks up to see abu rushing in all redfaced and out of breath said the young syrian and it is allah help you my friend what has happened so abu explained that he had something to sell but was concerned that nothing should be known of his visitnot to anyone not ever the dealer said that he himself could not imagine any reason why anyone should learn of any transactions they might undertake he took special pains to point out that his customers often required sympathy and understanding ask anyone he said they would tell you that faraq irbil is the soul of discretion and silent as the tomb apparently satisfied abu opened the sack and agreed to allow the dealer to examine the goodsbut first would he mind going to the door and looking outside please this he does said abu and as the fellow peers out he sees otti standing across the street glaring at the door of his hovel oh no i cry we must vanish at once i close the sack and jump up to leave the dealer is not content to allow his opportunity to disappear so abruptly wait a moment pleaded faraq there is nothing to fear let me see what you have maybe i can help but no i said it is too late too late i am sorry i had hoped to raise a little money but now allah help us it is too late forgive me for troubling you abu chuckled at his own shrewdness i close up the sack and rush to the door please do not leave the dealer cries clutching at my sleeve he has glimpsed the golden bowl with the gemedged rim and is loath to let it vanish as quickly as it has appeared i can see you are troubled faraq says to me perhaps events have overtaken you eh yes i thought so but there is nothing to fear you are safe here come sit down you say you wish to raise money you have come to the right place i am a dealer in fine gold jewellery and precious stones let me see what you have brought very well says abu i may as well show youbut remember no one must ever know i was here a womans honour is involved she is a wealthy woman you see the fault is not hers forgive me i wish i could say more so abu brings out the sapphireandruby rimmed bowl and says it is worth sixty thousand you know it i know it alas the time for bartering is past i will take forty forty faraq pretends to be shocked if only that was possible alas my purse is not so capacious as those in the upper street i am a man of more slender means twenty is the best i can offer you think it over while i go and see if that belligerent fellow is still waiting for you across the street oh yes he is still there it seems you must choose between us now but abu sharma slayer of demons is not finished yet he brings out the crystal dagger withdraws it from its sheath of gilded leather and lays the pearlstudded hilt beside the golden bowl i see that sacrifices must be made says abu but it is forty thousand i must have so twenty for the bowl and twenty for the knife the dealers eyes grow round this is a most auspicious day he is thinking truly my friend these are exquisite pieces therefore against my better judgement i will give you fifteen apiece more i cannot do o woe woe doom and woe why did i ever stray from the paths of righteousness alas i am undone cursed was the day of my birth i must have been fathered by a scorpion abu wails and moans he throws himself about the room tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth he scoops up the precious objects and throws them into the bag once more and points accusingly at the silent haemur you see you see you see how i am destroyed now we must make haste and flee the city our last hope must be in flight the dealer deeply impressed and alarmed by these words puts up his hands and says wait wait i have a brother who might be willing to help us from him i can get three thousand more i will add that to the sum already offered yes let us agree and put your troubles to flight my friend under the gold dealers ministrations abu allows himself to be calmed thirtythree thousand dirhams it is the dealer goes out and returns but a few moments later with the gold and silver in a chest together he and abu count out coins amounting to thirtythree thousand dirhams and with much praising and blessing haemur and abu depart carrying the chest between them the young syrian smiled broadly and the rest sharifah you have seen it is a remarkable tale abu cait declared if even half of it is true you have earned your reward i will pay you as soon as we have redeemed the captives and returned to the inn at the palace however they found the courtyard deserted and the wazirs secretary less than pleased at having been kept waiting half the day to complete the arrangements he had begun for the release of the war captives thirtyfive thousand dirhams he informed cait when she and the others had been brought into the hall where wazir muqharik received his visitors i beg your pardon katib answered cait speaking through abu but twentyfive thousand was the amount we agreed upon that was before you kept the princes chief official waiting he replied imperiously thirtyfive thousand pay it or go caitriona motioned for otti and abu to bring the chest forward and place it on the table this they did and cait threw open the lid and upended the box spilling the coins in a glimmering rush over the table twentyfive thousand cait declared that along with my most sincere and profound apologies for the inconvenience you have suffered should be more than sufficient i pray you will accept both having made his point the katib accepted the money and the apology the captives have been washed and clothed they also have been waiting he said speaking through abu if you would please proceed to the gate they will be brought out to you cait thanked the katib and returned to the palace gate where a few moments later the five knights were escorted from the guardhouse by a company of spearbearing saracens led by the jailer they were delivered without ceremony in simple arabic garb of long belted tunics and sandalscastoff clothing and well worn but clean they were still unshaven but they had been scrubbed to a glowing lustre and had made a gallant if only partially successful attempt to comb the tangles from their long hair and beards they hobbled from the courtyard and out through the palace gates without looking back their long imprisonment made walking difficultto a man they moved with an odd lolloping gait as if their legs were made of wood illfashioned and poorly hinged their muscles were unequal to the exertion and after only a few hundred paces they had to rest to catch their breath cait sent abu ahead to a nearby market square to hire two carriages when he returned the knights eagerly if painfully clambered aboard when the carriages began to roll leaving the palace walls behind the former captives overcame their infirmities sufficiently to revel in their freedom by giving vent to enthusiastic whoops and battle cries their exuberance drew stares from the people in the streets many of whom muttered imprecations against illmannered foreigners and fools who could not hold their wine blissfully ignorant of the disapproval swirling around them the jubilant company drove like conquering heroes through a city they had never thought to see again chapter eight upon arriving at the inn cait discovered that the rooms she had bespoken for her enlarged retinue were now occupied by the merchants who had arrived earlier in the day the innkeeper was vaguely apologetic but unwilling to turn his guests out moreover the special meal cait had arranged was now being prepared for the merchants i begged to be excused but they insisted he said spreading his hands in a gesture of abject helplessness they paid in gold dinars what could i do i suppose honouring your promise to me never occurred to you enquired cait tartly exalted lady you must try to be reasonable protested the innkeeper in his rough marketplace latin these are very important men from the east it is said that one is the supplier of pepper and saffron to the sultan of rhum and the others are the owners of caravans that carry silk and spices from kush to samarkand they are celebrating a royal commission to provide the court at baghdad with damasc cloth and cinnamon spare me your mealy mouthed excuses snapped cait these merchants who cannot be deniedwhere are they cait no murmured alethea she had been watching for her sisters return and hurried out to meet the knights who having eased themselves from the carriages stood gazing at the evening sky with the transparent delight of children the merchants my lady but he looked to alethea for help cait please thea tugged anxiously on her sleeve ignoring her sister cait demanded where are they why they are resting in the inner court but began the innkeeper as it is our meal they propose to eat they will not mind if we share the celebration turning to abu cait said come with me we will secure our invitation to the feast the horrified innkeeper started after her my lady this you cannot do it is cait turned on him and let fly you will not presume to tell me what i can and cannot do i have five noblemen who require beds tonight not merchants noblemen knights they are newly released from captivity and are not of a mind to sleep in your stinking stable so if i were you my oily friend she jabbed a finger into his flabby chest i would not waste another moment worrying about my precious propriety but would start trying to save my worthless skin for unless you find rooms where my men will be comfortable i will give them leave to peel you like a grape with that cait turned and marched directly into the inner courtyard to a flurry of protestation from a redfaced horrified innkeeper the courtyard had been spread with rugs and cushions for the comfort of the merchants and their guests who were reclining around large brass trays filled with cups and jars and bowls of olives and roasted pine nuts at her sudden appearance all conversation ceased the merchants looked up to see a woman livid with rage sweeping into their midst for a moment they merely stared and when it appeared that she was not about to leave one of them rose to his feet and addressed her courteously abu translated most gracious lady he said you honour us with your radiant presence a swarthy man of middle years his ample form swathed in costly robes of glistening blue and black and crimson he touched his fingertips to his forehead and made an elaborate flourish with his handa flash of gold from the rings on every finger i am ibn umar alfarabi purveyor of rare spices from the orient how may i be of service to you it seems the rooms which i have engaged for my party have been given to you and your friends indeed remarked the merchant with mild surprise when abu had relayed her words nothing was said of this to me i am sorry but i fear there is little to be done about it now we have already paid for the rooms you see also the meal which you will be served was bespoken by me she told him bluntly again replied the trader it is unfortunate but we were not told of this otherwise we would certainly have made other arrangements as it is we have paid for the meal and it is even now being prepared there is no remedy i fear he inclined his head sympathetically please accept my deepest regrets the other merchants were listening now she saw one of them smile with a smugness that brought her already seething rage to a roaring boil you may keep your regrets i have no use for them cait snapped however i may be persuaded to accept an invitation to join you at table tonight sharing the cost of course the arab twisted a gold ring on his finger truly you are as astute as you are determined therefore it pains me to confess that we cannot offer you the invitation you suggest for according to our faith it is a sin for a follower of muhammed peace be upon him for ever to entertain an infidel beneath the roof of his house abu relayed the merchants words and added for caits benefit this is not strictly accurate i believe he is testing you sharifah cait considered this observation and countered if this is all that prevents you allow me to put your pious soul at ease we are not infidels as you conveniently suppose but ahl alkitab people of the book indicating the dusky red sky overhead she said also the roof you see above you was created by god himself and it is his good pleasure that all his many children might sit with one another beneath it so that harmony and understanding may increase a shrewd smile spread slowly across the arabs smooth face i perceive that you are a most formidable advocate said ibn farabi bowing low i yield to your superior judgement therefore let it be as you say spreading his jewelled hands wide in welcome he said please join us and what was to have been a simple meal among friends will become a banquet cait thanked the merchant for his liberality and sent abu to bring the knights they trooped noisily into the courtyard still reeling with the heady intoxication of freedom haemur and otti came next with a mortified alethea trying to remain invisible behind them upon seeing their dinner companions however the norsemens jubilant expressions faded abruptly cait heard the ugly growl of muttered oaths it is not what i planned she told them sternly but it comes to this dine with them or go hungry you decide as they stood staring dully at their reluctant arab hosts the first platters arrivedtwo large brass trays bearing a veritable mound of apricotstuffed partridges and a wicker basket heaped with bread in flat round loaves the trays were served by the innkeepers wife and daughters dressed for the evening in shimmering green satin with strands of gold coins on their brows and in their hair well demanded cait the aroma of the roast fowls filled the courtyard and the knights gaze shifted from the arabs to the mounded platters what is it to be lady rognvald answered recovering something of his former exuberance tonight i would sup with the devil himself for a taste of this feast turning to the others he said not so they all agreed so cait bade her band of prisonhaunted knights landlocked sailors and mortified sister to follow her and with abus help presented each in turn to alfarabi who welcomed them and introduced them to his four fellow merchants and their companions the two parties sat down uneasily together one of the knights reached straight for a roast fowl and would have gulped it down but for caits sharp tap on his wrist this is not prison slops in a trough it is a banquet we are guests not prisoners therefore you will behave as if you have dined in civilized company before she turned her withering gaze on the rest of them you may look like denizens of the dung heap but try to remember you are noblemen and let us refrain from giving these arabs the satisfaction of slandering us when we leave alethea blushing crimson lowered her eyes and shrank even further into herself but the knights accepted the reproach with good grace duly chastised they assumed a more courtly demeanour and began to imitate their muhammedan hosts they washed their hands in the basins provided and proceeded to dip from the platter with their right hand placing the food on a flat of bread balanced on their left more platters and bowls were broughtherbed vegetables soaked in olive oil and grilled over coals fish and olives in mustard sauce and slivered cucumbers in salted cream and vinegar a careful if not altogether convivial silence descended over the meal as the hungry norwegians filled empty stomachs with food they would have gladly given sight and sanity to eat only half a day ago the merchants not to be outdone at their own feast kept pace with their ravenous guests and the food rapidly disappeared indeed the hungry company was just finishing the platter of partridges when the centrepiece of the meal arrived a whole roast lamb stuffed with rice leeks pistachios and spiced sausage surrounded by a sunburst of spitroasted doves glazed with sweet mulberry jelly as this grand dish was laid before the delighted company the innkeeper appeared and meekly enquired if the meal was satisfactory is all to your liking he asked tugging at his moustache with apprehension bring us wine cait told him and god willing all shall yet be well at once said the innkeeper hurrying away within moments wine was pouring from tall pitchers into cups and bowls the muhammedans did not drink the wine but continued to sip their shardbah an infusion of violets in sweetened water the knights however more than made up for the muslims restraint by quaffing the luscious dark liquid in deep draughts until it ran down their untidy beards as night drew in around them casting the company into deep shadow the innkeeper brought torches which he placed in jars of sand around the courtyard the resulting flames cast all in a rosy glow allowing cait to study her ragged band of knights there was yngvar first chosen a big man tall with hands easily twice the size of her own his fair hair was long and looked as if it had been gnawed by rats as she had noticed in prison he favoured his left side somewhatwincing now and then when he laughed but that did not stop the laughter his face was open and honest and his deepset eyes seemed like chips of northern slate beneath the overhanging ledge of his brow next to him sat svein darker more thoughtful genial but reserved cait suspected that however much he might nod and laugh with the others the greater part of him remained aloof and watchful the weight of his captivity lay heavy on him his broad shoulders drooped from carrying the burden of that long oppression and although he said little cait could tell from the wry knowing expression when she talked that his understanding of latin was better than his fellows and perhaps equal to her own beside svein was dag whose knowledge of latin appeared to extend only so far as the end of his wellshaped chin nor cait suspected was he troubled by an overly energetic intellect but where the others looked like they had been pulled fresh from the hostage pit he appeared as hale as a man who had just woken from a long nap younger than the others he was undeniably handsome and enjoyed the confidence his dusky good looks bestowed even so cait was pleased to see he displayed none of the conceit that goodlooking men so often cultivated he was easy with himself and the others his smile at once genuine and effortless beside dag sat the unknown knight guarded silent happily making himself an unobtrusive humble presence and then next to her rognvald tall and gaunt his flesh seemed to hang on his bones but the bones were strong cait imagined that a few weeks of good food clean air and rest would restore his former strength and chase the prison pallor from his face and it was she decided a good facea true nordic face with generous features and a long straight nose he was past the first blush of youthhis sandcoloured hair had begun to thin somewhat and the lines were beginning to deepen on his facebut just sitting next to him she sensed a steady and resolute spirit and his quick blue eyes hinted at hidden depths while she might have hoped for a more imposing bodyguard cait was satisfied they were near kinsmen after all with their familiar scandic features they might have been brothers uncles or cousins and she felt she understood them in the strangeness of this foreign land she found their presence comforting and reassuring and she was confident that once they had exchanged their prison clothes for attire more natural to their rank they would begin to resemble something more impressive than the motheaten coterie she saw before her now after the first pangs of hunger were appeased the meal took on a more cordial atmosphere the warmth of food and wine and the pleasant surroundings of the courtyard worked a charm of peace and calm conversation became more cheerful filling the evening with an amiable companionship which expanded to embrace them all in their elation over the extravagant and sumptuous fare the norsemen completely forgot their qualms about eating with arabs and the sedately dignified merchants gave every appearance of enjoying the company of the raucously enthusiastic northerners though they could not speak to one another save through abus mediation the arabs offered their boisterous guests choice morsels of succulent lamb or tiny spiced sausages for their parts the knights loudly acclaimed the virtues of their hosts with endless salutes of their cups all around the circle smiles came easier and laughter more frequent even alethea from the security of her place beside old haemur had shaken off her embarrassment and was enjoying herself as she sat watching the others eat and drink and laugh cait felt the hardtwisted knot she had carried within her for many days begin to loosen and unwind she found herself wishing duncan could be there to enjoy it papa would have loved this she thought and suddenly the grief which she had succeeded in stifling since constantinople rolled over her in a great fathomless wave tears welled suddenly and unexpectedly in her eyes to hide them she bent her head over her cup and let them fall lady murmured rognvald beside her are you well she nodded dabbing the tears away with the back of her hand celebrations always make me cry too he confided she glanced up quickly to see if he was mocking her but could not tell from his thoughtful expression i suppose i am just a little tired she said it has been an eventful day for all of us he raised his cup held it up to her then drank a silent health in her honour before filling his bowl with more roast lamb as the moon rose above the fingerthin tops of the cypress trees lining the courtyard and showered the company with its gentle glow a man in a white turban and long black cloak appeared in the arched doorway instantly ibn farabi rose from his place and clapped his hands for silence gesturing for abu to join him he made a formal announcement in arabic which abu translated friends and esteemed companions the merchant said i have now the very great pleasure of presenting to you the renowned seer and conjurer jalal sinjari who has kindly consented to perform for us this evening a few of his legendary feats the innkeeper and his family and several of the other guests at the inn slipped in through the door to stand along the perimeter of the courtyard and watch the dark magician who stepped forward bowed and made a fluttery movement with his hands suddenly there was a blinding flash of light and two small boys appeared beside him one on either side dressed in white tunics and trousers barefoot their hair shaved to a single thick knot which hung from the back of their heads they knelt and touched their foreheads to the ground sinjari stretched a hand over each of the boys and still kneeling they floated up into the air then producing two large squares of blue silk cloth from beneath his cloak he covered first one boy and then the other he lifted his hands and the boys drifted higher still and then hung there suspended in the air while sinjari his arms spread wide walked beneath them to the chorused murmurs of his small crowd he stepped back holding his hands high turned his face heavenward drew breath and gave out a mighty shout in the same instant he leapt forward and seizing a corner of the silk in each hand whipped the coverings away there was a popping sound and a flurry of white flower petals whirled and spun around the magician cait felt a puff of warm air on her face and was bathed in the fragrance of roses the unexpected marvel delighted even as it astonished and cait laughed out loud she laughed again when the conjurer turned around and there were the two boys clinging to his back they somersaulted to the ground and while the diners and onlookers applauded and rattled their cups against the brass trays the boys ran off to fetch a large urnshaped wicker basket which they dragged forward between them one removed the baskets lid and the other retrieved a small pipelike flute which the conjurer began to play with a raspy low droning sound the noise while not entirely pleasant to caits ear nevertheless made her feel as if a subtle movement was taking place in the earth beneath her and all around the trees and walls and air seemed to quiver with the sound for a long time nothing appeared to be happening but as the buzzing notes from the pipe began to quicken there came a movement from the basket which drew gasps and shrieks from the onlookers as what appeared to be the head and thick sinuous form of a gigantic serpent rose slowly above the rim of the basket but it was not a snakeit was a heavy braided rope the end of which had been knotted and bound up it went slowly undulating as it rose ever higher as if drawn upward by unseen hands eventually the top of the rope reached up beyond the small sphere of torchlight and there it stopped stretching itself taut without taking his lips from the pipe or interrupting the strange low melody sinjari nodded to the boy beside him who began to climb wrapping his arms and legs around the rope and gripping it with his bare feet higher and higher he climbed until he reached the top cait could see his small form dimly outlined in the moonlight as he clung there above the courtyard only then did the conjurer cease his playing he called up to the boy who answered him his small voice drifting down to them handing the pipe to the other boy sinjari took hold of the rope with both hands and began to shake it shouting angrily at the boy above the frightened child cried out but the conjurer paid him no heed indeed the more he cried the more sinjari shook the rope each jerk growing more violent until those looking on were shouting toofor the magician to desist and let the boy descend their pleas were too late for sinjari gave the rope a final terrible jolt and the hapless child shrieked and lost his grip plummeting to the courtyard like a stone the rope collapsing over him but when cait looked she saw only an empty tunic and pair of trousers of the boy there was no other sign the spectators gaped in amazement and declaimed to one another in voices thin with shock as the other boy picked up the crumpled clothes and threw them into the basket and then fed in the rope coiling it round and round sinjari meanwhile walked to one of the torches and pulled it from its container returning to the basket he pointed to it and the boy with the rope climbed inside pulling the last of the rope in with him the magician replaced the domed lid and taking up one of the blue silks covered the basket with the cloth he called out to the boy inside who answered he called out again and the boy answered likewise he called a third time and before the boy could make his reply sinjari whipped away the cloth and throwing off the lid thrust the torch inside cait fearing the boy would be burned threw her hands before her face otti leaped to his feet and prepared to charge to the boys rescue and was restrained with difficulty by haemur and abuwhile the others cried out in dismay for the childs sake but the magician impervious to their anguished shouts stirred the torch around and around filling the basket with flames then withdrawing the torch sinjari placed his foot against the basket and kicked it over the wicker vessel rolled lightly aside both boy and rope were goneand in their place a real living snake its skin glistening dully in the torchlight as it slithered slowly into the courtyard the crowd gasped and drew back in fright stooping to the serpent sinjari seized the beast by the tail and picked it up holding it at arms length as it writhed in the air he began to spin itgently at first but with increasing speed he spun the creature its sinuous length blurring in the flickering torchlight then all at once he stopped and behold it was a serpent no longer but a handsome wooden staff which he tapped on the ground three times with a solid and satisfying thump next he raised the staff and held it across his outstretched palms he elevated it heavenward once twice three times whereupon there was a sharp resonating crack the staff snapped in two spouting sparks and plumes of flame from the broken ends the flames showered tiny glowing embers of gold which bounced on the ground with a fizzing sound creating a curtain of white smoke and when the smoke cleared there standing before caits astonished eyes were the two small boys unharmed and neatly dressed as before the gathering cheered and applauded and cait laughed and clapped her hands with delight otti dashed forward to examine the two young lads and their mysterious basket as alfarabi congratulated the renowned conjurer on his extraordinary feats cait turned to speak to rognvald and found him looking not at the spectacle before him but at her for an instant his eyes held hers and then he smiled and glanced away leaving the distinct impression that he had been subtly appraising her before she could think what to say to this alfarabi clapped his hands for silence my friends he called with abus help jalal sinjari has kindly consented to apply his skills as a seer for us this evening please remain seated and he will come among us the magician bowed and proceeded to the reclining diners pausing before one of the merchants he said you wish to know whether your sojourn in the city will bring an increase in fortune i tell you friend it already has there were murmurs of approval from the others in the party and he turned to the man beside him and said your wife will not thank you for bringing home the servant girl unless you marry her and make her a wife you will not have a moments peace the man sputtered with chagrin but his friend roared with laughter he has seen through your cunning plan yusuf he cried marry the girl the magician moved on and was soon standing before cait pressing his palms together he bowed respectfully to her most noble lady he said speaking through abu you are as lovely as the jasmine that blossoms in the night please give me your hand enthralled caitriona extended her hand to him taking it in both of his own sinjari pressed it and then turned it over he traced the lines of her palm lightly with a finger and cait saw the merriment die in his eyes he stared at her palm and then looked into her face his touch grew instantly cold your other hand please he said glanced at it thanked her and stepped away abruptly saying a long and happy life awaits you good woman allah wills it dismayed and confused by this brusque dismissal cait felt the colour rising to her cheeks aware that the others were watching she smiled weakly and tried to shrug off the waves of distress rising around her after all she told herself it was only a ruse a trick for entertainments sakelike the snake and disappearing boysthe sly deception of a practised performer and yet despite all that reason assured her she could not shake off the feeling that sinjari had seen something in her future that had caused him to abandon what he had been about to say the magician moved on foretold a few more futures the innkeeper would have another son before the year was through and one of the merchants would become an amirand then quickly thanked his audience for their most gratifying praise and attention and dismissed himself ibn umar alfarabi walked with him to the doorway and bade him farewell while the two men talked together cait unable to resist summoned abu and when sinjari took his leave she followed him out into the yard a word sir if you please called abu on her behalf the conjurer turned ah i expected as much he smiled wanly accept my humble admonition do not persist in your enquiry sometimes it is better not to know i understand replied cait through abu but i must know noble lady a seer glimpses only shadows nothing more what can i tell you that you could not guess please sinjari sighed taking her hand once more he turned up the palm and gazed into it after a moment he began to speak in a low solemn voice that caused caits skin to tingle with stark apprehension you have placed yourself in great jeopardy he said already the forces of chaos and destruction gather about youthey soar like vultures circling in the air waiting for their feast he regarded her sadly if you persist in the way you have chosen death will mark you for his own death is a shrewd and pitiless hunter none escape his snares she pulled her hand from him as he finished and thanked him for telling her then bade him good night and turned away it is not too late to turn aside the magician called after her the future is written in sand not stone chapter nine forget the woman i say she is nothing to us commander de bracineaux regarded his companion with a stony basilisk stare she has stolen the popes letter she might have stolen the popes golden chamber pot for all the good it will do her felix danjou leaned his long frame against the stone rail of the balcony and eyeing the fruit in the glass bowl on the table before him drew a knife from its sheath at his belt the redandblue striped sunshade rippled lightly in the breeze as if it were struggling to exhale in the stifling heat of the day she has the letter and she has gone to damascus my point exactly replied baron danjou spearing a ripe pear on the point of his dagger he cut a slice from the soft flesh and lifted it to his lips on the edge of the blade are you finally insane danjou enquired the templar commander inert in his chair his white tunic open to the waist sweat was rolling off him in drops that spattered the dusty tiles like fat raindrops on hard desert pan perhaps allowed the baron judiciously but it occurs to me that if she has gone to damascus it can mean but one thing which is she does not have the slightest idea what she has stolen danjou cut another slice from the soft fruit ate it and tossed the rest over the rail into the garden below that is to say the woman has no idea of the letters value or what it means she is nothing but an opportunistic thiefand not a very clever one at that probably she cannot even read that is precisely why we must get it back de bracineaux pointed out why the baron picked his teeth with the point of the knife before someone else finds the letter and realizes its worth my god danjou he blurted in frustration what have we been talking about the baron of anjou sniffed he stabbed a fig and raised it on the end of his knife all the more reason to forget the girl and go for the treasure insteadbefore someone else gets there first the commander regarded his fairhaired companion for a long moment there was definitely something unnatural about him in all the time renaud had known him he had never seen felix danjou sweat the sun might scorch like an oven but the pallid baron seemed always at his ease by the same token nothing ever rankled him nothing ever perturbed bothered aggravated or upset him he seemed to have no feelings at all but met each and every trial with the same unassailable equanimity some might consider such supreme and disciplined poise to be courage or confidence but de bracineaux knew it was neither unless of course you merely wish to gratify your deep desire to punish the slut for trespassing on your good nature danjou continued then i could quite understand such a pointless preoccupation the baron took a bite of the fig then flipped it over his shoulder and sent it spinning into the garden to join the pear but with things as they are i daresay you would be better employed pursuing this mysterious rose blossom or whatever you call it gods wounds danjou replied de bracineaux slowly but i begin to see a sort of sense in what you say he splashed some more of the chilled lemon water into the tall silver beaker in front of him lifted it and rubbed the cool metal over his forehead before gulping down the sweetsour liquid we could leave as soon as troops arrive from jerusalem said the baron his blade hovered above the fruit bowl ready to strike the weather will stay good we can reach asturiaor wherever this cleric may be well before autumn as to that the templar commander rejoined i have twenty men garrisoned in the city that is a force of sufficient strength i cannot imagine we would need more we can depart as soon as provisions are put aboard we can leave tomorrow morning better still danjous dagger flashed down splitting the smooth skin of a plum he raised the fruit red juice trickled down the blade like blood what of the emperor we will simply tell our host that we have been called away on urgent church business and beg his leave to depart at once i am certain his niece and her new husband will find ways to amuse themselves until we return anyway the poor soldiers of christ have better things to do than provide escort for overpampered newlywed royals he sipped from his cup adding it is beneath us de bracineaux set down the beaker and rose as if he would set off for the harbour that very moment he looked at the white sunlight beating down on the rooftops of the surrounding wings of the palace the heat shimmered in waves before his eyes he promptly sat down again gislebert he had to shout twice more before rousing the sergeant from his nap in the next room there you are fetch me a runner sergeant i have a message for the emperor emperor manuel comnenus reclined on a couch beneath a sunshade of blue silk stretched between gilded poles the thin fabric rippled in the light breeze of the garden as he lay with his hands folded over his compact wellmuscled chest listening with halfclosed eyes as a robed official read to him from a large scroll entitled ecloga justinian the aged courtiers thin nasal voice droned in the quiet of the sunsoaked garden keeping the emperor from his midday sleep two small halfnaked children splashed in a fountain under the watchful eye of a whiterobed servant in a broadbrimmed red hat at the approach of the papias he roused himself rolling up on to his elbow the official bowed low his chain of office almost touching the ground well demanded manuel irritably grand commander de bracineaux has arrived basileus good let him wait on the terrace basileus said the courtier the sun yes what of the sun it is very hot on the terrace your majesty let him wear a hat of course basileus the old man had stopped reading while this exchange took place and as the papias departed the emperor turned to the reader and said pray do not stop murzuphlus even for a moment else we shall never get through this he returned to his reclining position and listened for a while longer and then when he was ready to hold audience he rose and thanked the old man saying we will return to this tomorrow calling an order to the whiterobed servant to take the children inside out of the sun he then proceeded to the terrace as he entered the gallery he was met by two courtiersthe protovestiarius and the silentarius the first held out a long sleeveless robe of purple with pomegranates embroidered in thread of crimson and gold manuel drew on the robe and stood patiently while the laces were tied meanwhile the second offered him a blue peaked hat with a brim like the prow of a ship in front which the emperor allowed to be placed on his head the silentarius bowed and then walking backwards while holding aloft his ebony rod of office he led the emperor to the terrace where an extremely hot and uncomfortable de bracineaux was waiting ah there you are commander said the emperor he made it sound as if he had been searching for the templar for most of the day de bracineaux swallowed down his annoyance it is a pleasure basileus as always he smiled sweat streaming from his red face it is very pleasant out here manuel said walking to the terrace rail below the city walls he could see the golden horn gleaming like beaten metal in the hot sunlight he watched the boats which ceaselessly worked the wide stretch of water we never grow tired of the view it is a fine view basileus it is yes the emperor stood at the rail hands clasped behind his back gazing out across the water to the hazy blue hills beyond lost so it seemed in a reverie de bracineaux waited a few moments but when the emperor appeared to have forgotten him he cleared his throat and said you wished to see me basileus i believe did we wondered the emperor he turned to the commander and regarded him mildly you should put off that heavy surcoat commander he observed you look like an ox on the spit it is warm yes basileus agreed the sweating templar the sun beat down on his red uncovered head manuel smiled we received a message that you wished to leave constantinople with your kind permission basileus a matter of some importance has arisen which requires my presence elsewhere the emperor accepted this are we to know the nature of this important matter his glance became keen as he watched the templar commander try to avoid answering the question it is a procedural matter basileus replied de bracineaux with slight hesitation i would not presume to inflict the minutiae of our order on you your highness procedure can be fatiguing we find the emperor drew breath and turned once more to the folded hills rising above the wide sweep of the golden horn nevertheless you may consider that we have matters of importance which require your presence here grand commander de bracineaux but your highness de bracineaux started to object the emperor cut off his protest with a wave of his hand without looking at his visitor he said my niece and her new husband will be returning to tripoli in a few days you agreed to escort them and we are inclined to hold you to your agreement with all respect basileus countered the templar i must beg to be excused but you will not be excused commander replied emperor manuel placidly your procedures he gave the word caustic emphasis will no doubt wait until you have fulfilled the duty for which you have been retained no doubt basileus replied the templar stiffly you are right to remind me of my duty i will abide we are pleased to hear it manuel said turning once more to his visitor we are having a banquet tomorrow evening for which we have arranged a display of arms we understand you franks are fond of martial entertainments what is the word you use tournament replied de bracineaux ah yes we must remember that replied the emperor his face lighting with pleasure we are having a tournament we are certain you and baron danjou will enjoy it commander i wait upon your pleasure basileus said the templar if there is nothing else i will trouble you no further he made a small bow and started away it does a soul good we find said the emperor to bend to a higher authority from time to time you must try it more often commander chapter ten we are being followed the voice stirred cait from her brooding contemplation of the white heatbleached sky and the powderdry road ahead cait lifted her hood and turned in the saddle to see that it was rognvald who had addressed her forgive me i would not intrude my lady but there is someone following us he addressed her in norse and his accent sounded to caits ear like the old fishermen who used to take refuge at banvard when foul weather drove them into the bay they were also from norway and the sound of the knights voice reassured her it made her feel as if she were speaking to some ancient relative how many she cast a hasty glance over her shoulderbut saw nothing save the owner of the horses they had hired and his two sons bringing up the rear on their donkeys behind them the dustdry track stretched back and back across the undulating hills to damascusnow a small shimmering gleam in the heathaze far behind them rognvald said just one he regarded her curiously did you think there would be more never mind what i thought she told him firmly i believe he replied you will have to tell me your secret sooner or later perhaps if you told me now i could help you with it i have no secrets she looked back at the trail behind her and saw a small dark figure disappear swiftly over a faraway hilltop at least none i care to discuss with you as you will they rode on for a time and cait turned her thoughts next to the necessary steps ahead acquiring her bodyguard of knights was just the beginning they would have to be properly clothed and armed and they would need horsesall of which would be expensive she would have to sell more if not most of the remaining valuables from her fathers chest she had offered to buy new clothes for them before leaving the city but the knights preferred their rags to saracen garb which was all that damascus had to offer nor could they buy any weaponsthe arabs were forbidden to sell to christians under pain of death by a decree of prince mujir eddin cait had her dagger but that thin blade was the only protection the party possessed once they reached tyre however they could buy anything the horses at least could wait why did you ransom us asked rognvald hmm wondered cait half aware he had spoken to her i already told you this pilgrimage of yours yes but as you will not tell me where we are going i can only assume some deeper purpose cait thought for a moment as a young man my father visited the holy land she explained simply he never reached jerusalem and always wanted to return and finish the pilgrimage last year he decided to do it and to take alethea and me with him he wanted to show us the places he had visited including prison she frowned my father was once a prisoner there so you said where is your father now caits frown deepened when she did not reply rognvald looked at her and saw her face clenched with concentration she seemed to labour so long over the question that he drew breath to withdraw it before he could speak she said we stopped in constantinople to see the city and refresh our provisions while we were there one of emperor manuels many nieces was married and we went to the ceremony it was held in the cathedral of saint sophia and thousands attended she did not look at him when she spoke but kept her eyes on the road ahead although her sight had turned inward and there was a softness to her voice that was not present before a sadness the service was over and i followed the crowds out into the street to see the bride and groom away my father remained inside however and when i returned i saw him talking to a man by the time i rejoined him the man was gone and my father had been stabbed the man stabbed your father wondered rognvald incredulity creasing his brow in a church he died in my arms affirmed cait nodding sadly we buried him the next day in the graveyard of a monastery and then sailed on to damascus i see the knight nodded thoughtfully so in honour of your fathers wishes you are continuing the pilgrimage to jerusalem cait frowned no she said then hesitated unwilling to say more ah rognvald guessed here is where the secret arises there is no secret cait insisted then tell me where are we going he regarded her with benign interest come my reluctant lady you have entrusted your life and that of your sister to us you might as well entrust your secret i will tell you cait decided at last but not now once we are aboard shipthen i will tell you lord rognvald accepted her decision agreed he smiled i will look forward to hearing it cait turned to look behind again what are we going to do about our follower there is a stream just ahead he said pointing to a line of small scrubby trees grey with dust it is growing hot we can rest there and see what comes cait agreed and the travelling party proceeded slowly to the line of trees the stream turned out to be dry the bed full of dusty rock and withered grass but the patchy shade provided some relief from the heat and the savage onslaught of the sun they dismounted and while the owner of the horses and donkeys gave each of his beasts a handful of grain from a bag the knights and seamen found places to rest under the trees rognvald rode a little apart and took up a position where he could watch the road retrieving the waterskin from behind her saddle cait pulled the stopper and took a long draught the water was warm but it wet her lips and tongue and washed the dust from her throat owing to their long captivity the knights were unaccustomed to the heat and sun and unused to the saddle they limped manfully to the little grove and flopped down to lie exhausted in the mottled shade after only half a day outside their prison pallor was replaced by the radiant pink of sunburn cait watched them doubtfully it would be weeks she reckoned rather than days before they were back to fighting fitness thus despite her impatience to hurry back to the ship she resolved to adopt a slower pace for their sake handing the waterskin to otti she told him to take a drink and pass it on then sat down with her back to a treetrunk and closed her eyes in a little while she heard someone beside her and looked around to see dag settling his lanky frame beneath the same tree why stonebreaker she asked after a time he smiled his blue eyes crinkling at the corners well now he said i was born in jutland where there are a great many mounds and stones and such belonging to the old ones it is a very fine placesometimes a little cold but the hunting is good once when i was out hunting with my brothers we caught sight of an elk and gave chase even though i was the youngest i was in the lead ya he smiled at the memory and cait smiled too for he also sounded like the norse fishermen whose voices rose and fell over the dips and crests of their words like a ship ploughing the ocean swell well now he continued as i raced along i passed one of these standing stones and as luck would have it my horse stumbled in a badger hole at that very moment and i was thrown from my saddle well i hit this stone see he slammed his fist into his hand with a loud smack to demonstrate i smashed into it head first and knocked it down the stone fell and i fell they thought i was dead but when they came to look they saw that i was still alive and when they raised me up they saw the stone was broken under me he grinned his fine straight teeth a winning flash of white i have been dag stonebreaker from that day hearing their talk yngvar edged nearer to join them and svein too cait noticed that alethea whose understanding of norse was nowhere near as good as her own was nevertheless listening with rapt attention to the handsome nobleman tell how you got your name svein said dag with a nudge of his elbow nay he replied it is never so exalted as dags tale but at the encouragement of the others he sighed and said my father kept houndsevery year he had to train up three good dogs to give king sigurd in tribute he had several fine bitches but his favourite was a sweetnatured brown called fala a few months after i was born fala lost her litter she was very disturbed over it and would not eat or drink at all my father gave her good meat on the bone but still she would not eat this went on until my father thought he would have to put her away he held off as long as he could but it had to be done so he went to get his sword and a strap to take her out behind the barn but when he came back he could not find fala they looked everywhere and finally found her in my bed with me she had brought me her bone we were both in there together chewing on that bonefala on one end and me on the other chewing away i have been svein gristlebone ever since he made the face of a boy gnawing a bone and alethea laughed out loud the others who had heard the story before laughed too what about rognvald asked cait does he have another name the knights looked from one to the other and shrugged if he does replied yngvar i never heard it how did you come to be taken captive she asked when no one made bold to answer she said if it makes an unpleasant tale you do not have to tell me still do not think to spare me on account of it my father was captured by the seljuqs as a young manthat is how he came to be in the damascus prisonso i know how abhorrent it can be your father was captured too wondered yngvar that is a tale i would like to hear nodding the others added their agreement at that moment however there came a shout from the road and they all rushed to the edge of the wood to see rognvald riding towards them with a stranger in tow cait saw the pale yellow tunic and trousers the bristly dark hair and started out to meet them i caught him hiding behind that hill said rognvald speaking latin for the benefit of his captive he pushed the intruder forward he was spying on us i was resting only what are you doing here abu cait demanded my donkey ran away because of him the young syrian crossed his arms over his chest and pouted answer me abu what are you doing here please sharifah do not send me away you will need someone to speak for you i can do this easily please let me go with you what about the sick and infirm who depend on youthe patients who keep you running morning to night he frowned do you have any idea how difficult it is to win favour as a physician in a place like damascus you need an amir or two at the very least if you hope to survive she regarded him sternly do you even have any patients to tell you the truth he replied no and are you a physician she said her tone defying him to lie to her i studied medicine in baghdad i did he insisted dropping his voice he added a little it is a very difficult occupation you have no idea studying was too hard so you abandoned it i did not he maintained was it my fault my teacher was executed yngvar had heard enough allow us to send him on his way my lady not just yet she said i want to hear the end of this svein dag go find his donkey and bring it you she said to abu come with me they returned to the grove and sat down once more abu before cait and rognvald and yngvar on either sidea magistrate and her officers dispensing justice alethea leaned on one elbow beneath a nearby tree feigning disinterest in the proceedings under caits questioning it soon emerged that while languishing in the baghdad prison for stealing eggshow was i to know the chickens belonged to the qadi of baghdadabu had chanced to meet the celebrated muslah abd allah uddin ibn arabi altusi court physician to the royal family the famed physician had been sent to prison following a failed attempt to poison the caliph it was a grave mistake an injustice of unrivalled magnitude abu declared with surprising vehemence the khalifa was not well liked it is true and those who would have rejoiced at his funeral were as numerous as the desert sands but dear old altusi could no more have poisoned anyone than a faithful dog pee in his beloved masters cookingpot he was a sage and scholar of the highest distinctiona very saint abu shook his head sadly when the poisoners failed they needed a scapegoat and supplied the royal physician indeed he made a perfect sacrifice he was too affronted at the suggestion to even defend himself so you met the physician in prison rognvald confirmed were you never his pupil abu shook his head not in the way you mean yngvar picked up a strong stick but he taught me just the same abu added quickly muslah allowed me to help him as he tended the other prisoners he also taught me greek i learned a very great deal from him what about cairo asked cait suspiciously were you ever there oh indeed yes sharifah it is a very great city i could be your guide if you want to go but you never studied there alas no abus face fell i went there to study it is true but i fell in with some bad fellows who worked for a man who owned a brothel the finest brothel in all egypt now my lady said yngvar slapping the stick against the side of his leg still abu sharma offered it was a good school in many ways i learned a very great deal cait was silent for a moment she regarded the contrite youth before her why should i let you come with us she said at last these men you have redeemed from prison he said indicating the knights yet before you stands a man no less needy than they were when you plucked them from mujirs dungeon you were well paid for your services how can you say you are needy in all the time i was in damascus he said solemnly i never met anyone like you sharifah you say a thing and you do it you have a purpose whereas i have none i try god knows but i have failed at everything if you let me come with you then i too will have a purpose his deep dark eyes pleaded let me go with you on my fathers head i promise you will not regret it caitriona frowned regarding the young man with mild exasperation if you have any more dealings with arabs abu suggested pointedly yu will most certainly need someone to speak for you very well said cait deciding at once you can join us thank you sharifah oh thank you very much abu said darting forward he snatched up her hand and pressed it to his lips you have made the right decision you will see god wills it amen go and help svein and dag find your donkey she ordered extricating her hand rognvald stared at her for a moment then rose without a word and stumped off what is wrong with him wondered cait he is a little upset i think suggested yngvar cait rose and went after him and caught up with him at the horse picket she stood and watched while he made a pretence of inspecting the animals well whatever it is you might as well spit it out there is nothing to say he did not look at her when he spoke you think i made a mistake so now you know what everyone is thinking am i wrong she demanded look at me and tell me i am wrong honest men do not consort with thieves neither do they consort with the refuse of the hostage pit she replied crisply yet i did not hear you complain about that the noblemans countenance darkened at the jab before he could reply she said hear me i am in command here and i will not have my authority questioned understood perfectly rognvald replied then added my lady he bowed stiffly turned and walked away cait returned to her place beneath the tree and sat down you made him angry alethea pointed out he will learn who is in command you should be nicer to people you might want them to be nice to you one day spare me your homilies saint alethea thea sniffed and shut up cait leaned against the trunk and closed her eyes but she kept thinking of all the other things she wished she had said to put haughty lord rognvald in his place after a time the others returned with abus donkey they rested through the heat of the day and moved on again when the sun began its descent in the west a few small ragged clouds had drifted in from the coast after midday bringing with them a slight freshening of the air thus the party resumed their journey in better comfort than before and continued on until darkness made the road difficult to see they camped then a little distance from the track in a grove of ancient olive trees which were fed by a tiny spring while the others set about watering the horses haemur otti and yngvar prepared a meal the moon had risen by the time the food was ready they ate by moonlight and stretched themselves beside the dying fire to sleep caitriona lay awake for a long time watching the stars slowly turn in the heavens the moon rose above the faroff hills causing the night creatures to stir somewhere out in the unseen wilderness a bird called filling the silence with its sad forlorn song tears came to caits eyes for she heard in the sound the cry of her own wounded soul and she felt a cold hard ache insideas if a sliver of ice had pierced her breast and lodged itself deep in the hollow of her heart she would feel the ache she told herself until shegods instrument of holy vengeancehad sent de bracineauxs black soul to judgement the night passed but gave her no rest and she rose to begin another day on the trail illatease and irritated they broke camp and started off it was not long before she found herself riding beside rognvald once more we will get you some weapons when we reach tyre she said when the uncomfortable silence grew too great to bear the markets are good there we should be able to buy whatever you want rognvald thanked her but made no further reply i would have preferred to get weapons in damascus she continued but the merchants are forbidden to sell arms to christians she paused glancing sideways at the tall norseman his proud silence was beginning to irk her i suppose she said trying to draw him out abu might have bought something for us somewhere again he waited before he answered no he said at last it is better this way better she challenged her vexation flaring into anger in what way better knights without weapons are not much use he looked at her calmly and that irritated her the more well she demanded if any of prince mujir eddins soldiers had caught us with so much as a pruning knife between us while we were still in the city we would have been thrown into prison againor worse he told her i think it is better this way for some reason this reply annoyed her too well then she said tartly if we are attacked on the road i will just leave it to you to explain to the cutthroats just how much better it is this way she snapped the reins and made to ride away intending to leave him behind with the sting of her retort but the knight reached out and took hold of her mounts bridle jerked back on the reins and brought both horses to a halt surprised and instantly furious cait glared dangerously at him and was about to lash out at his impertinence when he looked her in the eye and said in a low deliberate voice so long as i have breath in my body no harm will come to you he paused to make certain she understood then added that is my solemn vow and i do not make it lightly he looked at her again and she felt herself unsettled by the intensity of his gaze my lady he said releasing his hold on her mounts bridle he snapped the reins and rode on alone chapter eleven dusty saddlesore hungry and with a throbbing thirst clawing at their throats cait and her small company arrived at the port of tyre it was late in the day and after the stifling airless heat of the dry plain the wind off the sea was cool silk on her skin as they rode through the wide main street of the city which led down to the harbour cait saw the white glimmer of sun on water just ahead and heard the cry of gulls and was instantly transported to the coldwater bay below banvaro in caithness the elation she felt at this sudden memory faded with the realization that her father would never see his home again never again sail into that generous bay never again sweep his darling sydoni off her feet and fold her in his strong arms poor sydoni cait thought she does not even know duncan is dead she is waiting for him to come home and he never will she felt the sadness rising up in her like a spring but like the girl in abbot emlyns tale of the overflowing well she dropped the heavy stone lid back into place and the upsurge of grief subsided there would be time one day to lament her fathers death and mourn him properly but that day would have to wait grief was an extravagance she could not affordthere was too much to do too many responsibilities too much ground to cover later she would grieve she told herself when her work was finished you will be avenged papa she vowed once more as they drew near the harbour she sent haemur and otti to buy food and drink for their supper while she and the others proceeded to the wharf upon dismounting she dismissed the hostler paying him a little over the agreed amount for the use of his horses thanked him and sent him on his way she also gave the lastchosen knight a handful of silver coins and sent him on his way saying should you be tempted to desert your family again remember your vow and know that god will hold you to account the knight bowed and thanking her lavishly hurried away along the wharf in search of a fast ship to take him home she then climbed aboard the waiting persephone to be welcomed by olvir who had been left behind to watch over the vessel in her absence are you certain they are knights wondered the seaman observing the norsemen as they clambered on to the deck they look more like pig thieves they have been in prison cait informed him how do you think you would look if you had been left to rot in chains for three years who is that dark one is he also one of ours that is abu cait replied to prevent further discussion she added he is a physician and interpreter and will prove very useful in dealing with the arabs olvir counted the extra mouths that would need feeding every day maybe i can teach him to cook too cait glanced at the sun and then at the ships crowding the harbour one of them caught her eye hanging from the top of its mast was a white flag bearing a crimson cross a templar ship the sudden recognition brought her up short she told herself that it was unlikely de bracineaux was aboard that ship even so it served as an unwelcome reminder that the murderous commander had allies everywhere and he would not be idle because of the knights inability to travel at speed it had taken far longer to reach the ship than she had anticipated and seeing the templar ship she was loath to waste another moment show the men where they can stay get them some water to drink and fetch some soap so they can wash she told olvir making up her mind at once then make ready to sail this late my lady the day is soon over protested olvir we have few provisions and little fresh water on board let us leave tomorrow when all is in order will no one obey a simple command without crossing swords cait scowled at the obstinate sailor i want to depart as soon as haemur and otti return from the marketplace now go and do as i say a grumbling olvir hurried off and cait went to her quarters to wash and change her clothes it was cool and dark below deck which she found soothing after days in the relentless sun she undressed and laved the water over herself there was a little soap left and a clean cloth and she luxuriated in scrubbing her face and washing her hair most of the water in the basin ended up on the floor before she was finished and when alethea came in she complained of the puddles but if she had made ten times the mess and used up a weeks supply of water cait would not have cared it was well worth the delicious thrill of being clean again she dressed in fresh linen and feeling civilized once more left alethea to bathe and returned to the upper deck the norsemen had assembled and were stamping their feet on the planking pounding the rail and mast with their fists and remarking on the admirable qualities of the ship presently haemur and otti appeared with armfuls of provisions for the evening meal they had bought bread and wine and olives in the market and a sack full of sardines from a fisherman just returning with the days catch cait commanded the knights to clean the fish and the seamen to help olvir cast off rognvald heard the order and came to her i thought we were to buy clothes and weapons in tyre i have changed my mind i think you should reconsider this is a good place the city is secure and the markets are renowned we can get everything we need here we can get what we need in cyprus too we will stop there and what if we should be overtaken by arab pirates before we reach cyprus he enquired she had not thought of that but was determined not to let rognvald have the last word as we are sailing by night the pirates will never see us it is a foolish risk he told her if it was my ship i would not put her or her passengers in such needless danger he turned and walked away leaving cait furious with him for the second time in as many days while svein and dag gutted the sardines the others helped olvir otti and haemur make the ship ready to sail in a little while sleek persephone slipped her moorings and moved out of the harbour despite what rognvald said cait was glad to be aboard ship and under sail again once they had entered deep water olvir began preparing the charcoal brazier to cook their meal soon the deck was awash in the sweet scent of oily smoke and charcoal and the sardines were sizzling on spits one by one the norsemen were drawn away from the rail and their last lingering looks at the pale syrian hills now glowing red in ihe light of a crimson sunset they gathered around the brazier watching the fish hungrily olvir opened the wine jugs and soon the wooden cups were making the rounds while his men sampled the raw syrian wine rognvald strolled around the ship examining the fittings and ropes after their unpleasant exchange cait hesitated to join him but then considered it would make shipboard life too awkward to be avoiding one another every time they disagreed so she followed him to the prow where he had stopped and was gazing out to sea my father loved this ship cait remarked joining him at the rail so much in fact that he had two more built just like it still he preferred the original i can see why the norwegian lord replied amiably she is a handsome craft suitable for most any water i should think otti appeared with his jug of wine and wooden cups it is not so bad this he said pouring wine into the cups to your good health said cait raising her cup and freedom added rognvald health and freedom cait took a mouthful of the wine and almost spat it back into her cup she swallowed hard and gasped rognvald smiled placidly it is somewhat rough i think it is ghastly perhaps it would be better mixed with a little honey and water he said permit me taking her cup the norseman walked to where the others were dosing their drinks to taste she observed him among his men genial and unassuming his authority genuine and therefore unpretentious and unaffected perhaps i have not made such a poor bargain after all she thought to herself as she watched him returning try this he said offering her the cup i think you will find it more palatable she took a tentative sip he watched her reaction oh that is much better very much better she thanked him and they both sipped from their cups if galician wine is half so good we should not go thirsty is that where we are going he asked galicia realizing she had said more than she intended cait looked at him over the rim of her cup well it was no use denying it now yes she told him after cyprus we sail for galicia do you know it no he replied shaking his head we saw the coast from a distance but the king was eager to reach jerusalem and so we did not stop i have never been there either said cait my father was there once on his way home from the holy land he said it was a fine placeall steep hills deep valleys and rocks a great many rocks but the people he said were friendly to a fault at that moment olvir called out saying the supper was ready glad for a chance to break off a conversation which she did not care to pursue cait turned and walked to the platform before the mast where olvir was handing around the wooden skewers accepting a freshroasted sardine she retired with her cup and a piece of bread to the pilots bench where she sat down to eat the others remained clustered around the brazier watching hungrily as olvir set more skewers of fish on the coals the knights growing garrulous as the wine loosened their tongues joked and laughed as they plied olvir and otti with questions about their homeland on the platform alethea sat with abu and both appeared so deeply absorbed in their discussion that neither one was eating the skewers were untouched in their hands cait was just thinking that she would have to have a word with thea about encouraging an unseemly familiarity with the servants when rognvald approached and asked to join her if you like she said indifferently the norseman regarded her with pursed lips but said nothing what it is a large enough ship i can easily find another place to sit please cait relented i insist his smile was ready and affable since you insist i accept he sat down happily beside her put his cup on the deck and began pulling steaming bits offish from the skewer he chewed quietly for a while and when cait thought he might let their former discussion pass without comment he said if galicia is so full of friendly people why do you need a bodyguard of fierce and terrible norwegians cait could feel his eyes on her but she stared straight ahead and deliberately stripped off a piece of fish and put it in her mouth and chewed slowly to give herself time to think how to answer rognvald sipped from his cup and waited we are going she began at last then paused it was no good trying to concoct a plausible explanation on the spot the truth well why not said rognvald it saves so much time and trouble in the end yes let us begin with the truth she looked at him sideways the truth is i do not know he nodded thoughtfully considering this odd revelation then he said after a moments reflection if you do not mind my asking why are you going the way he said itneither opposing nor disapprovingmade cait smile she could hear duncan adopting the same tone and she liked it as to that she said i am not altogether certain that would follow he slapped his knee with his palm well now it is good to have that settled he thanked her for telling him and rose abruptly saying that if she should ever receive any further leading in the matter he would much appreciate a word are you always so headstrong and haughty she called as he stumped away when he did not stop or look around she relented oh very well i will tell you he turned around and retraced his steps everything he said standing over her yes she conceded everything just sit down so i do not have to shout up at you rognvald sat leaned back against the tiller rail clasping his cup in both hands proceed first cait said i must know if you hold any regard for the poor soldiers of christ and the temple of solomon the templars he glanced at her curiously and saw that she was in earnest no my lady the nobleman answered shaking his head slowly i have known but two or three of themthey were in prison with us but were quickly ransomed by their order they were franks it is true but seemed like honourable men nonetheless he shrugged they are said to be formidable warriors but i cannot say one way or the other are there templars in your explanation there are confessed cait one at least but probably many more by now they are the reason for this this she searched for a word and did not find one pilgrimage suggested rognvald supplying the term she had used before it is no pilgrimage cait admitted no she looked across the deck to where the knights were now lolling around the brazier their voices loud with raucous talk rognvald was right she had entrusted her life to these knights she might as well trust him with the rest she stood come with me it will be easier if i show you she led him below deck to her fathers quarters where she opened the wooden sea chest containing his clothes and belongings reaching down into the chest she felt along the side of the box and brought out a flat parcel wrapped in one of her mantles while a bemused rognvald watched she untied the knotted fabric and withdrew a flat parchment tied with a red silk band this she said placing the document in his hands is why we are going to galicia she indicated that he should open it he untied the silk band and opened the stiff parchment a letter he said scanning the salutation to the patriarch of rome yes she confirmed and it leads to a prodigious treasure chapter twelve that which is beyond all price intoned rognvald following his finger along the heavy parchment the treasure of the ages our very real and manifest hope for this present age and the kingdom to come the what rosa mystica his voice trailed off and he looked to cait for an explanation i do not know what it is either she confessed he calls it the greatest treasure in the world i mean to have it and the templars what of them the letter was in the possession of a templar commander cait explained i got it from him you stole it guessed rognvald yes the norseman nodded slowly this priest bertranodo you know him all i know about him is there she pointed to the elaborate signature in red ink bertrano de almira archbishop of santiago de compostela first we find the man who wrote this letter and induce him to tell us where the treasure can be found then we go and get it rognvald frowned and looked at the letter again simple plans are often the best he mused cait caught a note of censure in his tone you disapprove of the treasure no tapping the signature with his finger he said but have you considered that archbishop bertrano may not feel like telling you what you want to know you asked me what i planned to do and i have told you cait stood and hands on hips glared down at the disagreeable knight i do not require your approval my lord but i will insist on your obedience and i will thank you to keep your opinions to yourself they came in sight of cyprus the second day after leaving tyre and that evening persephone sailed into the harbour at famagusta the rumoured pirates had not appeared and the crossing proved wholly uneventful which cait counted a victory for her decision the next morning as soon as the markets opened she sent rognvald and the knights into the city to search out the best armourer take abu with you and when you have found the one she instructed send abu to fetch me he will find me in the street of tailors the knights departed in high spirits and cait and alethea disembarked a short while later with otti as an escort and proceeded to a narrow dogleg of a street where the citys tailors plied their trade they passed along examining the goods on display carefully and asking the prices oh look cait said alethea holding up a white linen mantle with tiny blue flowers embroidered around the neck it is beautiful is it not a young greek fellow squatting in the doorway leaped up just then crying no no no this is not for you god forbid my fine lady you should ever wear anything so coarse and unflattering he seized the mantle and tossed it back on to the pile of folded garments this he said producing a mantle in buttercoloured satin this is for my lady alethea was delighted oh cait look she clasped the delicate mantle to her and gazed down at its shimmering length it is wonderful sensing a potential sale in the offing two tailors from across the street hurried over you like this lady we have more said one and better than this added the other much better here come we will show you the young greek stepped between his customers and the other merchants get back theodores away with you he pushed them back i saw them first go leave us in peace if he cannot help you called theodoros come to us we have better goods if i cannot help them i will personally bring them to you now go having sent away his rivals he turned to his customers and made a polite bow i am didimus what can i show you a new cloak perhaps i have several i think would appeal where did you learn your craft asked cait examining the stitching on the mantle alethea still clutched tightly in her hands my family lived in jerusalemsix generations all tailors the young man said when the city fell to the franks we were among those fortunate enough to survive we fled to jaffa and then here now i am the only one left his long sad face brightened but i have a son god willing he will learn all i have to teach and he will become the best tailor in famagusta like his father it is good work but we are not looking for ourselves she said and went on to explain that she required clothes for four men everything she said from cloaks to belts smallclothes as well he asked politely smallclothes as well everything it will be a pleasure my lady he said bowing low he ran to the door and called to someone inside then returned with a stool for cait please be seated i will bring you some things to examine and we will begin he hurried away again and returned with an armload of cloth which had been halfsewn into cloaks while he was showing cait his wares a young darkhaired woman emerged with a tray containing a jar of sweetened lemon water and small honey cakes which had been baked until they were dry and crisp she placed the tray on the ground beside cait and knelt down to pour the drinks and offer the cakes before retreating hastily inside while cait sipped her drink and made her selections alethea munched honey cakes and chose beribboned shifts and flowered mantles for herself in the end cait decided on five cloaks one red two green two blue with thin rustcoloured stripes five short mantles all white five pairs of long breeches cut from a stout tightly woven wool which had been dyed a deep brown now the belts she told didimus they must be leather and they must be stout alas i do not have belts such as you require but my wifes brother works in leather if it please you my lady i could take you to his shop and you can tell him what you want also if you need shoes for these men of yours he would be happy to oblige so that is what they did cait paid for her selections arranged for the knights to come along later to be fitted for their clothes at the shoemakers workshop she chose the leather for the belts and was discussing the cost of new boots when abu appeared to say that rognvald had found an armourer with whom he was pleased to deal they are waiting for you now it was not an armourer who greeted cait but a merchant named geldemar who traded with smiths and weaponsmakers from many places including cairo constantinople tripoli and damascus the continual warring in the holy land brought a steady commerce to his door that made him wealthy discriminating and fat he conducted his lucrative business from a large house at the end of a street of metalworkers the house protected by a high wall and three imposing servants with dogs boasted two floors the lower rooms were crammed with weapons and armour of all kinds your men have been kind enough to express an interest in my wares geldemar told her lifting a jewelled hand to a hall bristling with lances pikes halberds and swords as you see i have assembled a fine collection he smiled regarding alethea with a keenly appreciative eye my ladies you are welcome to examine my goods i trade with only the finest craftsmen please satisfy yourself that this is so alethea uninterested in weaponry yawned as cait moved to a nearby rack which contained a dozen or more prankish broadswords other racks contained both smaller and larger swords of arab and byzantine design she picked up one and hefted it in her hand the weight was good and the wooden pommel tightly bound with rawhide thoroughly bored now that there was nothing for her alethea wandered into the next room where yngvar and dag were selecting shields from among the many different varieties on offerfrom small round byzantine dorkas and long oval targs which covered half the body to the enormous curved square wooden scutum of ancient roman design my compliments to you geldemar said cait replacing the sword you have amassed a distinguished armoury rognvald appeared just then holding a slenderthinbladed lance caitriona joined him we will find everything we need here he said with your permission my lady i would like to deal with this fellow very well replied cait i will leave it to you my lord if you like abu can stay and help with the bargaining no need answered rognvald geldemar and i understand one another she turned and addressed the merchant i will leave the choice of arms to the discernment of my knights cait told him geldemar smiled pressing his hands together very wise my lady producing a small purse cait handed it to the merchant as a gesture of good faith here are ten gold solidi let this be a partial payment for the items they select the rest will be paid when the goods are delivered to the harbour indicating the tall knight looking on she said lord rognvald will make the arrangements i am your servant my lady replied the merchant accepting the money to rognvald he said now perhaps if you would tell me what you require i will consider how best to help you cait left the men to their business and summoning alethea and abu resumed her procurement of provisions they visited a butcher miller baker sellers of spices honey oil and green goods and suppliers of smoked and salted meat and fish they arrived back at the ship only a few moments before the knights returned each carried a new sword and daggerwhich the merchant geldemar had trusted them to take away and their spirits were higher than she had yet seen them they vied with one another in proclaiming the virtues of their weapons this blade shines like a flame announced svein brandishing the weapon in the slanting sunlight i shall call it loga yngvar said that his sword would be called fylkir because as he boasted it will always be first into the fray dag said his was to be called hollrvarda because of the three his blade was the only true defender this provoked an argument over what sort of names were best for weapons and what the other items in the armoury were to be called the discussion was still going on when rognvald and geldemar arrived in a horsedrawn wagon carrying the remaining arms and armour helms and shields for all swordbelts with heavy bronze buckles and hangers for their daggers battle axes for svein and yngvar a mace for dag and ten good stout lances there were hauberks in heavy ringed mail with hoods and mail greaves to cover their legs cait went down to the wharf to meet the wagon and pay the balance due for the weapons we have done well my lady rognvald informed her he put up a good fight but we vanquished him in the end it was four against one geldemar said happily what could i do she noticed the rosy blush on his nose and cheeks and guessed he had been standing very near a wine jar recently how much is owing asked cait one hundred and fiftyfive gold solidi my bounteous lady said the merchant grandly and a rare bargain it is if i say so myself indeed cait looked to rognvald for confirmation our friend here was rendered helpless by a fit of generosity of a magnitude unseen in cyprus for more than a hundred years declared the knight patting geldemar on the shoulder amiably i do believe he is trying to become a saint among merchants geldemar laughed loudly at this and as the knights unloaded the wagon cait opened her purse and began counting out the gold coins into his hand then he thanked cait for her custom bowed low and kissed her hand and with rognvalds help climbed into the wagon off he drove with much waving and wishing of good fortune disappearing along the quay cait and rognvald watched him go as soon as he was out of sight cait said i know little about the cost of weapons but a hundred and fiftyfive seems a good price to mea very good price indeed i thought it might be two or three times as much to be sure replied rognvald easily but sometimes after a few friendly jars a fellow begins to understand that there is more to life than gainful trade i see anyway geldemar has more than enough gold but very few friends at least not many who will drink with him in the middle of the day i suppose they returned to the ship to find the knights rolling up the mats and clearing the foredeck that accomplished they immediately set themselves to honing skills dulled by long captivity cait decided to withdraw to her quarters below deck where it was cooler come thea she said let us leave the men to practise their swordplay when thea made no reply she looked to see her sister gazing raptly at the knights who had stripped to the waist in the heat he is handsome is he not she said cait saw where her sister was looking dag his spare muscular torso glistening with sweat was lunging back and forth across the deck in a vigorous display of stab and thrustas much for aletheas benefit cait surmised as for the drubbing of his invisible opponent thea come away snapped cait abashed at her sisters barefaced stare she took the younger woman by the arm and pulled her down the steps have you no shame she demanded as soon as they were below deck he is hired to do my bidding and i will not have you making cow eyes at him i was never making cow eyes replied thea rigid with indignation not that you would know anything about it you will die a driedup old hag and have no one to blame but yourself the remark was calculated to cut deep and it did take that back no take it back by way of reply thea screwed up her face in a sour expression of defiant disobedience before she knew it caits hand snaked out and struck her on the cheek with a resounding slap without another word thea turned and disappeared into her chamber slamming the door behind her cait upset and angry stood fuming in the companionway fighting down the urge to go in and throttle her sister instead she returned to the upper deck and was speaking with haemur about the voyage ahead when rognvald approached carrying a long cloth bundle in his hands this is for you my lady the tall norseman said drawing aside the cloth wrapping he presented her with a short slender sword it was made as a gift for queen melisende of jerusalem but was taken as loot when the baggage train that carried it was overrun by saracens geldemar only recently acquired it he placed the elegant keenedged blade in her grasp it was half the size of a mans weapon lighter shorter and balanced for a womans hand she swept it back and forth smartly the quick responsive weight sent an unexpected thrill through her she had tried swords beforemens bladesand thought them cumbersome and ungainly it is fine is it not said rognvald approvingly a very marvel she murmured with this blade she thought i will hold de bracineaux to account when geldemar saw that i liked it for you he insisted that you should have it in recognition of a wonderful new friendship i should think no doubt agreed the knight cait raised the sword before her face the way the sunlight slid over its polished surface and danced along the razorsharp edge brought a smile to her lips you must teach me to wield it properly she said it will be my very great pleasure said rognvald inclining his head two days later after fittings from both tailor and shoemaker a visit to the barber for shaves and haircuts for the knights who were finally beginning to look almost civilized againand numerous deliveries by provisioners bringing wine and water by the cask ground meal by the barrel hardbaked bread salted pork fish and sausage dried peas and beans and other staples and delicacies such as honey almonds pepper and ground spiceshaemur raised anchor and persephone drifted slowly out into the bay once clear of the long spiny ridge of the headland he unfurled the sails and they set out for the pillars of hercules and the rocky stormfraught coasts beyond part ii september edinburgh scotland gentlemen the time has come to appoint a new leader it was evans our second principal speaking in low solemn tones which filled the star chamber with a sepulchral sound the war which has already cost so many lives has claimed one more and we now taste the grief of those who mourn throughout our nation i tell you brothers he said looking to pembertons empty chair it fills my mouth with bitter ashes he turned his sorrowful gaze from pembertons place and said the rule of our order dictates the terms by which the new leader is to be appointed but before proceeding any further we will observe a time of silence in honour of our fallen leader we all bowed our heads and offered up the memory of that fine noble man to the allwise creator in whose presence he now delighted the silence in the room swelled to become a hymn of deepest admiration and the most profound esteem a veneration beyond utterance i do not know how long it lasted for time was overwhelmed by eternity and no longer held any meaning to me i simply became aware that evans was speaking and once more returned reluctantly to the concerns of this world and the matter before us unless anyone has cause to object evans was saying we shall proceed in accordance with the directives established in the rules of order i shall now read the pertinent portion from the articles of investment if it should happen that the first principal shall die in office the second principal shall hold in his stead the seal and charter of the brotherhood of the temple and the order of the sanctus clarus until such time as the surviving members of the elect be met to nominate and appoint one from their number who shall assume the mantle of authority and resume the leadership of the order guiding its protection preservation advancement and the furtherance of all its aims here the compact welshman looked up hear me all of you signify by saying aye this we did and he continued i shall now read from the articles of initiation if it should be found that prior to the election and investment of the first principal any of the seven have not attained to the master or final degree initiation and unless any impediment shall be admitted that initiation shall be offered without delay hear me all of you signify by saying aye while we all affirmed our understanding i did so in a slightly bemused state for until that moment i had neither heard nor suspected there were any higher degrees than the one i now occupied the seventh despite the slightly archaic and abstruse language it did not take a legal mind long to realize that evans was talking about me in other words if the first principal is to be elected from among the remaining members of the inner circle then they must all be of equal rank and status obviously i did not enjoy that particular rank indeed the very next instant he turned and addressed me personally brother murray he said i am mindful of your standing having attained the seventh degree and having performed loyal and exemplary service since your investment i declare before this assembly that you are deemed worthy of consideration for initiation into the final degree still slightly awed by the implications of evanss announcement i could only nod as zaccaria hastened to ratify this astonishing declaration saying i stand as second to the initiation of our esteemed brother we recognize the sanction and affirmation of brother zaccaria evans said therefore i must ask you brothers is it your will and pleasure that brother murray attain to the final degree if so please signify all around the table the members of the inner circle declared their endorsement of the proposal whereupon i was asked to stand brother murray said the second principal seeing no impediment to your elevation arising i now ask you to the best of your knowledge is there any reason why you may not advance to your initiation no brother i stand ready to accept the mandate of my superiors it is the customary answer to questions of this kind within the brotherhood the only difference is that now i knew the men around me to have been my superiors and not as i had mistakenly imagined for so long merely my peers while i accept that my initiation was a formality which was being carried out to fulfil the dictates of our rules of order i nevertheless experienced the familiar excitement of the novitiate facing the unknown obviously i did not know the form this initiation would take remembering my induction to the seventh degree however and the harrowing ordeal it engendered my enthusiasm was tempered by experience that is not to say i was afraid i was not i trusted the men around me implicitly even so the frailty of the human frame having been much on my mind of late i was only too aware of the limitations age had introduced though i was the youngest member of the inner circle i was neither as energetic nor as agile as in my youth and any qualms i felt were those which attended men of my age when contemplating even the most ordinary exertions evans took me at my word however so be it he said let the initiation commence he closed the book from which he had been reading out the articles the nature of initiation to the final degree requires that the candidate should remain in seclusion neither more nor less than three complete diurnal periods the purpose of which is to allow the candidate to reflect on the commitment he is about to make and to seek the safeguarding of his soul through making peace with his allwise creator he looked to me for an answer do you understand i understand brother and i am ready to proceed so be it turning to the others he said we will adjourn until this hour in three nights time when we will reconvene to undertake the initiation of our esteemed brother the meeting ended then and i received the congratulations of the others they wished me well and departed disappearing into the night by their various routes in a little while evans and i were left alone i was sorry to hear of the death of your wife he said our business concluded we could speak more informally it must have been a very great shock to you yes i replied although i had no idea how the other members of the inner circle learned of these things i had long ago accepted that they did i am only beginning to realize the extent of my loss time will heal he told me i do not offer that lightly though many people profess the same sentiment blithely and without consideration it is true nonetheless given time the wound will heal the scar will remain but you will no longer feel the pain i thanked him for his expression of sympathy and said as it happens i was prepared to relate a most curious incident concerning pembertons death i wanted to hear what the other members made of it oh indeed well would you mind telling me not at all i answered and went on to explain about pembertons ghostly appearance at the country house and my subsequent interview with miss gillespie i reported the queer message the young woman had passed on to me he spoke to the young lady he said the pain is swallowed in peace and grief in glory thats what she thought him to say but it makes little sense to me evans rubbed his smooth chin and his eyes became keen he loved a good puzzle and i was happy to share it with him and let him mull it over for as long as he liked now that is a poser he allowed providing of course that is what pemberton said granted i replied what one says and what one is heard to say are not necessarily the same thing quite he smiled his round friendly face lighting with simple good pleasure i shall have a good think now then let me show you to your cell i had learned over the years that the little church where we met contained several underground passages leading to a number of chambers subchambers and catacombs thus i was not surprised to learn that the cell he mentioned was of the oldfashioned variety a simple bare room with a straw pallet piled with fleeces for sleeping a small table with a large old bible bound in brittle leather and a single fat candle in an iron holder a low threelegged stool in the corner a tiny round hearth with narrow stone chimney above and next to it a supply of wood and kindling beside the hearth was a covered wooden stoup filled with water a wooden ladle hung by its handle from a leather strap atop the stoup lay a cloth bundle the rock walls were whitewashed and a simple wooden cross adorned the wall above the bedplace in all it was a clean little room reached after a short candlelit walk along a passage which joined a flight of steps leading from the star chamber which was itself below the chancel of the church all the comforts of home evans said tipping his candle to the one on the table but none of the distractions ive always wondered what it would be like to be a monk now i will find out you will enjoy your stay gordon he stepped to the doorway there is food in the bundle and you will find a latrine in the next cell along he bade me farewell then and left me to begin my time of preparation i listened to his footfall recede down the passageway and heard the door shut a moment later and i was alone i occupied myself with setting a tidy little fire on the hearth this i did as much for the light and the cheery company of the flames as the warmth provided i unwrapped the bundle and saw that it contained three large round loaves of bread a lump of hard cheese a halfdozen apples and three dried fish not only would i sleep like a monk i would eat like one too i tried the bed stretching myself out on the fleeces it was simple but comfortablethe straw was fresh and there was a rough woven coverlet should i need it i was not particularly tired so i got up took the candle and had a look at the latrineagain a simple but serviceable affair which would meet my basic requirements returning to the cell i placed the candle on the table once more and took up the bible i perched on the edge of the bed adjusted the candle so that i could see the pages and opened the cover only to discover that what i had taken for a bible was in fact a large heavy antique volume entitled the mark of the rose curiosity pricked i turned the pages and examined the text i am no expert in these things but i had ploughed through enough musty dusty old books in various legal libraries to recognize a handprinted tome when i saw one there was neither colophon trademark nor printers stamp that i could see judging from the antique typeface and the way the heavy pages were bound i guessed it had been printed anywhere from the mid to late s considering its age the pages were in remarkably good conditionindicating i assumed a prolonged and conscientious effort at preservation i returned to the title page and found printed beneath the title the words prepared from the manuscript of william st clair earl of orkney the choice of words was interesting it did not say that william had written the manuscript but merely implied ownership from this i deduced that the manuscript in question was an older document from which the book i now held had been produced thoroughly intrigued i began thumbing the pages indiscriminately and before long began reading my pulse raced as one after another i began encountering the old familiar names ranulf murdo ragna duncan caitriona sydoni padraig emlyn and others whose lives had now become so intimately known to me that i thought of them as friends i understood then how i was to use the time i was being granted settling back on my bed i pulled the table close and propping the book on my knees turned to the first page and began to read chapter thirteen twentysix days out from cyprus persephone passed the pillars of hercules leaving the calm blue waters of the mediterranean behind and entering the greengrey foamtraced depths of the cold atlantic almost at once the fair warm weather changed brilliant blue cloudless skies gave way to low heavy grey ceilings of endless overcast cold winds gusted out of the northwest kicking up a rough chop which hammered the prow and kept the ship pitching and lurching from crest to trough for days on end no stranger to heavy seas haemur reduced the sailonce and then againand kept a firm hand on the tiller and an experienced eye on the heavens when the rain and mist finally cleared the iberian coast came into view two days later they sighted the entrance to the great shallow saltwater bay which the locals called the sea of straw weary of the wind and rain and bouncing deck cait gladly gave the command to make landfall and in a little while they came in sight of lixbona with its wide and busy harbour tucked into the curved arm of coastline on the tagus river the white moorish city rising on terraced hills glistened in the sun with a fresh rainwashed gleam the air seemed sharper more invigorating tooheralding an early autumn cait thought persephones eager passengers stood on the deck as the ship passed through the narrows and into the bay and watched the city grow larger as more of the gently undulating hills were revealed to them there is the alqasr said abu sharma pointing to the citadel sitting square atop the steep promontory overlooking the harbour do you know this place wondered rognvald no he said and explained that the word simply meant fortress in arabic and look there is the central mosq he pointed to a large domed building with a tall pointed tower rising beside it like a finger pointing towards heaven but the tower or minaret as he called it was topped by a large wooden cross and another had been erected in the centre of the mosqs bulging dome for when the city fell to the christians there had been no gross destruction instead the practical people of lixbona merely converted the muslim buildings to new uses the fortress became the kings palace and the mosqs were made into churches thus lixbona resembled a true damascus of the north wide marketplaces covered bazaars mosqs synagogues and chapels scattered among the tall whitewashed houses with their elaborate screened balconies and flat roofs on which families gathered after the days work was finished and like damascus it was a city of brisk commerce too the rolling brown tagus was a welltravelled road along which the people of the fertile southern valley shipped grain meat wine and green produce all the way from the craggy sintra mountains to the coast upon reaching the great river harbour haemur could find no berths along the huge timber wharf so took a place among the ships anchored in the bay while the seamen made persephone secure the others prepared to go ashore after a few attempts the knights succeeded in attracting the attention of a ferryman who took them to the wharf it was the first landfall since leaving cyprus and it took some time to get used to solid unmoving ground beneath their feet for the knights the day began and ended at the first alehouse they encountered on the street leading up from the harbour meanwhile cait and alethea accompanied by olvir and otti purchased fresh provisions to be delivered to the ship that finished and with no wish to hurry back they walked along the market stalls and marvelled at the variety of goods feeling generous cait allowed alethea to buy a skyblue beaded shift and mantle and gave olvir and otti a similar amount to spend on two used but serviceable daggers ever since the knights began their arms training she had noticed how the seamen lusted after their norse companions handsome weapons and considered it would be no bad thing to arm her sailors as well by evening they were back aboard the ship and remained in the harbour for the night having discovered the norsemens fondness for ale cait thought it best to move on as quickly as possible putting out to sea again at first light the next morning to continue their journey north along the coast the evening of the second day they arrived at porto cales where again they stopped for the night haemurs chart was good but not so exact that he felt confident to navigate the treacherous often lethal waters of the rockstrewn coast ahead he wanted to talk to the local fishermen and find out all he could about their destination so they put in for the night and while abu and haemur with chart in hand spent most of the next day conversing with the boat owners and sailors of the town the others prowled the marketplacesexcept for svein dag and yngvar who prowled only as far as the waterfront inn and remained blissfully occupied drinking ale until rognvald came and fetched them back to the ship the best counsel my lady reported haemur on his return is to go up coast to pons vetus and hire a guide for the way ahead there are many ways to santiago de compostela abu put in the entire city is a shrine to saint james the great and many pilgrims come there to reverence his bones it is second only to jerusalem they say can we go and see it asked thea oh cait can we ignoring her cait said and did anyone happen to mention which of the many ways to the city we should take the best way for us is by river answered abu they say the river is wide and deep enough to take the ship but the channels can be difficult for the unwary it will cost a little haemur said and no doubt i could do it myself if pressed to it but if it please you my lady i would feel better for the use of someone who knows the water hereabouts he paused then added your father would not thank me to wreck his beloved persephone and forsake you and your lady sister in a foreign land nor would i haemur replied cait but thanks to you i am certain that will not happen i am happy to trust in your good judgement very good my lady god willing he said as if resigning himself to an irksome task i will take on a guide at pons vetus two days later that is what they did the fisherfolk of the busy little port knew the region well and when it was discovered there was silver to be had for showing the strangers the way haemur had no end of offers from which to choose eventually he decided on a man of mature age like himself who had for many years fished the coastal waters and supplied the galician markets with his catches wise you are the fisherman told them when he came aboard at sunrise the next morning to many folk the river is just a river they learn otherwise to their disadvantage the ulla is chancy especially above the bend but never fear gines will see you safe to port without a worry with that the old seaman took his place beside haemur and although neither man could comprehend the other with abu and olvirs help and much use of the signs nudges and nods recognized by sailors the world over the two men soon formed a rough understanding of one another gines directed the old norse pilot around the peninsula and up through the scattered rocks and islets on the other side it was slow work and the tide was out by the time they reached the river mouth it will be dark before the water is high enough again gines told them the weather is going to change we will find no better place to stay tonight if you are asking me i would say to drop anchor right here and proceed when it is lightweather permitting although the sky seemed clear and the day mild enough they accepted the old fishermans advice and prepared to spend the night idly drifting in the sluggish river current after supper cait soon lost interest in listening to the sailors trade sea tales and watching the knights drink wine she summoned a complaining alethea and went below deck to bed in her sleep she dreamed that she and her father had completed the pilgrimage and returned home she awakened when she felt the ship begin to move again and went up on deck to find what at first sight appeared to be a dream come true they were back in caithness the sky was thick and dark and low clouds lay on the hilltops and it was raining gently the hills themselves were green and steep and covered with splotches of yellow gorse and the crisscrossing patterns of sheep trails etched in the thick turf the rounded bulges of granite boulders broke the smooth surface of the hills like the tops of ancient grey skullbones wearing through their mossgreen burial shroud white morning mist searched down the slopes twisting around the stones with long ghostly fingers in all the landscape of galicia evoked her homeland so suddenly and solidly that before cait knew it tears were running down her cheeks more mystified than melancholy she nevertheless felt the inexplicable pull of her faroff homeland and marvelled that this place should appear so remarkably like scotland here my lady called the old pilot from the helm i never saw a place looked more like home if i knew no better id say we were come to caithness he is right remarked olvir i was thinking the same thing cait nodded and moved quickly to the rail so that haemur and the others would not see her crying she stood wrapped in her mantle gazing at the mistcovered hills as they slid slowly past when the knights came on deck to break fast she was dryeyed once more and ready to embark on the next stage of the journey it was after midday when the ship came to the small river town of iria there is a hostler at the crossroads in the town you can hire horses from him gines told them compostela is not far and you will soon be there as it happened the hostler had only two horses left for hire not wishing to wait until others became available cait took the two for herself and rognvald the others she decided could remain behind with the ship and she and rognvald would travel more quickly without a crowd to slow them thus they set off early the next day and undertook the ride through thickly wooded countryside the road was old and straight a roman road but wellmaintained and busy passing through several little hamlets and holdings in the valley bottoms they rode through forests of beech and oak damp from the rain and heavy with the smell of ferns as the day progressed the clouds parted and the sun grew warm they began to pass bedraggled travellers on foot some cloaked in brown and stumping along with long wooden staffs wearing widebrimmed cockle hats most of those they passed had scallop shells sewn on their hats and on their cloaks no doubt she reckoned these were some of the pilgrims abu had mentioned but what the crude symbol might signify she could not imagine they also overtook farmers carrying braces of chickens trudging along beside their wives lugging baskets of eggs or bunches of onions or carrots or bushels of beans and once an oxcart piled high with turnips and another with yellow squash as big and round as heads they made good time and reached the walls of compostela before sunset the city gates were still open and upon passing through they immediately entered a wide stonepaved street leading to a great square in the centre of which stood an enormous basilica on this pleasant summers eve pilgrims without number thronged the square those who were not waiting their turn to go into the church were either encamped on the bare earth of the square or crowding around one of the scores of booths and stalls which had been set up to sell food clothing or trinketssuch as painted scallop shells brass badges drinking gourds or sandalsto the restless pilgrim population that ebbed and flowed through the city like a brown beggarly tide he must be a miracle man this saint of theirs observed rognvald in amazement at the hordes i have not seen anything of this kind since jerusalem and even there it was not like this besides the holy wanderers there were traders moneychangers merchants vendors of food and drink and the produce of the surrounding fields and labourers of every kind for the precinct of sancti lacobi was rapidly becoming a town in its own right with a dozen or more grand buildings in various stages of construction the square seemed more like a building site than an ecclesiastical precinct in the streets surrounding the square numerous inns had been built to serve travellers of better means cait decided on a small establishment with a red rose painted on a placard above the door this is the one for us she said and rognvald went in to enquire about rooms for the night they will have us he reported for two silver denari a night each there are others who will take less i am content she replied lord rognvald signalled a young man who came at a run to take their horses as he led them away cait and rognvald went in to make the acquaintance of the innkeeper a small bald man with a large moustache and a swollen jaw from an abscessed tooth he was wearing a poultice of herbs soaked in vinegar and wrapped in a cloth tied to the top of his head peace and comfort my friends he said thickly trying to smile through his pain i am miguel welcome to my house please come in and sit while i make your rooms ready there is bread on the table and wine in the jar i also have ale if you prefer supper will be served at sundown he heeded off pressing a hand to the side of his cheek and cait and rognvald found places at one of the two large tables in the centre of the halllike room one side of which was taken up by a great hearth on which half a pig was sizzling away over a bed of glowing coals owing to the cost of the rooms the inn was not crowded and the guests were of a higher rank than the mendicants who swarmed to the monastery porches and hospices their fellowlodgers were merchants and wealthier pilgrims for whom a visit to the shrine of the blessed saint was not a particular hardship still after the fresh air of the open sea cait found the smoky confines of the inn almost suffocating and was heartily glad when after a supper of roast pork bean soup mashed turnips and boiled greens she could at last leave rognvald and the travelling tradesmen to their stoups of ale and news of the world and retire to her room not much larger than her quarters aboard ship it was swept clean and the box which made the bed was filled with fresh straw and the coverings were washed linen she undressed hanging her mantle and shift on a peg on the door and happily sank into the bedonly to spend an allbutsleepless night scheming how best to get archbishop bertrano to reveal the secret of the mystic rose she had had plenty of time to ponder this since leaving constantinople but as many plans as she had made that many had been discarded along the way now it was time to decide and she was still far from certain what to do the following morning as they walked across the busy square an anxious cait schooled a thoughtful rognvald in the necessity of gaining the clerics confidence before broaching the true subject of their visit he must not suspect we are anything but genuine pilgrims she said we will get the measure of him first and then decide how to proceed understand aye replied rognvald absently i understand they strolled through the gathering crowds to the huge oak doors of the archbishops palace hard by the great basilica which according to the pilgrims at the inn contained the holy remains of the blessed lacobus magnus saint james the great disciple and companion of christ it was the apostles venerable bones that drew the penitent pilgrims in everincreasing numbers at the palace they presented themselves to the muchputupon porter who eyed them with weary indifference god be good to you i am brother thaddeus he said in clipped precise latin how may i help you greetings in the name of our lord and saviour said rognvald stepping towards him we are looking for archbishop bertrano it is a matter of some importance thaddeus regarded his visitors blankly and said he is not difficult to find but you must take your chances like everyone else we would be happy to make an appointment to see him when it is more convenient suggested cait the priest smiled pityingly you misunderstand the archbishop is overseeing the construction of the new monastery he is seldom to be found in residence the monk lifted a hand towards the tower of timber scaffolding in a corner of the square and then closed the door they walked to the place and were soon standing on the edge of a cleared mound where amidst vast heaps of grey stone and a veritable forest of timber the stately curtain walls of a sizeable chapel and bell tower were slowly rising block by heavy granite block the place was seething with workers an army of masons stonecutters and sculptors scores of rough labourers and dozens of hauliers with their mules and teams of yoked oxenall of them moving in concert to the loud exhortations of a large fatbellied man dressed in the simple black robes of a rural cleric his jowls were freshly shaved and his round face glowed with the heat of his exertion leave it to me rognvald told her as they approached i have a bold idea what are youwait cait began but it was too late rognvald was already hailing the priest who turned to regard his visitors with a scowl that would have curdled milk in a bucket chapter fourteen pax vobiscum called rognvald cupping a hand to his mouth with the creaking of windlass and wagon the groaning of the ropes the lowing of oxen braying of mules and the dull continuous clatter of hammer and chisel on stone the norseman had to shout to make himself heard above the din we are looking for bertrano lord of this holy see god be good to you my friend you have found him turning from his visitors he cried not there not there bertrano waved his hands at a group of workmen shovelling white powdered lime into a pile beside the halfraised bell tower despite his rank the archbishop appeared perfectly at ease amidst the clamour and dust of the building site indeed the only thing that set him apart from one of his many labourers was the wooden cross swinging by a beaded loop from his wide leather belt on the other side it goes there bertrano pointed to a heap of sand thereon the other side you see i commend you archbishop offered cait politely when they had succeeded in gaining his attention once more and finished introducing themselves your monastery will be a marvel of the builders art a very marvel indeed good lady agreed the archbishop sourly if by some miracle it is ever finished redfaced puffing and sweating for all the sun had only just risenthe fat man wiped his forehead with a damp sleeve and shouted a terse order to a mule driver who was just trundling past dragging a length of timber with a chain why should it not be finished she asked ask the king cried archbishop bertrano it is his interminable campaigns that keep us limping along like lame lepers when we should be racing like champions to achieve gods glory if not for the king suggested rognvald the muhammedans would still rule this part of the world no the harried archbishop threw him a withering glance what do you know about it he cast a disdainful eye on the tall knights sword there is more to life than brawling battling and wenching before the knight could beg his pardon the archbishop softened forgive me son i have allowed my temper to get the better of me gods truth i am a tyrant until ive broken fast afterwards i am mild as a lamb we would not think of keeping you cait began perhaps we might return later when nonsense replied the archbishop striding away come we will break bread together and you can tell me the news ofwhere did you say you have been the holy land said rognvald confidently ah yes the holy land bertrano led them to a small wattle and thatch hut across the way in the centre of what would one day become the monasterys cloisters there three monks had prepared a table for the archbishop at his approach the monks hastened to fetch the archbishops thronelike ecclesiastical chair from inside the hut this they placed at the head of the table the chair was highbacked and bore the image of an eagle on each armrest a fine cross was carved into the massive top rail gilded and surrounded by hemispheres of cut and polished jet the golden cross looked as if it were encircled by a string of shiny black pearls i had the workmen put up this hut so i might oversee the work archbishop bertrano said indicating the sturdy little house he gathered his robes and settled his bulk in the chair the monks drew the table up to his stomach and then darted back inside to begin serving the food you simply would not believe the morass of problems that require my attention he waved his guests to places on stools either side of the table rinsed his hands in a bowl of water offered by one of the monks and then wiped them on his robe eternal vigilance my friends is all that separates us from everlasting chaos i imagine it can be very taxing replied cait sympathetically just you try building a bell tower growled bertrano and then come and teach me about taxing cait stung by the remark felt her face growing red the archbishop gulped and smacked his forehead with his hand god help me i have done it again i beg your kind indulgence my lady please let us sit in contemplative silence i pray you until weve got something in us to dull hungers sharp edge the three sat quietly and presently the monks brought bread and boiled eggs sweetened wine and a porridge made from dried peas onions carrots and bits of salt cod oblivious to his visitors the archbishop fell to sopping up the pease porridge with chunks of bread which he sucked dry and then gobbled down pausing every now and then to peel an egg break off a bit of bread or take a gulp of wine before plunging in again cait and rognvald ate sparingly watching the archbishop for any sign that he deigned to notice them once more when after a third bowl of porridge and second cup of wine he appeared to be slowing his onslaught cait ventured a compliment on the food archbishop bertrano held up his hand for silence raised the bowl to his lips and drained it in a long greedy draught he wiped his mouth on the tablecloth sighed sat back in the great chair and beamed beatifically at his guests while flicking crumbs from his robe ah now you were saying the meal was delicious said cait the eggs were boiled to perfection we get a lot of eggs observed the archbishop the people bring them to the monastery god knows what they think we want with them but there you are turning to rognvald he said now then you say you have come from the holy land i think i have replied the knight pushing aside his bowl and i would the tidings were better there is much fighting as always and the crusaders win as often as they lose it is true but they lose all the wrong battles any battle lost opined the archbishop was a wrong battle i should have thought true enough agreed rognvald affably still the winnings do not cover the losses if you see what i mean everywhere territory falls to the muhammedans and the christians are once more subjugated and enslaved bertrano appeared disheartened by the news is jerusalem still safe it is for the time being but soon it will be merely a solitary rock in an ocean of islam it cannot last the norseman spoke with a sincerity that surprised cait she watched with growing admiration for his intelligence and subtlety as he drew the archbishop into their trap perditio perditio sighed the archbishop wagging his head sadly but tell me can nothing good be said the cities of the coasttripoli tyre acre jaffa ascalonall remain safe the arabs are masters of horse and desert but they are indifferent sailors thanks to the genoan and venetian fleets the saracens can make no advancement there so for as long as the ships can pass unhindered the coastal cities will remain in christian hands ah well that is something at least answered the archbishop contentedly he like cait regarded rognvald with a new admiration you speak like a commander perhaps you should be leading the armies of christ against the infernal hosts of the infidel the knight smiled but shook his head no i have seen enough of battle i want nothing more to do with itwith any of it for my troubles i spent nearly three years in a saracen prison and indeed i would still be there now if not for the love of my good lady wife he reached across the table to take caits hand she travelled all the way from our home in caithness to damascus and ransomed me from prince mujirs dungeon and for that i shall be eternally grateful to her he squeezed her hand and cait pretended a smile of wifely love which surprised her with its naturalness and ease no i shall not go back there again rognvald said but others were not so fortunate i saw many good men die in that stinking prisontoo many one of themand it grieves me full well to say itwas none other than the grand commander of the kingdom of jerusalem impossible cried archbishop bertrano it cannot be rognvald regarded the cleric with unflinching conviction alas it is all the more lamentable in fact it is because of his death that we have come the archbishop raised his eyebrows in mystified amazement pray tell me how this has come to be the tale is sorry but soon told replied the knight the commander arrived sorely woundedthere was a storm and his ship had foundered on the rocks somewhere between tripoli and tyre i think a great many men were drowned outright and as ill luck would have it the saracens who found them killed a number as well the few survivors were taken captive and brought to damascus he frowned as if remembering a tragedy they had fought valiantly to prevent themselves being captured as only a man of his courage and stature would offered the archbishop the battle was fierce as i say several were gravely injured commander de bracineaux foremost among them his wounds were too great he could not recover he lingered only a few days and then died i am grieved to the very soul to hear it sighed the archbishop jerusalem will not see a finer soldier and mores the pity so persuasive was the norsemans forthright tale that cait found herself feeling sorry for the plight of the poor templars and their mortally wounded master it is a very great loss she agreed her voice soft with sorrow i will say a special mass for them declared the archbishop and order a day of perpetual intercession on their behalf before the throne of grace he nodded absently to himself it is the least i can do the three were silent for a time and then the archbishop stirred himself and asked did he say anything before he died oh yes rognvald assured him as noblemen we were held in the same cell you can well imagine that the ransom price for such an important man is exceedingly largeas much as for a king the saracens were hopeful his release would earn them a fortune greedy dogs snarled the archbishop i would to heaven that god might rain unending calamity upon their unbelieving heads i truly do you will also appreciate knowing de bracineaux as you undoubtedly do that his last days were eaten up with anxiety lest the templars should hear of his capture and pay the money he thought the ransom excessive and worried that it would impoverish the order unnecessarily he said to me i pray i may die quickly and cheat the devils of their due he said he would not rest in peace if he knew the money paid for his release would be used to carry on the persecution of brave christian knights dumbstruck the archbishop leaned back in his chair and thumped his head gently against the carved rail of his chair even as he lay dying he said after a moment even then he took no thought for himself you know better than i the kind of man he was said rognvald with touching conviction that sir is the kind of man he was cried the archbishop his broad face suffused with a ruddy rapture noble through and through he told me something else rognvald confided leaning nearer his last days were difficult as you might expect talking however gave him some peace it comforted him to unburden his soul he leaned closer still as if he feared he might be overheard the archbishop bent his head nearer this is why we have come indeed wondered bertrano then tell me my son if it is a confession i will hear it the matter that most upset him concerned a letter a letter a special letter confirmed rognvald from you archbishop bertrano from me the cleric sat back and gazed at the knight in amazement in heavens name what can it mean are you certain this letter was from me rognvald nodded in solemn earnest he was very agitated about it said the knight towards the end he spoke of nothing else i think it pained him to leave his task undone and that is why he confided in me there was no one else you see he wanted me to carry on the work that he had begun bertrano grew thoughtful he gazed out towards the unfinished tower did he tell you what he had undertaken alas no answered the knight he made me swear upon my life and the life hereafter that if ever i was to receive my freedom i was to come to you archbishop bertrano and tell you what had happened he said that you would explain all i needed to know the knight spread his hands as if humbly offering himself for the churchmans inspection here i am great god in heaven cried the archbishop leaping to his feet and almost overturning the table in his effort to extricate himself from his chair no no both rognvald and cait drew back in alarm rognvald stood hands outstretched to calm the suddenly ferocious cleric cait astonished at the abrupt change in the archbishops demeanour jumped up and started after him furiously trying to think what the norwegian lord had said to so completely antagonize the archbishop as to send him fleeing from the table please she called wait archbishop bertrano threw her a hasty glance over his shoulder no it is all going wrong we meant no offence can we not return to our discussion not you the archbishop said the tower he thrust an angry finger before him cait looked where he was pointing and saw an oxdrawn sledge loaded with stone the driver was tossing the rough blocks on to a heap of freshcut stone come to me after vespers we will dine together and i will tell you everything i must go he raced on shouting you there stop desist i say or i shall excommunicate you at once chapter fifteen i confess i find it difficult to believe archbishop bertrano was saying he looked from cait to rognvald and shook his head that a man like de bracineaux should be cut down so cruelly i am sorry it is most untimely and it saddens me greatly nor are you alone in your grief offered cait sympathetically i have only recently lost my father accept my deepest condolences my child said the archbishop more wine he reached for the silver jar and filled all three cups beginning with his own he took a long draught and wiping his mouth on his sleeve said now then i have been thinking about this letter you have mentioned it can only be the letter i wrote and dispatched to the pope some time ago did the commander tell you what this letter contained only that it was a matter of highest and utmost importance offered rognvald i think he feared revealing too much lest our captors somehow discover the secret in that he showed the wisdom that made him such a formidable leader of men the archbishop took another drink and laid the cup aside he fixed his visitors with a stern and cautious stare are you certain he said nothing more about the contents of the letter by my faith no my lord archbishop answered rognvald truthfully he breathed not a word to me the table around which the three were gathered was large round and splendidly made of polished oak it nearly filled the chamber before them was sweetened wine in a large silver flagon and a platter of ripe figs although modest the room bordered a walled garden and for this reason the archbishop often used it to welcome his more intimate guests sparrows returning to the roost twitched and twittered in the branches of the orange trees outside adding to the heightened anticipation for cait well you have said it for it is indeed a matter of utmost and highest importance the churchman continued and now that i know my message has gone astray as it were i shall send to the pope to inform him of the tragedy cait swallowed hard did he mean to tell them nothing after all before she could think how best to proceed rognvald nodding sympathetically said no doubt that would be best it was all cait could do to stifle a scream of frustration she took a drink from her cup to hide her aggravation then it is settled bertrano concluded happily i shall write to the pope at once and send it by swift courier rognvald smiled diffidently and cait narrowed her eyes at him over the rim of her cup silently urging him to speak up before it was too late the templars will be choosing a new master of jerusalem soon enough i expect the knight replied we can but pray it will be someone who shares de bracineauxs integrity and zeal he paused then added i tremble to think what would happen if the reward of your hard work was to be usurped by an emperorloving judas but what do you mean wondered the archbishop a crease of worry appearing on his brow just that said rognvald nothing more do you think there might be a chance that could happen rognvald shrugged i should not like to say come now sir stormed the archbishop striking the tabletop with a fist if you know something you must tell me i fear i have said too much already rognvald raised his hands in surrender i beg you do not force me for i would not like it to be thought that i slandered another mans name in truth it is none of my concern and i will say no more no sir blurted bertrano growing agitated that will not do at all i must know if my purpose is likely to go astray i assure you my lord archbishop answered rognvald a little stiffly i have told you all that can be said he appeared about to say something further but thought better of it and closed his mouth instead the archbishop saw his hesitation and pounced on it ah you do know something he crowed tell me my son keep nothing back i am a priest remember with me all confessions are sacred it was only a thought began rognvald he turned to cait as if seeking her approval go on my darling she urged him sweetly let us hold nothing secret from this honest and upright churchman the archbishop gazed at him benevolently his features warmed by the wine to a fine mellow glow arranged themselves in an expression of compassionate understanding it is for the good of all the archbishop intoned in his best confessional voice allow me to hear your thoughts and we will decide what to do let it be as you say said rognvald as if relieved to have the thorny decision behind him here is the nub it occurred to me that there might be a way to ensure the harmony and shall we say the original integrity of the enterprise so cruelly curtailed by the saracens yes go on urged bertrano i am listening if you agree i might fulfil that certain task which troubled his last days and which death forced him to abandon the archbishop shook his head in sorrow over the sad plight of the suffering templars troublefilled last days in short rognvald continued i could serve in de bracineauxs place before the churchman could respond to this rognvald turned to cait stretched out his hand and took hers saying i am sorry my love i know i should have discussed it with you but the notion just occurred to me the cleric gazed at the knight thoughtfully and then with a clap of his hands declared i am liking this continue it seemed to me that a letter even by swiftest courier would take several months to reach the templarsif it should reach jerusalem at all it could so easily go astray and fall into the wrong hands too true agreed archbishop bertrano i feared as much with the first epistle but if you were to act for me in this it would hasten our undertaking to a favourable outcome am i to have nothing to say in this matter cait said adopting the manner of a neglected and muchputupon wife turning to the churchman she said you must forgive me archbishop if i find the prospect of losing my husband less than agreeable he was three years in prison she lowered her eyes modestly and i have only just got him back i can but apologize my love answered rognvald and beg your pardon to the archbishop he said my wife is right i pray you will excuse me and release me from the duty i have so rashly proposed the trusting cleric distressed to see the perfect solution to his dilemma receding as swiftly as it had presented itself raised his hands in a fatherly gesture of mediation peace dear friends let us not make any hasty decisions we will soon regret i am certain there is nothing to prevent us proceeding along a harmonious and dare i say mutually beneficial path to cait he said my dear i can well understand your reluctance in this regard but once you learn the nature of the prize before us you will understand moreover you will embrace our purpose with a zeal you cannot now imagine cait regarded the cleric doubtfully since you put it that way she allowed none too certainly perhaps you had better tell me about this prize whatever it might be oh my lady it is not to be spoken of lightly said bertrano growing earnest for it is a wonder long concealed from the world but pleasing god to reveal in our time to further the glorious conquest of his blessed son over the heathen infidel he raised his cup and gulped down more wine as if fortifying himself for what he was about to divulge delicately wiping his mouth on his sleeve once more he leaned forward in an attitude of clandestine solemnity cait and rognvald drew nearer too the rose of mystic virtue he announced savouring the words eyes shining with excitement he looked from one to the other of his guests and seeing the uncomprehending expressions exclaimed here does the name mean nothing to you upon my word it does not cait confessed beguiling in her innocence what does it betoken the holiest most worshipful object that ever was known declared the archbishop it is nothing less than the very cup used by our lord and saviour in the holy communion of the last supper yes caits heart quickened at last oh and what a rare treasure indeed beyond price to be sure the treasure of the ages she thought remembering the description on the parchment our very real and manifest hope for this present age and the kingdom to come it was all she could do to keep from laughing out loud for the sheer joy of having discovered the secret oh yes she thought this is what i have been catted to do like my father and grandfather before me i am to seek a prize worth kingdoms adopting a more solemn tone she said but how do you know i mean no disrespect my lord archbishop but it has been lost a very long time as you have said forgive my asking but how does anyone know it is the selfsame cup it is a fair question allowed bertrano and one i did not hesitate to ask myself but the good brother who brought this discovery to my attention is stalwart and trustworthy i have known him for many years as a priest of unquestionable faith and character furthermore he is most adamant about the provenance of the holy relic in fact it was his revelation that prompted my letter to the pope you see ever since the reconquest began the moors have been pushed slowly but steadily further and further south and east many of the moors who used to live on the plains and in the valleys have fled to the hills and mountains to escape the kings relentless pursuit thus unless its loss can be prevented it is only a matter of time before the most sacred and holy relic ever known falls into the hands of the infidel i understand replied rognvald thoughtfully then the pope must have passed the letter on to master de bracineaux who else asked the archbishop no doubt the pope entrusted the task of recovering the holy relic to the templars it follows since the commander would be charged with guarding this inestimable treasure once it has been returned to its proper position as the centrepiece of our faith indeed that to my mind will be the most difficult partprotecting it from the saracens heathens pagans and greeks who would undoubtedly try to steal it so as to mock our glorious salvation do you know where it is cait asked unable to keep the tremble of excitement out of her voice no archbishop bertrano shook his head and i do not wish to know owing to brother matthias careful directions however it should be easy enough to find the directionswere they in the letter said cait thinking of the obscure text she had not been able to read again the archbishop shook his head he reached for the flagon and refilled his cup no hie said between gulps of wine i did not think it wise to trust information of such importance to a mere letter he lowered his cup and smiled with sly satisfaction instead i told the pope where to find brother matthias the good brother knows where the cup is to be found and i wrote the directions in a secret language cait was about to ask the nature of this secret language but rognvald spoke first very wise he agreed you seem to have thought of everything he poured himself more wine and filled caitrionas cup as well but now everything has changed if we are to help protect the mystic rose then we will need to know where to find brother matthias in time my impatient friend replied the churchman all in good time first you must find fearless and trustworthy men to help you from the little matthias has related i believe the sacred cup resides in aragon far awayin the mountains somewhere if i am not mistaken and there are a great many saracens between here and there you will need troops rognvald slapped the table with the flat of his hand ask and it shall be given he declared jubilantly as it happens i have men with me countrymen who were imprisoned with me in damascus they are sworn liegemen tried and true i trust them with my life the archbishop raised his hands in benedictory praise truly you have been sent by god himself for this very purpose turning to cait he said my lady you can no longer have any objection to your noble husband pursuing this enterprise it is blessed and ordained by the lord god himself and heaven stands ready to pour out grace and honour and glory upon any who undertake this service rognvald regarded cait with the look of a loving husband what say you dear heart will you allow it at the knights use of the intimate termthe one her father had so often used in their talk togetherher throat tightened and it was a moment before she could answer yes she replied at last gazing at rognvald with genuine admiration i will allow it how could i a mere woman stand against heavens decree chapter sixteen having taken their leave of archbishop bertrano cait and rognvald stood up from the table and walked through the dark and quiet streets of compostela alone save for occasional roisterers whose loud singing echoed from the walls and galleries round about they had the city to themselves respectable townsfolk were asleep in their beds lying to an archbishop now rognvald said shaking his head in mock remorse that is a very low thing de bracineaux dead in prison remarked cait if i had my way he would be she regarded the tall knight with a new appreciation wherever did you think of that i confess when i heard you say it i thought you had taken leave of your senses i know we agreed that we should pretend the pope had commissioned us to look into the matter on his behalf but that did not sit well with me it raised more questions than it answered you might have warned me she said her tone more irritable than she felt in truth i did not think of it until i said it well it all came right in the end she allowed what is more it was a better tale by far indeed you told it with such conviction i began to believe it myself thank you my lady said rognvald pleased to have earned her guarded praise god willing she added we will be far away from here before anyone learns otherwise they walked the rest of the way in silence listening to the roisterers and the crickets chirruping in the long grass beside the walls upon reaching the inn they found the doors barred and locked but rognvalds insistent rapping on the door eventually roused the disgruntled landlord who took his time letting them in caitriona enraptured with their triumph and exhilarated by bertranos revelations lay down on her bed and tried to compose her mind it was no use her thoughts whirled with gleaming images of the wonderful treasure waiting for her the mystic rose chalice of christeven the sound of the words on her lips made her feel quivery inside with an almost unbearable excitement the most holy object in the world and she herself alone had been given the task of finding it and protecting it oh but that was not all far from it for once she had the sacred relic in her possession she could use it to lure renaud de bracineaux to his richly deserved doom her thoughts teemed with ways to bring about his demise time and again she brought his fleshy greybearded face before her minds eye and imagined his astonished expression as the realization broke upon him that he had been bested by the daughter of the man he had so rashly thoughtlessly viciously murdered just how and where this fateful meeting would take place she could not determine but time and again she imagined the moment when cold implacable justice would find its fulfilment swiftly and without warning the dagger clasped tight in her hand she would strike the narrow blade would enter his gutjust as his own knife had pierced her beloved fathers sideand de bracineauxs imposing bulk would crumple to the floor as he lay dying she would stand over him and watch the light of recognition come up in his eyes only to fade as his lifeblood spilled out in a slowly deepening crimson pool but perhaps this was not punishment enough perhaps she would force him to confess his crime and beg for his life she could see him stripped of his robes of office humbled on his knees holding up his hands to her beseeching wailing pleading for mercybefore she slit his throat like a hog at the slaughter she lay for a while savouring the sweet hot tang of revenge lord she prayed the blood of a good man cries out to be avenged you whose judgement against the wicked is everlasting make me the instrument of your vengeance and then as the grey dawns light began seeping in under her door she decided to wake rognvald they could be on the road by sunrise and back in iria and under sail by evening with favourable weather they could be in bilbao in a few days and from there it was an easy ride to vitoria where the archbishop had told them they would find brother matthias what if the templars reach this brother matthias first asked rognvald once they were on the road again i cannot see how that is possible replied caitriona smugly we have the letter and we know where matthias is to be foundde bracineaux does not no i wonder mused rognvald he must have read the letter if he read it then he knows enough to find the monk to lead him to the treasure bertrano said the directions were in a secret language protested cait her confidence beginning to erode secret to us perhaps but not to the pope and perhaps not to the templars rognvald was silent for a time then said i think we must assume the templars are searching for the treasure as diligently as we ourselves they may even find it before we do they will not find it first declared cait can you be so certain thanks to rognvald a dark cloud of doubt dogged the return to iria and cait begrudged every moment spent on the trail by the time they arrived back at the ship she was anxious to set sail immediately but those who had remained behind had first to be collected from the town the knights were easy to locatea search of the waterfront inns brought them from their cupsbut abu and alethea were more difficult to find by the time she spotted them caits anxiety had long since boiled over into desperation she heard a laugh that brought her up short it was alethea no mistake and cait glanced quickly around to see her sister strolling across the town square with abu sharma at her side they were talking and thea was laughing and swinging a cloth parcel the mere sight of the two of them together and caits anger flared to white heat what in heavens name are you doing she demanded flying at the two young people alethea smiling oblivious to her sisters rage glanced at abu and laughed again oh cait you have to hear this tell her abu tell her about the spitting monkey you saw in damascus the young man more mindful of the elder sisters mood wisely declined another time perhaps he said the smile evaporating from his face oh please abu insisted alethea blithely tell her you will like it cait it will make you laugh she glared at her sister i do not want to hear it she replied her voice flat with menace whats wrong with yousit on a bee quipped alethea cait turned on abu leave us get back to the ship at once sharifah he ducked his head in a hurried bow and swiftly removed himself from the vicinity taking her sisters arm cait marched the complaining alethea to a deserted corner of the nearempty square must you always humiliate us me gasped alethea what did i do anyway you are the one always causing trouble all the time he is an infidell cait hissed can you understand that who demanded the younger woman i have no idea what youre talking about abu spat cait you cannot be seen going around with him like that it is disgraceful i forbid you to be seen with him you forbid me thea charged her voice going shrill with indignation you are not my mother and father no snapped cait father is dead and your mother is a world away like it or not you answer to me i will not have you behaving like a lowborn slut abu is friendly countered thea weakly she was beginning to wither under the lash of her sisters fury i like him he is kind to me and he makes me laugh he is a muhammedan caits voice was a stinging slap in her sisters face he is also a servant and i will not have you consorting with him in public who else have i to talk to thea moaned tears starting to her eyes you are always rushing about and the knights only care about drinking and fighting they do not said cait and anyway what they do is none of your concern she took aletheas arm and squeezed hard now you listen to me you are a lady of a noble family and you are to keep yourself chaste and above reproach abu is impertinent and brazen enough as it is without you encouraging him he is not a muhammedan alethea insisted her lip beginning to tremble as the tears started he is a druzewhich is a kind of christian he told me he could be the patriarch of constantinople for all i care cait snarled he is still a servant and you are not to have anything more to do with him she glared hard at the sniffing unhappy alethea do you understand her sister nodded and pushed the tears away with the heels of her hands very well said cait softening at last you have made a poor beginning but that is no reason you cannot amend your manner and conduct see that you do they walked back to the waterfront and boarded the ship owing to the delay it was well after midday when persephone slid from her mooring and out into the river with gines help however they reached the headlands as the sun began its downward plunge to the sea rather than look for a place to berth for the night cait ordered haemur to sail on and they reached deep water as the sun dipped below the horizon we dare not go further my lady haemur said it will be dark soon gines says there will be a full moon tonight cait countered that is as may be allowed the pilot but the waters hereabouts are dangerous we should drop anchor in the next cove and start as soon as it is light cait hesitated the wind was fair and the weather mild with a good moon they could be well up the coast by morning haemur is right said rognvald who had been listening to the exchange full moon or no it would be foolhardy to try the rocks at night pay the fisherman to stay on and he can show us the fastest way to bilbao much to haemurs relief cait relented and gave orders to drop anchor for the night with a promise of double payment she induced gines to stay aboard and lead them to bilbao and at first light next morning he and haemur began the long and tedious process of picking their way among the great rocks and tiny islands strung out along the galician coast like so many shards of broken crockery two days later they rounded the protruding northwestern hump of the iberian peninsula and entered the great sweeping expanse of the bay of vizcaya each day they watched the tiny fishing villages of the coast passing one by one in slow and stately procession glistening white against the earthy greens and browns of the cantabrian mountains rising behind them like a dull swathe of wrinkled cloth the sea remained calm allowing haemur to sail by night once cait awoke at midnight and wanting some air went up on deck to find lord rognvald at the helm taking a turn to rest the old pilot who was asleep on a nearby bench she watched the tall knight for a moment before going back to her bed without a word seven days after leaving iria they came in sight of the port there it is gines informed them that is bilbao cait and alethea looked where the old seaman was pointing beyond the clusters of crude fishing huts scattered along the coast they saw a dark smudge of smoke hanging above the low hills divided by the deepchannelled river not much of a city concluded alethea dismissing it with a disdainful sniff perhaps not allowed the galician but it is the gate through which you must pass a short time later they sailed into the cupshaped bay of the nervion river estuary and proceeded to work their way along the wide slowflowing channel to bilbao as at iria they hired horses for the ride to vitoria this time cait paid for enough mounts for all to go save the four sailors who stayed behind to watch the ship it cost a great deal for so many horses but alethea obviously needed watching and she did not like the idea of leaving the knights behind to waste their days in the alehouses of bilbao and abus usefulness as a translator along with whatever rudimentary skills as a physician he possessed argued for his inclusion i do not know how long we shall be away cait told haemur god willing it will only be a few days or so but it may be longer take all the time you need the old pilot told her it matters not a whit to me as i told your father my lady never fear though the lord return and sound the heavenly trumpet to call the faithful home to paradise you will find old haemur here and waiting still thank you haemur cait replied even so should we be gone longer than i expect i am leaving enough money to keep the ship in harbourage and for any provisions you will need and she added you know where duncans sea chest is kept if ill befalls and you need more worry not the old seaman replied in a lively harbour such as this there are always nets to be mended and hulls to caulk if our hands keep busy we should not want for anything there is just one small matter however yes gines was hoping to stay on with us awhile if you have no objection i have no objection whatsoever he has given us good service and i am grateful she nodded to the galician fisherman who was standing quietly aside looking on if he wishes to stay so be it thank you my lady said the pilot with some relief in a place like this it helps to have a friend who can speak the tongue of his countrymen if you know what i mean i understand he can also help you keep the young men out of trouble that he can my lady caitriona bade him farewell and then took her leave of olvir and ottithe latter of whom was not at all happy to be left cooling his heels in port while the others rode away otti cait said who will guard the ship if not you he tried to think of some way to dispute this fact but could not rise to the challenge but you will need me too he insisted i do need you it is true she said gently i need you here otti she rested her hand lightly on his arm in confidence the others are not as strong as you and if any trouble should arise you must protect them and guard the ship feeling that he was failing to persuade her he lowered his head in sullen defeat listen to me otti she said i am counting on you to look after the others when she saw that he understood she added now then i have left haemur a little money for ale for you and olvir if you do well he will give it to you at the realization that she had made provision for him and olvir that they were not to be forgotten in her absence ottis face lit with simple pleasure he accepted this compromise happily and cait joined the others at the end of the wharf to begin the ride to vitoria accompanied by the hostler who for a small additional fee had agreed to be their guide so as she climbed into the saddle cait took a quick mental inventory of her company first came the hostler a short stocky man named miguel a pleasant fellow with a ready if somewhat toothless smilehe had been kicked by a horse and was missing both upper and lower front teeth he rode a hinny and led a pack mule bearing equipment and supplies for the camp following the hostler were yngvar and svein who had tied long strips of blue cloth to the heads of the lances they carried the improvised pennons fluttered in the light breeze alethea hair gathered beneath a lowcrowned green hat with a veil to keep the sun from her face had managed to make her place beside dag who cait noticed had lately begun to reciprocate her sisters undisguised interest next came rognvald tall and upright in the saddle a widebrimmed leather hat high on his head the sleeves of his shirt rolled to his elbows the knights all had shields slung upon their backs and swords at their sides cait dressed in a simple red shift and mantle her dark hair swept back and held in place by small silver combs beneath her hat carried the sword rognvald had given her its gleaming slender length sheathed for protection of blade and rider both svein and dag led pack animals carrying the rest of the armour and weapons and abu his face all but hidden beneath a large straw hat brought up the rear leading two more mules laden with provisions provender and drinking water for the journey freshly shaved and dressed in the clothes she had bought for them in cyprus their weapons gleaming in the strong sunlight cait thought her knights a fine and handsome sight as she took her place beside rognvald she was filled with a sudden and unanticipated joy and a sense of righteous certainty almost inevitabilitythat her feet were established on a path which had been prepared for her long ago she was where she was meant to be and doing what she had been born to do tightening the scarf holding her pale yellow widebrimmed hat she raised a hand to show that she was ready the hostler cracked his whip and the company set off chapter seventeen the road was good and the sun hot the company travelled quickly passing through numerous settlements of the deep river valley at several of these the sky darkened and they smelled the sharp stench of sulphurous smoke black ash rained out of the air and they saw heaps of spent slag darkening the hillsides the river turned an ugly rusty colour and barges loaded with pigs of rough iron floated slowly towards the harbour they soon left the last of the ironworking settlements behind and the sky became clear and the air clean once more despite their long absence from the saddle the knights rode easily and lightly talking and joking as they went along and making the hills echo with the sound of their banter cait liked hearing them it confirmed in her the feeling that she had done well to save them and give them back their lives that first day they rode as long into the evening as they could and then made a simple camp grass sleepingmats arranged around a stoneringed fire with the starflecked sky for a roof over their heads they were on the move again as soon as light permitted the next morning and the second day passed like the first the only difference they noticed was that the settlements were smaller and further apart on the third day the hostler pointed out a tiny projection rising like a dark sliver from a distant hill that is the bell tower of the church of vitoria he told them the rest of the day they watched the tower slowly grow as they came nearer they also began to smell a foul odour as they approached for the town was supplied with no fewer than three tanneries which used water from the streams to wash the hides and dumped the scraped offal and waste in the water to be carried away downstream the heat of the sun raised a stink that could be smelled for a great distance around which the party did its best to ignore it was only when they reached the town square that they gained some respite from the smell the tower stood on one side of the square attached to it was a church which was connected to a monastery where according to archbishop bertrano they would find brother matthias cait slid down from the saddle and dropped the reins on the dusty ground rognvald come with me the rest of you wait here she said and went straight to the monastery gate and presented herself to the porter he listened politely and then conducted her and rognvald to the friar brother matthias is not here said the cleanshaven friar who met them outside the chapel he was hereearlier this spring for a time but he is gone now gone wondered cait as if trying to think what the word could mean frustration sharp as despair arrowed through her gone the friar confirmed i am sorry good day to you caitriona stared at the insipid smiling cleric and thought of all the time and effortnot to mention expenseshe had employed just to get this far only to be told by some fool of a priest that her pains had been for nothing it took a moment before she could trust her voice to speak i would thank you to tell me where we might find him she said masking her acute disappointment with a smile we have journeyed a very long way to see him it makes no matter how far you have travelled replied the friar carelessly he is not here and that is that now if there is nothing else i have duties elsewhere he made to leave but rognvald reached out a hand and took hold of his brown robe bunching it in his fist and holding the monk firmly in his place perhaps the knight suggested your duties are not so pressing that you could reconsider the ladys question with the courtesy it deserves the friar spluttered indignantly he gaped at the knight saw that he was in earnest and blurted oh very well he is at palencia if you must know this palencia said rognvald releasing the priest is it far the friar smoothed his robes and glared at his assailant it is neither near nor far neither near nor far repeated cait her brow lowering is that what passes for an answer in this festering stinkpot of a town or are you more of an idiot than you appear it is a middle distance i would say sniffed the friar satisfied rognvald raised his hand and the friar quickly added i have never been there ask in the townone of the merchants will tell you one would think information more valuable than gold the way you hoard it cait replied her anger beginning to simmer tell me miserly friar when was the last time you gave a generous answer to a friendly question as the friar huffed and puffed she added it is as i thoughtyou cannot even remember cait turned abruptly and started away rognvald fell into step beside her they had walked but four paces when the priest called after them you are not thinking of going to palencia we are cait replied she halted and turned around regarding the cleric suspiciously why it is not allowed the friar informed them allowing himself a grimace of satisfaction the king has forbidden anyone to travel there and why i pray you is that demanded cait moving closer before the friar could reply she held up her hand no do not tell me for i am keen to guess let me see i know the road has been scrubbed and put away for safekeeping she took another step closer no then how about this the king is annoyed with palencia and wishes to punish it by denying it any visitors she took another step closer no what then is the sky the wrong colour or perhaps the moon makes all the citizens mad she was now face to face with the priest once more well which is it realizing he was once more on precarious ground the friar quickly explained that alas king alfonso vii had died last year and his son alfonso viii was king now until the king can reestablish order the monk told them all roads to the south and east remain under control of the muhammedans and bandits who prey on pilgrims and merchants i travel with my own army cait replied a fearsome frown bending the corners of her mouth the bandits will not trouble us then i wish you godspeed the monk replied blandly some of his former insolence returning only you must first obtain a writ of passage from the king i cannot tell if you are more fool than knave replied cait darkly or whether it is the other way around but if you value your ears explain the writ can be had for the payment of a small taxthat is all i know very well said rognvald we will go and see the king and obtain this writ i do not think it will do any good the friar offered the king sees no one but his mother and her attendants why cait asked her frown deepening dangerously is he ill ill by no means my lady the priest shrank from her threatening glare god keep him he is in the best of health but he is only three years old agh shrieked cait this is absurd we are going to palencia with or without your mewling infant monarchs blessing she turned on her heel and stormed away stupid man rognvald caught up with her a few paces down the street i will go and speak to the magistrate and see what he advises he offered if you like you could wait with the others in the square go then cait agreed and rognvald hurried off in the direction of the towns civic halla blocky fortress surrounded by a high wall of red stone and a shallow dry moat cait walked slowly back to the square which was now all but deserted most of the townspeople had gone to their homes to escape the heat of the day leaving only a few stragglers and gossips behind the latter were standing in the centre of the square holding forth with several idle tradesmen she found the rest of her party readily enough a tall market cross stood in the centre of the square above the great round stone basin of a fountain the knights abu and alethea were sitting around the base of the cross beside the fountain watching the hostler water his horses and pack mules in the basin cait joined them and sat down in the shade at the base of the cross to wait it was passing midday most of the market stalls had closed already and in the rest the merchants were dozing on their stools an air of drowsy contentment hung like a gauzy curtain over the square cait leaned back against the cool stone and took a deep calming breath she closed her eyes and listened to the droning of the knights voices as they talked you are sadly wrong svein yngvar was saying the romans were never in this place it was the goths victoriacum replied svein knowingly does that sound like a goth name to you maybe the goths spoke latin countered yngvar did you ever think of that maybe you are not as clever as you think replied svein did you ever think of that here now dag what say you is it roman this place or goth who cares answered dag they are not here nowi am oh yes said yngvar that is something one day people will find this place and say dag the conqueror was here i tell you it was goths eyes closed in the cooling shade cait felt her steaming frustration slowly give way to the soothing air of the place the ransomed knights were she reflected much stronger now and becoming more themselves with every passing day if nothing else the long sea journey had been restorative allowing them to recover their strength as the good food and air and water healed their hurting spirits whatever awaited them on the road ahead they would she felt be ready to meet it abu however was rapidly becoming an unwanted problem since the confrontation in iria he had grown increasingly truculent allowing him to join them had been a mistake there was no denying it with every mile further from the holy land his usefulness dwindled that much more and unless she could think of something for him to do he would soon be far more trouble than he was worth she was just thinking it might be best to send him back to bilbao with the hostler when she heard rognvald hail them from across the square cait opened her eyes and saw the tall knight striding towards them he paused to lave water over his head and face before turning to her i have no good news my lady he said his face and hair dripping i was able to speak to the magistrate who confirmed that a writ must be obtained however he refused to help us he said that he could not allow us to travel until the bandits had been eradicated and the roads secured once more it seems the archbishop of castile has requested the formation of a holy order of knights to guard the roadsthe knights of calatrava he called them they have sent an embassy to rome to secure the churchs authorization but that could take months yngvar pointed out if not years said svein too true agreed rognvald but until the new order receives the blessing of the pope the magistrate insists no one is to be allowed to use the roads if we cannot secure the kings permission we will simply go without it even that may not be so easy rognvald went on to explain for without the writ none of the tradesmen in this place will sell to us they risk confiscation of their goods and perhaps imprisonment into the bargain cait unable to fathom the idiocy of the spanish authorities was not of a mood to comply good she stood making up her mind at once i want nothing more to do with this flyblown dirt clod of a town anyway the others sat looking on to your horses she told them we go on to palencia chapter eighteen despite the extravagant protestations of the ostler who received the rumour of bandits with cait thought exaggerated emotion he nevertheless seemed happy enough to permit the company to purchase his animals seven horses and five pack mules he said tapping the side of his nose thoughtfully i could let you have them for his eyes narrowed as he calculated the figure five gold marks each for the horses and one for each muleforty gold marks in all he proclaimed triumphantly a moment said cait and summoned abu who seemed to know the trade value of everything he says forty gold markswhat do you think not a bad price granted abu but not a good one the horses are in good condition rognvald said stepping near but one is blind in one eye and two of them will need shoeing soon i cannot say about the mules they are fair said abu for mules offer him thirty do you have that much left asked rognvald she nodded and turned back to the ostler master miguel said cait reasonably you have us at your mercy we need the animals in order to continue and there is no one else who can sell to us she removed the coin bag from beneath her girdle and untied it therefore i will give you thirty gold coins my lady replied miguel with his toothless grin and shaking his head if it was my decision alone i would do it but i have a wife and children to feed and without my animals i cannot earn my crust forty gold marks please since you put it that way i will give you what you ask she said but before he could reply she raised an admonitory finger but i make one condition yes the eagerness faded from the ostlers face as you know we will be returning to bilbao where the ship is waiting therefore once our business is completed and we have no further use for the horses we will sell them back to you for say she glanced at abu who showed three fingers thirty gold marks agreed twentyfive gold marks countered miguel done cait counted the gold coins into the ostlers hands and bade him farewell by way of thanks master miguel accompanied them a fair distance from the town to see them well on their way to palencia before turning back to make his way home the ride through the long lush nervion valley proved peaceful and wholly agreeable never did they see any sign of the fearful bandits the countryside appeared quiet and serene as the last of the fierce summers heat dissipated leaving behind a beautiful mellow autumn which settled over the countryside like a warm comfortable cloak apart from a few sudden showers which sent the party galloping for the shelter of overhanging chestnut boughs the days remained bright and clear occasionally they awoke to a crisp nip to the morning air which cait found both refreshing and exhilarating but for the most part the days remained warm from early morning to well after dark every now and then cait would look up from her solitary meditations to discover a silent partner beside her sometimes abu or one of the knights but more often lord rognvald he seemed content merely to ride with her never speaking until she invited his conversation which she usually did and in this way cait began to discover the depths of the man she had redeemed from a slow death in a muhammedan prison what is it like where you were born she asked him one day the morning air was cool and the sun warm on her face the leaves on the birch and ash trees were just beginning to turn and she felt like talking rognvald cocked his head to one side and looked at her with a quizzical expression my home he said after a moment or the place where i was born most people are born at home she said were you not my home is in haukeland near bjrgvin in the south but i was born at kaupangr where olav the holy is buried it is a most sacred place and a great many people make pilgrimages there my mother was a very devout lady your mother was on pilgrimage at the time of your birth cait assumed curiously delighted by the notion in truth replied rognvald shaking his head no he smiled and cait caught the cheerful gleam of his eyes blue as the cloudscoured spanish skies above as he said you see the king also had hunting lodges there and he would invite noblemen to come hunting with him it came about that my father was summoned to attend one of the kings great winter hunts well one of the old vassalsa wise woman with uncanny powershad foretold bad luck for a winter birth and that doubled for a child without a father my mother took this to heart so naturally my father was loath to leave her alone naturally echoed cait staunch in her conviction that childbirth ought to take precedence over trivialities like hunting yet even so the hunt was to take place during the yuletide celebrations and fortunate indeed were those allowed to observe the christ mass with the kinga rare and singular honour and one not to be spurned for otherwise it would certainly never come again so my father did what anyone in his position would do heaven forbid it said cait he took their bed from the house and lashed it to the deck of his ship and covered it with a tent then he wrapped my mother warm in his huge bearskin cloak tucked her safely in bed and sailed off to kaupangr to visit the king cait laughed out loud her voice falling rich and warm on the leafcovered trail rognvald thrilled to hear it and several of the others riding along behind raised their heads and smiled so you were born at the kings hunting lodge she guessed again the knight shook his head my mother would not endure the noiseall the shouting and singing you know when men hunt they get thirsty and king magnus was never one to stint on anything his was sweet and dark and good and served in foaming vats that never were allowed to run dry the noblemen and warriors feasted and revelled every night with the same zeal as they pursued the harts and hinds by day this made the lodge a very clamorous place king magnus you say king magnus was a cousin of my father he said in the same way king eystein is now my cousin is now wondered cait was he not always your cousin no explained rognvald he was not always the king cait laughed again and they rode on happy in one anothers company the knight related how his mother having refused the kings boisterous hospitality was lodged instead at the nearby convent and that was where i was born he told her two days after the christ mass i am told the queen herself attended my birth and presented me to my mother so perhaps my birth was not so unlucky after all indeed not murmured cait she grew silent thinking about the strangeness of life and its many unexpected turns after a time rognvald turned in the saddle and asked something i have said has made you thoughtful i see i was just thinking that if not for king magnus you and i would not be riding together at this very moment then he is a far greater king than i imagined i must remember to lay a gift at his shrine and thank him for his fortuitous assistance he looked sideways at her and asked but how do you reckon we owe our meeting to magnus it was magnus who befriended my grandfather she told him and went on to recount how it was that murdo had come to follow his father and brothers on the great pilgrimage travelling on a ship in the hire of the king we lost our lands in orkney she told him but the king was just he gave us caithness instead that was very good of him replied rognvald approvingly he must have liked your grandfather very much well cait allowed it was mostly the kings fault we lost the land in the first place it was the least he could do no laughed rognvald suddenly it was never that you must not know many kings he regarded her trim and comely in the saddle her cloak falling low on her shouldersfor all it was a warm dayand her dark hair neat beneath her silver combs do you like caithness or would you rather have orkney my grandfather might feel differently i cannot say but caithness is home to me i have never known any other my family owns an estate on one of the orkneyjar islands the knight confided they tell me i visited there once with my family but i cannot even remember which island it was they talked amiably passing the time as they rode along each enjoying the easy companionship of the otheruntil alethea grew bored riding by herself and decided to join them whereupon the pleasant mutual feeling gradually shrivelled under aletheas irritating whining about the heat the dullness of the countryside the sun in her eyes how thirsty she was how rough the saddle and how disagreeable her mount i cannot see why we have to ride anyway she complained you should have bought a carriage instead and then we could travel like queens if only everything was that easy three days after entering the valle de mena they came to the walled trading town of burgos paused briefly to replenish their provisions and then set off again before anyone made bold to stop them four days after that they arrived at palencia the town had faded somewhat from its glory under the roman legion of lucus augusti the crumbling garrison still stood having served several generations of muhammedan rulers as a stable and armoury it was now a monastery in sore need of a new roof the old roman walls remained in good repair however and protected the town and its inhabitants from the moorish raiders infesting the hills preying on the foolish and unwary owing to the kings ban on travel the local farmers and merchants were effectively cut off from their trading partners to the west consequently they seized on the newcomers arrival with an interest that far exceeded the significance of their visit as cait and her entourage dismounted in the town square one of the onlookers ran to inform the magistrate that important visitors had arrived the magistrate and his young assistant came on the run to offer an official welcome the towns governor was a smoothshaven man with a frizzled fringe of dark hair which he tried to keep under a red cap shaped like a deeply notched bowl pushing the eager townsfolk aside he cleared a place for himself in the crowd and then addressed the visitors most noble lady he began bestowing on cait the sort of bow usually reserved for royalty friends travellers allow me to introduce myself i am carlo de la coruna magistrate and governor of this fine and prosperous town his deputy smiled and bowed too in anticipation of being introduced to the handsome noblewomen and their broadshouldered fearsome entourage but his superior ploughed ahead without so much as a wink in his direction on behalf of the worthy citizens of palencia the magistrate announced i welcome you and your excellent company furthermore i invite you all to be our special guests at a feast to be held in your honour tonight please rest and take your ease while you are here be assured we will do all we can to assist you in every possible way for as long as you care to remain with us cait thanked him kindly and said that she and her travelling companions would be delighted to attend the feast and asked whether there might be a convenient moment for herself and the magistrate to discuss matters privately as it happens a few small concerns have arisen i would be grateful for your counsel magistrate coruna i am certain they will pose no difficulty for a man of your obvious wisdom and authority the magistrates cheeks took on a rosy glow under caits wellaimed flattery he ducked his head in hasty assent and said with pleasure my lady if you would deign to join me in the courtyard of my house during sixta we might discuss your concerns over a cooling drink cait smiled but hesitated spending the rest of the day with the obliging bumpkin of a magistrate might have its uses but foremost among her concerns was locating the priest called brother matthias lord rognvald saw her hesitation however and leaning close confided go and see if you can charm him into getting us a wagon and some tents the priest i will find him cait smiled at the eager official my sister and i would be honoured magistrate your men however may wish to observe theah usual formalities at our most excellent inn suggested the magistrate delicately am certain they would like nothing better turning to rognvald she instructed him to take his men to the inn and see that the formalities were in fact observed take abu with you and make certain everyone is washed and prepared for this evenings festivities as the knight inclined his head in assent cait added in a whisper find matthias tell him we wish to speak to him tomorrow i will see what i can do about the wagon and tents turning to the magistrate cait smoothly linked his arm in hers and allowed him to escort her across the squaremuch to the satisfaction of the townspeople pleased to see their governor esteemed by such distinguished and obviously important visitors upon reaching the archway which marked the entrance to the square carlo turned to his assistant grieco what are you doing the young man looked blankly at his superior we are having drinks uncle carlo are we not no no no not you you must run to master pedrino at the bakery and tell him we will need twenty chickens roasted for tonights feast yes uncle replied the youth visibly disheartened twenty chickens is that all for heavens sake must i do everything myself it is to be a feast grieco tell him we want three sheep as well he paused considering the quantity of meat to be provided yes and a piga big one not a skinny runt like last time oh yes and five dozen loaves no six dozen tell him yes uncle why are you waiting go hurry there is everything to get ready the young man made to dash away wait cried his uncle go to tomas at the inn and tell him we want wine for sixty guests he is to bring it to the banqueting hall and olives too everything he fluttered his hands at the havering youth be off with you now hurry the gangly grieco flapped away down a side street leaving cait and alethea and carlo to proceed at a more leisurely pace to the magistrates house where they were received with all cordiality by carlos sister manuela who acted as housekeeper cook and companion to the busy official the ladies were conducted directly to places on a low bench under the leafy boughs of a lime tree in the corner of a terracotta tiled courtyard while manuela saw to the refreshments carlo drawing up a greenwood chair settled himself in the pleasant company of his captivating guests now then he said expansively about these tiresome concerns please tell me everything that troubles you cait smiled and opened her mouth to reply but her host held up his hand and said remember it is the magistrate of palencia you are speaking to by authority of the castilian crown therefore tell me everything and we will see what can be done he waved his hand imperiously settled back in his chair and closed his eyes please to begin chapter nineteen my dear archbishop said commander de bracineaux smoothly i am very pleased to meet you at last and i am astonished to meet you at all answered bertrano eyeing the templar narrowly you are supposed to be dead de bracineaux laughed then i think you will find me a most corporeal ghost as if to demonstrate his material presence he reached out and took the churchman by the arm and squeezed it i assure you my lord cleric i have a good deal of life left in me yet archbishop bertrano seated in his thronelike chair outside his hut regarded the hand on his arm his flesh seemed to squirm under de bracineauxs handas if he had been touched by something from beyond the grave indeed sir replied the archbishop pulling his arm away but how am i to know you are who you claim to be ah yes of course sighed de bracineaux as if the question had plagued him down the years what proof will you accept it is not up to me grumbled the archbishop perhaps you would not mind telling me how you came by word of my demise suggested the templar commander but i do mind sir snapped bertrano i do not see that i owe you any explanations it is for you to prove yourself or get you hence a moment longer if you please said de bracineaux i do not know how this confusion has come about but i can guess there was a womannot pretty but young still with dark hair she had a letteryour letterthe one you wrote to the pope asking for help to save a treasure called the mystic rose this woman told you i was dead regarding the churchman closely he said i believe i am close to the mark archbishop bertrano fingered the wooden cross at his belt but said nothing turning to danjou the commander said you see baron it is as we feared the thief has already been here before us we are too late the damage is done be of good cheer my lord answered danjou with practised if slightly oily sympathy all is not lost he turned sad imploring eyes to the archbishop with gods help we may yet be able to recover the holy relic you are right to remind me replied de bracineaux glumly we wait upon gods good pleasureand upon this prince of the church turning once again to the archbishop he said it rests with you noble cleric we are in your hands bertrano frowned and pulled on his beard he gazed long at the two men before him and made up his mind then i will not keep you waiting my lords i tell you now i want nothing more to do with you i protest began baron danjou the archbishop cut him off hear me out you come galloping into my city with your horses and men covered with dust and stinking of the trail you come making demands and shouting orders at everyone raising an unholy turmoil in the streets you command audience and bully my monks until i abandon my work to see you he glared at his two unwelcome visitors well i have seen you concluded the archbishop brusquely and i do not mind telling you that i do not like what i have seen he rose from his chair and stepped from the table now sirs i will thank you to excuse me i have a church to build danjou made to object once more but de bracineaux waved him off i see we have provoked you my lord archbishop he said pray forgive us if we have acted in haste and without sufficient forethought it was because we have been long on the trail with but a single thought burning in our heartsto recover the holy relic for the good of the church the archbishops scowl turned to anger so say you he answered but i do not know you the renaud de bracineaux i knew perished in a saracen prison he stepped toward the door of his hut i bid you good day gentlemen and godspeed with that he stepped through the door slammed it behind him and was gone how extraordinary remarked danjou quietly i do believe the man is insane perhaps agreed de bracineaux but there is more to this matter than we know we must consider carefully what has happened before we decide how to act he rose stiffly from his chair and rubbed his hand over his face i am tired danjou and in dire need of a drink come de bracineaux replied the baron rising at once i sent gislebert to secure rooms for us at the inn across the square follow me and we shall have wine and meat before you know it the inn was as much stable as hostel with rancid straw on the floor and a grubby illkept fire on the hearth it was crowded with roughhanded labourers from the nearby cathedral who sat in dull exhaustion with pots of warm ale between their thick paws drinking quietly to ease the throbbing in their joints several knights from the town had heard about the templars arrival and had come to see for themselves what manner of men they were they were talking loudly and drinking wine as they took the measure of the muchvaunted grand commander of jerusalem this is a noisy place grumbled de bracineaux into his cup swallowing down the wine in gulps and it stinks trust gislebert to find the worst i have seen better certainly danjou gazed around the room with mild disgust we could try somewhere else he suggested or would you rather stay at the monastery with the men good lord no i have had a bellyful of simpering dampeyed monkery he drank again and set the cup down heavily we will stay here the night and if all goes well tomorrow we will not be forced to endure another night in this pesthole of a town baron danjou refilled the cups have some more de bracineaux and tell me how you plan to persuade this disagreeable priest of your sincerity the commander pushed aside the cup no more of this vile stuff see if the innkeeper has anything better danjou rose and made his way to the board behind which the innkeeper and his haggard wife dispensed food and drink to their guests he returned to the table with a small brown jar and two small wooden cups he pulled the stopper and poured out a pale golden liquid then passed one of the cups to the commander who sampled it then tipped his head back and swallowed the sweet fiery liquor down in a gulp that is more to my liking de bracineaux said what is it he called it dragons milkif i understood him correctly the rude fellows latin is atrocious danjou took a delicate sip not bad whatever it is he refilled his companions cup it seems our friend the archbishop believes you to be someone else what else should he believe the man thinks me dead you think it was the woman of course who else she spun a tale for him and he believed her the old fool and you are a fool too baron i should never have listened to you the commander tossed down another bolt of the liquor now we must find a way to convince him of his folly i wonder what else she told himand perhaps more to the point what he has told her de bracineaux shrugged once we gain the archbishops confidence all our questions will be answered placing his hands flat on the table the commander shoved back his stool and rose i am going to bed he turned to make his way towards the door at the back of the room leading to the three sleeping roomsone a common room with six grubby pallets of wood shavings and straw and two small private chambers with slightly better furnishings as he moved through the room one of the spanish knights called to him they say the templars are gods own soldiers the young knight said loudly have you come to enrol the brave spanish in your holy army de bracineaux glanced around and saw four large young men sitting at a table watching him with scowling faces he saw the ruddy blush of wine on their smooth cheeks and knew they were half in their cups so decided to ignore them and moved on my lord templar shouted the knight there came a crash as his stool toppled over behind him i asked you a polite question perhaps you would have the decency to answer the inn grew hushed as de bracineaux turned are you speaking to me pigherd the knight stepped around the table and into the templars path i am alejandro lorca sir you will address me with the respect that is due a nobleman out of my way de bracineaux put a hand to the young mans chest and pushed him aside he fell sprawling on his backside but sprang to his feet with surprising agility he came up fast knife in hand the templar commander backed away a step the youth grinned stupidly ah now we shall see the famed courage of the knights of the temple he lunged forward the blade sweeping the air before him de bracineaux dodged to the side took the young mans arm spun him around and shoved him hard into danjou who stepped forward at that moment the two collided and the youth went down clutching his side and gasping danjou peered blandly down at him the young knight pulled his hand away and gaped at it in disbelief his fingers were covered with the blood which was rapidly spreading from the gash in his side impudent pup intoned the baron coolly i ought to slit your throat he bent down and the young man flinched danjou smiled wickedly and with a flick of his hand wiped the blade of the short dagger on the wounded knights tunic perhaps next time he said then stepped over his victim and continued towards the door the incident already forgotten de bracineaux regarded the young knight with loathing you want to be more careful pigherd you could get hurt the two men disappeared into the room at the back of the inn the knights friends and the rest of the patrons rushed to the young mans aid as soon as the door was closed lifting him upon their shoulders they hurried from the inn to the physicians house in the next street to have his wound stanched and bound before he bled to death the next morning the innkeeper greeted his two prickly guests with extreme deference bowing and bowing until danjou asked if the mans bowels were loose no my lord replied the innkeeper mystified by the question then kindly stop bobbing around like a goose with distemper and bring us some bread and a bowl of sweet wine the man bowed again and darted away mind the bread is fresh danjou called after him not that wormgnawed crust you gave us last night de bracineaux walked to the entrance pushed the door open and gazed out across the bare earth street beyond the low roofs of the surrounding dwellings the timber scaffolding of the cathedral soared heavenward i think he mused we shall pay another visit to our quarrelsome archbishop this morning and see if we can persuade him to see things in a different light how pray do you propose to do that while you slept i have been thinking on the evidence of the disturbance here last night it occurs to me that the people of santiago do not fully respect the poor knights of christ and the temple a lesson in courtesy would not go amiss i think i am intrigued said danjou with a yawn tell me more you must learn to rein in your enthusiasm replied de bracineaux glancing back over his shoulder it will do you harm one day the innkeeper reappeared a moment later bearing an armful of fresh loaves and two jars of sweet wine which he poured into his best cups there is honey for the bread my lords if you please he said with a bow bring it said the baron they broke fast on bread and honey and sweet wine while the innkeeper watched them twitchily until they rose to go was everything to your liking my lords he asked anxiously you keep a foul rats nest of an inn danjou told him it would be a boon to travellers everywhere if i burned it to the ground the innkeeper drew back in horror at the suggestion pay him said the commander moving to the door baron danjou reached into the purse at his belt withdrew two coins and offered them to the innkeeper as the anxious man reached for the coins the baron tilted his palm and spilled them into the dirty straw at his feet then turned and followed de bracineaux into the grey autumnal mist they proceeded to the monastery where following prayers the gates were just being opened for the day the grand commander strode into the cloistered square and called in a loud voice for his men to come forth they appeared from various doorwayssome from the chapel some from the refectory some from the dormitory marshalling his troops de bracineaux ordered them to saddle their horses and arm themselves for battle this they did without question although there was no indication of alarm the town seemed peaceful and quiet within moments this placid repose vanished in the clattering tumult of troops rushing to saddle horses and don armour they assembled in the street outside the monastery gates and many of the townspeople hearing the commotion came out to watch the strange soldiers array themselves for war as soon as they were armed and mounted master de bracineaux with sergeant gislebert on one side and baron danjou on the other took his place at the head of his companyfour ranks of five knights templar each wearing the long coat of fine chain mail and over it the distinctive white surcoat with the cross of red upon the chest armed with lance and sword and carrying the longtailed oval shield painted white and bearing the red crossthey rode out passing slowly along the streets of santiago de compostela and proceeding towards the towns great square and the building site of the new cathedral as the mounted troops moved slowly on they gathered a crowd of curious townspeople along the way so that by the time they reached the unfinished square the onlookers outnumbered knights by more than ten to one the labourers were already at work their fires and iron braziers were scattered around the site at places where they could warm themselves from time to time and cook their meals the dull morning rang with the sound of heavy hammers on wood and stone the creak of wooden wheels and the braying of donkeys as the timber scaffolding and stacks of cut stone rose slowly higher and ever higher archbishop bertrano stood at the broad base of the tower shouting at one of the masons who gazed down at him from the unfinished wall high above the mason pointed beyond him into the town square whereupon the churchman turned and beheld the mounted templars and their entourage of townsfolk hands on hips he waited for the knights to draw near you again he growled i told you i wanted nothing more to do with you good morning to you too archbishop answered de bracineaux cordially i hope you passed a pleasant night it is none of your concern snapped the archbishop eyeing the mounted ranks of armed soldiers i myself did not sleep so well the commander confessed guilty conscience no doubt remarked the cleric on the contrary said de bracineaux i could not sleep for thinking how i might prove myself to you then you have forfeited a good nights sleep for nothing the archbishop told him be gone and let me return to my work and then as i was at my prayers the answer came to me continued the commander speaking evenly and slowly so any of the many onlookers who understood latin might understand the example of our lord christ himself provided the way to verify the truth of my claims that i very much doubt sir sniffed the archbishop more likely it was the devil you were listening to diligent churchman that you are the templar continued as if he had not heard a word the archbishop said you will certainly recall the incident recorded in the holy text where the lord jesu is approached by a centurion of the roman army bertrano frowned drawn by the crowd and commotion more people were streaming into the square i know the text he said do not think to instruct me this roman soldier as you will recall continued de bracineaux blithely had a trusted servant for whom he had developed a certain affection yes yes snapped the archbishop impatiently i know the story do you remarked the templar i wonder the servant had fallen ill said the archbishop his irritation growing so the roman sought out the lord christ and asked him to heal the man indeed yes replied de bracineaux smiling the lord said he would come to his house and perform the necessary healing at once he paused his smile becoming fierce and do you remember what the soldier replied of course snapped the archbishop stop this mummery i see what you are doing the roman soldier stood before jesu and said my lord i would not presume to have you set foot in my house but just say the word and my servant will be healed the lord marvelled at the mans faith and the centurion explained he said i myself am not to be outdone before his own flock the archbishop took up the recitation he said for i myself am a man under authority with many soldiers under me i tell this one go and he goes to another i say come here and he comes to me to my servant i say do this and he does it he regarded the templar shrewdly am i supposed to be impressed by a small recital of holy writ well then i am not impressed in the least even the devil can quote scripture as we all know my dear archbishop coaxed de bracineaux you miss the point of the lesson you see like that centurion i am a man under authority with many soldiers under me arrayed behind me are but a few of them i say to this one come he turned and summoned the first soldier from his place behind him and beholdhe comes the soldier dismounted and ran to the commanders side i say to him stretch forth your hand the templar lifted his arm shoulderhigh and stretched out his hand de bracineaux drew his sword and touched the keenedged blade to the mans wrist he then raised the sword high overhead and prepared to strike off the soldiers hand without a quiver of fear the templar gazed impassively at the archbishop do you think maiming this unfortunate soldier will sway my opinion in any way said bertrano coldly i tell you it will not the commander slowly lowered the blade perhaps you are right he conceded what is a mans hand when the fate of the most valuable relic in all christendom even now hangs in the balance handing the naked blade to gislebert he dismounted and stepped before the waiting templar have you been shriven he asked simply the man nodded once then as your superior in christ i command you to kneel before me and stretch out your neck without hesitation the templar dropped to his knees and placing his hands behind him he lowered his head and stretched out his neck before the commander meanwhile gislebert having dismounted brought his commanders sword taking his place beside the commander he held the sword across his palms a body of monks from the nearby monastery arrived in the square just then and seeing what was happening raced to prevent the impending slaughter keep them back the commander ordered and six mounted templars broke ranks and rode to head off the onrushing monks indicating the man kneeling before him de bracineaux said as you a prince of the church wield power over the priests beneath you likewise does the commander wield power over those who serve under him for i ask you my lord archbishop who but the rightful lord holds the power of life and death for those beneath his authority the archbishop glared furiously at the templar but held his tongue very well concluded de bracineaux what i do before you now i do to prove my authority taking the sword from gislebert he grasped it in both hands and made an elaborate sign of the cross above the kneeling soldier then slowly raising the blade above his head he cried for the glory of god and his kingdom the blade hovered in the air and the archbishop rushed forward like an attacking bull your authority charged the archbishop his voice ringing in the restless silence of the square your authority you wicked and perverse whoreson the blade faltered and halted in its downward stroke the templar turned to face the oncoming archbishop for the glory of god roared the angry cleric get thee behind me thou satan it is for your glory not gods and i will not stand aside and watch you spill the blood of the innocent for your vain amusement genuinely taken aback by the indictment de bracineaux lowered the sword you accuse me of vanity priest he growled how many men have you killed in the raising of this monument to your vanity he waved a hand airily at the curtain wall and tower of the unfinished cathedral it is a temple to the everlasting god sir replied the archbishop four men have died and five hundred have laboured long to establish an altar which will last forevertheir lives and labour an honourable sacrifice to the author and redeemer of life the archbishop bent down raised the kneeling soldier to his feet and pushed him out of the way before turning on the templar once more do not presume to elevate your wicked exercise by comparing it to the exalted and holy obedience of my faithful labourers i know you for what you are sir and i condemn your arrogance and pride de bracineaux bristled at the clerics heated accusations why you bloated old goat he said his voice strangled with rage no man talks to me this way i am the master of jerusalem do you hear were you the very emperor himself i would speak declared the irate archbishop for when vile pride usurps a mans humility and true affection it is the duty of a priest to speak to name the sin and call the sinner to account the templars eyes narrowed dangerously his hand tightened on the hilt of his sword i came before you in friendship and humility he said forcing the words between clenched teeth and i was shunned now as i stand before this crowd of witnesses i am reviled his jaw muscles worked grinding his teeth with suppressed rage i command armies and ships fortresses and cities i have but to lift my hand and kingdoms are overthrown i speak and heathen nations tremble and i swear before almighty god were it not for the sake of the holy cup you would be kneeling before the throne of heaven even now proud priest archbishop bertrano raised a triumphant finger now do i truly believe you are the master and commander of the knights of the temple for who else but a man long accustomed to the wicked conceits of high position could stand in the presence of god and boast as you do your pride sir is a stink in the nostrils of god almighty and unless you repent on bended knee it will drag you down to hell de bracineaux livid and shaking reached out and snatched hold of the archbishops robe and pulled him close tell me where the mystic rose is to be found or i swear by my right hand that before you draw another breath i will carve that devious tongue from your lying mouth the archbishop his lips pressed into a firm defiant frown glowered at the templar with smoldering indignation well priest de bracineaux said his breath hot in the clerics face it was your letter that brought me here and i have not come this far to fail i ask but once more he tightened his grip on the archbishops robe where is the holy cup as god is my witness i tell you i do not know where the relic is to be found answered the archbishop that knowledge resides with the monk matthias he alone knows the whereabouts of the sacred vessel and he is not here he is in aragon then you will tell me where this brother is to be found the commander said even as he spoke his eyes took on a sly gleam better still so that no further misunderstandings threaten the harmony between us you will show me the way considering that this singular opportunity has come about through your interfering offices i think it is the least you can do releasing the cleric he called to gislebert ready a horse for our friend his highness the archbishop is joining our pilgrimage you cannot command me the archbishop spluttered i have work to do then i suggest you make haste to discharge your obligations without delay he turned on his heel and gestured to the templars looking on bring him one of the pack mules was hastily saddled and made ready for the archbishop who protesting the outrage being practised upon him was forcibly manhandled on to the back of the beast then at the sergeants signal the ranks of templars moved slowly off the monks gave out a loud cry of dismay pushed past the mounted soldiers and ran after their beloved archbishop clamouring for his release the soldiers paid them no heeduntil some of them ran up to the churchmans mule and tried to haul him from the saddle at a word from the master gislebert called a command and the last rank of templars wheeled their horses raised their shields and lowered their lances instantly blocking the street and preventing the townsfolk and monks from impeding their retreat meanwhile the rest of the cavalcade rode on archbishop bertrano realizing there was no rescue forthcoming called to his monks for building work to continue in his absence he was still shouting instructions when his listeners disappeared from sight chapter twenty impossible cried carlo de la coruna holy mother of god bear witness i cannot allow it surprised by the magistrates sudden vehemence cait glanced at thea who rolled her shoulders in a shrug of perplexed resignation why ever not wondered cait somewhat more innocently than she felt you will certainly be killed all of you the bandits are very fierce they are brigands cutthroats carlos wicker chair creaked as he squirmed with agitation no it is impossible my conscience would give me not a moments peace if i let you go i would never forgive myself indeed god himself he said thrusting a finger heavenward and crossing himself solemnly would never forgive me the road is safe enough cait pointed out we saw no sign of anyone all the way from bilbaoneither bandits traders nor anyone else you see the kings ban is working we are starving the bandits into submission no doubt said alethea stirring herself from her listlessness the thieves have already moved on to more profitable pickings elsewhere she yawned otherwise we would have seen them the little man shook his head from side to side no no no no no it is too dangerous i cannot allow it you must stay here at palencia until the knights of calatrava can escort you and your lovely sister properly and in all comfort and safety may i remind you magistrate we already possess such an escort cait insisted gently and if you agree to allow us to buy the supplies we need then we will be as well provided on the road as we would be here behind the walls of your excellent city she displayed her most winsome and beguiling smile you are very kind carlo and your concern shows a generous and compassionate heart she reached out and pressed his hand warmly but you see there is really no cause to be fearful on our account madre mia sighed the magistrate the king would boil me alive in hot oil if he found out the king alethea replied blithely is only three years old they feasted that night in the banqueting hall of the old palace palencia had been a favourite royal residence many years agofrom the time when alfonso iii expelled the moors and took over the amirs house for his own rognvald and the knights had spent the day roistering with some of the higherranking townspeople and had made a fair few acquaintances among palencias knighted nobility a small but ferociously loyal brotherhood most of these had been invited to the feast and so the warriors carried on their revel late into the night in all it was a grand repast and when the celebrants arose from the crumb and bonestrewn tables and staggered out into the darkened streets of palencia new friendships had been forged and vows of eternal brotherhood pledged the next morning caitriona alethea rognvald and dag rode out to an estate a short distance south of the city where as rognvald had learned from one of the local noblemen brother matthias was reported to be building a church for the vassals the estate was not far and magistrate carlo offered to ride with them and show them the way cait was desperately trying to find a way to politely but gently discourage him from this course when he was called away on urgent business to settle a dispute between a pair of brothers over the use of a cow which they had bought let us go quickly now thea said as the officious governor hurried off before he comes back the way was well marked and they had no difficulty finding the church for but a short distance from the trail they observed a heap of rubble and several piles of rough lumber in the midst of these heaps a ragged curtain of laid stone was being raised leaving dag on a nearby hilltop to keep watch on the trail and warn them should any trouble approach they rode on to the building site where on a plank balanced between two sections of wall stood a young man wrapped in the brown robe of a priest the hem of the robe was drawn up and tucked into his wide leather belt revealing a pair of muscular but dirty legs and equally filthy bare feet the day being warm he had withdrawn his arms so the upper half of the wool garment hung down around his trim waist pax vobiscum called rognvald as they reined up the monk straightened from his work and turned to greet his visitors holding in his hands the stone he was about to lay pax vobiscum he replied glancing from the knight to the two women his dark hair and wispy beard had been lightened by long hours in the sun we are searching for a priest called brother matthias said rognvald i am wondering if you could help us find him your search is at an end brother replied the monk in easy spanishtinted latin i am matthias god be good to you said cait we have something of importance to discuss is there a place we might talk i have no secrets before god sister the monk replied turning back to his work and as you can see there is no one here but the good lord and me so whatever is in your heart speak he placed the stone on to a bed of oozing grey mortar which he had prepared then scooped the excess mortar from the side of the wall and packed it around the stone are you building this church all alone asked alethea is there no one to help you god is helping me sister answered the monk he lowered himself on to the plank and then dropped to the ground moving to the nearest heap of rubble he chose another stone hefted it on to the plank and then clambered up once more the people come when they can but it is soon harvest time and they are needed in the fields we have come from archbishop bertrano in santiago said rognvald have you indeed said the monk turning towards them again then you have travelled a fair distance he straightened and regarded them with renewed interest i would share a cup of wine with you he said but all i have is water he pointed to a gourd hanging from the wall by a strap still you are welcome to it cait thanked him but declined i fear we come bearing bad news she said bertrano is dead guessed the monk he picked up the stone from the plank and gazed at it sadly how did it happen was it one of the builders the good archbishop was hale as ever when we last saw him cait assured the priest quickly unfortunately it is commander de bracineaux who is dead she noticed aletheas quick and questioning glance and prayed her sister would just this once keep her mouth shut i am sorry she said ignoring alethea she hated deceiving the priest in this way but the ruse must be maintained if they were to secure his help a puzzled frown clouded the monks open guileless features i do not understand there was a shipwreck rognvald said and explained how the templar commander and the other survivors were attacked by muhammedans sadly the commander died of his wounds i am aggrieved to hear it offered the monk resuming his work alethea watched him set another stone in the wall you seem to take your grief in your stride she observed thea hush whispered cait furiously matthias glanced at her his sunbrowned features breaking into a grin no doubt i would be more sorrowful if i had the slightest idea who this man de bracineaux might be you do not know him asked cait good lady i know him less well than i do the knight beside you said the monk and him i know not at all forgive me brother said rognvald quickly i am rognvald lord of haukeland and orkney ar and this is lady caitriona and her sister lady alethea of caithness in scotland may the lord of all holiness bless you and keep you my friends said the priest inclining his head in an ecclesiastical bow as it is nearing midday said cait i wonder if we could entice you down from your lofty perch with an offer of a meal we have brought some foodwould you care to share it with us the work of god cannot be diverted matthias dropped down to the ground once more selected another stone and hoisted it on to the plank you do eat do you not asked alethea sometimes allowed the monk when time is not so pressing still i want for nothing god supplies all my needs if he feeds you like he helps with the building thea observed then i am not surprised you have but little time for food indeed it is a wonder you do not waste away altogether matthias laughed o ye of little faith he said clambering back on to his rough plank we must work while we have the light for i tell you the truth night is soon coming when no man can work to caits surprise it was rognvald who parried this lighthearted thrust blessed yesu said my food is to do the work my father has given me perhaps what we have to tell you is also the work of god therefore let us also eatand perhaps we will discover what our heavenly father would have us do with the light we yet possess the priest stood upon his plank and beamed a man after my own heart i yield to your wise counsel as the priest climbed down from his suspended walkway again cait indicated a solitary scruboak tree a little apart from the building site come thea we will prepare the meal we can sit in the shade they dismounted and taking the bundles from behind her saddle cait led her sister past the mounds of stone and timber to the tree thea there is no time to explain but whatever rognvald or i may say just you consider it the truth better yet thea keep your mouth closed i know the templar isnt dead she said is that what you mean yes and there is more i will explain everything later believe me i do not like it any more than you do i like it just fine remarked alethea glibly and so do youi saw your face when you told him you enjoy it so do not try to pretend being holy and contrite all of a sudden i know better oh very well have it your way cait told her we will talk later just see you do not interfere why would i interfere anyway he is a fine and handsome mando you not think so cait he is a priest hissed her sister you cannot treat with him like other men in fact you must not treat with him at all alethea shrugged and they unwrapped the bundle and began spreading the meal beneath the tree shortly the knight and priest finished their inspection of the farfromfinished church and joined them bertrano sent you to tell me this the priest was saying he did answered the knight you see the archbishop took your concern to heart and sent to the pope for guidance in the matter of the holy cup you know about the mystic rose wondered matthias bertrano told you commander renaud de bracineaux was master of jerusalem the knight said he told me of the popes letter before he died he asked me to take word to archbishop bertrano and bertrano has sent me to you the priest nodded i begin to see now i did not know the archbishop would involve anyone else i told him in confidence and so it remains cait quickly assured him i am certain the good archbishop would not have confirmed us in this task if there was a better way although you might not know it the knight added the muhammedans have been troubling the region of late travel has become very difficult no doubt the archbishop took this into account i suppose you are right agreed matthias there has been trouble true enough thanks be to god we have been spared until now why did you think archbishop bertrano was dead wondered alethea thea not now hushed her sister matthias grinned again his teeth white against the sundarkened patina of his skin and curly wisp of a beard so long as that cathedral of his remains unfinished the man is a very plague to all the poor workmen who must labour under his tireless zeal he chuckled to himself in truth it is only a matter of time before one of his harried builders smites him with a hammer or throws him from a scaffold even so said rognvald the cathedral rises day by day it will be a magnificent church that it will agreed matthias with a sigh of resignation the marked lack of enthusiasm did not go unnoticed you do not approve of such enterprise asked cait lady i confess i do not the expense is beyond belief for the cost of one cathedral a thousand churches like mine could be built and a hundred monasteries convents and hospitals besides he sighed again but cathedrals woo the wealthy and everywhere kings are vying with one another to see who can build the most ostentatious monuments to their own vanities the food is ready said alethea pleasantly she smiled at the tanned and hardy priest please sit brother be our guest taking up one of the small loaves of bread the monk raised it on high as if it were the host of the holy sacrament and blessed it whereupon they all sat down to a simple but perfectly satisfying meal they had brought bread and smoked fish olives cheese and plums there was watered wine to drink and while they ate they listened in enthralled silence as matthias told an enchanting and wondrous tale chapter twentyone i first learned of the holy cup four years ago matthias said rolling an olive between thumb and forefinger before popping it into his mouth this was in old alfonsos day mind when the kings peace still heldand i was travelling in the high hills to the east beyond the ebro valley where there are many villages without churches but in one of the placesa small settlement in the mountains reached by a single sheep trail which is all but impassable most of the yeari found that the people already knew christ and his teachings i asked how this had come about and the head man of the village told me that they had preserved this knowledge from long before the muslims came but that must be said rognvald breaking in what three hundred four hundred years the priest nodded he broke off a bit of bread and chewed thoughtfully you know something of history my friend yes four hundred yearsas you shall see and for all those hundreds of years the people have remained faithful though surrounded by muhammedans on every side like a tiny rock of christianity in a turbulent muslim sea extraordinary breathed alethea hanging on the handsome young priests every word miraculous agreed the monk placidly i confess that at first i scarce thought it possible so during my sojourn with them i took every opportunity to question the villagers about thissubtly of course for i did not care to make them wary gradually they began to trust me and to tell me more and the more i learned the more extraordinary it became in time they came to realize my interest in them was genuine so one night the village chief came to me and asked if i wanted to learn a secret which would answer all my questions i told him i would welcome it if he wished to show me but if it would disturb any of his people in any way i did not care to know it for i valued their friendship far more than any secret they might possess alethea clucked her tongue with impatience at such irrelevant civility would have made him show me at once and that replied matthias with a wink is why you would still be waiting to discover the secret you see the hill people are not like others i believe they are the remnant of a more ancient race they are secretive by nature but they can be very loyal and they have extremely long memories they remember the slights and injuries of centuries as if they happened yesterday and they never forget a kindness so my answer was just the right one for the chief looked at me and said i would not show you if i had not already asked everyone i asked them and everyone has agreedeven gydon and he never agrees to anything well it was the middle of the night and i thought he meant to show me in the morning but he instructed me to tie up my shoes and put on my cloak and taking neither lantern nor torch we walked out into the darkness and up into the hills behind the village with nothing but the light of a pale quartermoon to guide us i saw neither trail nor path like a blind man i had to maintain a tight grip on the chiefs shoulder to keep from stumbling with every step we walked a fair distance or so it seemed and came at last to a hidden valleynothing more than a crease between two steep bluffs and high up on the side of one of the bluffs was the entrance to a cave i could not see itfor all it was dark as the bottom of a well but he assured me it was there and by virtue of small steps cut in the bluff he led me up to the cave though it was a tight squeeze through the rough doorway once inside the chamber we could stand upright my guide knew the cave well and by means of some materials left there he soon lit an oil lamp so we might view what he had come to show me what was it asked alethea rapt her eyes gleaming a small altar had been cut in the rock at the back of the cave and the entire wall whitewashed and painted with the sign of the cross so as to make a sort of shrine this painting was of a delicate and intricate craft the like of which i had seen but once beforein an old old text in the scriptorium of the monastery where i received my priesting this text was one of the monasterys principal treasures a gospel of john copied out by the hand of saint samson of dol it was a very beautiful ornament and i imagined that this was what he had brought me to seeand it was wondrous enough but no the chief indicated that i should move nearer the altar which i did and on the altar was a curious object at first i took it for a knifeit was long the monk held up his hand to indicate a daggerlength span and like a knife it tapered along its narrow length a closer look revealed that it was not a knife however for although it had a sharp point it had no edge like an ordinary blade and no handle what was it demanded alethea hugging her updrawn knees and rocking back and forth in anticipation matthias enjoying the suspense gave her a smile that is what i asked him the chief stretched forth his hand and said in a prayerful and reverent voice this is the spike which pierced our blessed redeemers feet as he hung on the cross for our salvation just like that at these words cait felt a tingle of excitement trickle up along her spine this is ordained she thought we are meant to be here this is a sign how did it come into their possession asked rognvald that is what i asked chuckled matthias i said to him my friend tell me how did it come to be here crossing his arms over his chest the village chieftain bowed low before the altar and spoke out a prayer in a language i have never heard before and then pointing to the spike he said lago gave it to us lago echoed cait you mean saint jamesthe same whose tomb is at compostela the same replied matthias enjoying the wideeyed wonder of his listeners the old galicians called him lago and hold that after the infant church was driven from jerusalem saint lago fled by ship with a number of other followers of the way they landed in the north and wandered here and there performing signs and wonders and preaching the gospel of salvation through belief in the risen lord christ he lived among the galician tribes for many years and towards the end of his life decided to return to jerusalem his proselytizing landed him in trouble with the jewish authorities who had him arrested and taken before herod agrippa who tried him and put him to death so that his grave should not become a place of worship herod refused to allow him a proper burial the priest paused to take a drink of wine before continuing when word of the sainted mans unfortunate end eventually reached the newfounded churches of iberia the people grew very distraught they came together and chose a delegation of twelve strong and righteous men led by a priest of undoubted holiness the delegation was sent to jerusalem to claim the body of their beloved lago through many travails they persevered and were at last granted permission to recover the corpse of the great saint which they placed in a specially prepared casket and carried back to galicia to be buried in the place where he and his followers first made landfall and where his bones have been venerated ever since was it really the true spike alethea wanted to know it might have been any old scrap of iron there is no deceiving you declared the priest you put the blessed thomas to shame leaning close he said to tell you the truth i had my doubts too i asked how it was that after such a long time they could be certain that it was the selfsame spike of the crucifixion and do you know what the chief did alethea shook her head the nearness of the priest made her stomach flutter and she noticed how the sun had burnt the hair on his bare arms to a fluff of golden curls what did he do she asked almost swallowing her voice he told me to pick it up he said lago was a powerful prophet and he foresaw the time when the galicians would suffer under the moors he gave us this inestimable treasure so that we should never forget the teaching he left behind for he knew the gospel he preached would help us endure and survive and he told the truth then the village chieftain stretched out his hand towards the relic and bade me to pick it up did you asked cait lady i did i stood before the altar and i reached down and plucked up the spike and held it in my hand it was heavier than i imagined and cold to the touch now i know you are a holy man said my host or else you could not lift it i did not know what he meant but before i could ask he bade me make as if to steal it away still holding the spike in my hand i turned away from the altar and started towards the doorway and wonder of wonders the spike began to grow warm in the space of a single step the cold iron grew so hot as to scorch my palm i looked and the metal now glowed red as if fresh from the smiths fiery forge what did you do said alethea what could i do i swiftly returned the sacred object to its place on the altar lest my hands be burned to unfeeling stumps lo and behold no sooner had i replaced the relic than it resumed its former appearance touch it said my host and i did the monk stretched forth a tentative finger recalling the gesture for his astonished audience what did i find the ancient iron was cold once more a very miracle said rognvald with satisfaction you are a trusting soul replied the priest i would i were more like you in this regard unfortunately ever since childhood i have suffered the affliction of a suspicious nature i could not let the matter rest i saw a stack of kindling wood lying on the floor next to the cave entrance so i took up a stout chunk of wood in each hand and returned to the altarthinking to get the object between the two pieces and remove the iron spike that way without burning my hands did it work asked alethea slightly breathless with awe sister it was even more wonderful than before for no matter how hard i tried i could not move that spike though i applied all my strength the holy relic would not be diverted by so much as a whiskers breadth the wood splintered and my fingers grew raw but i could not move it the village chief watched me with great amusement he laughed at my efforts and then calmly walked to the altar where i was struggling and bowing before it took up the spike and placed it once more in my hand as if it were no more than a feather were you less holy than you are he told me you would not be able to lift it for to the man of evil intent it contains the weight of the world i replaced the holy relic then and knelt down before the altar and thanked the heavenly father for allowing me to witness this great and powerful sign when i finished my prayers we departed the cave and returned to the village reaching the settlement just as dawn rose over the eastern hills i thanked the chieftain for showing me the marvellous relic and vowed i would treasure it always and tell anyone who cared to listen so that faith might increase as i said this a great smile spread over the chieftains face and he said do you see that sunrise our poor relic is as the darkness of the valley through which you walked compared to the shining glory of the graal the three rapt listeners repeated the strange word like you i had never heard of this graal and did not know what it might be the priest told them i asked what was betokened by this word my guide made the sign of the cross and said it is the lords cup the cup of the communion of saints which was blessed by the christ at the table of the last supper the mystic rose whispered cait brother matthias nodded i thought he meant that the village possessed another secret in the form of this relic and so i asked if he could show me but he merely smiled and said that it was not his to show for long ago the cup was removed by the will of god and taken to a refuge where it could be guarded lest the moors learn of it and seek to steal or destroy it my excitement made me rash and in my unthinking haste i asked him to show me where the blessed cup had been taken i asked him to lead me there at once my guide recoiled from my unseemly alacrity it seemed then that he feared he had revealed too much he quickly bade me farewell and would say no more agh cried alethea in protest you should have made him tell you in the end i did learn the rest of the tale a few days later he came to me after dark i was at my prayers and he came into the room where i was staying and said that he could not rest knowing that he had betrayed the sacred cup how betrayed i asked i am a priest of the church all things touching the holy are safe in my hands even so i failed to convince him and so i suggested that the best way out of his dilemma was for me to learn the rest of the tale from someone else that way i told him the burden is lifted from your shoulders because you were not the one to tell me well he saw it as his redemption in the matter and told me that if he was a man wanting to learn secrets of this nature he knew a place deep in the high pyrenees where all such questions could be answered the way he said it gave me to know that this secret place in the mountains was where the cup now sheltered so i agreed and he instructed me on how to find this place i listened with utmost care to all he said and when he left i quickly prepared a pen and wrote down all he had told me i wrote the directions in the margin of the gospel text i always carry with me so that i would not forget them and a few days later i concluded my work and set off to find the sanctuary of the cup did you find it asked cait i did my lady answered matthias i found it just as he said i would and did you see the cup asked rognvald i did replied the priest his voice falling to a whisper i saw it in all its manifold splendour and i worshipped it i fell on my face before the sacred object and when i arose three days had passed three whole days challenged alethea disbelief edging into her tone in the mere blink of an eye affirmed the monk and then i rose and went out healed and satisfied in heart and mind and soul i rose as a man renewed and reborn and with a holy fire burning in my belly since then i have travelled the land preaching wherever i am welcomed and building churches for those who have none he spread his hands humbly i am as you find me a muchchanged and chastened man he drank again allowing the others to ponder what he had told them why did you write to the archbishop asked cait after a moments reflection ah that that has vexed me greatly matthias confessed following my rebirth the zeal burned so great within me that i could not rest but that i should begin straight away to preach to the poor and build churches for them and thus bring them to knowledge of the loving creator naturally i could not set about this new work without the permission of my superior so i composed a thoughtful letter and sent it to archbishop bertrano asking for his permission and seeking his blessing in my rapture i told him about the mystic rose of virtue that i had seen it and been changed by it in short i told him everythingand more for i was enraptured and unable to keep this glorious news to myself and he is my superior after all well after i sent the letternot at first but some time later i began to fear that i had said too much what if the letter went astray what if the news of the sacred cup should become known to men of evil intent low thieves who would steal or destroy but the deed was done and i could but trust god to make it right cait lowered her eyes modestly hoping the priest would not see the waves of guilt washing over her they had come like low thieves to steal the cup for themselves the simple trusting faith of brother matthias put her to shame and she was on the brink of admitting it to the priest confessing her sin and asking for absolution when her sister spoke up god has sent us to you declared alethea with quiet but undeniable conviction cait glanced at her in furtive amazement only to see that the young woman was hi utter and solemn earnestand this astonished her even more mouthing untruth with such brazen audacity must be the worst kind of blasphemy certainly she was still trying to take in the enormity of aletheas sacrilege when lord rognvald said archbishop bertrano also feared for the safety of the cup he told us that owing to the reconquest of the land he considered it only a matter of time before the holy cup fell into the hands of the moors the knight smiled his broad countenance shining with the light of a golden day and the joy of blessed assurance that is why he sent us with gods help we will rescue the cup and bear it away to safety before any ill can befall it grinning brother matthias leaned forward and embraced his visitorsfirst alethea then rognvald and then cait i too believe god has sent you he said i have often worried that i had done wrong by sending word to the archbishop and as often as i worried i prayed god would grant me his peace in the matter in you my friends this peace has finally come i thank god for it and for you unable to bear seeing the unsuspecting priest deceived and deluded still further cait made bold to lay bare the fraud that she and the others had perpetrated please it is not what you think she began nothing ever is sister replied the monk cheerfully where god is concerned surprise abounds our heavenly father delights in the unexpected the unforeseen serendipitous circumstance and happy accident ours is a god of surprises alethea affirmed cait stared at the others unable to speak my friends i am convinced the lord has sent you what is more i feel he is sending me too the monks grin widened still further i will lead you to the mystic rose chapter twentytwo when the party departed palencia four days later they were mere travellers no longer they had become pilgrims destined for a holy place and for at least two of their number the journey had taken on profound spiritual significance rognvald and alethea maintained that the sudden stirring of reverence and devotion was a genuine awakening i see it so clearly now alethea insisted it was the night before they were to leave and the three were talking alone in the magistrates walled courtyard we have been chosen to save the holy cup and deliver it to safety how can you say that demanded cait when you know i was the one who took the letter from the templars as the holy word says what you intended for evil rognvald intoned god has destined for good so be it and you cait charged bought your release not the angels and that for one purpose onlyto help me steal the relic god works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform replied the knight placidly as for myself i never doubted that our great redeemer had a hand in your scheme surely it is the divine will that we should rescue the sacred vessel from the iniquity of desecration cait shook her head in disbelief at what she was hearing you sound more like a priest every day my lord she grumbled perhaps you should join a monastery where your preaching would be more appreciated only a fool mocks what he does not understand the knight replied unperturbed by caits outburst is it so difficult to believe that in spite of your intentions our great lord has ordained us to this task and even now guides us to our destination it was no use talking sense to them cait decided they were so full of holy foolishness that they could not see the blunt obvious mudugly fact that the whole enterprise was founded on a mass of lies halftruths and deceptions large and small and all of them growing out of a theft which itself originated in an act of revenge while it might be true that the theft of the letter was instigated by the white priesta fact cait preferred not to mention to anyone the naked shabby truth was that she hoped from the first and hoped still to employ the sacred cup to aid in avenging her fathers murder at the hands of de bracineaux as she had come to see it the white priests commission provided her with the means to an end she had desired from the first yet she puzzled over the others peculiar insistence that their venal and selfserving journey had in some way transmuted itself into a true pilgrimage in aletheas case she suspected the girl was simply enamoured with the handsome young monk and his simple almost childlike ways rognvald was a different matter she could see no reason for his conversion from cunning accomplice to pious pilgrim she had assumed it was part of his guisemuch the same as that which he had adopted to win archbishop bertranos confidence the knight however remained adamant that his manner was in no way calculated to deceive and in this he appeared sincere indeed he bristled at the suggestion that his virtue had ever been a sham lady you do wrong to doubt me in this he had told heragain in all sincerity with her fellowconspirators stricken by this inexplicable saintliness cait could find no reasonable way to discourage the zealous brother matthias from joining the company and as the prudent monk seemed wholly disinclined to reveal any details pertaining to the holy cups whereabouts she had no choice but to welcome him with as good a grace as she could muster nor was the priest the only newcomer to the group by the time they were ready to depart thanks to the norwegian knights innate friendliness and magistrate carlos wellintentioned efforts the party had acquired an escort of six additional knights who happily agreed to accompany the travellers as far as their next stop four warriorswhat is that he told her it is enough to get you into trouble but not enough to get you out before she could protest he surged on no do not thank me since you will not listen to sense and reason sending these additional men is the least i can do i could not in good conscience allow you to continue your journey otherwise thus owing to her growing entourage cait had become the reluctant owner of three additional pack mules and a converted hay wain to carry all the extra provender and provisions needed to feed the increased numbers of men and animals she had also taken to heart magistrate carlo corunas counsel that she should purchase tents after logrono the next town on the way he told her settlements of even modest wealth and substance were few and very far between the weather will not stay fair for ever he warned sooner or later the autumn rains must come sleeping under a leaking sky is not for a noble lady heaven forbid but you are indeed fortunate for i know a man who makes the most wonderful tentsa cousin of mine as it happens but a tentmaker without peer i will take you to meet him and you will see for yourself in the end the tentmaking cousin had only two completed tents to sell the number of pilgrims travelling through palencia on their way to or from santiago had so declined since the kings ban that he had not made any new tents for some time and was seriously considering giving up the business altogether he was overjoyed to sell his last tents to cait and her company and explained that if she could wait but a month longer he could have more ready for her she declined politely but purchased the remaining two for a generous price and added them to the growing mountain of equipment and supplies the tents were fashioned in a sturdy rustic way tall peaked leather roofs stretched between two stout poles and anchored on all sides with tightbraided ropes side pieces of heavy wool cloth were then attached to the upper portion by way of eyes and ties so that the interior might be opened or closed to the outside depending on the desires of the inhabitants whatever the structures may have lacked in elegance they more than made up in durability the roof portions were good spanish leather and the cloth was tough and impervious to wind or rain cait and alethea took one tent for themselves and were pleasantly surprised by the additional comfort provided the other tent was given to the men who took it in turn to use it five sleepers sharing each night equipped provisioned and rested they set off the next day at first the wilful defiance of the kings decree made the ride seem daring and eventful but as the days passed the continual vigilance and stealth began to palemuch like the sunstruck wilderness through which they journeyed a dustdulled aridity of empty hills and parched valleys filled with tinderdry plants in subdued shades of ochre and tan and brown because of their greater numbers the company travelled more slowly than before the spanish knights knew many songs and games and enjoyed teaching them to their norse swordbrothers they told stories about the people and places of old galicia often vying with one another to see who could tell the most outrageous lies about their homeland the weather remained warm and dry the fiery heat of summer slowly giving way to the fresh cool days of autumn as before they met neither bandits nor pilgrims and had the road to themselves from dawns first gleam to twilights last glimmer thus the days passed pleasantly if not as swiftly as cait would have liked if not for the fact that the cost of provisions threatened to overwhelm her ready resources cait would have enjoyed the journey far more keeping everyone fed and watered became the occupying concern of each and every day the supplies disappeared at a shocking rate and cait began to feel she had made a grave mistake taking on the extra men and horses fortunately finding good water for so many thirsty throats posed no difficulty the road was rarely out of sight of a stream or river although most had dwindled to little more than a trickle awaiting the autumn rains at least the animals could be easily watered and the knights were not forced to spend the greater part of every day searching for wells springs or drinking holes likewise once they entered the ebro valley they could follow the substantial rio ebro to logronoanother oncemagnificent roman town which had decayed under the long years of muhammedan dominion upon reaching logrono they stopped to bathe wash their clothes rest and replenish provisions as at palencia the travellers were welcomed with genuine warmth by the local citizenry who had not seen any travellers for many months and were eager for news of the wider world during their brief stay cait followed brother matthias advice to consult the abbot at the local monastery about the road ahead the trails beyond logrofio into the lower valley and eastward into the mountains were not so well travelled as those they had used so far and cait was grateful for any knowledge of the most likely stoppingplaces along the way because the abbot was not receptive to the idea of women visiting his scriptorium and holding converse with the monks under his charge he declined to allow cait to join the visiting party so rognvald and matthias went in her stead they say we can get meat and meal at milagro on the rio aragon rognvald told her on the eve of their departure he and matthias had spent most of the day studying the monasterys maps and charts of the region and then again at carcastillo it is four days to milagro matthias said and carcastillo is two or three days beyond that we will stop there said cait our provisions will last that long at least the abbot suggests stopping at both places the knight offered once we are into the mountains it will become very difficult we will get nothing more until berdun and then but little but with fewer in our party cait pointed out that should not become a problem ah yes said rognvald glancing secretively at the monk i have been meaning to speak to you about that very thing yes cait regarded him dubiously i have been thinking that it would be good to keep the spanish knights with us oh no declared cait i agreed they could come with us this far but no further they must go back although she enjoyed their genial and entertaining presence the spanish knights cost a great deal more than she had anticipated they are good warriors said rognvald they are good trenchermen it seems to me countered cait we have not seen so much as a moorish shadow since leaving santiago do not think me a pinchfist in this matter i enjoy their companionship as much as anyone but it comes at a pricenearly two hundred marks since joining us the knight frowned but held his tongue lady caitriona said matthias forgive me if i speak above my place but the abbot has strenuously advised us to turn back he says the mountain passes have become very dangerous in these last days with many lawless and evil men waiting to prey on unwary travellers with such an army as i possess we are far from unwary cait pointed out all the more reason to retain the spanish warriorsif they are willing regarding cait with sly solemnity he added it is but a small price to pay for the saving of the blessed cup his mention of the sacred relic brought a twinge to caits raw conscience matthias did not yet know her true intentions for the vessel she hesitated to insist on sending half her force away might arouse the priests suspicions regarding the nature of the enterprise which had caught him up until she had the cup in her possession she could not risk losing his aid and affection turning to rognvald she asked do you commend it my lord most heartily i do he replied very well then she decided speak to the men if they are willing and agree to abide your command then they may continue for as long as necessary thus when she and alethea rode out of the gate the next morning to resume the journey they did so with a company of twenty horses and pack mules ten knights and one priest and an interpreter driving a wagon laden with supplies of food and drink by caits rough reckoning enough ready gold and silver remained from that which she had brought from her fathers chest to allow them to reach their destinationso long as it was no further than matthias vague intimations what they would do after that she did not know this cast her into a melancholy fretful mooda condition that did not improve when day after day they failed to be confronted by any of the regions muchfeared bandits indeed they met with no greater mishap than a sudden drenching when the sky opened and dumped a months supply of rain on them in two days riding was so miserable that they camped for a day and a half staying in their tents for the most part until the weather cleared and they could continue the rains filled the allbutempty river basins and made fording the streams more of a problem than before at one crossing the wagon struck a submerged rock and pitched abu headlong into the rapids an alert dag flew after him and plucked him sputtering from the water a few hundred paces downstream each day they moved on following the track as it rose slowly higher and yet higher into the hills the women gradually became accustomed to life on the trail cait learned to sleep with her sword and alethea eventually ceased complaining about each small discomfort both became adept at darting quickly into trailside bushes to attend to their more intimate needs rejoining the company before anyone knew they had gone the knights grew used to one anothers ways and an easy camaraderie developed between them which made the daily tasks of establishing and breaking camp tolerable if not enjoyable from time to time as the mood took him brother matthias preached and recited psalms and he taught the norsemen simple hymns in spanish despite the everworsening weather everyone remained in good spirits for the most part upon arriving at the place where the rivers joined they turned north to follow the rio aragon up into the foothills of the sierra de guara pausing briefly at the hilltown of milagro where in order to conserve her dwindling supply of gold and silver coins cait made the knights work for the townspeople in exchange for the necessary provisions the men mended walls fixed leaking roofs and chopped firewood for the coming winter after a week they had accumulated enough supplies and the company moved on the weather in the high hill country was growing damp and windy matthias staunch refusal to tell them precisely where they were going began to rankle cait more and more the priest was adamant that the location must remain a secret to the very end but intimated that their final destination was still a good many days beyond carcastillo so at their next stop they took the opportunity to trade labour for goodsthis time in order to obtain heavy cloaks made from the dense wool of the regions sheep both cait and alethea thought the cloaks smelly beyond beliefan unappealing mixture of rancid fat and burnt dungbut the cloaks were warm even when wet and kept the sharpening wind at bay as the party ascended ever upward into the cooler heights the women slowly became accustomed to wearing the noisome garments through the day and more often than not sleeping under them at night as well the weather became steadily cooler as autumn advanced the skies grew dark and moody and often there was rainsometimes in fierce pelting bursts and sometimes in dismal misty drizzle which set in early and lingered making everyone and everything miserable wet and cold alone among the members of the company brother matthias seemed not to mind the discomfort in fact he revelled in it regarding the mild distress as a chastening discipline the worse the storm the louder he sang his psalms and chants sometimes delivering whole sermons to the sodden empty trail and drifting clouds the spanish knights apparently derived great satisfaction from this curious demonstration a thing which cait could not understand how far cait demanded of the priest one evening they had stopped at a clearing beside the muddy rivulet which was their trail and the knights were making camp after a dreary days ride abu was trying to light a fire and most of the spanish knights were searching the nearby forest for dry wood the low grey sky threatened yet more rain and the ground was soggy underfoot the looming peaks rising in the near distance were wreathed in fog and the wind among the rocks and canyons soughed with a desolate whine not far now he replied with an exuberance that set her teeth on edge a few more days how many days she said stubbornly i want to know you are leading us there anyway so you may as well end this absurd secrecy and tell me how much longer we must endure this incessant rain and chill matthias regarded her with soulful compassionate eyes peace you are disturbed over nothing we will arrive in gods good time never fear oh i am not disturbed cait insisted her voice threatening and low my feet are wet my clothes are muddy i am cold and tired and i do not think it too much to ask how far we have yet to travel is it two days ten twenty sister the monk said calm yourself there is no i am not your sister i am your patron and i want an answer alethea came rushing up just then cait what is wrong why are you shouting at brother matthias all is well the priest told her it is a misunderstanding nothing more he laid a soothing hand on caits arm forgive me my lady by my estimation we are perhaps six days from our destination no more than ten six or ten days cait repeated dully removing his hand from her arm fifteen at the most which is it priest demanded cait ten fifteen five hundred it is difficult to say my lady so much depends on the weather the mountain trails can be treacherous this time of year aghh cait cried in frustration and fled the conversation rognvald caught up with her as she stormed from the camp is something wrong my lady no she snapped charging through the underbrush into the woods nothing what so ever she spat each word as if it were a pellet of venom all is happening in gods good time she said adopting the mincing tone of a dissembling cleric apparently she shoved aside a lowhanging pine bough and let it fly the knight walked along beside her a few paces we could remain in camp tomorrow if you like he suggested and move on when the weather improves why must you always take his side his side gods side no him she jerked her head in the direction of the monk who was now talking blithely to a warmly receptive alethea the idiot priest i take no ones side without due cause and consideration the norseman told her firmly she glared at him and surged on ahead rognvald started after her again leave me alone she said turning on him a woman needs a little privacy now and thenhave you ever considered that rognvald begged her pardon and retreated she went on until she came to a thick bank of elder bushes loosening her girdle and swordbelt she removed her smallclothes then hitched up her cloak mantle and shift and was preparing to squat when she heard the shriek at first she thought it the cry of a hunting eagle for the sound seemed to have fallen from the low sky overhead she listened holding her breath in a moment it came again thea hurrying she rearranged her clothes once more and ran back along the track she had wandered further than she knew it took longer than she expected to reach the camp and as she drew nearer she heard men shouting and the clash of armsthe unmistakable sounds of battle the camp was under attack chapter twentythree cait flew back through the woods as she neared the fighting she crouched low and hid behind a tree the halffinished camp was swarming with dark men in dark brown cloaks moors she thought counting them quickly there were eightand all were mounted two or three of the bandits held spears the rest wielded swords and they were swooping among the knights who were struggling to fend off the marauders occupied with setting up camp for the night none of the defenders had been wearing armour when the attack began as a result they were only lightly armed most had she saw been able to lay hand to a sword but none had shields and only rognvald had a horse the clash of weapons was fierce and the shouts of the men to one another and to their assailants deafening the commotion filled the clearing with a dreadful disorienting clamour above the tumult there came another earshattering shriek and cait looked to the partially erected tent alethea was kneeling at the tent opening hands to her face terrified dag stood before her tent pole in hand defending her from two swarthy assailants yngvar and svein were running to join him just as they reached the tent however two mounted bandits caught them and they were forced to break off their assault to defend themselves the horses were picketed nearby none had saddles but cait had ridden bareback from childhood darting to the line she untied the nearest mount swung herself up on to its back drew her sword and raced for the tent her attack was cut short however when a blackbearded moor suddenly appeared before her and with one swipe of his sword knocked her weapon from her hand the slender blade went spinning to the ground and the bandit seeing that she was unarmed reached for the bridle of her horse cait slashed the reins across his face catching him on the side of the head as he leaned forward he drew back with a curse between his teeth and jabbed at her with the sword she dodged aside easily and the bandit lunged forward snagging the bridle strap of her mount she pulled back hard on the reins attempting to make her horse rear but the bandit clung on keeping the animals head down the wildeyed brute swung around beside her thrusting the sword at her and shouting in arabic as he made to lead her horse away taking her with him throwing aside the reins she slid lightly off the back of the horse landed on her feet and started for the tent once more she had run but a halfdozen steps when she felt the ground tremble beneath her feet the same instant a jarring thud between her shoulderblades lifted her off the ground she squirmed in the air as the bandit tried to haul her on to his horse swinging wildly she struck out at her attacker with her fists striking him in the ribs she swung again and her knuckles grazed something sharp twisting in her assailants grasp she reached for the place once more and her fingers closed on the hilt of a dagger the knife was out of the sheath before the moor knew what had happened squeezing the hilt she raised her arm and plunged the blade down into the meaty part of the bandits thigh with an astonished cry of pain and rage her wouldbe captor hurled her to the ground and the knife went spinning from her grasp she landed hard on her side forcing the breath from her lungs gasping her chest aching unable to breathe she drew up her knees and cradled her head in her arms to prevent the horses hooves from dashing out her brains a loud whirring filled her ears and she felt herself slipping awayas if sucked down into a dark spinning maelstrom beneath violent waves the whirring sound ended in a sudden crash and she felt something heavy fall upon her cait could not move the upper half of her body was trapped beneath a dense weight and when she turned her head to look she saw the bearded moors sweaty face leering back at her she felt a rush of warmth flood across her chest and stomach and looked down to see the bandits body lying across her own blood and bile spilling from a gash that split his torso from side to side below the ribs she struggled to push free of the dead weight but it held her to the ground a veil of darkness descended across her vision and the clash of battle grew fainteras if the fight was swiftly receding with the onrush of night and then the crushing burden suddenly lifted from her and she was free air rushed into her lungs and her vision cleared revealing rognvalds worried face hovering above her gathering her in his arms he raised her up i can walk she gasped gulping in air i am not hurt this way he said placing her back on her feet holding tight to her hand he pulled her quickly to the edge of the clearing get down he said indicating a hollow place formed by a tree growing between two big rocks crouching low she leaned back into the hollow and with a quick chop of his sword rognvald lopped a branch from the tree and put it over her shielding her from view stay here he said dashing away again as soon as he had gone cait bent back the branches so she could see across the clearing the attack appeared to be intensifying where before she had counted eight there were now at least twelve possibly more with all of them constantly circling and swirling they were difficult to reckon never attacking straight on they struck glancing blows darting in and disappearingonly to reappear again a moment later attacking from a different quarter the knights were making a valiant attempt to form a defensive circle but their numbers were too few and the need to counter the raiders incessant darting sorties kept them off balance and unable to close the gaps in their ranks rognvald swiftly crossed the clearing dodging two bandits as he ran to join his men under their lords command they soon succeeded in closing the circle and but a few moments later two of the spanish knights had gained their horses svein and yngvar soon joined their comrades in the saddle and the next whirling attack was met by four knights on chargers they cut down two raiders and unhorsed a third before the moors broke off to reform the assault when the next onslaught came there were five mounted knights to repel it which they did with quick and decisive prowess driving into the centre of the bandit attack unhorsing the foremost moor and scattering the rest the unseated raider fell backwards over the rump of his horse and landed awkwardly his arm bent back under his body he lay squirming on the ground clutching his shoulder and howling svein dispatched him with a short sharp chop to the base of the skull and he lay still the bandits were no match for mounted knights and knew it from her stony nook cait watched as four or five spearwielding moors made one last halfhearted feint allowing their fellows to gather up the plunder they had succeeded in liberating from the wagon and then suddenly all of them were fleeing back into the surrounding forest as soon as the last of them disappeared cait sprang from her protecting hollow and ran to rejoin the others the two spanish knights were for giving chase but rognvald called them back and ordered them to stand guard lest the bandits return upon reaching the centre of the clearing cait stopped and made a quick assessment of the damage three of the moorish raiders had been killed but none of the knights involved in the affray seemed to have been wounded or injured she breathed a sigh of relief as she looked around the bandits had made off with some of the provisionsa bag or two of meal a side of smoked pork and a few smaller itemsbut nothing of any real consequence that she could see rognvald wheeled his horse and rode to where she was standing lady caitriona he said sliding from the saddle are you hurt my ribs ache but i am well otherwise she turned from the plundered wagon and looked towards the tent suddenly remembering what she had been about when the bandit diverted her attention god help us no she shouted running for the tent where is alethea chapter twentyfour dag lay face down on the ground before the collapsed tent a small dark patch of blood pooling beneath his cheek the tent pole with which he had tried to defend himself and alethea lay broken beside him cait reached him first and even as she took in the sight her eyes quickly scoured the surrounding area for her sister seeing that the young womans body was not lying battered and bloody nearby cait knelt beside the fallen knight fearing he was dead she put a hand to his cheek the flesh was cold and damp she heard rognvald shout an order to the others to remain mounted and on guard for another attack and then he hastened to her side i am sorry began cait as the knight handed her his sword and bent over the body of his liegeman i think he is with expert quickness rognvald searched the body for wounds finding none he took dag by the shoulders and rolled him on to his back it was then cait saw the ugly gash over his left eye the blood had come from this cut and from the mans broken nose bending close rognvald placed his ear next to the mans mouth listened for a moment and then sat back on his heels he lives alethea is not here she said perhaps she has run into the forest she made to rise but rognvald put his hand on her shoulder and held her down stay with dag he said taking back his sword i will search for her calling svein and the two mounted spanish knights to accompany him he made a swift search of the perimeter in a few moments cait could hear them shouting for alethea as they made a circuit of the surrounding woodland while they searched cait occupied herself with washing the unconscious knights wound and preparing a bandage for him she bade yngvar bring water and then sent him to fetch some dry moss which she formed into a thick pad binding it to the wound with a strip of linen torn from the hem of one of her mantles as she worked she kept looking to the forest halfexpecting to see her sister straggling back to camp from her hidingplace where have you been she would demand we have been calling for you could you not hear alethea shaken but unharmed would complain about her sisters lack of pity for her particular hardship and all would be well once more in the end however it was not alethea she saw but rognvald and svein hurrying from the wood their faces tight with dismay tell me you did not find her said cait bracing herself for the worst lady we did not rognvald replied the spanish knightsthe four who were gathering firewood they were set upon by the bandits and killed before they could raise the alarm and warn us all four dead despite what the knight was telling her she only felt relieved that her sister was not among them their kinsmen are with them rognvald said we saw no sign of the young lady svein added quickly there is hope still better than for the priest said yngvar joining them matthias why where is he she stood up and looked around he has been killed my lady yngvar pointed towards the plundered wagon his body is there to all appearances the good brother had simply fallen asleep at his prayers hands still clasped he lay on his side his robe damp at the knees from kneeling on the wet ground the killing blow had caught him on the back of the neck almost severing his head yet his expression was not one of terror or anguish but intense calmas if in the fervency of his prayer he had been unaware of the tumult around him i do not think he felt any pain poor fellow observed svein poor fellow yngvar retorted i hope i might go in such a way he was close to god this one svein nodded thoughtfully he is closer now rognvald glanced at the lowering sky it will be dark soon we must hurry if we are to raise the trail at first cait did not understand the implication of his words raise the trail she objected but alethea would not just run away the bandits trail rognvald corrected until the knight uttered those words the possibility that her sister had been taken had simply not occurred to her it did so nowand with all the terrible consequence of certainty instantly her mind filled with the vile and awful defilements customarily suffered by abducted women she stood we must find her where is my horse i will take yngvar and the others svein will stay here with you i am going she insisted get me a horse rognvald placed his hand firmly on her shoulder we are armed and you are not it would be better for you to stay and look after dag let svein look after him she said shaking off his hand i am going retrieving her sword she strode to sveins horse gathered the hem of her mantle put her foot to the stirrup and swung into the saddle well are you coming or not rognvald muttered an oath beneath his breath and moved quickly to his mount he wheeled his horse and started off in the direction the marauding moors had fled stay in sight of me he said to cait as he passed her at first they had no difficulty seeing exactly where the raiders had gone they followed clear hoofprints in the rainsoftened earth making good speed through the wood indeed their progress was so swift and purposeful cait allowed herself to imagine they would quickly catch sight of the fleeing raiders too soon however the little light which shone through the thick overcast sky dissolved into a dismal damp gloom and then as darkness settled about them the ground began to rise to meet the rocky hills they climbed to the top of a steep thicketcovered slope and there the trail of hoofmarks divided the last dregs of daylight revealed a sudden turning away from the path and into the rough trackless hills here rognvald called a halt mark the place he called to yngvar we will resume the search in the morning you would turn back now demanded cait they must be but a short way ahead of us we can catch them yet we cannot catch them if we cannot see them rognvald replied as it stands we will be fortunate to find our way back to camp in the dark go back then cait growled angrily you can all go back will go on alone my sister is taken captive and i will not abandon her we will find alethea declared rognvald his words terse and his voice low but we cannot search in the darkness and will not risk all our lives in foolish pursuit with that he turned and started back the way they had come cait shouted at him to come back but he ignored her yngvar fell in behind his lord the two spanish knights hesitated then followed leaving cait to herself in defiance she urged her horse forward along the trail but stopped again after only a few dozen paces it was hopeless she could no longer see the ground much less the hoofprints trees shadows hills and sky were merging into an impenetrable inky gloommade all the darker for the lack of moon or stars to light the way she reined to a halt and sat staring into the deepening murk and listening for any sound that would tell her alethea was near she heard only the wind fingering the tops of the tall pines as it rushed down from the cold mountain heights when she realized she could no longer hear the knights behind her she at last gave in god be with you thea she murmured and then turned around to make her way back finding the trail was far more difficult than she had imagined if not for the fact that she had just passed that wayand that yngvar was waiting for her further onshe knew she would have spent a cold night alone in the wood it galled her to admit that rognvald was right but she accepted yngvars silent lead and followed on by the time they reached the camp a small fire was burning brightly in the centre of the clearing the bodies of the dead bandits had been removed and dag was sitting beside the fire holding his bandaged head in his hands he stood shakily as the others came into the camp where is svein asked rognvald dag replied that he was in the wood digging graves paulo rodrigo rognvald said turning to the spanish knights s they dismounted go help svein we will come shortly and bring the priest for burial cait heard the names and realized she did not know the spanish knights who served her her cheeks burned with shame at the thought four of them had given their lives in her service and she did not even know their names in that moment the enormity of her blind grasping arrogant vengeful ambition came dreadfully painfully clear to her she moved to the fire collapsed beside it and sat staring in hollow despair tonight her allconsuming hunger for revenge had cost the lives of five good men and the abduction of her sister and this was just the beginning she thought before it was over how many more would pay she heard rognvald say come we will join them he instructed yngvar to wrap the body of matthias in his robes and then he was standing over her i said we would join them at the grave site miserable with guilt and the heartbreaking weight of the disaster she found she could neither lift her head nor answer she merely nodded her acquiescence he stood for a moment looking down on her she could feel his eyes and she imagined his expression of scornful reproach and then he was beside her his mouth close to her ear hear me my lady he said speaking softly but earnestly nobilitys worth is not proved by the brilliance of its glory but by the light it lends to others in the dark night of need then he took her hand and stood raising her to her feet come it is time to say farewell to our friends taking dag by the arm she followed rognvald and yngvar as they carried the body of the priest a short distance into the wood where by the light of a fire of pine branches svein and the two spanish knights paulo and rodrigo were completing a wide trench between two large trees using their swords they had cut into the soft turf hacking through the roots and scooping out the earth with their hands the four dead knights lay in a neat row to one side bundled in their cloaks arms crossed upon their chests brother matthias was carefully laid beside them and as cait and dag took their places beside the single large grave rognvald and the others began moving the corpses to their final restingplace the monk was interred first and then the knights two at either hand the symmetry seemed to satisfy some desire on the part of the spanish knights to see their swordbrothers accompanied on their eternal journey side by side with a priest once they had been arranged their faces were covered by the hoods of their cloaks and loose dirt was pushed over the bodies cait stood and watched in the gently flickering light as the knights packed and smoothed the mounded earth with their hands then one of the spaniards took up a wooden cross he had made from a forked branch and crosspiece lashed together with a leather strap the crude cross was set in the top of the mound and anchored with a few small stones they stood for a long moment in silence contemplating the grave and then taking a burning branch from the fire rognvald held it over the mound in elder times he said a fallen warrior would be sent on his journey to the otherworld with fire tonight we will honour this ancient custom and leave our brothers and companions with a farewell flame to light their way through the dark valley of death to the city of light with that he planted the burning branch in the grave mound to one side of the cross he straightened and stepped back may they enter the great kings presence with thanksgiving may they join the glad company of heaven and find everlasting joy in the service of the lord of hosts svein took up a burning branch and likewise planted it in the mounded soil farewell my friends though we must leave you in this strange place we leave a flame to light your path go home to god next paulo took up a brand he stuck it in the mound saying thadeus ricardo hernando emari brother matthiasyou were my friends in life death has taken you away but you will live in my memory and in the deeds i shall do in your names farewell at last thought cait sadly i have learned all their names and now it is too late the other spaniard removed a branch from the fire and holding it above the mound said today i lost the friends of my youth tonight i mourn the loss tomorrow i will avenge them from this moment the blade at my side is dedicated to you my friends and i pray to almighty god that it will deal justice to the cowards who cut short your lives he plunged the burning brand into the mound i rodrigo bilar make this vow cait knew the sentiment only too well and shrank from the recognition oh rodrigo she thought you do not know what you are saying yngvar and dag each bade their dead friends a heartfelt if simple farewell and planted their torches then it was caits turn plucking a branch from the fire she stepped to the graveside and stared at the great oblong bulge of earth what was there to say she did not know these men anything she said would be a triviality an empty gesture that would mock their sacrifice so without a word she added her torch to the circle of flame around the wooden cross the party stood for a moment in silence listening to the wind sighing through the unseen treetops then rognvald led them back to the ruined camp where after they had finished putting up the tent for cait he addressed them saying get what sleep you can we resume the search tomorrow at dawn yngvar prepared a warm gruel of pease porridge with bacon but cait was too tired and numb with sorrow to eat instead she went into the tent and sank down on to the thin pallet of pine boughs that served for a bed she pulled aletheas cloak around her and lay as still as she couldas if by remaining motionless she might calm the ceaseless whirling of her thoughts and though she closed her eyes she kept seeing the moorish bandits circling and circling like ravening wolves she heard again the dull thunder of the horses hooves and the desperate shouting of the knights as they strove to fend off the attack and somewhere above the clamour of battle she heard aletheas screams although she had not been aware of it at the time she must have heard her sisters cries for help as she was carried off she heard something else too a mans voice frantically shouting for help the hopelessness of the cry brought her bolt upright in her bed with a gasp abu chapter twentyfive the sound of the knights saddling the horses and preparing to strike camp brought cait from an unquiet sleep her eyes felt like raw wounds and her mouth tasted of smoke and ashes she dragged herself on to her knees and pulled back the tent flap the sky was dark still but a thin line of pale red light was showing through the trees to the east she rose and shuffled out of the tent and felt the cold sting of the air on her face last nights wind had brought cold weather to the mountains there was frost on the ground on stiff unfeeling legs she moved to where rognvald was throwing a saddle pad over the back of a horse he greeted her sombrely and said we will leave as soon as the horses are saddled i think it best to take everything with us i do not expect we will come back here again the wagon will slow us down will it not dag is not yet well enough to sit a horse he can drive the wagon and look after the pack animals we will mark the trail for him and tell him where to stop and wait it will slow us yes but it cannot be helped abu is missing too she told him her voice taking on a confessional quality he finished smoothing the pad and then glanced at her yes he said i know he bent down lifted the saddle which was laying on the ground beside him and hefted it into place i did not think you would remember another time and the reprimand would have rankled and irritated now however she merely swallowed glumly you did not find his body when you were searching the wood she said after a moment so perhaps we may yet find him he cannot have gone far he has a horse rognvald told her how do you know there were three dead moors and only two horses you think he took it cait was baffled by this unexpected turn then we shall have to divide our forces and search for them bothis that what youre thinking i am thinking replied rognvald stooping to gather the cinch strap dangling beneath the horses belly that where we find alethea there we will also find abu he followed her cait murmured of course she was slow to pick up the thread of rognvalds thought but now she had it and felt her blood warm once more to the chase stepping close she put her hand on rognvalds arm i am sorry for my shameful behaviour it was not becoming a lady of rank i allowed my anxiety over my sisters disappearance to cloud my judgementa fact which i deeply regret rognvald bent down to fasten the strap i have offered my apology cait said her voice growing tight did you hear what i said i heard do you not accept it lady it is not for me to accept or reject am i a priest now waiting at your beck and call to shrive you stung by his reproach she removed her hand from his arm our priest is dead yes agreed the tall knight so i think you will have to suffer your pangs of conscience as best you can i do suffer them sir and i was taught the virtue of repentance obviously you were not see here we all do things in the heat of battle we later regret war is regret he gave a sharp tug pulling the cinch strap tight do not look to me to soothe away your remorse with kind words and kisses oh never you fear my lord she spat though you die in your bed an illtempered old man you will not hear me apologize again she turned on her heel and stormed away thus the unhappy day began as soon as the tent was packed away and the wagon loaded and secured the muchdiminished party moved on they accompanied dag and the wagon a short way along the track and arranged a place to meet later in the day before turning aside to take up the trail they had abandoned the previous evening the ground was more rough and rocky than cait remembered or perhaps it was the coating of frost which made every stone leaf branch and twig stand out in sharp relief the path was much steeper too and as they climbed higher and ever higher the wind began to grow stronger and more raw whipping the horses manes and tails the tracks of the fleeing moors led up over the curving spine of a bare rock ridge with sour disappointment growing in her breast cait began to suspect that the bandits had disappeared into the mountains beyond a suspicion quickly confirmed when the party scrambled up an incline of scree and abruptly found themselves gazing down into a rocky defile through which snaked a grey stream and across the divide the mountains cait looked at the daunting slopes covered in a thick tangle of scruboak hazel and small stunted pines and her heart sank she turned in the saddle and looked down the way they had come far below she could see the narrow trail as it wound along the lower shoulders of the foothills she did not see the wagon but reckoned it was down there somewhere we will rest here a moment called rognvald svein and i will ride to the bend he pointed along the top of the ridge and see if we can find a way ahead they rode off and the others dismounted to stand close to their mounts for warmth cait pulled her cloak more tightly around her to keep the wind out and stood staring bleakly at the soaring slopes beyond the canyon the three knights stood talking together and cait decided that it was time she made herself better acquainted with those remaining in her service the men stopped talking as she joined them and turned expectantly please she said do not stop on my account i did not mean to interrupt my lady said yngvar we were just remarking how winter comes early to the mountains it seems winter has begun cait agreed adding alethea does not even have a cloak the men exchanged uneasy glances is it like this in your country the one called rodrigo asked indicating the mountains there are mountains in scotland cait told him but only low hills where my family lives our lands are near the sea and winters are often harsh my family owns land near bilbaoalso near the sea the knight told her that means we share the same sea you and i he smiled and cait realized he was trying to cheer her i am sorry for the death your friends she said thadeus ricardo hernando and emari the names she knew but had no idea which name belonged to which knight if not for me they would still be alive the knight lowered his head cait saw him swallow down his grief i will miss them it is true he replied evenly but they were men of valour and freely sworn they would not hold you to blame nor do i even so they did not deserve to die like that said the one called paulo it is a disgrace for a knight to die without a sword in his hand only the worst coward would cut down a man who cannot defend himself yngvar said a man of honour would never do such a low thing a great sadness swept over cait as she listened to the men talk she pulled the heavy wool cloak more tightly around her throat and looked towards the mountains the higher peaks were lost in mist which appeared to be thickening tendrils of fog oozed down the slopes like sinuous fingers slowly reaching and stretching searching out the low places filling them and flowing silently on the wind blew in fitful gusts whistling over the bare rocks of the ridge and she could smell snow in the air oh alethea she murmured to herself i am so sorry she closed her eyes and prayed god to send his angels to protect the young woman from the killing cold no less than from the hateful abuse of her heathen captors a short while later they heard the sound of horses and looked to see rognvald and svein returning as they dismounted the others gathered around to hear their report there is a marker at the edge of the stream down there rognvald told them that is where they crossed a marker said cait a heap of stones my lady replied svein but who would she began and then the answer came to her abu svein nodded we think he is marking out the way for us show me said cait swinging back into the saddle it is not far said rognvald but we have a decision to make something in his tone gave her to know that he was talking about her yes the day is growing foul i think a storm is coming we will find what shelter we can along the way i am not giving up the search because of a little wind and rain i am not suggesting we give up the search rognvald replied his voice growing tight with exasperation but there is no need for all of us to grow wet and miserable with it you could go back down and wait with dag at the wagon by the time you join him he will have reached the waiting place and will have a fire going you can sit and warm yourself by the fire cait told him i am going to find my sister then we move on rognvald motioned to the others to mount their horses and the party continued halfway down the slope the rain started it was not long before cait felt the cold wet begin to seep into her cloak before they reached the valley floor she was chilled to the bone and wishing she had not dismissed rognvalds offer so hastily but now having rejected the suggestion she was determined not to allow him the satisfaction of proving her wrong so she put all thoughts of warmth and comfort behind her and pulled the hood of her damp cloak lower over her head to keep the rain out of her face the valley was shallow and did little to slow the wind gusting down from the mountains they came to the markera pile of stones at the edge of the stream on the opposite side was anotherthis one in the rough shape of an arrowhead pointing upstream they rode in the direction indicated by the marker following along the grey stream as it wound its way around the large rocks and boulders which had fallen from the slopes above after a while the rain turned to sleet and they stopped in the shelter of some young pines to eat a little dried meat but the trees offered so little protection from the stinging winddriven pellets of ice that they quickly decided to take to their saddles again before the horses grew too cold and their sweaty coats began to freeze as the day wore on caits hopes of quickly rescuing alethea began to dwindle they were briefly revived when another marker was found and a short distance beyond it the remains of a small campfire in a bend in the valley where the stream pooled the moors had stopped thereto water the horses and prepare a meal no doubtbut aside from a small heap of soggy ashes and unburnt ends of branches there was nothing to see rognvald examined the tracks leading from the campsite and concluded that the bandits no longer feared pursuit how do you know wondered cait one set of waterfilled hoofprints looked very like another and these were no different from any she had seen so far the gait of the horses tells the tale replied rodrigo the riders are in no great hurry see here he pointed to a series of moonshaped tracks pressed deep in the mud see how the leading edge of each hoofprint is scuffed i see cait looked more closely they look smudged the horses are tired the spanish knight told her they are ambling dragging their feet yes he made a slow flicking motion with his hand that means the riders are no longer pushing them it is good for us said svein they do not know we are chasing them with luck said rodrigo we may soon catch sight of them up ahead he indicated the ridge wall which formed the end of the valley we will be able to see into the next valley from up there the trail led around the edge of the pool the tracks in the rainsodden bank were now easy to follow and cait began to feel they were making real progress at last however the ridge was further away than it first appeared and the rise far more steep by the time they reached the bottom of the ridgewall daylight had begun to fade although the sleet had stopped the wind was growing more fierce rognvald halted the party and with a glance at the sky said we are losing the light it is time to turn back the words struck cait like a blow her first reaction was to defy him to challenge his judgement to contradict his command in her heart she knew he was right however and besides she was cold and hungry and no longer had it in her to fight futile battles with either men or the elements still for aletheas sake she asked might we go just a little further it is no use even if we gain the top we will not be able to see anything in the dark we must go back now if we are to meet dag before nightfall that was the end of it as before they marked the place so they could find it the next day and turning to the high hills to the west of the pool rode away the sky had grown dark by the time they gained the wagon trail the deeprutted track was treacherous in the dark so they were forced to dismount and cross the undulating hills on foot which meant a cold slog along rocky waterfilled furrows they saw the glint of dags fire from a hilltop long before they reached the place cait watched the glimmering of flame as it grew slowly larger step by step her fingers stiff on the reins of her horse were numb and her toes stung with the cold she imagined stretching her feet before a blazing fire clutching a steaming bowl of porridge between her hands and feeling the blessed heat warm her frozen bones this reverie proved so pleasant she imagined sleeping in a dry bed heaped with furs in a room warmed with burning braziers and the delicious feeling of fur against her skinthen realized with a start that she was imagining her chamber at home in caithness how many times she wondered had she slept in that room in just that way dag had the wagon unhitched and a small store of firewood collected by the time they reached the camp despite his throbbing head he had spent the short span between midday and dusk doing what he could to set up the camp and they were grateful for it indeed the prospect of warming themselves by the fire so cheered the knights that with wild whoops and ecstatic cries they raced down the last slope to the picket line dag had strung between the trees beside the trail they hurried through unsaddling and grooming the horsesrubbing them down with handfuls of dry straw before watering them and tying on the feedbags that chore finished they hastened to thaw their freezing hands and feet before the flames after they had warmed themselves awhile rognvald said we will need more firewood tonight see what you can find while the others moved off in search of more wood cait dag and rognvald set about making a supper of boiled salt pork with beans and hard bread it was ready by the time the knights returned and the childlike abandon with which they gave themselves to their food made cait smile they are just overgrown boys she observed as she and rognvald followed them to the bright circle of warmth and light it is good they should enjoy a dry night out of the wind and rain the knight replied it will be the last we see for a while cait glanced at him for an explanation tomorrow we must abandon the wagon he told her i had hoped we would be able to give dag another day or two longer to recover but the moors are fleeing into the mountains if we are to have any hope of catching them we cannot return to the wagon each night do you think it will be very many nights in truth i hoped we would get sight of them today and the matter would have been decided he paused and then as if thinking aloud said we shall take with us as much food and fodder as we can carry but the tents poles and irons and all the rest will have to stay behind his expression became apologetic and cait realized he meant the chests of extra clothes and personal belongings if that is how it must be she replied steeling herself for the privation ahead so be it we will catch them we will get thea back never doubt it chapter twentysix i am carlo de la coruna magistrate and governor of this fine and prosperous town said the man he made a flourish in the air with his hand removed his fine red cap and bowed deeply on behalf of the worthy citizens of palencia i welcome you and your excellent company and may i wish you a most enjoyable stay the knight took one look at the chubby roundshouldered fellow in his peculiar hat and decided that he was an absurdity likely to cause problems if not strenuously avoided good day to you magistrate he replied stiffly as you can see we are in need of food and lodging i will thank you to arrange it the magistrate puffed out his cheeks well he began to protest but thought better of it and said of course my lord if that is what you wish it will be my pleasure turning he summoned his deputy to his side grieco where are you come here grieco i want you to take word to master hernando at the inn tell him i am sending very important guests to stay with him tell him breaking off he turned once more to the newcomers and said if you please my lord may i know who i have the pleasure of welcoming i am renaud de bracineaux master and grand commander of the knights templar of jerusalem he replied and this he indicated the fairhaired thinfaced man on horseback beside him is my companion baron felix danjou also with us is bertrano archbishop of santiago de compostela unfortunately friend bertrano is indisposed and cannot speak to you now i want rooms for three the rest of my men will lodge at the monastery turning his arid gaze to the soggy windblown street he shivered in the autumn chill you do have a monastery in this he hesitated this place do you not and an inn but of course my lord answered governor carlo proudly we have a very fine monastery it has long been renowned for good said de bracineaux decisively you can show us where to find it he called gislebert to attend them the magistrate will lead you to the monastery lodge the men and then come to us at the inn turning back to carlo the templar said come now governor my men have ridden far today and are in want of a hot meal and beds be quick about it and you will find it worth your while governor carlo stared in astonished indignation who did these men think they were to order him about so even the king was more gracious to his subjects than these arrogant saddlepolishers well if they wanted him to lead them to the monastery he would do it but it would be the last service he would perform for them after that they would pay for what they received moreover as they imagined themselves emperors of vast domain they would pay royally the thought suffused his face with a glow of magisterial satisfaction carlo smiled bowed and led the heavy footed gislebert away simpletons muttered the templar all of themcomplete and utter simpletons come now de bracineaux that is overharsh said danjou it is a substantial enough town and we have seen far worse in recent days i think we may well find some amusement here we will not have time to amuse ourselves de bracineaux growled the moment we find this priest matthias we will be on our way have a heart de bracineaux sniffed the baron diffidently we have spent the last three days slopping through mud up to our fetlocks and i demand a few decent nights sleep in a bed that does not float we shall see grunted the templar commander first we find the priest the miserable pisspot of a priest can wait corrected danjou placidly first we find the inn de bracineaux allowed himself to be persuaded he too was sick of the damp and filth and the prospect of a hot meal dry clothes and a jug of mulled wine melted his resolve very well two nights he agreed have one of the men bring up the wagon they proceeded down the crooked main street of the town to the inn where young grieco was waiting with the innkeeper a balding man in a big shirt with baggy sleeves and a greasy linen cloth tied around the bulge in his middle welcome welcome my friends he said running forward to take the reins of the commanders horse please come in eat drink and take your ease looking past the two riders to the wagon he said i see you have a lady with you let me assure you she will be most comfortable i will have my wife prepare a special bath for her take no trouble the templar told him curtly it is not a woman as he spoke the wagon rolled creaking to a halt behind them the driver climbed down and went to the back where he removed the board and allowed the bellicose passenger to emerge dios mio gasped the innkeeper taking in the imposing bulk swathed in heavy black robes it is the lord archbishop turning on the young man beside him he cried grieco you fool why did you not tell me the archbishop was with them with that he darted forward and ran to bow before the august cleric my lord archbishop you honour us with your presence please come in you shall have the best room i can offer archbishop bertrano gave the man a sour smile i would gladly accept your hospitality he replied but i believe the commander will have other plans for me at the innkeepers bewildered expression danjou put his arm on the archbishops shoulder and said our cleric is on a special pilgrimage you see nothing but cabbage and cold water for him and a horsehair robe in the stable the stable cried the innkeeper but my lord i could never allow it why it would ruin me please you must see that just give him the room next to mine said de bracineaux wearily and bring us wine at once you can stable the horses later of course my lord said the landlord he hesitated well demanded the templar i have two rooms my lord but they are not next to one another unless you wish to just put him where i do not have to look at him or listen to him snore at once my lord the innkeeper spun on his heel and hurried inside followed by grieco who caught the door and held it open for the important guests de bracineaux pushed the reluctant churchman ahead of him and once inside made for the low table before the hearth danjou came last and paused long enough to take griecos arm and pull him close i will be wanting a companion this evening he told the youth a companion wondered grieco i am certain my uncle would be most happy to oblige i will ask him if you the devil take your uncle boy i want a woman the younger the better he gripped the young mans arm hard understand he left the gaping grieco at the door and while the landlord bustled the silently disapproving archbishop to a room at the back of the inn he joined de bracineaux at a large table before the fire he removed his gloves and put them on the table gods eyes but it is good to be dry again he said sweeping off his hat he tossed it on to the floor i thought it would never stop raining you are soft danjou you would not last three days in the east you would have perished long before ever setting foot in jerusalem then you can have your holy land and all that goes with it the baron replied airily i will stay here and delight the ladies of iberia the anxious innkeeper arrived just then with a large jar and cups which he placed gingerly on the table wine my lords it is not mulled but pour said the templar the innkeeper did as he was told and then backed away as the commander raised his cup to his lips he took a single sip swilled it in his mouth and then spat it out agh de bracineaux pitched the contents of his cup into the fire then threw the cup at the startled landlord i said i wanted wine you dolt not this horse piss you serve everyone else now get you gone and bring me something drinkablethe best you have the innkeepers mouth worked as he tried to think of a suitable reply danjou stood shoved the jar into his hands spun him around and sent him staggering back the way he had come look lively man my throat feels like old leather the baron sat down again and began removing his boots which he placed by the side of the hearth he stretched out his feet to the fire the templar watched him without interest in a moment the innkeeper came creeping back with another jar which he offered with extreme hesitation at a glance from the master he proceeded to pour but his hand shook so badly that he missed the edge of the cup and spilled wine on the table almost splashing danjou clumsy oaf snarled the baron leaping to his feet he snatched the jar from the cringing innkeeper get out and leave us in peace the man scurried away and danjou returning to his chair poured a cup of wine which he pushed across the table to de bracineaux he watched as the commander sniffed the offering and then took a swallow passable said the templar whereupon the baron took up a hot poker from the hearth and plunged it into the jar mulled danjou said as the wine sizzled tossing aside the poker he poured himself a cup and settled back into his chair once more feet spread before the fire they drank and let the wine do its work when de bracineaux held out his cup for more the baron filled it and said i suppose this priest has a church somewhere close by has the archbishop said where it is the bloated pigs bladder of a priest professes not to know he is more trouble than he is worth i am sick of the sight of him regrets enquired the baron since santiago he has been worthless grumbled the templar and he was very little use before that i smell something cooking the baron lifted his nose and craned his neck around probably pork muttered de bracineaux i am heartily sick of pork too what about some of that beef we saw coming into town said danjou sipping from his cup perhaps we should have gislebert get us some he has better things to do than cater to your idle whims danjou at that moment the door opened and gislebert appeared ah said danjou lifting his cup the very man himself here now sergeant de bracineaux thinks you have better things to do than serve my trifling fancies is that so gislebert glared but made no reply the men are lodged and the horses stabled he looked at the wine longingly what news of matthias did the abbot say where the priest might be found the sergeant swallowed he is not here the abbot said he is expected to return to the monastery for the winter but he has not yet arrived then we shall go and get him said the commander where is he he is building a church on lands near here it is no great distancehalf a days ride perhaps not more then tomorrow we will ride out and convince this priest to join our happy pilgrimage that should be no great difficulty his grace the archbishop can simply compel him under threat of excommunication said danjou pouring a cup of wine for gislebert sit down sergeant you look faint from thirst once we have the priest to lead us we will abandon that puffing windbag at last de bracineaux drained his cup and as the baron refilled it he shouted for the landlord to bring the food when the innkeeper appeared the templar said i have a taste for roast beef i have no beef my lord the landlord said wringing his hands in the cloth at his waist my good wife has made a rabbit stew with shallots wine and mushrooms everyone says it is excellent i want beef damn you beef but there is none to be had in all the town just now perhaps a young bull will be butchered in a day or two and then i shall certainly get some for you he spread his hands helplessly i have some sausages and there is fresh pork if you like i will have my good wife make for you a fine devil take you and your good wife the templar raged i want beef and that is what i shall have the innkeeper appealed to danjou i am sorry my lord there is no beef in all of palencia his dark eyes implored the rabbit stew is very good bring it the baron told him at once my lord he turned and scurried back to the kitchen i will bring bread too and more wine at once sir the master glared at danjou never cross me like that again he growled what and do you mean to crucify the man replied the baron casually for gods sake de bracineaux there is no beef carving up our host will avail you nothing he leaned back in his chair clutching his cup to his chest and closed his eyes savouring the warmth of the fire the innkeeper brought another jar and a round loaf of brown bread which he placed diffidently on the table and scurried away before drawing the ire of his difficult guests gislebert tore the loaf in half once and then again he sat chewing his portion and staring absently into the fire the commander drained his cup and poured another the three drank in brooding silence until the innkeeper reappeared holding the sides of a bubbling iron pot which he placed in the centre of the table a boy with him brought an assortment of wooden bowls which he left beside danjous elbow before darting away again the innkeeper produced four wooden spoons which he cleaned on the greasy scrap of cloth around his waist placing a spoon in each of the bowls he proceeded to ladle out the contents of the cauldron what is that growled de bracineaux eyeing the fourth bowl balefully the landlord hesitated the ladle wavered uncertainly above the table stew my lord he replied timidly for the archbishop you were told he was to have nothing but boiled cabbage and water the templar said darkly of course my lord but he swallowed glancing anxiously from one to the other that is i thought you were in jest i do not expect you to think the commander replied menacingly i expect you to obey pour it back and get him the cabbage as you were told the innkeeper appealed silently to danjou who softened as this is his graces last night with us suggested the baron why not let him have the stew let him join us he can tell us what he knows about this priest matthias we have asked him already de bracineaux said he has told us all he knows which is little enough get some wine into him and he may surprise you and sing like a lark said danjou it is the last chance to find out very well said the commander to gislebert he said fetch the disagreeable priest and tell him he can join us if he minds his manners the sergeant stuffed a last piece of bread into his mouth then rose and lumbered off de bracineaux regarded his companion with dull petulance you are an old woman danjou do you know that you should have been a priest the baron sipped his wine i lack the mental rigour he replied placidly i am too easily led astray by frivolity and caprice the commander stared at him then laughed the sound like a short sharp bark gods wounds danjou he lifted his cup and drank again then pulled his bowl before him and started to spoon hot stew into his mouth in a moment gislebert appeared with the churchman in tow sit down bertrano said de bracineaux kicking a chair towards him the baron here thinks you should join us for a farewell feast what do you say to that i say he replied a shred of common decency still clings to the baron perhaps he may be redeemed after all i would not be too certain about that the commander pushed a bowl of stew across the table i want you to tell me about the priestthis brother matthias i have already told you all i know said bertrano he bent his head murmured a prayer crossed himself and began to eat de bracineaux reached out and pulled the bowl away again first the priest and then the food the archbishop looked up wearily i can tell you nothing i have not already said before the man was unknown to me before i received his letter he roams about building churches and preaching to the poor that is all i know it will be a pleasure to see the back of your disagreeable carcass said the commander shoving the bowl of stew towards him once more you are too harsh de bracineaux said the baron affably our friend the archbishop is a very fount of wisdom and good will the road will be a far more lonely and cheerless place when he is gone we shall miss his merry japes thanks to you the building work will have fallen behind winter is upon us and if the roof is not in place much of the work will be ruined has no one ever told you that it is folly to store up treasures on earth where moth and rust do corrupt wondered de bracineaux bringing a snort of derisive laughter from gislebert and is it not written because it was in your heart to build a temple for my name says the lord you did well to have this in your heart and the temple i am going to build will be great because our god is greater than all other gods and who retorted the templar commander is able to build the temple of god for heaven is his throne and the earth his footstool he raised his cup in mock triumph even satan can quote scripture replied the archbishop sourly de bracineaux bristled at the jibe away with you he growled your selfrighteous prattling wearies me the archbishop finished his stew raising the bowl to his lips and draining it in a gulp then he stood how is it that a man can see the mote in his brothers eye yet miss the beam in his own with that he wished them a good night and went back to his room remind me to give him that lame horse when he leaves tomorrow better still said baron danjou why not give him an ass so he has someone of like mind for company well said laughed sergeant gislebert a man after my own heart you are only half the wit you think you are danjou de bracineaux grumbled shaking his head be of good cheer commander the baron replied eat drink and rejoice for tomorrow the search for the mysterious rose begins in earnest with any luck you will have it tucked safely away before the season is through we can be in anjou before the snow flies and winter at my estatewhat do you say to that i say replied the commander we do not yet have the relic i will not revel and make merry until i hold it in my hands then let us drink to the quest said the baron raising his cup may our joy be swiftly consummated chapter twentyseven their supper was pease porridge and black bread againand for the next three nightsas each days search took the party further into the wild desolate mountains the weather grew steadily worse each day colder than the last the clouds lower darker filled with mist and rain wind blew down from the barren heights buffeting them by day and invading their sleep by night one cheerless day they found one of abus markers in a broad grassy glen nearby lay the remains of a campfire there were tufts of wool on the bushes and brambles and sheep droppings on the ground probably a shepherd taking his flocks down to the lower valleys for the winter observed paulo raising his eyes to the mountain peaks which now loomed over them god willing we will soon be going home too the next day they rode out in the direction indicated by the marker and promptly lost the trail by nightfall they had not found it again it is gone paulo concluded dismally we must have missed a marker suggested yngvar perhaps allowed paulo but i do not think so we will find it tomorrow cait said when the light is better i am sorry donna caitriona he said shaking his head the ground is mostly rock and chippings if not for abu we would not have been able to trail them this long something must have happened to him if he was injured or killed said svein we would have found him on the trail the bandits must have caught him yngvar concluded this is what i think then god help him said dag what are we to do now cait asked turning to rognvald who stood nearby with his arms folded over his chest to keep warm i suspect they have a stronghold hidden in one of the high valleys the tall knight replied we will establish a camp at the last marker and then we will ride out from there and examine each valley in turn until we find them the place rognvald suggested was a grassy dell formed by the junction of two larger glens running either side of a great jutting spur of a peak a freshrunning stream flowed around the foot of the mountain so they never lacked good water there was a sizeable stand of trees on one side of the meadow where they could get firewood and green boughs with which they constructed crude shelters to keep off the worst of the rain and wind not for the first time did cait wish they had been able to bring the tentsand the extra clothing she had left behind the next morning they began searching out the manyfingered valleys following the rough mountain pathways through one windblown canyon after another it quickly became apparent that there were far too many canyons gorges dales and hollows to be explored so to make the most of their efforts they decided to pair off each pair of searchers pursuing a different direction they changed horses every day to rest the animals and allow them to graze on the lush grass of the glen each morning they rode out with hope renewed this day they were certain their dutiful perseverance would be rewarded but each evening they returned to collapse beside the coldwater stream exhausted and frustrated to spend another dank night on the ground each day caits hopes like the late autumn sun rose a littler lower than the day before the light that much weaker and more distant the horses ate their fill of grass and began to grow thick winter coats but cait and her company of knights were not so fortunate they soon ran out of the most perishable provisions eggs cheese and bread then the wine slowly disappeared leaving only the dried meat meal and beans each night there was less to eat and it grew increasingly apparent that if their efforts were not soon rewarded they must abandon the search to return to the lowlands where they might find a settlement or town where they could replenish supplies we have enough for ten more days maybe said dag who had become cook and provisioner for the company they had awakened to find a fine white haze of hoarfrost on the ground a delicate coating of frost edged the stream and spiked the bare branches of the trees after that well it is in gods hands i think the supplies will not outlast the weather paulo pointed out winter is on us the snow is comingit could come any day tomorrow maybe or the day after but soonand when it does it will close off the passes and we will be lucky to get out of here this bleak prediction cast cait into a doleful desperate mood which she hated and so she railed against paulo for speaking it what do you know about anything she snapped if you were but half so observant as you think yourself we would have found alethea long since the knights face fell and he looked at her with sad tired eyes i beg your pardon my lady if i have spoken out of place the slender spaniard appeared so appalled and crestfallen that cait did not have the heart to remain angry at him it is i who must beg your pardon paulo she relented forcing down her emotion you merely speak a truth my heart does not wish to hear the truth yes he agreed sadly but i would give the world to change it they searched two more dayswith no greater success than beforeand then rognvald called for a day of rest cait did not like this any better than the icy fact of winter but she kept her disappointment to herself this time as luck would have it their day in camp proved sunny and calmeasily the best weather they had seen since the raid and aletheas abduction the first snow of the season fell that night and they awoke the next morning to find the ground covered with a fine even layer of gleaming white and a fresh blue sundazzled sky as they were getting ready to ride out svein and yngvar discovered new tracks in the snow a small herd of roe deer had ventured from the wood before dawn the prospect of fresh meat overwhelmed all other concerns and the days search was swiftly abandoned so the men could go hunting cait declined to accompany them forsaking the thrill of the chase for a rest beside the fire keep the flames burning brightly my lady called dag we will bring back a fine buck or two for our supper tonight she sat by the fire gazing at the pale blue spanish sky after a while the supply of firewood began to dwindle and she decided that if there was going to be any roasting of venison that night she had better gather more so taking up the sack and rope the men used she saddled her horse and rode some way into the forest where she found a ready supply of dead wood she filled one sack and dragged it back to camp seeing the men had not returned she decided to fetch another she enjoyed this humble taskthe day was bright and crisp the snow on the trees and on the high mountain peaks gave everything a glistening sheenand allowed her mind to drift where it would losing herself in the aimless flow of her thoughts as she moved among the trees looking for fallen branches that would be easily broken up she thought about sydoni waiting at home worried by their absenceand then remembered that they had originally planned to winter in cyprus so those left behind in caithness were not yet missing them unexpectedly this thought moved her to prayer she prayed that alethea was well and would be found before the supplies ran out and they were forced to give up the search for the winter please almighty father she prayed send a sign that you are with us and that you care no sooner had cait sent up her simple prayer than the answer came speeding back with the swiftness of an arrow for she heard a strange jingling soundlike tiny bells high in the air amazed she looked up quickly the sound seemed to travelas if an angel was gliding slowly from east to west over the treetops but she could see nothing for the closegrown branches she started forward following the sound as it drifted overhead and soon found herself standing on the edge of the wood and gazing up into the crisp blue sunbright sky at a soaring falcon as the majestic bird wheeled through the cloudless heavens she noticed something dangling from its legsthe leather jesses of a trained hunting bird the recognition caused caits heart to quicken such a hawk in flight meant a hunter nearby darting back into the forest she ran to retrieve her mountonly to discover the animal had wandered away probably it had returned to camp leaving her to carry her burden by herself taking up her halffilled sack of firewood she began dragging it over the rough ground scolding herself for failing to adequately secure the horse the sack was heavy and she laboured with it as she struggled back through the trees upon emerging from the wood she paused and searched the sky once more but the hawk was gone unaccountably disappointed she turned and resumed her walk dragging the sack behind her the track down to the camp passed by a hillock around which the stream coursed as it wound through the valley upon drawing even with this small promontory she heard the light clinking jingle of the hawks bells once more and turned towards the sound it was not a hawk this time however but a great black stallion his glossy coat shimmering in the sunlight at the sudden appearance of the beast cait stopped in her tracks and jumped back giving out a small cry of alarm then she saw the man astride the horse his head swathed in a shimmering black turban a richly embroidered black cloak flung back from his shoulders and over the stallions hindquarters he saw her in the same instant and although he gave no outward sign she saw in the quickness of his keen dark glance that he had not been expecting to encounter anyone in the glen that he was a moor was as obvious as the curly black beard on his face in aspect and appearance he looked very like the bandits but where they were sloven and cowardly the man before her was regal bold a man of wealthhis cloak was sewn with silver and his highcantled saddle was fine black leather ornamented with shelllike silver bosses and trimming the horses long thick mane was braided and each braid interwoven with threads of silver cait stood motionless holding her breath as the man regarded her with disarming curiosity turning away he lifted his head and raised his arm into the air he wore a heavy leather gauntlet he uttered a piercing whistle which was echoed by a shriek from on high and an instant later there was a rush and rustle of wings as the falcon swooped down to take its place on its masters fist i give you good greeting woman he said turning his attention to her once more his face was fine and handsome his skin dark and smooth his limbs slender and graceful god keep you sir cait replied releasing the sack of firewood she straightened under his scrutiny resting her hand on the pommel of her sword forgive me for startling you he said but would you mind very much if i asked you why you are encamped upon my land his latin although heavily accented with a thick eastern intonation was spoken with a low strong voice the combination produced a sound which reminded cait of the magician sinjari and the thought produced a feeling of recognition which made her bold i beg your pardon my lord she replied courteously if i had imagined this wilderness canyon belonged to anyone i would never have spent a moment camping here when i might have come to your house and demanded hospitality his smile was a white glint of teeth in the blackness of his beard indeed what makes you so certain that this muslim would honour the request of a christian a wise man once told me that among muhammedans it is considered a sign of true nobility to demonstrate mercy and generosity even to enemies especially to enemies sir he laughed his voice rich and deep the sound roused the falcon on his hand the bird shrieked angrily and flapped its wings hush kiri naughty girl he reached into a pouch at his side and produced a ragged strip of red meat which he fed to the hawk leave us i wish to talk to this charming lady with that he flung the hawk into the air the bird disappeared in a rushing flurry of wings and tinkling of silver bells kiri is a cunning and fearless hunter he said admiringly but she is also exceedingly jealous the moor slid from the saddle then to stand before cait regarding her with a lightly taunting amusement that cait found slightly disconcerting if we are to begin as enemies he said at last let us at least strive for the virtuous nobility celebrated by your wise acquaintance the man was my father cait said lord duncan of caithness then he has my condolences he replied with a smile sir any man who would let such a daughter out of his sight even for a moment must certainly be suffering a most powerful bereavement he smiled again and cait felt a strange warmth flood through her a result she strongly suspected of his shameless flattery i am prince hasan salah ibn alnizar he made a low sweeping bow peace be with you may allah the munificent crown all your endeavours with triumph and glory forgive my curiosity my lady but what miracle brought you to this lonely and forbidding place cait gave her name and told him she was on pilgrimage from her home in scotland caitriona he repeated then frowned that will never do my poor moorish tongue has not the facility to express the natural mellifluence of your wondrous name i believe i shall call you ketmia insteadif i may be so bold cait repeated the name uncertainly it is not disagreeable i suppose ketmia what does it mean it is the name of one of the most fragrant and beautiful flowers ever to blossom hasan told her in the east it is given to brides on their wedding day for like the loveliness of the flower the memory of that day will last through all time infusing each remembrance with its glorious perfume his smile broke forth in a sudden blaze of delight which cait found endearing when i saw you i thought to myself ketmia very well agreed cait suitably charmed splendid said prince hasan he made a flourish of his hand as if in elaborate acceptance of her will and said it would vastly improve the austerity of my cowbyre of a dwelling if you would accept my hospitality while you are sojourning in my realm since you ask so nicely cait replied i do acceptalthough perhaps i should warn you that i am not alone as it happens i have a company of knights with me five of themall under the authority of lord rognvald of haukeland even so the prince looked to the right and left and back towards the camp are they djinn these warriors of yours by the hair of my beard i cannot see them they are riding to the hunt just now she explained trying to get a little meat for our supper she thought she saw a shadow of displeasure pass over his face as she spoke but it vanished in the sudden sunburst of his smile then let us pray they are successful for fresh meat will be a welcome addition to the banquet which i shall spread before you and your estimable retinue this night he turned and smoothly swung up into the highcantled saddle gather your things if you please he instructed i will send my katib to bring you to my house when you are ready cait thanked him and watched him ride away he stopped at the edge of the wood and whistled for his falcon then lifted his arm and with a wave of his blackgloved hand wheeled the stallion and galloped across the meadow and was gone she stood for a time wondering whether she had done well in accepting the moors offer of hospitality she worried over this for a while and decided that prince hasan was precisely placed to help her find alethea indeed his appearance had all the fortuitous indications of an answer to her prayer the knights returned at midday in a jubilant mood having killed two young stagsa humour cautiously increased when cait informed them they would not have to sleep on the cold wet ground that night tonight we are to banquet with a prince she said and went on to explain her encounter with hasan he is heavensent she told rognvald as the others trooped off to begin preparing the deer more likely a trick of the devil muttered the tall knight his face clenched in a scowl of sour disapproval listen to you she scoffed lightly you have not even met the man and already you condemn him in truth he is the very likeness of a nobleman so is the devil rognvald replied he has offered us hospitality and i will not hear a word against him cait snapped indignantly he is a moor rognvald said tersely need i remind you it is the moors who have taken your sister that was unkind my lord cait snarled have i not spent every waking moment these past many days searching for my sister tell me what more i could have done and rest assured i will do that too rognvalds scowl deepened he opened his mouth to reply but cait cut him off as it is she continued levelling the full brunt of her anger on him we are running out of food and the weather is against us therefore i think it no bad thing to accept help when it is offered she glared at him defiantly and yes even from the devil himself the tall knight stared implacably at her his jaw muscles tightened with unspoken words but he held his tongue we are going to accept prince hasans hospitality and at the first opportunity i am going to enlist his aid to help find alethea i do not care whether you approve or not one way or another i will find my sister she did not allow him the satisfaction of making a reply but turned on her heel and stormed away they stayed away from one another as they went about striking camp and preparing to leave the princes katib arrived a short time later and found them ready if not eager to quit the cold and damp for the warmth of hearth and hall like his master the man was gracious and well mannered he was somewhat older than the prince his beard was streaked with grey and his skin was weathered and creased like an old leather glove though not tall he carried himself with a posture which would have become a king dressed in a rich brown cloak and high riding boots he rode a tawny brown mare and carried a long curved knife with a jewelled handle in his wide cloth belt he entered the camp with two attendants one of whom carried a wheatcoloured bundle tied with golden cord the other led a saddled black horse as the knights gathered to receive them he dismounted and in fine aristocratic latin presented himself to cait saying may the light of allah the magnificent shine for you and may his blessing of peace rest upon you he bowed low making an elegant motion of his hand i am alfadil halhuli katib and overseer to prince hasan from whom i have come with an invitation to join him at his home cait received his greeting with good grace while the knights stood looking on from a short distance arms folded across their chests and similar expressions of distrust fixed firmly on their faces they followed rognvalds lead adopting a suspicious stance and made no move to join in the proceedings ignoring their bad manners the katib snapped his fingers and the attendant with the bundle dismounted and came to kneel beside his superior my master the prince has sent me with a gift which he hopes you will do him the very great honour of accepting he motioned to the kneeling servant who extended the bundle in his hands please my lady halhuli said indicating that she should receive the bundle cait took it in both hands whereupon he untied the golden cord and unfolded a handsome hooded cloak of the finest wool she had ever seen it was the colour of wheat and brushed to a soft almost furlike finish the hood cuffs and hem were embroidered with blue silk in a series of tiny swirling filigree loops instantly enchanted with the gift cait took the cloak shook out its folds and held it up before her oh it is wonderful she said forgetting her composure in her enthusiasm it is easily the finest i have ever seenby far the cloak was indeed exquisiteyet it was more the completely unexpected nature of the gift that so amazed and delighted her however if she had seen that rognvalds scowl had reappeared in force she might have reined in her excitement somewhat and if she had seen the disapproving furtive glances the knights exchanged with one another she might have recovered the greater portion of her natural dignity and bearing while the katib held it up for her she put her arms through the sleeves and turned drawing the splendid garment around her luxuriating in its richness and warmth it is true what my master has said he told her you have eyes like the very houri of paradise to caits embarrassment she coloured under this blandishment and it brought her to herself once more i thank you my lord she began if you please my lady he interrupted smoothly i am simply halhuli i deem it the utmost pleasure to serve you he turned and spread his hands in a gesture of deference and said now if you are ready my lords we can proceed my master is waiting to welcome you and i assure you he is most eager to make your acquaintance with a flick of his hand halhuli sent his bearer hurrying to bring his horse though it was but a few paces behind him at the same time the other servant dismounted and came on the run leading the black horse taking caits hand the katib helped her into the saddle and then resumed his own mount without another word or backward glance the princes overseer turned and rode from the camp with cait at his side the knights gathered the pack animals and hurried after chapter twentyeight the short day faded with high clouds coming in from the north on a bitter wind the mountain tops were soon lost to view and the sky grew dark and heavy long before they came in sight of their destination although she tried cait found it difficult to maintain her sense of direction one desolate treefilled valley was very like another and one twisting trackless bare rock ridge the same as all the rest after they had travelled a fair distance into the mountains they paused it is not far now halhuli told her turning in his saddle he lifted his hand and said behold aljelal the palace of prince hasan salah alnizar cait looked up to see high on the towering ridgewall before her a low boxlike structure squatting on the edge of an almost vertical curtain of rock rising from the valley floor the lofty dwelling built of the same drab stone as the surrounding mountains was so uniformly colourless and dull that if the katib had not stopped to show her she might never have noticed it the party continued on and soon reached the end of the valley and began the ascent of the ridge by way of a paved trail once atop the ridge they saw that the palaceor as halhuli said the alqazr occupied a natural hollow in the upper part of the slope and had been built in the manner of a series of graceful steps rising to the top each one slightly higher than the last the whole was surrounded by a stone wall the gates of which closed upon the ridge trail sealing off the only path leading to or from aljelal as a stronghold it possessed little in the way of fortification the wall was the only defensive structure and it had no towers as an example of the builders art it lacked any redeeming aspect indeed the dismal mudcoloured stone with which it was constructed appeared unspeakably dreary and cheerless beneath the low grey skies the prison in damascus had more to charm the eye than this foul nest grumbled yngvar under his breath svein and dag grunted in agreement cait heard and though she turned to glare at them for their discourtesy she knew they were right she looked up at the high lonely house and her heart sank at the thought that she had exchanged the freedom of the wind and stars for a forlorn and comfortless rock of a fortress the gates opened as they drew near and they passed through and into a wide sloping yard a row of iron stanchions had been set up with a torch fluttering from the top of each one beneath each flame fluttered a golden banner with the princes crest a falcon soaring above a curved moorish sword beyond the row of banners stood the first of the palace buildings the princes reception hall the massive cedar doors were open and whiterobed servants stood with torches at either side of the entrance as the visitors were dismounting the prince appeared in the doorway and came hurrying swiftly down the steps to join them he walked directly to rognvald and stretched out his empty hand in greeting my lord rognvald he said i am pleased to welcome you and your men to my home as the knights gathered around their lord and leader the prince said i am hasan salah ibn alnizar prince of the house of tashfin your presence will make a most entertaining diversion during this bleak season indicating the dressed deer carcasses slung across the backs of two pack mules he said i compliment you on your success as it happens my lands boast the best hunting in all of aragon i look forward to riding with you one day soon my lords for a certainty replied rognvald with but slight hesitation we would like nothing better splendid exclaimed the prince with your permission i will instruct the kitchen to prepare the stags to be served with our banquet tonight now then he said motioning to the waiting katib if you please halhuli will lead you into the hall the knights moved off and the prince turned to cait lady ketmia you must forgive me for leaving you unattended but i wished to escort you personally stepping before her he caught up her hand and brushed it with his lips the cloak is to your liking it is beautiful she said and i thank you my lord it is a very thoughtful gift and much appreciated on a day like this my pleasure entirely taking her hand he turned and led her up the steps and in through the open doors the winter wind can be devilish in these mountains the wool comes from a kind of goat that roams the peaks around here it is very soft but also extremely warm i am glad you like it they passed through the open doors into a large vestibule the walls were made of rough stone which had been whitewashed and the floor was polished pine it was simple clean and spare if a trifle plain but at least it was not as dire as cait had feared and it was warm there were two doors at either end of the vestibule and through one of them cait could see the last of the knights disappearing down a long corridor prince hasan conducted her to the opposite door where two young women were waiting both had long black hair which was worn in a single braid and both were dressed in the same white loosefitting robe the male servants wore at the princes approach the maids bowed low and remained in that posture until their lord had acknowledged them this is mahdi and pilai he told cait they will be your maidservants during your sojourn here i have instructed them to take very good care of you so please allow them to fulfil the charge they have been given the sight of the two young women cheered cait and improved her spirits immediately she had allowed herself to imagine the prince the sole tenant of his bleak windswept haven surrounded by the kind of rank squalor men descend to when there are no women around to maintain decency and order the fact that she was provided with not just one but two maidservants all to herself suggested otherwise are there many women here she asked a fair number replied the prince affably yet i feel there is always room for at least one moreespecially when that one brings such great cheer to the bleakness of the dark season it was blatant flattery but lightly spoken and cait decided it would be churlish to object to it she decided to ignore it and instead asked what of your family prince hasan is it large or small very large ketmia like all good moors our family is both numerous and industrious some of them live here with me some on the lower estates in the valley and some in almaghrib the corridor turned and they came to another pair of polished wood doors and as the maidservants opened one for cait to pass through the prince halted here i must leave you he said this passage leads to the womens house it is not permitted for men to enter beyond this door why ever not wondered cait in a muslim palace the prince explained men and women do not share the same apartmentsa practice which creates some small inconveniences as you might imagine yet we find the virtues far exceed any difficulties and the separation promotes an ease of life which is commendable in many ways i trust you will find the womens house to your liking addressing the two maids he spoke in rapid arabic they bowed in response and he said they will bring you to the banqueting hall when all is ready i leave you in their capable hands he turned and walked away and cait stepped through the doorway and into a dream beyond the threshold the corridor opened on to a great ovalshaped inner courtyard with a doubletiered gallery running around the perimeter in the centre of the courtyard an alabaster fountain splashed into a round pool lanterns glowed from the gallery posts and lamps burning with fragrant oils lined pathways on which patterned carpets in red blue and green were laid over smooth stone there were small palm trees and broad leafy plants in huge painted jars and here and there low tables and cushions where the inhabitants of the womens house might meet to recline and talk caits maidservants picked up lamps and started along the righthand pathway beneath the overhanging gallery cait followed passing a series of small doors before coming to a flight of stairs leading to the level above the maids indicated that they were to climb the stairs one went before cait and one after to light her way there were but four doors opening off the upper gallery they passed two of these and stopping at the third the foremost maidservant motioned for cait to open the door instead of a latch handle cait saw only a silken cord with a tassel on the end encouraged by the maid she took the tassel and pulled the door swung open and she stepped into a room unlike any she had ever seen there were lamps and candles by the dozenhundreds of them large and smallfilling the room with gleaming shimmering light the walls were covered with glazed tiles in gemlike colours the floors were polished wood and the ceiling the ceiling was wood too but carved into a fantastic dizzying pattern of intersecting lines each place a line crossed another was inlaid with a motherofpearl boss in the shape of a star in the flickering candlelight the ceiling seemed to glitter with a thousand slivers of light the room was spacious and open divided only by a few pierced wooden screens as in the courtyard below there were low tables surrounded by cushions and these were placed on thick wool carpets displaying impossibly intricate designs there was a woven rug hanging on the wall too and a row of small round windows covered with glass behind one rank of screens was a low cushioned platform covered in glistening blue silk this cait guessed was her bed she stood for a long moment taking in the bewilderingly beautiful sight and then gasped it is magnificent her maidservants appeared to enjoy her amazement and smiled behind their hands it is the most wonderful room i have ever seen they laughed at this and cait asked if all the rooms were as sumptuous as the one she had been given it was then she realized her servants neither spoke nor understood latin at the end of the room opposite the bed stood another screen and behind it a carved panel set in a niche while one maid busied herself with a wooden chest beside the bed the other led cait to this panel taking the silken cord in her hand she pulled and the panel slid effortlessly aside a rush of warm moist air flooded over cait as she stepped into the doorway to see a smaller roomthe interior of which was almost entirely taken up by a pool of water curling tendrils of steam rose from the surface of the pool and one look sent a melting feeling through cait the next thing she knew the maidservant was removing her cloak and boots her swordbelt girdle and mantle followed and cait found she could not shed her clothes fast enough she moved to the edge of the pool and shrugging off the last of her clothing stepped down into the delicious hot water the blessed warmth made her weak in the knees and she gave herself to it sliding in submerging herself slowly the pool had a stepped ledge at the bottom on which she sat feeling the heat seep into her cold and weary bones with a splash her maid mahdi entered the pool in one hand she held a small brass jar and in the other a lumpen loafshaped object these she placed at the side of the pool and with a stirring gesture indicated that cait was to sit with her back to her she did so and mahdi began laving water over her head using the pale lumpy objectcaits first encounter with a sponge mahdi then poured some liquid from the jar into her mistresss wet hair and began to wash it for her more intimate ministrations followed wherein caits body was lathered and washed and dried and her flesh perfumed with fragrant oils rubbed into her skin although sorry to leave the warmth of the bathing room she allowed herself to be wrapped in a great fluffy cloth and led back into the bedchamber where pilai had chosen clothes for her from the chest beside the cushion bed the garments were so far as cait could tell most exquisitely made and of the finest fabrics in shades of scarlet and deepest crimson some woven with gold thread to form glittering stripesand all of them somehow to be worn lifting one gossamer length of cloth after another she admired each in turn but try as she might she could not discern how they should be assembled her maidservants soon took her in hand however and dressed her in the manner of an eastern princess layer upon layer the loosefitting garments were wrapped and draped and secured here and there by way of ties and laces cait relished the smooth liquid sheen of the cloth and its delicate texture against her skin as each new piece was added to the others the maids worked together with quiet efficiency clearly enjoying their labours and cait began to feel as if she were a young bride dressing for her wedding just as they were finishing there came a knock at the door followed by the entrance of a tiny old woman bearing a lamp at her appearance both serving maids bowed giving cait to know that she was their superior the overseer of the womens quarters most likely the old woman moved forward with small quick steps and came to stand before cait and by the soft glow of her lamp proceeded to make a lengthy inspection of the newcomer examining caits hands feet and face she untied the cloth belt around caits waist smoothed it between her fingers then carefully rewound and retied it satisfied she spoke a word of command to the two maids pointing to caits bare feet pilai scurried to the chest and brought out a pair of thin black sandals the soles of which were soft leather and the tops black silk with tiny pierced pearls sewn in spirals over each instep cait waited as the sandals were slipped on to her feet whereupon the old woman stepped back and cast a sharp critical eye over their efforts then with a sharp nod of her head she turned and led them from the room through a series of interconnecting corridors vestibules reception rooms and antechambersso many that cait lost all sense of directionthey came at last to a halllike room fronted by a pair of tall narrow doors bound in gilded leather ornamented by a pair of falcons one on each panel their images traced in black nails hammered through the gleaming hide before each panel stood a servant who at the approach of the old woman stood up smartly and tugged open the heavy doors the old woman indicated that she should enter so cait followed by her two serving maids stepped through the entrance and into what she could only describe as the interior of an impossibly large tent the ceiling was hung with great swooping drapes of cloth attached to the tops of the rooms numerous slender columns which took on the aspect of tent poles and from which large manyflamed oil lamps hung on brass chains the wide expanse of floor was covered by rugs of every size and colour piled one atop another in a profligate display of wealth and here and there around the room were clumps and clusters of enormous satin cushions inexplicably cait remembered the first time she had entered a cathedral with her stepmotherthe great church at kirkjuvagr in orkney while her father was talking some business or other with the tradesmen sydoni had taken her to see the cathedral and she remembered trembling with wonder at the astonishingly majestic building so strange and mysterious she felt it must have been enchanted she felt the same way now as with slow deliberate steps she moved into the room eyes wide with amazement at the elaborate strangeness of her surroundings as the doors closed silently behind her a new serving maid appeared greeted her in arabic and offered a tray containing a silver cup a heap of bread torn into small bits and a bowl of salt it was she recognized a ritual of welcomethe scots observed a similar custom taking a piece of bread she dipped it in the salt and then ate it the serving girl then presented her with the cup filled with sweetened wine she took a drink and replaced the cup she heard the sound of voices in the antechamber beyond and turned as the doors opened once more to admit rognvald and the knights they trooped in following a serving boy with a blue turban even from where she stood cait could see that they had bathed and shaved and like her they had been provided with clothes for the festivities of the eastern variety well made and of good cloth only slightly less opulent than her own unlike her however they moved uneasily in their finery as men unaccustomed to such luxury one by one they paused to partake of the bread and salt and accept a drink of sweet wine upon seeing cait they immediately gathered around her and exclaimed over her exotic dress oh my lady said yngvar his tone one slow gasp of pleasure how beautiful you look no queen ever appeared more elegant agreed svein dag nodded enthusiastically and added nor more lovely the spanish knights murmured their approval and she turned to rognvald as he raised the cup from the tray what say you my lord of sombre mien she asked teasingly i make a fine princess do i not passing fine my lady he said softly she saw something in his eyes then that took her aback she had meant the question to be a playful if somewhat impish jest but staunch rognvald was in grave earnest suddenly embarrassed she looked away just as the doors opened once more to admit their host prince hasan and with him a slender young woman with long dark hair and large dark eyes the prince greeted his guests effusively making much of the remarkable alteration in their appearances then he introduced the woman beside him saying my friends may i present to you my sister danji the woman pressed her hands together and bowed gracefully unfortunately she does not speak latin but i thought her presence and that of her handmaidens would make this evenings festivities more enjoyable turning to the knights he said my lord rognvald perhaps you would be so kind as to present your men to me i would know the names of those who share my table tonight of course prince hasan he replied drawing his eyes away from the lovely ravenhaired woman standing demurely beside the prince then beginning with yngvar he presented each of the knights in turn to the prince and his sister introducing himself last when these formalities had been observed the prince called everyone to join him at table and proceeded to the centre of the room where a cluster of cushions had been arranged to form an open circle he dropped on to a cushion in the centre of the horseshoeshaped arrangement and waved others to their places here lord rognvald he called sit at my right hand and you my lovely ketmia sit with danji at my left when everyone had been seated he clapped his hands and there appeared a succession of serving men bearing low tables which they placed before the diners hard on the heels of the men came a dozen serving maids to spread each table with a spotless white cloth no sooner were the cloths in place than brass trays appeared bearing sweet dark wine in silver cups when each guest had been given a cup prince hasan opened his arms in a gesture of benevolence and declared tonight it pleases allah the almighty and munificent to bless this company with feasting that the bonds of friendships may be strengthened between men of faith and goodwill eat and take your ease that we may rise from this table better friends than when we first sat down together thus the banquet began chapter twentynine now then hasan said leaning his chin on his palm how did you come to be wandering around in my mountains they had feasted on spiced lamb and kid and on strips of fresh venison which the princes serving maids cooked for them over charcoal braziers set up beside the tables when the meat was done they transferred the roasted strip to the bowl of each individual guest using extremely long forks the knights had not seen this before and took an instant liking to this method of cooking and serving meat there were also rich highly seasoned stews of vegetables and fragrant rice with dates and almonds and plenty of honeysweetened wine the princes sister danji summoned six of her handmaids to come and join the festivities so that the knights might have a pretty companion to share the meal as a result the somewhat icy wariness of the men melted in the warmth of the princes lavish and convivial hospitalityexcept for rognvald who while allowing himself to enjoy the meal nevertheless maintained a discreetly guarded attitude towards the prince as you have discovered my alqazr is far from any roads and travellers seldom pass this way he continued looking from one to the other of them as he reclined on his elbow amidst the cushions what brought you here despite rognvalds cautious glance cait decided the moment had come to tell hasan about her sisters abduction and secure his aid in all it is easily told she began we were on pilgrimage following the valley road some distance from here when we were attacked by bandits they killed five of our men but we fought them off only to find when the battle was over that my sister alethea had been taken a shameful business to be sure said hasan but alas far too common in these remote regions this is a wild land in many ways the assault came at dusk rognvald put in or we might have made good the pursuit as it was we followed the trail until we lost the light and were forced to give up the chase a pity sympathized hasan and the next day you resumed the search but he sighed it was too late they were always too far ahead and eventually you lost the trail that is exactly what happened said cait much impressed how did you know because that is the way of these brigands they attack at dusk and make off with whatever they can carry trusting darkness to cover their path they ride through the night so that when dawn comes they are far ahead of any pursuit just so said rognvald we would not have come this far only one of the servantsa syrian fellow named abuhad followed lady alethea he marked out the way for us but then the markers stopped cait said we made our camp in the place where we saw the last marker that was five days ago we have been searching for the trail ever since you will not find it hasan told her how many bandits did you say made the attack cait glanced at rognvald who said i make it at least twelve but there may have been more then unless i am mistaken it was ali waqqar said the prince his tone suggested both familiarity and contempt yuallah he is the worst he and his rabble of outcasts have been a scourge of thievery and murder for far too long you know them wondered cait hope quickening inside her once more alas i do know themand wish to heaven that i did not replied hasan his voice thick with animosity once ali waqqar was a fine warrior and leader of men he led the army of sultan alfarama in his wars to recover saragossa when the sultan was finally defeated the army dispersed and ali waqqar has lived as a bandit and cutthroat ever since if you know them suggested rognvald perhaps you also know where to find them they know the mountains well and they have many places to hide such is the fear they inspire the people look the other way when they pass thus they are not easy to find the prince paused and shook his head sadly i am sorry my friends that this has happened is unfortunate that this has happened within the boundary of my realm is unforgivable from this moment he said his tone growing more adamant i will make it my sole concern to find ali waqqar and his brigands and bring them to justice drawing himself up he placed his right hand over his heart and said prince hasan alnizar makes this solemn vow and i will not cease until you are joyfully reunited with your beloved sister and your valorous servant i pray you swift success cait told him achieve your aim and you shall win a loyal and loving friend praise allah the magnificent i could ask for nothing finer so caught up were they in pledging their fealty to one another neither saw rognvalds tight slightly scornful grimace as he lifted his cup to his mouth do you have a wife lord hasan he asked abruptly the prince regarded him with mild surprise i have been married yesonce when i was a very young man he said only once i thought muhammedans kept wives the same way herders keep cattle cait incensed at the knights bad manners glared furiously at him in an effort to make him desist he took no notice some may take more than one wife it is permitted hasan forced a thin smile although not advised as the great qadi tukhmin has said a house with many wives is like a ship with many oars but no rudder and you my friend have you ever been married no replied rognvald returning to his cup one day perhaps god willing but not yet hasan nodded sympathetically god wills all good things for his children i am sure you will find the very woman one day and then qismah your fate will be well and truly sealed from somewhere outside of the hall there came the sound of a gong instantly danji and her handmaidens rose and bowing to the prince and his guests they departed the knights sorry to see the women go looked to their host for an explanation it is the hour of covering the fire hasan told them from ancient times my people have observed this practice you see we were once a desert people and each night the signal was given to cover the fire so that all would know when it was time to sleep he smiled but please you are guests in this house you must not interrupt your revelry on account of this quaint custom seeing a chance to establish some small authority of his own in this strange place rognvald said we will observe your custom lord hasan for we too must sleep if we are to renew our search in the morning he stood i thank you for your kind consideration certainly it was the best meal we have had in a very long time now if you please we will leave you in peace to cait he said i bid you good night my lady the other knights recognizing the signal rosealbeit somewhat more reluctantlyand following the example of their lord took their leave they walked from the banqueting room leaving cait and the prince alone i cannot remember a more lavish and delightful feast prince hasan cait said your kindness and generosity have made this a night i will never forget the prince smiled and inclined his head your praise is more than my small effort deserves he paused regarding cait with a pensive expression alas i do not think your lord rognvald approved he is a cold one to be sure but i had hoped the festivity would have warmed him a little please i pray you do not take a moments thought for him he is a frozen norwegian who cannot accept kindness when it is offered cait spoke with more vehemence than she felt but did so for hasans sake proud men often disdain the benevolence of others ah you are as wise as you are lovely sighed the prince it is rare in my experience to find those two qualities united in one woman for as the poet says what can be bought with wisdoms coin that beauty does not own but you ketmia possess both in abundance no one had ever called her beautiful before and caitriona did not know how to reply she tried to think of something to say growing more and more uncomfortable as the prince blissfully silent regarded her with delight akin to rapture until at last she said it has been a most enjoyable night and i thank you not least for undertaking to help us find my sister she rose slowly i must sleep now if i am to be ready to ride in the morning so i will bid you gods rest my lord to be sure said the prince rising slowly i will have jubayar escort you to the womens quarter taking her arm he led her to the anteroom where a very tall very fat man was standing beside the large brass gong he wore a pale blue turban and long unbelted mantle his face was beardless revealing a livid scar running from the point of his chin to his collarbone he regarded cait with a sleepy haughtiness his large fleshy features impassive as she came before him this said the prince is jubayar he is one of my most trusted servants he is a eunuch and therefore has charge of the womens house you will be entirely safe in his protection the big man bowed but said nothing when cait attempted to greet him jubayar the prince shouted and then as an afterthought explained to cait he is also very deaf but he can be made to understand if you speak loudlyalthough he knows no latin turning once more to the large eunuch he spoke a rapid burst of arabic whereupon the servant bowed and with a last glance at cait began leading the way down the corridor cait thanked the prince once more bade him a good night and then hurried after her surly escort mahdi and pilai were asleep when cait entered the room both young women slept on thin pallets at the foot of her bed they roused themselves as she entered and helped her undress folding the numerous items of clothing and carefully stowing them away in the wooden chest they brought out a loosefitting silk gown which she put on and as pilai prepared her cushions mahdi brushed her hair and then skilfully braided it so that it would not grow tangled in the night leaving her maids to put out the lamps cait drifted off to the first truly restful sleep since leaving home that night she saw alethea in a dream she dreamed that she and her sister were in caithness it was a fair summer day and the two of them were walking along the brow of the high promontory to the southeast of banvard the wind was fresh and the sun bright on the water in the bay far below she could hear the rush and tumble of the waves and the mewing of the seabirds as they wheeled and circled in the wide cloudless sky alethea was talking about something which caitriona could not make out she listened in a halfhearted way as thea droned on and on her voice growing slowly fainteruntil cait could no longer hear her any more cait stopped and looked around but could not see her sister she called out once and again but there was no reply fighting down the panic rising in her breast cait tried two more times with no better result on the third try she heard thea answer the voice came from the direction of the sea but sounded far away realizing what must have happened cait rushed to the edge of the promontory and fearing the worst looked over instead of seeing theas mangled body lying on the rocks below she saw instead a steep and narrow trail leading down to the shingle beach and thea herself halfway down along the precipitous track thea wait she cried go no further wait for me i am coming to help you at her cry alethea looked back over her shoulder to where cait was starting down the treacherous path cait no she called do not follow me it is for me to go on alone you will be killed cait shouted come back thea shook her head gently no harm will come to me she put out her hand and pointed to the bay far below you see she said they have come for me i must go with them cait looked and saw that a boat had entered the cove and was making landfall there were a number of women in the boat and they were all dressed alike in long hooded robes of grey with a small curiously short mantle of white covering their shoulders two of the women climbed out of the boat and waded to the shore they came to stand at the waters edge and looking up beckoned thea to them farewell darling sister do not feel sorry for me i have never been happier with that she turned and proceeded down the steep and winding trail cait continued to call after her but she neither looked back nor gave any other sign that she hearduntil after joining the two figures on the shore she turned and lifted a hand in farewell cait watched as her sister waded out to the waiting boat and climbed aboard the boat turned and made its way from the cove and out into the empty sea cait stood on the clifftop long after the boat was out of sight when she at last turned from the wide expanse of water she saw the sky was dark with angry clouds and rain was beginning to spatter the ground at her feet she could hear the howl of the wind rising out of the east and knew there was a storm coming still she refused to leave the place she had last seen dear alethea it was not until the lightning raked the clouds with jagged talons and thunder trembled the ground beneath her feet that she finally turned away only to find that the sky had grown dark and she could no longer see the path the wind whirled around her dashing rain in her eyes and tearing at her clothes and hair she threw a hand before her face and staggered forward the force of the wind almost knocking her to the ground struggling to her feet once more she took a hesitant step and then halted for she did not know which way to go frightened now lest she be swept over the clifftop and hurled to her death on the rocks below she stood shaking with indecision and searching the howling blackness for some sign of the path ahead lightning flashed and she saw illumined by the naked glare the figure of a man robed in white the figures back was to her and he was striding purposefully away this she glimpsed in the brief light before darkness reclaimed the hilltop wait she cried lurching forward the resounding clash of thunder drowned her words but she made for the place where she had seen the white figure wait god help me she cried please wait for me the next lightning flash revealed that the man had paused a few dozen paces further on what was more he bore a distinct likeness to her father could it be she wondered she moved towards him in the darkness her heart quickening in anticipation as she drew close however the whiterobed figure moved on papa she cried hurrying after desperate now to catch him she gathered her wet skirts and stumbled ahead papa it is cait please papa wait for me another jagged flash lit up the sky and she saw in the briefly shimmering light that the figure had stopped again she ran to him as he made to turn and move on she lunged and reaching out caught hold of the trailing edge of his sleeve the man halted and as the sky was torn by another flash she saw his face at last he was a young manmuch younger than her father she could see that nowbut his youthful aspect was belied somewhat by his oldfashioned dress and the way he carried himself carefully as if he did not fully trust his weight to the ground still his dark eyes were keen and his gaze almost distressingly direct his hair was dark and thick and trimmed in the tonsure of a monk oh she gasped it is you greetings caitriona peace and grace be with you always the man said at these words the intensity of the storm seemed to lessen the wind calmed and she could hear him plainly come now there is nothing to fear brother andrewoh please hurry it is thea she pointed back towards the precipitous edge of the cliff she went down there and they took her away we must find her have no fear for alethea the monk told her they could not take her anywhere she did not wish to go but we must save her insisted cait she needs me where alethea has gone you cannot follow he said gently she is at peace now cait stared at him tears starting to her eyes but i do not understand listen to me caitriona you have departed from the true path evil crouches at your heels and only awaits a chance to drag you down beware dear sister she opened her mouth to protest but the white priest raised his hand time grows short the end of the race is near the prize awaits like your father and grandfather before you my daughter you must hold tight to the holy light cling to it caitriona put your faith and trust in it alone and let it be your guide at this brother andrew made to step away cait reached out to take hold of him but her hands closed on empty air and she was alone once more with rain and wind raging around her please she cried do not leave me brother andrew help me help me there came no answeronly the voiceless shriek of the gale and the pelting sting of the rain this was how she awoke with the wild wind screaming over the broken crags pounding the thick stone walls with tremendous fistlike blows that boomed with the sound of thunder rattling the heavy ironbarred shutters and driving the rain through tiny cracks around the windows she could not tell when the storm arose but knew that she had been hearing it in her sleep for some time the candles had blown out leaving her room in darkness deep as the tomb she heard a sound beside her and her dream came back to her in a rush brother andrew she said aloud reaching out and praying the white priest had not abandoned her her fingers touched another outstretched hand she gave a little cry and jerked her hand away ketmia came the timorous quivering voice mahdi is it you the frightened maidservant slipped into bed beside her cait put her arm around the young womans shivering shoulders and gathered her in as she would have comforted alethea she consoled mahdi stroking her hair and telling her there was nothing to fear pilai slept on serenely unaware of the wind and lashing rain so cait and mahdi held vigil together huddled in bed until it was light enough to get up the storm gave no sign of abating with the dawn but as soon as it was light enough to find her way around cait rose and allowed her maids to dress her then escorted from the womens quarters by jubayar she hurried to find prince hasan so the search for alethea could begin anew chapter thirty searching for the prince she found lord rognvald instead he was standing in the vestibule entrance with two fidgety porters the door wide open staring out into a bleak windtorn void of fog and sleet and swirling snow he turned as she came to stand beside him and greeted her with stiff almost frozen formality then observed you are early risen my ladyfor one so late to bed cait returned his chilly greeting and said i could not sleep for the storm she looked out through the open door at the roiling grey mass and felt the cold bite of the wind on her skin a memory stirredof a dream or the lingering impression of a dream something about being lost in a raging gale it passed through her with a shiver and then was gone it must break soon i should think she said hopefully pray that it does rognvald told her for until it spends itself somewhat we cannot resume the search growing impatient at last the porters intervened to close the doors and shut out the icy gale cait and rognvald made their way to the reception hall where a fire had been lit and was now blazing with bright fury on the hearth two servants were adding firewood to the already towering stack under prince hasans commanding gaze at his visitors approach the prince beckoned them to come and warm themselves it is the one regrettable verity of life atop a mountain he said if the weather is bad in the valleys it is always worse hereespecially in winter it is often like this wondered cait extending her hands towards the fire worse ketmia winter arrives with a fury and leaves only with the greatest reluctance we call it alzobaa the ferocious one but the palace walls are stout my forests keep us well supplied with firewood and the harvest of the valleys is always bountiful so we do not often have cause to trouble heaven with our complaints lord rognvald thinks the storm will prevent us from resuming the search cait said hoping for a better word then he is most prudent agreed hasan cheerfully it is unwise to tempt fate on a day like this at caits distraught expression he said yet all is not lost ketmia he took her hand in both of his and pressed it comfortingly for if the storm prevents us from searching it also prevents ali waqqar from escaping to the south do you think that is where they are going to be sure replied hasan winter is mild in the south and he will be able to sell to the slave traders cait had never considered this possibility before and it brought her up short the prince immediately offered consolation have no fear ketmia that will not happen i will not allow it spreading his arms wide he took both cait and rognvald in his stride and said but come my friends this is a disagreeable business to discuss on an empty stomach let us break fast together and i will tell you how i plan to catch this rogue who has abducted the fair alethea for i pondered this matter long last night and this morning allah author of eternal justice has blessed me with a scheme of such simplicity and cunning it could only come by way of divine inspiration he led them through a door to a chamber behind the hearth dim light shone through tiny diamondshaped windows of coloured glass casting the room in shades of deep blue one wall opened on to the hearth so that both the reception hall and the smaller chamber could share the warmth of the fire a number of cushions had been placed around a low table near the hearth and the table laid for a simple meal please sit take your ease my friends said the prince dropping languidly on to a cushion serving maids appeared and began pouring cups of almond milk they unwrapped stacks of flatbread spiced with anise still warm from the oven there was dried fruit and nuts in little baskets and a warm drink made with dried apples infused in hot water and sweetened with honeywhich they served in small cups made of glass cait took a bite of her bread and set it aside if you please prince hasan tell me your plan she said unable to suppress her excitement any longer i must hear it at once then you shall my dove for it is swiftly told tearing a bit of bread from the flat loaf he dipped it into the sweetened almond milk and chewed thoughtfully for a moment before saying you see it came to me that no one chases miceit is an impossible business what do we do instead he paused to allow his listeners to appreciate his subtlety we set a trap yes agreed cait waiting for the prince to expound his philosophy you are saying mused an unimpressed rognvald that we set a trap for this bandit ali waqqar we would still have to find him firstwould we not prince hasan smiled as if at an unenlightened child but we do not go out searching for mice in fact they find us do they not all we have to do is dangle the bait in the right place and praise allah the rogue of a bandit will come to us it will i believe save a great deal of time and effort if ali waqqar is as cunning as you suggest he may not care to risk the trap ah said the prince raising a finger in triumph if the bait is irresistible enough even the most wily mouse will risk the trap he smiled expansively i will simply make the bait so enticing that ali waqqar will have no choice then when we have him where we want him he will have no choice but to surrender alethea that will work cait said hopefully do you not think so rognvald oh indeed my lady he answered stiffly ask any ratcatcher he sipped the warming apple drink and regarded the splendidly pleased prince for a moment before saying tell us more about this trap of yours as you know it is my belief that the bandits will try to sell alethea in the slave markets of alandalusmost likely in balansiyya or mayurika forgive me ketmia but a young woman of your race would bring a very great price in tunis monastir or rabat naturally the price would be even greater for a virgin prices in excess of thirty thousand dirhams are not unusual and if the woman is truly beautiful the price could easily climb to as much as fifty or sixty thousand dirhams i had no idea said cait a little awed by the exorbitant amount oh yes hasan assured her and that is your sisters greatest protection for the bandits are well aware of the value of a fairfaced virgin thus we can be certain that your sister has not been harmed in any way as the poet says if evil is an oyster hope is the pearl you see even a brute like ali waqqar will want to make the best price so he will take good care of her believe me i pray you are right prince hasan said rognvald even so i cannot see how this helps us to find alethea ah impatience often begets impetuosity my lord i am coming to it in good time as you yourselves have seen for brigands like ali waqqar these mountains provide countless hiding places a man might search for a hundred years and never find his quarry but settlements are few and all of them are within easy reach of this fortress now then he leaned forward grinning with wily exuberance ali and his band of thieves must obtain supplies from one settlement or another i propose to send word throughout the realm that prince hasan wants to buy a white slave we will say that i have grown bored and lonely on my mountaintop and wish to divert myself with a female slavea luxury for which i am happy to pay sixty thousand silver dirhams hasan gave a little laugh and lay back then we simply sit back and wait for ali waqqar to come to collect his fee and when he appears he clapped his hands together smartly snap we have him it is indeed an ingenious plan cait granted however there is one thing which i question only one muttered rognvald sourly ignoring him cait asked how can we be certain ali waqqar is still in the region he might be fleeing south even now would it not be wise to send men to search the southern trails if what you say about the slave markets is trueand i do not doubt itwe might catch him along the way my thoughts exactly agreed rognvald he tore off a bit of bread and popped it into his mouth assuming that it is ali waqqar and assuming that he would be making for the coast how do we know he is not hastening there even now my friends said hasan yu do not know ali waqqar as i know him he has long been a bane to me and to my people we have suffered his thieving and plundering far too long nothing would give me greater pleasure than to crush him like a worm beneath my heel perhaps if i had been more vigilant in the past we might never have come to this difficult pass but i have vowed before almighty allah the saviour of the righteous to bring a swift end to this brigands predation and restore your sister to her rightful place stretching his hand towards cait who grasped it with unseemly alacrityso it seemed to rognvaldthe prince said my beautiful ketmia i could not endure the thought of seeing you bereft to reunite you and your loving sisterthat has now become the pure flame of my ambition raising her hand to his lips he kissed it by the will of allah i shall not rest until i have brought about this reunion rognvald watched this immodest display through narrowed eyes but cait much taken with the prince already found her heart beating a little more quickly for his promises unable to stomach any more rognvald rose and begging the princes pardon took his leave saying that he wished to see to his men i want to be ready to ride out as soon as a break in the storm permits he said rising he acknowledged the prince with a bow then turned and strode quickly from the roomalmost colliding with jubayar who was lurking at the door cait watched the tall knight depart before turning to prince hasan to apologize i pray you forgive lord rognvald my lord he seems to have forgotten himself since coming here ah well as the poet says warriors like swords grow dull with neglect all men of action feel inactivity an onerous burden no doubt he will feel more at ease when he can return to the saddle you are too kind my lord prince if i am it is your good influence upon me he kissed her hand again you inspire me to greater virtue and i am happy to be so inspired they spent the rest of the morning together the prince showed cait through various chambers halls courts and quarters each more sumptuous than the last with rare woods carved and inlaid in fantastically intricate patterns and fine coloured marble in some the walls were smoothplastered and painted with rich glowing colours in others the walls were decorated with ornate and costly tiles some had windows fitted with triangles of coloured glass and others with grills of carved wood or stone some of the rooms were spacious and grand while others were intimate as bedchambers whether large or small however the rooms were immaculate in cleanliness and conception revealing the full splendour of the intellect that had created them each room was named and the names were wondrous too zaffira caravanserai ivory court the ladies tower red sirocco and one called evening narjis where the deepcoloured tiles reminded cait of a peacocks feathers and so instantly it became the peacock room as they went on cait could not help but notice that the rooms although exquisite to the tiniest detail were uniformly devoid of furniture after viewing one barren expanse after another her curiosity grew unbearable truly i have never seen such a wealth of magnificence yet i cannot help wondering where all the furnishings have gone prince hasan put his head back and laughed the sound of his voice full and deep oh ketmia you are a very marvel of practicality yes the rooms are bare until the moment when i decide which shall be occupied and for what purpose then the things i require are brought by my servants and arranged as need dictates cait thought this practice highly resourceful and expressed such delight at the ingenuity of it that prince hasan said allow me to demonstrate now then of all the rooms you have seen so far which do you favour cait was ready with her reply oh it must be the peacock room the colours are exquisite the prince appeared pleased with the choice splendid i knew you would choose that one it is one of my special favorites too so tonight we will dine in the peacock room you and i and i will show you how this feat is accomplished cait spent the rest of the day examining the books in the princes considerable collection obtained in various places throughout the arab world each one was bound in fine leather and although written in the graceful flowing arabic script which cait could not read she enjoyed looking at the painted pictures which adorned page after page one book contained scenes of life along the river nile the great mosq of cairo and the sphinxand this one she especially enjoyed you like this book said hasan enjoying her delight i can see it in your eyes oh yes very much she said you see my father was once a guest of the caliph of cairo he told me about it many times and in these paintings i can see what he saw you love your father observed the prince i can hear it in your voice when you speak of him i did yes he was a fine man he is dead now and i cherish his memory it is the most precious thing i own then you must have this book so you can look at it whenever you like and remember him in a happier time oh but i could not cait protested a book like thisi have never seen the like it must have cost a fortune i could never accept such a costly gift i have nothing to give you in return prince hasan closed the leatherbound book and placed it in her hands darling ketmia if you only knew how much you have already given me please accept it as but a small token of my great esteem and he gazed intently into her eyes my even greater affection her heart filled with tender thoughts of her father the warmth of the princes breathtaking generosity and so many fragile emotions overflowed in a sudden rush pray excuse me lord she said pushing the tears away but it has been so long since anyone has treated me with such kindness and compassion his gaze softened reaching a hand to her cheek he said oh my lovely ketmia you deserve nothing less i would that i could give you such gifts always for although we are but briefly met i feel as if i have known you all my life flustered by this admission cait stood speechless grasping the book she looked down and rubbed the fallen tears from the leather in the end she was saved having to answer the princes declaration by the sound of a gong ringing in one of the antechambers the prince straightened i am called away come i will have jubayar take you back to the womens quarters so that you can rest and ready yourself for this evening the gong sounded again and the prince led caitriona back through a long corridor to one of the reception halls and there commanded the eunuch to conduct her to the womens quarters she looked for rognvald or one of the knights as they walked back through the interconnecting maze of corridors and passages but saw none of the other guests mahdi and pilai were waiting when she returned while she rested they prepared a bath for her and laid out clothes for the evening cait surrendered herself to their ministrations and passed the rest of the day in a pleasant haze of pampered indulgence as evening came on the serving maids dressed her arranged her hair and brought out a necklace of jewels for her to wear and then when she was ready the gong sounded and a few moments later jubayar arrived to take her to her dinner with the prince she followed her escort through the covered courtyard and as they passed the alabaster fountain she heard a rustling sound and turned in time to see prince hasans sister danji disappearing behind one of the leafy palms cait had just a glimpse and then she was gone but received the distinct impression that the young woman had been trying to attract her attention she turned back to find jubayar watching her his wide fleshy lips twisted in a sneer of suspicion and disgust chapter thirtyone caitriona dined alone with prince hasan that night he fed her duckling glazed with a compote of honeyed apricots boiled rice with cardamom and pine kernels and baked quails eggs he plied her with spiced wine and sweetmeats and pledged his love for hernot once but twice and she had accepted his blandishments she returned to her bedchamber slightly dazed and giddy from the heady potion of wine and murmured endearments with the help of mahdi and pilai she undressed and went to sleep contemplating the evening in all its glittering grandeur arrayed like an eastern princess in layer upon layer of costly silks and jewels she had been escorted by jubayar to her dinner with the prince she arrived to find the peacock room completely bare of any furnishings whatsoever and stood for a moment peering into the dim empty interior feeling vaguely disappointed for she had allowed herself to imagine something of the opulence of the previous evening her first thought was that the prince had forgotten his promise then again perhaps she had not understood him correctly as she stood in the centre of the turquoisetiled chamber trying to think what could have happened the prince arrived dressed in flowing black robes edged with gold filigree and wearing a turban of glistening damascus cloth he was the very embodiment of princely nobility slender and tall his trim waist wrapped in a wide cloth belt into which had been bound a long curved dagger with a ruby handle and golden sheath he swept across the room to her in bold eager strides and greeted her with a kiss on both hands sensing her petulance he smiled with wry amusement clapped his hands and in the manner of a sorcerer demonstrating a wonder cried a word in arabic which sounded like haydee doors at the far end of the empty chamber were flung open and a succession of whiteturbaned servants appeared first came four men carrying iron standards one in each hand on each standard a candletree burned with ten lit candles hard on the heels of these first came four more men carrying a lengthy roll of scarletandblue figured carpet which they placed at one end of the room and proceeded to unroll to the other before they had reached the end four more serving men appeared bearing enormous satin cushions on their heads and a smaller carpet roll under their arms no sooner had the first servants finished than the second rank unrolled their rug in the centre of the carpet and placed the cushions on it meanwhile two more servants had entered carrying a low table between them which they placed before the cushions scarcely had these departed when the first returned pushing gigantic pots of hammered brass containing miniature palm trees on wheeled platforms additional tables appeared and more plants and live greenery in beaten brass containers until the room began to take on the aspect of an arabian garden then followed satincovered chests and carved wooden boxes of various shapes and sizes three flaming charcoal braziers and two cauldronshaped copper incense burners and a threepanel pierced screen made of rosewood which was set up behind the bank of cushions and an enormous brass gong lastly a canopy of blue silk was placed over the table and the candles arranged around it to bathe the diners in a golden glow of gently flickering light cait was captivated by the speed with which the transformation was effected and by the wonderful result in her excitement she kissed the prince lightly on the cheek five musicians appeared arranged themselves and their instruments at a discreet distance from the canopy and began to play as the softly swaying melody filled the air hasan lifted his hand and declared this is how a true prince of the orient lives wherever he goes whether to dine or sleep or he paused taking caits hand to receive his honoured gueststhe noble arab has only to command and his naked word is transmuted into magnificence and splendour but come he said leading her to the bank of cushions let us sit and take our ease i have arranged food and entertainment for your pleasure tonight darling ketmia you will sample delicacies to make the angels envious will danji be joining us she asked or rognvald no not tonight he smiled his black eyes glinting in the candlelight tonight my love we spend together you and i cait felt a quiver of illicit excitement at the implications of his declaration but suddenly the skin at the nape of her neck crawled a sensation of dread descended over her and she felt as if she had just seen a snake at any other time this reaction would have warned her now however it irritated her where she demanded of herself was the danger she told herself that prince hasan was an admirable and generous host a thoughtful and trustworthy friend he was elegant wealthy and refined he had already demonstrated his loyalty to her in his vow to save her sister and now he spoke his love no man until now had ever called her beautiful to be thought so thrilled her in a way she could not have imagined who else had ever said the things to her that hasan had said a woman might search all her life for such a man and never find him and here he was beside her bidding her to take her ease and join him in a night of pleasure and delight and yet the prospect for all its seductive charm produced not the rapturous warmth of mutual regard but a thin icy tingle of danger she saw hasans smile and it was the corpselike grin of death why should this be why should his loving declaration raise such dread as she walked to the table and sank down on to the satin cushions she determined to ignore the warning sensations and enjoy the evening to the full firmly and with an air of defiant indulgence she pushed all such unpleasantness from her and wilfully embraced the princes invitation to luxuriate in the warmth of their newkindled affection folding her legs beneath her she reclined on an elbow while the prince taking up a leathertipped mallet struck the gong twice before the sound had faded the door opened and serving maids appearedtwo of them with trays one bearing a jar and two gold chalices and one a selection of silver bowls while one of the serving maids placed the bowls on the table the other poured the wine there is good news said the prince watching the dark wine splash into the golden cups the storm abated somewhat at midday so i was able to send halhuli and some of my men to take word of my offer to the settlements it will not be long i think before we hear word of his whereabouts oh that is good news thank you my lord i owe you a debt of gratitude it is my pleasure to serve you my sweet ketmia said hasan passing her a cup let us drink to a splendid and glorious future together cait accepted the cup without hesitation and thus began a night of such intimacy and tenderness that when she finally rose to return to her quarters she felt as if she were leaving part of herself behind now in the thin morning light as she lay in bed still floating on the ebullient tide of emotion she experienced the first faint twinges of regret outside the storm rampaged with renewed vigour she could hear the galedriven sleet and snow rattling against the windows and the wind booming and bellowing as it hurled itself against the walls in waves like a raging ocean swell she pushed any thoughts of reproach or misgiving firmly aside and got out of bed her serving maids had risen and were waiting to dress her and adorn her hair when they were finished she went out to find rognvald to tell him that he need not worry about resuming the search she found him along with svein dag yngvar and the two spanish knights hurrying across the snowy courtyard to the stables they were dressed in heavy skins wool and leather and carried bags of provisions on their backs at her call the tall knight sent the others on and returned to hear what she had to say the horses are saddled we have provisions enough for three days on the trail with gods help we will return before then but the storm still rages and it may continue for several more days before it is finished we have already lost three days we dare not waste any more there is no need she said lightly the prince has already sent word to the settlements we have only to wait and ali waqqar will soon bring alethea to us i beg your pardon my lady but i do not think it wise to abandon the search now you are just being stubborn she told him and you are being gulled by a man used to having every whim satisfied he replied straining to keep his tone even mark me a dalliance with a man like hasan can only end in misery how dare you come highhanded with me she charged instantly furious with him and i will thank you not to speak of our benefactor in that coarse and insinuating way benefactor rognvald dismissed the notion with a scornful laugh that man only thinks to benefit himself i should have thought a woman of your discernment would recognize a poisonous snake when she saw one take that back she snapped hasan has treated me with more respect and esteem than any man i have ever met he is a prince in both word and deed and a nobleman worthy of the name is he the knight challenged is he indeed then consider this do you not think it strange how this noble man seems to know such a great deal about the price of slaves in tunis what of that cait countered waspishly even know the ransom price of a pigheaded knight rescued from a damascus prison rognvald glared at her his mouth a firm hard line his blue eyes bright with cold fire nothing else to say my lord sneering does not become a lady nor does petty spite and envy appear more seemly in a man she retorted if you could keep your contemptible observations to yourself i would count it a blessing still glaring he made a curt bow as you will pray give my regards to your prince my men and i will resume the search for abu and your sister then go for all the good it will do he stepped quickly to the door and paused i made a vow before god he said in solemn earnest then hurried out into the storm furious still and determined not to allow him the satisfaction of the last word she dashed to the open door and shouted after the swiftly retreating figure hasan is twice the man you are her words were lost in the rattling howl of the wind rognvald walked on and the sleety snow soon took him from view she turned to the door and pushing with all her might slammed it shut with a booming thump the sound brought the two porters on the run they admonished her in rapid arabic but she paid no heed and stalked off leaving them to wipe up the puddle of melted sleet on the floor seething inside she stormed along the deserted corridors of the alqazr smacking her fist against the wall now and then and cursing rognvalds insufferable insolence she swore on her soul that she had never known a more vexatious and annoying man she did not know which was the more irksomethe norwegian lord himself or the fact that impudent as he undoubtedly was he was also right a dalliance with the prince could bring serious not to say disastrous consequences not yet ready to admit as much cait dismissed the thought from her mind and made her way back to the womens quarters without pausing to summon jubayar to escort her presently she reached the covered courtyard and paused at the fountain to look at the water lilies and chide herself for being so angry with rognvald she was gazing at her own glum reflection in the water when she heard the soft brush of a light step on the gallery above and glanced up to see hasans sister danji watching her intently forcing a smile she raised her hand in greeting and drew breath to speak before she could utter a word however the young woman silenced her with a frantic gesture and motioned for her to come up on to the upper gallery glancing around quickly to make certain they were unobserved cait hurried up the stairs only to find that danji had moved on she was standing a few paces away and as cait made to join her she disappeared through a door leading to one of the inner chambers uncertain what to do cait hesitated and a moment later danjis hand appeared beckoning her on cait hastened to the door which was open and stepped inside the room was cold and dark the only light coming from a small window covered by a heavy grill with a look of intrigue that sent a quiver of complicity racing through cait the young woman pulled her into the room and closed the door behind her she then moved to the window and motioned for cait to follow i must speak to you danji said but we must never be seen together her voice trembled but whether with fright or cold cait could not tell promise me you will tell no one you can speak latin said cait you must promise danji insisted now this instantor i will tell you nothing i do promise i will tell no one what passes between us she agreed firmly very well do not think me unkind but you must leave here at once it is not safe she gripped caits arm for emphasis you must believe me why what is wrong danji glancing around as if she feared they would be overheard danji shook her head i can say no more why must i leave you are in danger she edged closer to the door cait held her tell me why where is the danger please i can say no more he would kill me if he found out i spoke to you danji moved quickly to the door cait followed who she asked but received no reply clearly she would get no more from the frightened woman this way and decided to try another approach no harm will come to you she said trying to reassure her i thought hasan said you could not speak latin hasan says many things the young woman replied he said also that i was his sister are you not no opening the door a crack danji peered out to see if anyone was watching as she stepped out on to the gallery she looked back over her shoulder i am not his sister she whispered i am his wife chapter thirtytwo in anjou before the snow muttered renaud de bracineaux thickly as he stared at the muddy track before him whitetopped mountains in the distance seemed to be holding up a sky like rumpled grey wool winter at your estatethat is what you said he spat into a puddle i blame the emperor the baron replied indifferently if we had not been made to lavish attendance on his silly cow of a niece we would have been there and back by now de bracineaux continued as if he had not heard not to mention the priest disappearing ho now i will not have that laid at my feet danjou objected anything might have happened to him wild animals might have got him for all we know gods teeth snarled the templar it was that damnable woman and that is another thing you were wrong about he regarded the man on the horse beside him with rank disgust i am curious tell me danjou have you ever been right about anything in your life sergeant gislebert reined up just then the company is ready commander de bracineaux cast a glance at the long double rank of troops and pack animals and wagons the knights sat humpshouldered on their mounts hooded their oncewhite surcoats now brown with mud they looked like the ruined remnant of a vanquished army turning away abruptly the commander looked again at the low sullen sky as rain began to spatter on the mudslick road let us make a start he said god knows we will not get far today raising a hand he signalled the columns to move forward and they rode on into another day of drizzle and cold at midday they stopped at the ford of a swiftrunning stream to rest and water the horses while there the scouts who had been sent out the previous day returned the commander met them as they rode in well he said impatience making him sharp we have found something my lord said one of the templars we think you should take a look what is it remains of a camp said the second knight how far not far we can be there by nightfall de bracineaux accepted this estimate without comment he turned to gislebert get fresh mounts for these men he ordered and have one of the cooks prepare them something to eat i want to be ready to move on as soon as the horses are watered until now the trail had not been difficult to follow the abbot of logrono reported having spoken to a foreign knight and having attempted to dissuade him and his party from continuing their journey at milagro and carcastillo the villagers told them that yes of course a party of knights passed through they stopped and worked in exchange for bacon flour oats and such yes they said there were women with them and a priest they stayed a few days and then departed heading north and east along the river the templars followed the river too and when the settlements grew so far apart and so far off the trail to be dependable sources of information de bracineaux took to sending out scouts the trail was old but the scouts were expert trackers so the templars slowly followed their quarry further and further into aragons high empty hills with the approach of winter the wind and rain and occasional frost had begun making the thieves trail increasingly difficult to raise for the last two days they had journeyed on without clear indication that they were still in productive pursuit now however the scouts had turned up another clue to help them continue the search a little longer even so de bracineaux knew not to allow himself to become too overjoyed by this development winter was coming to the high country and if he did not discover where the priest was leading his band of thieves before it fell he might never find them the thought that they might yet escape his grasp filled him with an icy and implacable rage that drove him on by the time they reached the place the scouts had marked the day had ended in a damp gloom which descended over the rainsoaked track like a curtain we can see nothing now said de bracineaux set up camp down there he pointed back down the trail to where the troops were waiting if there is anything to see i do not want it trampled into the mud we will give the place a thorough inspection as soon as it is light the tents were raised and the evening meal prepared in the rain and darkfive tents with four men each for the knights one for the commander and one for the baron when space permitted they clustered the tents around two or three large campfires which both warmed them and dried their sodden clothes this night however because of the trees and thick underbrush they strung them in a line along the track and had to rely on small campfires before each tent there was little warmth and no one went to sleep in a dry cloak or boots the next morning dawned clear and while the sergeant oversaw the troops as they prepared to resume the journey de bracineaux danjou and the two scouts rode up to the abandoned campsite dismounting a few score paces away de bracineaux walked to where the fire had burned he squatted down and looked at the ground inside the fire ring the ashes had been washed away by numerous rains all that remained was a milkygrey puddle and a few unburned ends of branches with a small pile of sticks stacked beside the ring of stone rising he turned and looked across the clearing towards the trees a large branch lay on the ground before a rock outcropping between two trees he went to it lifted it and examined the end the cut was ragged it looked as though the branch had been halfchopped halfyanked from the tree he stood fingering the cut and looking around lord commander have you found something asked one of the templar scouts i cannot say he replied i think there was some trouble here you there de bracineaux called to the other scout search in those trees and you he said to the other we know they had a wagon see if you can find any tracks while the scouts carried out their orders the commander walked back and forth slowly over the clearing although it was difficult to tell for certain it did appear as if the turf was broken and churned up in several placesmore than it would be by a company of travellers stopping for a night or two here danjou called de bracineaux look at this and tell me what you think the baron leaned low in the saddle holding his head to one side then the other i think it is too wet and too damnably cold to be searching for weevils in the porridge the ground damn you barked de bracineaux look at the ground he paused for a moment then demanded well it looks as though they have had a falling out a fight among thieves perhaps not among thieves the commander corrected between thieves there is a difference there is every difference danjou replied de bracineaux he then declared they were attacked the baron regarded the muddy patch doubtfully a bit of scuffedup turf is hardly indication of a pitched battle scout shouted the commander the nearest templar came running fetch the sergeant and four more men i want a search made of the perimeter the man disappeared on the run and de bracineaux fists on hips head bent down continued his close scrutiny of the soggy ground every now and then he stopped to examine something that caught his eye before moving on again lord commander here called the remaining scout de bracineaux joined the man at the edge of the clearing what have you found it appears to be barley meal replied the knight stooping low over a pale heap of sodden matter the commander knelt and removing a glove picked up some of the soggy stuff he rubbed it between his fingers held it under his nose and sniffed i think you are right there must be a quarter of a barrel spilled there the knight pointed out either someone was very careless or in a very great hurry concluded the templar commander too great a hurry to salvage what he had spilled and there said the scout pointing to four shallow evenly spaced indentations those could be from the wagon wheels danjou approached and sat on his horse a little distance away does anyone smell what i am smelling he asked lifting his beaklike nose into the air something has given up the ghost de bracineaux walked to where danjou head tilted back was sifting the air for the scent it is somewhere off through there he said pointing across the clearing towards a stand of taller trees sergeant gislebert and the additional men arrived just then de bracineaux met them in the centre of the clearing there is something dead in those trees just there he said pointing to the place danjou indicated start your search there call out if you find anything the templars hastened off into the wood and almost immediately the cry came back commander there is a grave baron danjou smiled as he dismounted may never be right but this nose of mine is rarely wrong he followed the commander into the wood and they quickly arrived in another small clearing to find the templars standing beside a wide rectangle of mounded earth a crude cross was pressed into the soft dirt and around it were the spent stubs of burnt branches de bracineaux took one look at the mound and said dig it up the knights hesitated one of their number made bold to reply my lord commander he said pointing to the cross christians are buried here unless you wish to join them growled the commander do as i say dig it up still the knights hesitated my lord said gislebert speaking up the shovel is in the wagon back there damn the shovel gislebert you have swords do you not hands dig slowly and with great reluctance the templars began to burrow into the soft wet earth with their bare hands with every handful of dirt they removed the stink danjou had noticed grew stronger soon the men were holding their noses with one hand and digging halfheartedly with the other as slowly five human forms began to emerge dig damn you cried de bracineaux growing impatient the soil was less damp nearer the bodies and the stench all the stronger the templars continued to scoop away the dirt one or two with tears streaming down their beards the rest clutching the edge of their cloaks to their faces slowly individual bodies were revealed there were five of them two big men in dark brown cloaks laid out on either side of a slender man in black hold called the commander bending near what have we here he pointed to the one in the centre pull the hood away from his face the nearest knight did as he was told and pulled the hood of the corpses dark robe from his face the flesh was wan and waxy but the cold ground had prevented the body from bloating so it still resembled the man that had been the beard was black against the bloodless pallor of his skin and the lips held the hint of a smile it looks like a priest said the templar pulling a small wooden cross from beneath a fold in the robe de bracineaux nodded what about these others he said indicating the corpses either side of the priest another knight pulled back a hood covering one of the faces here the worms were at work on the eyes the sudden sight of squirming halfempty sockets proved too much for the knight who jerked back his hand as if he had been burned a spaniard observed danjou judging from their clothing so are the others indicating the priest he said do you think that could be matthias de bracineaux nodded five dead he mused if the villagers at the last place were telling the truth she has only six left do you want me to bring the archbishop to see the priest asked gislebert he insists they never laid eyes on one another replied danjou bring him anyway the commander ordered for all the good it will do by the rood i wish i had sent him back the man is a very millstone turning to the knights standing nearby he said well search the rest of the area and be quick about it in the end they found nothing elsesave the ragged remains of three human carcasses which had been gnawed by animals the dead were moorish from what they could gather from the remains and scraps of clothing of the company that had been attacked no further signs were found so commander de bracineaux ordered his scouts to begin scouring the area working out in everwidening circles from the camp in the hope of raising the trail again the day ended without success but the next morning one of the scouts found a small heap of rocks beside a nearby streamand another on the opposite side pointing the way they passed this way and marked the place the scout told them they seem to be heading into the mountains hear that danjou said the commander we have found the trail lifting his eyes to the mountains in the distance showing above the trees he continued the hind is swift but the hound is persistent we will yet run her to ground and when we do i will tear her apart chapter thirtythree despite danjis revelation and the urgency of her warning cait dined with hasan again that night and also the next in any event she had little choice rognvald and the knights were still away and she could think of no reasonable apology she might offer to excuse herself without rousing unnecessary suspicionall the more since she ardently professed to enjoy their evenings together and she did enjoy them albeit somewhat warily now as she tried to determine the nature of the danger danji had intimated she perceived no change in prince hasan he remained as charming and engaging as ever and each evenings meal was pure enchantment from beginning to end still the worm of doubt had begun to gnaw its way into her heart was he or was he not the man she thought him to be during the day she pondered this question turning it over and over in her mind on the one hand she could not discern anything amiss in either mood or manner he was solicitous thoughtful respectful and polite in every way on the other hand there was danji if she was telling the truthand cait had no reason to doubt herhasan was not at all as he appeared although she looked for any opportunity to speak to danji alone she did not see the slender young woman againbut she did notice that jubayar was much more attentive and present than previously on the second day the storm subsided and by dusk the sky had cleared cait decided to try the princes integrity for herself when they met for dinner that evening she said the storm has abated and that is a blessing therefore i was hoping we might ride to one of the valley settlements and enquire whether anyone has word of ah waqqar of course my lovely ketmia if that is what you wish replied the prince smoothly after so many days shut inside even the most splendid palace becomes dreary as a prison we will ride down to the valley and see if the seeds i planted have borne fruit he paused as if considering the matter more thoroughly although he began then hesitated no it is not important what is it asked cait alert to even the slightest nuance of deception tell me well he said i do not expect we shall learn anything for if ali waqqar had heard the terms of my offer the rogue would have been here already he smiled suddenly but you must not worry no doubt the storm has prevented word from reaching him yes cait agreed absently i suppose it would be wrong to expect too much just yet hasans smile broadened he held out his hand for hers precisely my love give it another day or so and no doubt the brigand will be beating on these very doors demanding payment and then what will you do asked cait sweetly hasan appeared distracted by the question please what will you do with ali when you catch him why i shall throw him in chains and before the sun has set his ugly head shall adorn a pike above the gate he pulled her to him but come ketmia it is not seemly for a woman to discuss such unpleasant subjects let us talk of finer things i have written a poem for you sit here my lovely and i shall read it out nothing more was said that night and the next morning true to his word the prince had horses saddled and ready for their ride they left before the sun quartered the sky and rode out into a bright crisp winter day the storm had scoured every cloud leaving the vault of heaven clean and polished to a brilliant crystalline clarity wrapped in her fine new cloak cait enjoyed the stinging fresh air and the stunning views from the ridgeway high above the valley floor the trail was steep and winding and so they rode in single file to the valley the prince led followed by halhuli cait came next and then four mounted guards with banners attached to their spears as they neared the lower slopes they passed through a snowdusted forest where hasan pointed out the delicate hoofprints of red deer and the less dainty tracks of wild pigs in the unbroken snow upon reaching the valley floor the snow vanished entirely and the track became a road the nearest settlement was some distance away and it was after midday by the time they reached the place a small upland village of squat whitewashed houses forlorn amidst bare muddy fields at their approach the villagers came out to watch and greet them a gaggle of ragged children wideeyed and stifflegged pointed at the brightly coloured banners and exchanged whispered observations behind their hands while halhuli and his men looked on the prince dismounted and spoke to the villagers in arabic he passed along the line handing out silver coins to one and all the children danced with excitement presently a stout man with a rough beard and dirty yellow turban appeared and with a gesture of welcome loudly hailed the prince hasan turned to cait and called here is abdullah the head man we will learn something now the two walked a little apart from the clutch of villagers cait watched them closely but saw nothing to arouse her suspicion one way or another after their conversation the prince placed his hand on the mans shoulder and then embraced him they parted then and the prince returned to his horse and climbed into the saddle abdullah says that the bandits were seen skirting the village four nights ago before the storm caits heart leapt at this sudden revelation and alethea was she with them did they see her she looked at the man who was now standing beside the princes horse oh please ask him i must know i am sorry ketmia it was growing dark and they were far away the prince spoke to the head man who pointed across the fields to a line of trees in the distance he says they were riding east towards the hills one of the boys saw them and abdullah went to look but could not tell how many there wereeight ten maybe more the prince thanked the villagers and moved his party on escorted from the village by the children who ran along behind ululating in a weird chorus of acclaim they proceeded to the next settlementa short ride away on the other side of the river which divided the valley in half here as before the same custom of greeting was observed and the same discussion alone with the head man of the village a toothless humpbacked old man this timewho told them that two of the bandits had come to the village to buy ground meal and cured bacon it was almost dark when the men appeared the chieftain reported and the villagers were afraid of what the brigands would do if they were turned away emptyhanded so they sold the bandits meal and bacon and some wineand the men rode away on further questioning the old chief said that although he did not see any more riders he knew there were more waiting nearby was it ali waqqar asked the prince who else replied the toothless chieftain it is always ali waqqar then you were right said cait much relieved by what they had learned it is ali waqqar her relief was shortlived however for in the very next breath she asked but now that he has provisions what if he has moved on what if he is riding south even now peace dearest ketmia a little faith can move great mountains so it is written is it not you must trust me he remounted his horse cast a quick look at the sky and said i think we should begin the journey home so soon asked cait alas my love even a prince cannot prevent the sun from setting he smiled sympathetically still it has been a good day we have learned much and i have repeated my offer of ransom it will not be long now i think before we obtain your sisters release thus they started back reaching the steep trail to the high alqazr as the sun dropped below the ridge to the west casting the valley in shadow they were just beginning the long climb up the winding mountain track when they were hailed by riders from the south halhuli spoke a word of command and the princes guards lowered their spears and took up a protective position between the oncoming riders and the prince it is lord rognvald shouted cait when the newcomers were near enough to recognize hasan shouted a command to his guards who raised their weapons and rode out to meet the knights greetings my lord knight called the prince as the norsemen escorted by his guards reined up good hunting no said rognvald his voice cracking with fatigue not as good as we had hoped we saw smoke from a campfire once offered svein but we lost it before we could find the place concluded dag we never saw it again added yngvar too tired to speak the two spanish knights shook their heads in agreement most unfortunate answered the prince still there is cause for joy we have learned that ali waqqar is nearby indeed rognvald looked from the prince to cait who confirmed hasans assertion with a nod the bandits have been seen she told him they came into the valley for provisions three or four nights ago that is good news agreed rognvald he rubbed his face wearily they are still in the region at least yes said hasan i think it will not be long now before our efforts are rewarded as the poet says a silken net to catch a bird a silver net to catch a thief ali waqqar will come to us very soon i pray that it is so lord prince replied rognvald hasan signalled to halhuli who began leading the way back to the palace the prince took his place beside caitriona and rode with her for the rest of the journey twilight was full about them by the time they entered the outer courtyard the stars shone as bright needles of light in the thin cold mountain air they dismounted and as the grooms came running from the stables the knights began moving slowly and stiffly towards the palace entrance the doors were open and rosy light from the braziers burning in the anteroom spilled out on to the steps and into the courtyard you and your men are exhausted said the prince falling into step beside rognvald allow me to send a hot supper to you in your quarters that way you can use the baths and eat at your leisure well said rognvald glancing back at cait who appeared not to have heard if it is no trouble not in the least hasan assured him i myself often do this when i return from a day of hunting otherwise i would fall asleep at the table and that would never do we will talk tomorrow he sent them off with words of encouragement and turning to cait said i am afraid you must endure my company once again your knights have chosen to take their meal in their quarters tonight to be sure it is for the best they have been riding three days and are very tired oh replied cait disappointment flitting across her features i had hoped to hear more from rognvald about their searches tomorrow my love promised the prince we will all sit down together and tell what we have learned and who knows maybe tomorrow ali waqqar will join us and we can put an end to this trouble at last dinner that night was as sumptuous and enjoyable as any that had gone before prince hasan was charming and attentive winsome in his manner and subtly insinuating in his flattery this time however she was able to plead weariness and leave the table with most of the night still before her under jubayars stern and silent eye she returned to her chamber feeling more than ever as if she were playing the hapless hare to the princes falcon mahdi and pilai were surprised to see her so early and took the opportunity to brush her hair and braid it in preparation for bed chattering away to her blithely indifferent to the fact that cait could not understand a word they said so absorbed were they in their talk that neither one of them heard the gong ringing at the entrance to the ladies court shh said cait putting her finger to her lips listen the gong sounded againa low ringing tone not loud cait stood and was moving towards the door when it burst open and lord rognvald entered the two serving maids began to cry out but cait silenced them with a sharp slap on the arm apiece hush she said i will speak to my friend she crossed to where rognvald was waiting by the door rognvald i was hoping to speak to you how did you know where to find me please i have little time he said svein and rodrigo will keep the guard jubayar busy as long as they can but he could return at any moment and i dare not let him find me here yes go on god knows it gives me no pleasure to say it pray speak what is it the prince is lying about the offer of ransom he never sent his men to the settlements but just today i saw no rognvald shook his head firmly the offer was never made are you certain i know enough arabic to discuss ransom the knight replied and no one in any of the villages knew anything about hasans offer and all waqqar him they knew aboutthat much was clear but no one would talk to us i think they are afraid what should we do rognvald regarded her intently his eyes searching probing if you are with me in this i am then we must confront hasan and make him tell us the truth i agree cait replied and it must be soon tomorrow morningwhen we meet to break fast we will take him by surprise cait nodded and suddenly very grateful for the tall knights stalwart devotion she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek rognvald smiled suddenly your change of heart is wondrous to behold truly i did not think you would hear any word against the prince she raised an eyebrow have i been so prickly of late lady a bramble thicket is more welcoming putting her hands on his chest she pushed him towards the door go now my lord i fear you have outstayed your welcome he opened the door a crack and looked both ways along the gallery before stepping out the door closed silently and he was gone cait turned to her two gawking handmaidens and through a series of what she hoped were sternly pointed gestures warned them to secrecy in an effort to maintain the pretence that nothing unusual had taken place she commanded them to continue brushing her hair and making ready her bed they fell to readily enough and were soon whittering away again like birds when they finally blew out the candles and settled down for the night cait could not rest sleep eluded her she kept thinking about the lies she had been told and tried to discern what might be behind them daylight found her illrested and in a foul humour but all the more eager to face prince hasan and demand an explanation of him she woke her sleepy servants and dressed hurriedly leaving the womens quarters in the company of a grimly disapproving jubayar she was first to arrive at the room where they most often broke fasta small bright room with coloured tiles of blue green and yellow and a large window overlooking a garden court below there was no one about so she settled down to wait and presently an old servant appeared bowed in greeting and began making up the fire in the hearth after a time more servants came to prepare the table spreading bright cloths on which they placed baskets of bread and cold sliced meat one servant began cooking oat porridge in a pot on the hearth and others brought a large bowl of hot almond milk spiced with cinnamon cait accepted a cup of the warming drink and waited while more servants came and went where was rognvald she wondered what could be keeping him she went to the door and looked out into the antechamber and the corridors beyond but aside from jubayar slumped asleep in a corner there was no sign of anyone about she waited some more and had just decided to go in search of the knights when she heard footsteps and voices in the anteroom she jumped up from her place at the table and ran to the door to meet prince hasan and his advisor halhuli allah the ever gracious be good to you exclaimed hasan darling ketmia how lovely you look this morning i did not know you would be waiting or i should have come sooner cait greeted him pleasantly and said truthfully i did not sleep well last night so i rose early she looked beyond the two men i was hoping to speak to rognvald too i wanted to hear how he fared in his search but ketmia he is gone a sudden anxiety overcame her what do you mean where would he go raising a calming hand the prince said peace my darling i am sorry had i known you wished so ardently to see him i might have prevented him from leaving she looked to halhuli for confirmation he merely shrugged as if to say there was nothing to be done but why would he go off without telling me allah alone knows my love we will ask him when he returns but if i may speculate please do said cait her tone growing brusque it seemed to me that he was disheartened by his lack of success in finding alethea the man is very stubborn as you know hasan offered a sadly sympathetic smile and spread his hands i believe he could not accept his failure he and his knights roused the stablemen and ordered fresh horses to be saddled they compelled the porters to open the gate and rode out just before dawn cait looked at him blankly a feeling of desperation rising up from the soles of her feet and into her belly she knew the prince was lying but she could not understand why or know how to force him into an admission he might have left some word for me she said darkly as if her anger were directed at the thoughtless knight hasan turned to his silent advisor did he leave any word halhuli shook his head no my lord i am sorry ketmia now you are angry and unhappy what shall i do to cheer you he tapped his chin with a finger as if in thought i know the winter garden is ready now and it is a rare delight the day is fine we will break our fast and then i shall take you for a walk in the garden later perhaps said cait i think i would like to go back to my room lord rognvalds thoughtlessness and negligence has spoiled my appetite i pray you will excuse me she left then lest the prince find some means of persuading her to stay on the way to her quarters the realization struck her that her position had suddenly grown extremely precarious she was all alone now and there was no one she could trust or turn to for help by the time she reached the womens quarters however the first fright at her predicament had passed in its place had settled a cold determination not to allow the prince to work his devious will the heat of righteous indignation fired her thoughts and by the time she reached the door to her room she had remembered that there was someone she could trust to help her now danji chapter thirtyfour cait waited through the day for danji to appear by way of signs and gestures and the repetition of danjis name she had at last brought mahdi to comprehend something of the urgency and apprehension she felt the handmaid went off on her secret errand and cait settled back to wait tired from her restless night she soon closed her eyes and descended into a fitful sleep full of fragments of images and halfremembered dreams she stood again on the high cliffs above the little bay south of banvard alone the sky filled with the cry of the gulls circling high overhead dark stone buildings and green fields beyond snug between heathered hills a thin silvery thread of smoke rising to flatten on the wind from the sea a tall figure dressed in black standing alone on the clifftopsydoni grey hair combed by the wind taking her by the hand and saying caitriona dear heart it is good to see you i was hoping you would come and bid me farewell sydoni vanished and cait was outside the gate of the stronghold in the twilight abbot emlyn was there they were walking very quickly and he was talking to her but she could not make out the words and as they walked along she kept falling further and further behind desperate she cried wait abbot emlyn wait for me the kindly old abbot did not stop but turned his head and called over his shoulder sanctus clarus cait remember sanctus clarus it is your birthright one day it will be your name and then she was alone once more the walled stronghold was gone and she was alone with the night and the stars and mahdis gentle touch ketmia mahdi said touching her lightly on the arm she came awake at once and looked around the room was dark the small round windows admitted no light she had slept longer than she knew and as she sat up she found her mouth was dry and her face was warm her forehead slightly damp danji she said is danji here she made motions with her hands to communicate her question the handmaiden understood and shook her head in an effort to fight down the desperation she felt coiling like a serpent around her heart cait threw back the silk covering and rose from her bed she moved to the door opened it and then stopped realizing she did not know where she was going there was she concluded only one place to go having decided she walked quickly through the covered courtyard and out into the anteroom jubayar was nowhere to be seen so she moved swiftly on lest her nerve desert her composing her thoughts as she went she would find prince hasan and confront him demand the truth from him and hold him to account by the time she reached the main corridor leading to the reception hall she knew exactly what she wanted to say to the prince it was halhuli the princes overseer she encountered first however she greeted him and asked whether he knew where hasan might be found at the question cait saw a stiffness come into the servants face his eyes shifted away from her i do not know lady i must speak to him halhuli it is important and there is no one else i can ask i must beg to be excused he turned to leave no said cait stop the force of her command caught and held him hear me halhuli there is something wrong heresomething very wrong i will do all i can to see that it is put right but i need your help she moved beside him please halhuli help me i do not know what you are talking about i am sorry i think you do halhuli you know exactly what i am talking about he looked straight ahead and said nothing i can see that i am right cait continued softening her tone i think you want to help me but your loyalty to your master prevents you i understand i am katib to the prince halhuli told her like my father before me and his father before him we have served the house of tashfin i am my princes to command he paused and added whether in honour or dishonour cait pounced on the morsel he had given her but if the prince is behaving dishonourably then is it not the katibs duty to save his prince from the infamy and disgrace of his actions halhuli regarded her with deep sad eyes but remained silent i know that if i had lost my way i would want you to lead me back to the path of virtue in her pleading cait put her hand on the katibs arm i do not ask you to do this for my sake but for hasans for if the prince has strayed who will rescue him if not his wise and loyal katib halhuli raised his eyes and regarded cait for a long time she could almost see the battle taking place within him at last he straightened having made up his mind follow me i will take you to him he led her to a part of the alqazr she had never seen before the rooms were smaller the walls thicker and far less ornate they climbed a flight of stone steps to an upper floor where halhuli stopped before a low wooden door cait put her hand to the iron ring pulled up the latch and would have pushed open the door but halhuli prevented her may allah forgive me he said and pushed open the door himself there in the centre of the room lay danji shoulders bared and hands tied with cords of braided leatherprostrate before an enraged prince hasan who was using the other end of the braided cord as a lash to raise angry red welts on the delicate skin of her back as the door swung open the prince glanced around saw halhuli and caitriona standing in the doorway and halted the beating danji lifted her head as the prince moved quickly towards the door ketmia he said forcing a sickly smile what are you doing here he reached for caits arm but she deftly sidestepped him moving quickly to the injured woman raising her up she tugged on the braided cord hasan made to take hold of her shoulder ketmia you must not or what demanded cait whirling on him you will beat me too prince hasan started the colour bleeding from his distraught features you do not understand this is beneath you my lord cait told him her voice shaking with fury she bent once more to free danjis hands perhaps moors are permitted to whip their wives but christians detest the practice she is not my save your lies cait snapped i know she is your wife prince hasan swallowed hard his hands fluttered towards the kneeling danji as if he would appeal to her she looked up at his face and said something in arabic which cait took to be confirmation hasan stood caught between the two women his expression angry bewildered shamed and mortified all at once he looked from one to the other of them and then at halhuli who was standing just inside the door why did you not prevent this he snarled his fury finding outlet at last is everyone against me now forgive me my lord replied the advisor with quiet resolve princess danji is also my mistress and i could not see her treated so you speak above your place blurted the prince he speaks the simple truth cait retorted sharply believe me ketmia said hasan appealing to her it was never my intention to harm you in any way he took her hand in both of his truly your love has enslaved me cait glared at him you lied to me she said jerking her hand from him she moved to danji and gently pulled her robes over her shoulders then raised her to her feet and stood holding her since the first moment i saw you my heart was slain by your beauty the prince said i swear before the throne of allah i wanted only to keep you with me i knew that once you tasted of life in the palace you would be content to stay i would have married you he raised his eyes hopefully i would marry you still you are already married cait pointed out tartly it is no impediment to a moor of my rank and wealth replied the prince recovering something of his former composure we are permitted more than one wife and i would make you very happy cait turned her face away i have disgraced myself in your eyes the prince said yes agreed cait sharply we agree on that at least tell me how i can redeem myself and it shall be done then tell me what has become of my knights she demanded they did not ride out this morning where are they hasan hesitated the anguish on his face appeared genuine tell her my lord danji said the prince looked to halhuli for help his eyes pleading i will tell her if you wish the advisor said hasan nodded and lowered his head in shame your knights are resting comfortably my lady said halhuli stepping forward they have been confined to the ladies tower they have not been harmed you must release them at once cait insisted prince hasan hesitated my lord prince you profess to feelings of affection for me if that is true you must release my knights i will speak to them cait said lord rognvald is an honourable man and he will understand there will be no blood shed over thisonly you must set them free at once the prince raised his unhappy gaze to cait very well to halhuli he said see that it is done more relieved than angry cait did not have it in her to sustain her fury any longer all will yet be well my lord prince she told him taking danji by the arm she said come we will see to those bruises while we wait leaving prince hasan to stew in his misery the two women proceeded to the reception hall to wait for the norsemens release while they waited danjis maidservants applied a soothing balm to the red stripes on her shoulders and back you have suffered this injury for my sake said cait as the servants finished applying the unguent i am sorry danji if we had left the palace when you warned me it is finished we need not speak of it again she waved the servants away and arranged her clothing once more please i would not have you think ill of my husband i do think ill of him cait replied a man is a brute who would do a thing like this to danji shook her head you do not understand she sighed and gazed at her hands which were clasped in her lap my husband is an honourable man he is good and kind but great as is the love within him greater still is his grief cait regarded the darkeyed woman before her are you telling me sorrow has driven him to behave this way danji nodded two years ago this palace was a very different place we were happy then the voices of children rang in the courtyards and corridors and the womens quarters were full of gossip and activity truly aljelal was a small portion of paradise on earth her gaze fell to her hands once more now it is a tomb what happened the fever danji shook her head it was very bad the children were taken first i lost my baby and hasans sister lost two of hers and then hasmidi herself was taken and hasans mother also four of the serving maids died in one night after that the fever spread to the rest of the palace cait was beginning to understand the enormity of the tragedy what did you do there was nothing to be done but wait and watch our people die and bury their bodies when the fever was finished with them the plague passed to the servants quarters and most of them were taken and the stablehands and groomsthe fever even killed some of the horses and still it had not reached its full height tughril the old prince hasans father was taken and his last remaining wife then hasans younger brother kalaat and his wifethey had been married less than a year oh danji i am sorry i had no idea in the end hasan lost all of his family except me he lost his sons and heirs danji raised sad eyes to cait please the prince is not a bad man he is desperate to make this empty shell of a palace a home once more he has been praying every day for a way to make this happen and then he found you cait understood at last when he saw me in the wood he must have thought she shook her head in wonder i had no idea truly i do not believe he meant to harm anyone i thank you for telling me it is indeed a sorrowful tale but i feel better for knowing i will not judge your husband too harshly they sat together in silence for a time and then hearing footsteps in the anteroom turned as lord rognvald and two of the knights came trooping into the hall lord rognvald hurried to where cait and danji stood waiting thank god you have not been harmed he said taking her by the arms i was worried i did not know what he might do is there anything to eat wondered svein eyeing the empty tables or drink it is thirsty work being a hostage said yngvar be seated all of you said danji rising i will order food and drink to be brought it would be a kindness cait told her perhaps i should go with you there is no need replied the young woman my husbands shame is sufficient he will not increase it with another attack danji walked with slightly pained dignity from the room and the knights took places at the empty table to wait for the food to appear i did not know she could speak latin said rognvald when she had gone nothing here is quite as it seems cait replied lady danji is not hasans sister she is his wife and if he had won his way i would have been his wife as well this brought a smile from rognvald what demanded cait accusingly and is that so unlikely that you should mock it is not mockery you see but pleasure i confess i much prefer the lady caitriona before me to the swooning coweyed maid we have been seeing of late coweyed indeed replied cait with an indignant huff perhaps i should have left you locked in the tower that would have been a shame replied rognvald lightly for then we would never learn where alethea has been taken hasan you mean he knows where she is that i do believe the tall knight nodded firmly in any event i sent dag rodrigo and paulo to fetch the prince so we will soon discover the truth of this treacherous affair part iii september edinburgh scotland i read through most of the night and all the next day my reckoning may be faulty for it is difficult to gauge the passage of time below ground without the sun to aid orientation one loses all sense of regularity and proportion the body quickly succumbs to its own peculiar rhythm hence i ate and slept as it seemed right to me performing any small tasks as need or whim dictatedwashing grooming tending the fireand the rest of the time i read from william st clairs old book when i grew tired of sitting in bed i sat on the stool when the stool grew uncomfortable i took a fleece from the bed and laid it before the hearth and read by the flickering light of the fire eager to finish caitrionas tale before evans returned for me i read the hours away discovering in the process that without the ordinary distractions of daily life with all its clamour and clutter without the tyranny of petty demands and humdrum obligations the mind soon ceases its continual fretting and gnawing over the events of the day the spirit calms and peace descends like a balm over the soul feeling very much like a monk who has devoted his life to prayer and study in quiet solitude i read the book and the bare confines of my cell ceased to exist i was transported across the centuries to that faroff time at the embryonic beginning of our longlived order in short as my understanding grew towards completion i envisioned the form my final initiation would take and began to prepare myself accordingly my time of contemplation passed so peacefully that i was actually startled when i heard the door open at the end of the passage and footsteps descend the stone steps i was ready when evans reappeared at the entrance to my cell and again i started a little for he was not wearing the scarlet of the inner circle nor the ordinary grey of brotherhood he was wearing a long white robe without emblem or insignia but belted with a wide woven band of cloth of gold he carried another white robe which he held up for me saying peace and grace to you brother by this i knew the formal ceremony had already begun i returned his greeting and he said the council of brothers has gathered and we await your presence he glanced at the book on the table i trust your time here has been of profit to you it has been inspirational i replied slipping into the offered robe and i am grateful for it good he held out to me a woven belt like his own i passed it around my waist and he tied it for me arranging the knot at the side he stepped back regarding me with a critical eye then nodded his approval if you are ready we will proceed i replied that i was and taking up the candle he led me from the cell we did not return to the star chamber as i might have expected but continued down the passage leading deeper into the underground interior i followed and we walked without speaking until reaching a low door at the end evans knocked on the door there came the long metallic scrape of a bolt being drawn and the door was opened from inside evans held the candle above the lintel and indicated that i should enter i stooped bent my head low and stepped inside to see genotti standing beside the doorway candle in hand my first impression that the room appeared to have been carved out of the living stone which formed the churchs foundationturned out to be correct this was swiftly followed by the recognition that i had been in this room before years ago when i was elevated to the seventh degree then i had been blindfolded but there could be no mistake this was the cavernous chamber into which i was lowered on that night when a blind man searching in the darkness i had found the beginning of the path which had led me to this final revelation i saw in the flickering glow of candles in tall sconces around the room the other members of the inner circlede cardou zaccaria and kutch waiting before a stone altar they were like evans and genotti robed in white behind them to one side was the vestibule wherein i had found the iron lance the sacred relic was there i could see its slightly bowed and crooked length resting in the shelved niche carved for it in the solid rock wall and the sight produced a feeling of intense elation which flooded through me like a warm wave of triumph opposite this vestibule there was another evans who had joined genotti saw my glance and knew i was curious to explore and so gave his assent with a silent nod the others stood by and watched as i moved to the semichamber ascended the single step and went in to find another carved niche my heart quickened as i saw the dark scarred length of ancient timber and knew that i beheld the black rood the heavygrained wood was grooved and sinuous with age its deeply patined surface smoothed by saintly veneration to a satiny lustre that shimmered dully in the gently flickering light the truncated and much abused relic had been ornamented with simple gold bands which covered the roughsawn ends humbled by its presence i held my breath and ran my fingertips along the length of ancient wood in a caress of profound gratitude reverence and yes love my thoughts returned to the sunny island of cyprus where i had encountered the tale of the relic in a copy of duncans handwritten manuscript in the monastery of ayios moni amid the pineforested peaks of the troodos mountains had it really been fifteen years since caitlin and i had passed the winter on that sleepy island in the midst of the sunbright sea we had always meant to return and relive that happy time now we never would i left the vestibule and returned to where the others were waiting for me there is but one more secret to be revealed genotti said tonight there are no blindfolds there will be no stumbling and fumbling in the darkness tonight we stand and move in the glory and radiance of the sanctus clarus are you ready brother asked evans i am i replied little knowing how unprepared i truly was for what was about to happen chapter thirtyfive by the time they came in sight of the ridge the wind had turned raw whipping at the horses tails and manes and stinging the faces of the riders what had begun as a crisp sunbright day slowly sank into a dull freezing mist and cait was glad of the handsome wool cloak hasan had given her she had offered to return it along with the other gifts but he would not hear of it i would brave the everlasting fires of jahennem itself hasan had declared boldly for the merest hope of your forgiveness ketmia leading your beloved sister to freedom will be but a token of my sincerity and contrition cait readily accepted his pledge but lord rognvald was of a less forgiving mind despite the apparent change in hasan and the princes oftrepeated pledges of fidelity benevolence and selfless resolve the wary norwegian maintained a sceptical attitude having been burned once he was not inclined to wholly trust the fire again even so inasmuch as prince hasan professed to know where the outlaw ali waqqar could be found he had no choice but to swallow his misgivings and allow the contrite moor to lead them to the bandits refuge during the night the horses supplies and weapons had been made ready and the company departed at dawnled by hasan rognvald cait and the knights came next followed by halhuli and three more servants leading a train of seven pack horses they reached the first valley crossed it and continued on into the ragged northern hills beyond a rough desolate land of tumbled rock and deeply eroded ravines inhabited only by herds of tough little mountain goats and flocks of wild sheep shortly after midday the prince halted the party while halhuli and his men set about preparing a meal he led cait rognvald and the knights a little further along the trail observe that ridge which rises before you like a wall he said lifting his hand to a massive bulwark of mottled brown rock in the distance that is arsh iblees or as you would say the devils throne beyond it is a narrow valley and that is where we will find ali waqqar it will be dark before we reach the ridge observed rognvald i think so agreed hasan i suggest making camp here and beginning again at first light but the day is not so far gone cait pointed out a little anxiously we could ride a fair way yet we might it is true allowed the prince we will be more comfortable here however and there is less chance of alerting the bandits to our presence i would prefer to arrive unannounced thus cait was forced to endure yet another restless night on the trail she lay sleepless in a little round tent the front of which was open to a campfire that blazed throughout the night and rose early and set about saddling her horse once more waiting had made her sullen and surly she begrudged the slowness of the others and wished to high heaven she had never embarked upon this disastrous course she was cold and tired and aching with the knowledge of her own failure folly and conceit with what arrogance had she conceived this reckless enterprise with what sublime ignorance what consummate vanity when at last they set off again she turned tired eyes to the featureless sky above and the bleak beginning of another dismal day in the saddle so empty so hopeless and like the revenge she sought so endlessly abysmally pointless out on the winter trail with a fretful wind swirling about her shivering shoulders grief enwrapped her in its cold clutch and squeezed her hard where before she had been able to ease her sorrow and remorse with the assurance that the reward was worth the cost in the pale light of yet another dreary dawn that assurance foundered like a pack horse forced to carry a crushing burden far too long her confidence collapsed never to rise again it was all she could do to stifle the scream of desperation she felt rising up in her throat she lashed her horse to a plodding trot and rode out ahead of the others so that they could not see the tears of frustration sliding down her frozen cheeks they spent the morning fighting a wet and gusty wind which threatened to sweep them off the trail by the time they gained the top of the ridge and began their descent cait had determined to abandon the search for the holy cup her illadvised pursuit of the relic had so far brought nothing but death and misery it was timeand long past timeto renounce her ambition while sojourning in hasans palace she had been able to hold off the decision she had known all along was coming now as she sat freezing in the saddle all she wanted was to win her sisters freedom and return to bilbao and her waiting ship while she and those with her still had life and breath to do so de bracineaux would win he had killed her father and he would gain the mystic rose too there was nothing she could do about that she would walk away emptyhanded but at least she told herself she would still be alive that would have to be enough in a little while they came to a wide place halfway along the downward trail here sheltered by the ridge wall behind them they stopped to rest and warm themselves the riders dismounted and the prince summoned cait and rognvald to join him i do not see any settlements cait informed him glumly gazing down into the pinched ravine of a valleylittle more than a deep crinkled gash with a rockfilled stream at the bottom no hasan said there are neither settlements nor holdings in this wilderness the land is not good for farming then where will we find the bandits the hillsides below are seamed with a great many caves prince hasan told them this is where ali waqqar hides as to that i think it would be best if you and your men were to wait here and allow me to go on ahead alone rognvald frowned and cait shook her head please ketmia what i propose is wisdom itself ali and i have had dealings in the past you see if i go to him alone he will allow me to come near and speak to him surprise him with an army however and he could easily disappear into his labyrinth of caves where we could never find him cait resisted the idea alethea and abu were somewhere down there and she meant to get them out truly it is for the best insisted hasan oh very well she nearly screamed with exasperation go on then yngvar svein and the others will wait here with you rognvald told her but i will go with the prince he turned to regard hasan with quietly stubborn defiance seeing the knight was adamant the prince reluctantly agreed and commanded halhuli to find a turban for rognvald and exchange cloaks with him as soon as rognvald was suitably disguised they remounted and hasan cautioned the tall knight to sit low in the saddle and avoid drawing attention to himself pray that ali waqqar is of a mood to receive visitors today he said then raised his hand in farewell cait watched the riders disappearing down the side of the hill and changed her mind crossing quickly to her mount she climbed into the saddle and was off before anyone could stop her dag and rodrigo ran a few steps and called for her to come back but she ignored them and rode on the riders heard the commotion turned saw cait and halted on the trail say what you like i will not go back she told them in a tone suggesting that heaven and earth could pass away long before she would be persuaded i have not come this far to stand aside and wait yuallah sighed hasan he glanced at rognvald who made no move to intervene then relented so be it whatever happens stay close to me my lady rognvald instructed keep your blade ready to hand see you keep your head covered with the hood of your cloak added hasan it may be they will think you are danji and take no notice having won her way cait became compliant she did as she was told and fell in behind lord rognvald they moved on reaching the floor of the valley a short time later where cait saw that it was as hasan had said as she gazed at the broken boulderstrewn slopes all around she could see the entrances of small caves as dark holes in the sides of the hills leaving the ridge trail they rode out into the narrow valley passing among fallen rocks the size of houses hasan found his way to the stream and they followed the path beside it owing to the high protecting walls on every side the air was calm and silent on the valley floor the only sound to be heard was the rippling splash of the water as it coursed along its stony bed in a little while it became clear that the prince knew exactly where he was going they came to a place where the stream pooled as it passed around the base of an enormous moundlike boulder providing a good fording place they paused to allow the horses to drink then crossed the stream and turned towards the towering eastern slope a few hundred paces from the ford a great stone slab lay like a toppled pillar on its side the trail passed between two of the shattered sections they rode through a gap wide enough for horses to go two abreast and continued on towards the slope picking their way among the chunks of stone fallen from the heights which lay scattered over the rising ground and in a little while arrived at the entrance to a cave potsherds and the droppings of sheep and horses covered the flat area at the base of the slope which served the cave as a yard aside from that and a faint whiff of smoke adrift in the still air there was no sign that anyone had ever been near the place rognvald halted a little way off and cait behind him hasan rode to the cave entrance and shouted ali waqqar he waited a moment and shouted again adding a few words in arabic the call had scarcely died in the air when a figure emerged out of the darkness of the cave mouth the man was a darkskinned moor shabbily dressed his clothes stiff with grease and dirt his beard matted and long his hair unkempt his fat belly hung over his drooping belt and the sleeves of his cloak flapped in rags about his hands as he stared warily out at the three visitors he spat into the dirt at his feet before making bold to answer prince hasan addressed the man sharply and to caits surprise the burly fellow straightened and made a curt bow hasan spoke again whereupon the man disappeared he is one of alis men hasan explained he is meant to be on watch but he lifted a hand equivocally you can see how it is is thea here did you ask if cait began but the prince cut her off hush ketmia he warned quietly all in good time they waited in silence for the guard to return when he did it was with three other men one of whom taller than the others appeared slightly better dressed and reasonably more alert he bowed and addressed the prince politely moving out from the mouth of the cave for a closer look at the visitors prince hasan spoke to him the while raising his voice in demand when the guard appeared to take an interest in the two accompanying the prince a few paces from cait he swung around sharply and moved to hasans side offered another bow and hurried into the cave once more leaving the others behind to stare dully at the visitors until their leader returned appearing at the cavern entrance he motioned the newcomers to follow him the danger is past said hasan visibly relieved it appears ali waqqar will be pleased to receive us in his lair do you wish to accompany me or would you rather wait here we will attend said rognvald very well prince hasan swung down from the saddle follow me but see you keep your wits about you cait dismounted and followed the men into the cave regretting her decision at once the entrance opened on to a highceilinged chamber the walls of which were streaked grey with bat dung a fair few of the grotesque creatures hung in wriggling clusters from the rocks overhead on one side of the chamber a winding passage led deeper into the heart of the mountain the lower walls of the passage were damp and reeked with the sour stench of stale urine nor was that all as they moved further into the cave she encountered other odours toothe acrid tang of horse sweat the earthy ripeness of manure and human dung and the putrid stink of rotting meatall of them so rank and malignant as to make her eyes water pressing a hand to her mouth she hunched her shoulders and hurried on ahead of her she heard rognvald mutter something under his breath as they passed by one particularly malodorous heap of refuse the passage ended in another doorway carved in the rock bending almost double they stooped beneath the grimy lintel and stepped into a large domelike room which was lit by the blaze of a log fire barely contained within a crude hearth in the centre of the cavern haunches of meat were sizzling on wooden spits placed around the perimeter of the hearth filling the air with oily smoke water trickled down one wall to fill a small pool made of rocks and mud beside the pool were a halfdozen enormous earthenware jars several large grass baskets were stacked here and there along the wall with a few wellmade wooden caskets among themcontaining plunder no doubt from raids or other nefarious doings at first glance the room appeared to be deserted but as cait looked around she began to see human forms in the quivering shadows along the arching walls and upper ledges what she had first taken for lumps of stone were in fact men wrapped in cloaks and turbans and sound asleep there were others sitting quietly slumped in attitudes of drunken stupor oblivious to events around them in all she estimated there were perhaps twenty or so and the sight of them infuriated her to think that these indolent sots were the brigands who had killed five good men and carried off her sister now that she saw them again at last she fairly squirmed with the urge to draw her sword and separate their odious bodies from their worthless souls it took all her strength of will to keep her hand from the blade at her side and walk on by with averted eyes for aletheas sake she did just that the visitors were led to a place on one side of the hearth where skinned pine logs formed benches of sorts near a slab of rock upon which had been spread a fine rug and a satin cushionthis cait guessed was where the outlaw chieftain held court they sat down and after a short wait three more bandits entered the chamber one of them cried out as he entered hasan it was cait thought a greeting of particular intimacy the guests turned to see ali waqqar step quickly around the hearth fire and approach the prince with open arms cait regarded the bandit with keen interest and felt unexpected relief in the certainty that she had never seen the man before he was not among those who attacked her camp that day a man of imposing heightmade more so by the elaborate turban of gleaming blue satin on his headhe walked with the eager rolling gait of a man hurrying from one dissipation to another closer cait could see the telltale signs of long and habitual overindulgence a muscular frame now thick and flabby loose wattles about the neck dirt ingrained in the lines of his face and beneath fingernails oncehandsome features bloated his clothes were of good quality but filthy and the cuffs of his sleeves and the hem of his mantle were threadbare in all his appearance proclaimed a man much come down in the worldand yet he still possessed the arrogant confidence of a warrior the prince rose to receive the homage of the bandit and it was then that cait realized the dealings the prince admitted to having with ali waqqar were of a more familiar kind than he had led her to believe the recognition produced a perverse sort of hope that the apparent amity between the two men would lead to release for her sister and abu what was more she could see from his expression that rognvald discerned this too for his eyes narrowed and his nostrils flared with suppressed anger cait quickly averted her gaze lest he see that she did not share his indignation at being deceived hasan and the outlaw leader stood gripping each others arms for a moment and exchanged a few pleasant words then the prince turned and said allow me to present my friends lord rognvald of haukeland and lady caitriona of caithness ali waqqar stepped before them rognvald rose as he was introduced his face impassivemagnificently so cait thought considering what she had seen only a moment before whatever he felt at the sight of the marauding brigand there was now no visible sign at all and then it was her turn she made no move as the bandit chief turned from rognvald and made a slight bow before her to her horror he reached down and took up her hand she writhed inwardly from his touch but emboldened by rognvalds poised example forced a thin smile and lowered her head demurely prince hasan spoke a few words to the bandit who nodded his head in assent and then in the manner of a hosting lord clapped his hands a dirty boy appeared bearing a battered silver tray containing an illmatched assortment of small golden cups the bandit took up one and indicated that the others should do likewise raising his cup ali exclaimed my friends though my cave is a stinking hovel unfit for nobles of your obvious rank and refinement you are welcome here i drink to your health to caits surprise his latin was polished and smoothly spoken she wondered whether he had stolen it along with everything else he possessed she put the cup to her lips and sipped daintily unwilling to taste even the smallest morsel of the brigands rude hospitality they were invited to sit once more and resumed their seats on the log benches while ali took his place on the rugcovered slab adopting the manner of a potentate enthroned hasan and ali exchanged idle pleasantries until the cups were drained and then the bandit called for meat to be brought one of the roasting joints was pulled off a nearby spit and brought dripping to the bandit leader he pulled off a strip of flesh and stuffed it in his mouth and licking his fingers loudly indicated that the others should likewise enjoy a succulent bite now then said all chewing thoughtfully pleased as i am to entertain noble guests he lifted an ambivalent hand in their direction in my experience people do not seek out ali waqqar unless they desire something of him so tell me if you please what is it that you wish of ali most astute replied the prince affably as always you have discerned the heart of the matter the day is speeding from us and we have a long ride awaiting so i will be brief it has come to my attention that you may have a slave to sell we have come to buy i see the bandit nodded looking from one to the other of his guests although it grieves me to say it i fear you have had a long cold ride for nothing i have no slaves at this time he took another draught from his cup none we seem to have been misinformed replied the prince forgive me but i was certain they said you possessed a young female slave truly said ali placidly i wish i had such a slave to sell for she would be yours this instant alas my friends i have no slaves at all of any description business this year has been very poor owing to the prohibition on travel between cities you must have heard of this to be sure said the prince even so it is a very great pity to have come all this way to no purpose perhaps i might be so bold as to suggest that i would be willing to pay seventyfive thousand dirhams for a likely young woman he paused ffyou should happen to hear of anyone who has such a slave to sell i will bear it in mind agreed ali waqqar now i beg you to excuse me but you have had the misfortune to find me in the midst of a particularly busy day he rose from his cushioned slab accept my apologies duty you know is a harsh task master and never satisfied of course as it happens our return cannot be delayed any longer hasan stood slowly until we meet again ali waqqar the prince made a flourish with his hand the outlaw chieftain made a cursory bow and the visitors were escorted back through the cave and returned to their waiting horses cait watched the prince climb into the saddle she strode to his mount and took hold of the bridle is that it she demanded is that the end of it ketmia hush he cautioned they will hear you he was lying he has alethea i know it the prince glanced towards the cave entrance where the guards were watching them with dull interest he does not have her he said in low tones believe me he would never have allowed seventyfive thousand dirhams to slip through his fingers if he had even the slightest hope of producing her we would be haggling over the price even now if he does not have her then he knows what happened to her cait countered he knows and you must make him tell us ketmia please this is not the way he looked to rognvald for help we must leave at once i think the bandit was lying too rognvald said he may not have alethea now but i believe he knows what happened to her cait held tight to the bridle i am not leaving until i learn what happened to my sister and i am telling you that if we do not depart at once we will join her in her fate you seem very well acquainted with these brigands it seems to me you know them better than you led us to believe it is because i know them that i say we must go growled the prince losing patience if you do not believe me then believe your own eyes he indicated the cave entrance where three more of alis men carrying swords and lances had joined the first two behind them others could be seen moving in the dark interior of the cave frustrated beyond words cait gave out a strangled shriek and stormed to her horse she mounted quickly and started away rognvald waited until she had passed him then fell in behind her they had ridden only a few hundred paces when there came a cry from the cave sharifah cait heard it and glanced back over her shoulder she saw a slender darkhaired figure racing towards them the cry sounded again and she swung around for a better look her heart clutched in her breast abu instinctively she jerked hard on the reins her horse halted and reared rognvald she shouted it is abu chapter thirtysix rognvalds sword was in his hand before her cry had ceased he flew past her shouting ride on cait ali waqqar appeared at the mouth of the cave saw abu darting away and roared a command at his men who stood looking on in flatfooted indecision he roared again and started shoving men right and left knocking two or three over those still on their feet leapt after the fleeing youth abu put his head down and ran as if all the hounds of hell were snarling at his heels rognvald naked blade high in the air raised himself in the saddle he swept by the young man and made instead for his pursuers closing on them with blinding swiftness with a rattling battle cry he drove headlong into them scattering attackers in all directions wheeling his horse and making long looping slashes with his sword he kept the wary bandits at bay more brigands boiled out of the cave ali waqqar stood in the centre of a confused knot of men shouting and shoving and then even as cait looked on the chaos suddenly resolved into an attacking force they came forth in an angry rush shouting swords flailing heedless of rognvalds command cait hastened to abus rescue galloping across the rough rocky ground reining up hard as she reached him with a tremendous bound the young man flung himself on to the back her horse shouting fly fly she turned her mount and felt one bony arm encircle her waist fly fly abu screamed away they flew cait head down lashing with the reins and her passenger bouncing like a sack of meal and clinging on for dear life she found the path by which they had come and headed out across the narrow valley prince hasan sped past them racing to rognvalds aid make for the ridge he cried as he thundered by summon the knights we will hold them at the ford his shout dissolved into a whirring soundlike the sizzling buzz of an angry hornetand suddenly the prince jolted upright in the saddle as an arrow instantly appeared in his upper chest grasping the shaft with his free hand he wrenched it out and threw it carelessly aside continuing his headlong plunge into the fight another vicious whirr sounded in the air ending with a meaty thud abu gave a startled cry go sharifah fly cait urged her horse to greater speed streaking away over the rocky ground two more arrows fizzed past before she was out of range she struck the path and raced to the broken stone slab passed through the gap and splashed across the ford speeding along the stream to the base of the ridge where she was met by the knights who had seen her approach in haste and had come down armed and ready for battle as soon as she was near enough she shouted go rognvald and hasan need you yngvar was the first to reach her where are they my lady follow the stream she gasped breathless from her ride you will find them beyond the ford they are attacked for gods sake hurry yngvar turned to the others ready arms he cried follow me with a shout the knights clattered off the last was dag who paused long enough to ask would you have me stay to protect you my lady no we will be safe here go the knight bounded away cait watched as the warriors raced out along the stream in the near distance she could see the pool which marked the fording place and beyond it the divided slab yngvar and rodrigo reached the tumbled stone and disappeared through the gap the others pounded through one after another and were gone they will return soon she said with more hope than conviction you will need a mount abu when he did not answer she swivelled in the saddle to look behind her abu one hand still holding to her cloak sat with his head down as if contemplating the tip of the arrow which had passed through his upper back and now protruded between the bloody fingers of his other hand cait slid from the saddle and caught the wounded youth as he toppled to the ground she laid him down as gently as she could forcing calm to her shaking hands she rolled him on to his side the arrow had found its mark in his back just below the shoulder to emerge on the other side between two upper ribs the iron arrowhead was small but it was barbed pulling it out the way it had gone in would do far worse damage so she thought it best to break off the fletched end and remove it from the front grasping the slender wooden shaft in her hand she tried to break it the movement brought a groan of pain from abu so she decided to leave it for the moment ahh god forgive he gasped his voice thin and brittle i am sorry sharifah you were proud of me once i wanted you to be proud of me again i failed i am sorry never say it removing her cloak she shook it out and draped it over him i am proud of you abu if not for your markers we would never have found our way rest here a little while i go and fetch halhuli the arrow must come out she made to move away but his hand snaked out and snatched hold of her sleeve you need help abu i will go and quickly return i will abu threw aside the cloak and struggled on to an elbow the effort sent blood spilling from the wound in a scarlet rush his face contorted with pain thea he said squeezing his eyes shut i must tell you about thea i am listening she lowered him back to the ground and replaced the cloak thea is not here he said gasping she escaped ran away i helped her he opened his eyes imploring her to understand where abu where did she go before he could answer he was taken with a fit of coughing which left him panting for breath and unable to speak rest easy she told him i will get some water she dashed to her mount and untied the small waterskin from beside the saddle and brought it to him kneeling down she drew the stopper and allowed a little water to flow out on to his lips here she said lifting his head drink he sipped a mouthful of water and then looked at her his eyes big and bright with pain listen sharifah there is a lake and a village beside the lake i learned of it from shepherds she is there he drank again swallowing hard and then laid his head on his arm and closed his eyes where is the lake cait asked when he did not reply she put her lips close to his ear please abu tell me where is the lake i must know if i am to find thea his eyelids fluttered open his dark eyes were no longer as bright as they had been only a moment before the lake yes abu where where is it there he said his voice a breathless whisper the mount of gold the mount of gold abu i do not understand tell me what is the mount of gold where is it his mouth opened and a small gurgling sound came from his throat as he tried to make the words there he gasped at last staring straight out across the crooked valley cait saw the tawny glint of reflected light in his eyes and followed his gaze to a snowtopped peak rising in the near distance bathed in the light of the westering sun it glowed with a rich golden hue is that the mountain asked cait abu is that the one you mean she turned and saw that although the reflection of the mountain still filled his eyes with light sight was already fading oh abu she said her voice cracking she bent her head and placed her hand on his cheek her tears falling on to his still face go with god my friend she whispered then gathered him in her arms and held him as deep silence descended over them halhuli found her that waycrouched beside the trail shivering with cold still holding the young mans corpse lady ketmia he said hastening to her side may i assist without waiting for an answer he lifted the young man from caits grasp and lowered him gently to the ground he removed the cloak from abus body and put it over caits shoulders then taking hold of the arrow below the head gave a solid tug and pulled it through the wound he laid the arrow on the ground and set about straightening abus limbs placing the knees and feet together and folding the hands over his chest he closed the young mans eyes and mouth and as he worked cait became aware that he was praying over the bodyhis low murmuring chant had not ceased since he began tending abus ragged corpse next he poured some water from the waterskin and washed the young mans hands feet and face he then washed his own hands dried them and kneeling beside the body raised his hands and face to heaven and intoned a prayer in arabic when he finished he bowed and touched his forehead to the ground thank you halhuli said cait he will commence his journey with an easier spirit now replied the princes overseer at that moment a raw wordless cry sounded across the valley it was followed by the savage rattle and clash of weapons cait and halhuli rose and stood gazing toward the gap in the broken slab as the sounds of battle waxed and waned much as the sound of sea waves tumbling rocks on a pebbled shore and then the clamour stopped cait held her breath she balled the fabric of her cloak in her fists and watched the gap for warriors to appear lord save us she prayed through clenched teeth an instant later prince hasan rode through the cleft he paused at the ford and was soon joined by dag and svein rodrigo was next carrying paulo with him across the back of his horse followed by yngvar and lastly rognvald they rode to the foot of the ridge trail where cait and halhuli waited the knights breathing hard from the exertion of their brief but fearsome toil wiped sweat from their faces and extolled one anothers skill and bravery the dogs have abandoned the chase rognvald informed her paulo and hasan have been wounded we must get them back to camp at once my injury is not so bad hasan said shaking his head but we must not linger here lest ali waqqar dares to tempt fate again rognvald signalled the knights to ride on as they clattered past cait reached out and put her hand to his knee what about abu she asked rognvald heard the sorrow in her voice looked past her and saw the body of the young man lying still on the ground the fatal arrow beside him he rubbed a hand over his face and shook his head did he say anything before he died he told me alethea escaped cait replied that is something at least and i think i know where she may be found she quickly explained what abu had told her then looked back over her shoulder at his body i do not want him left here nor do i rognvald dismounted crossed quickly to the corpse lifted it in his strong arms and carried it back to his mount cait held the horse while rognvald secured the body and then they rode silently back to camp the sun was dropping below the mountains to the west by the time they reached the top of the ridge the encircling wall cast the valley into shadow there were no bandits following them so they hurried on making their way along the switchback trail leading down the other side of the ridge the sun fired the mountain tops causing the snowtopped peaks to glow like redhot brands and cait watched the colours slowly fade as the short winter day gave way to a misty dusk they halted at the edge of the clearing and rognvald lifted abus body down from the horse and laid it on the ground he straightened crossed himself then turned to find cait watching him we will bury him soon he told her you are wounded she said regarding the ragged rent in his sleeve above the elbow he saw her glance and said a small cut it is nothing she reached out to take his arm for a better look but he held it away from her grasp a scratch only he insisted leave it be they walked to the camp to find the knights standing around the outstretched body of paulo while halhuli examined his wound and the princes servants scurried for supplies cait pushed in beside svein and watched as halhuli probed the unconscious spanish knights wound then looked up the cut is deep he said but clean with rest and care i think he may recover satisfied the knights nodded and moved off to other tasks while rognvald and halhuli made paulo comfortable in one of the tents dag svein and yngvar found a place at the edge of the camp and dug a deep grave then as the first stars began burning in the east the knights buried the syrian servant while cait and the wounded hasan stood looking on they pressed crude wooden crosses into the mound of soft earth and prayed over the grave commending the soul of the slender youth to the almighty giver and receiver of life by the time they finished the princes servants had a hot supper prepared so they all sat down around the fire to warm themselves and eat a simple meal cait related what abu had told her about aletheas escape and where to look for her then something good has come of this at least hasan observed allah is wise and merciful they finished their supper in silence each wrapped in private thoughts which none cared to disturb when they had finished hasan his face pale with fatigue rose the excitement of the day has given me a headache he said and i am tired may allah grant you a peaceful repose he bade them a good night and retreated to his tent after he had gone rognvald called the knights to attend him they moved a few paces away from the fire it may be that darkness will inspire the thieves to boldness he said let them come said yngvar we will make the wolves a feast they will not soon forget nevertheless said rognvald we will take no risks rodrigo and dag will take the first watch yngvar you and svein take the second watch and i will take the third thus prepared for the night the rest of the party retired to their tents to sleepexcept cait who noticed the way the tall knight had begun favouring his arm as he ate his supper a moment my lord she said as he came into the light of the fire i would examine your wound a scratch he insisted is scarcely a wound not to be put off she stepped before him then it will scarcely matter if i have a look at it she took his arm and led him to the fire where she had prepared a bowl of hot water and some strips of clean cloth sit you down and remove your shirt lady it is cold i will certainly freeze listen to you now she chided undoing the laces at his throat and you a true son of the north crying about a little cold god preserve us he sighed shrugging off his cloak he pulled open his shirt and drew it over his head it was the first time she had seen him without his shirt and the broad sweep of his muscled shoulders and the pale curly hair on his chest pleased her she found herself gazing raptly at him in the wavering glow of the fire well he said stirring her to action get on with it then kneeling beside rognvald cait took his arm lifted it and stretched it out the errant blade had caught him on the back of the arm poked a hole through his shirt and produced a small raggedlooking gash the edges of the cut were puckered and inflamed there had not been much bleeding but some of the fabric of the shirt had been driven into the wound she could see several discoloured threads sticking out but all in all it was as rognvald maintained little more than a nasty scratch cait set to work dampening a square of cloth in the bowl and applying it to the wound she put the hot cloth against the cut and held it there to soften the dried blood rognvald adopting the pained expression of a man who is being made to endure humiliation at the hands of an inscrutable higher power stared at the fire avoiding caits eyes after a while she asked how long do you think alethea could survive out herealone in the cold it is difficult to say rognvald replied water is good and abundant the days are not so cold in the valleys and there is shelter to be found if she kept her wits about her she would not be much worse off than she was before what about the wolves he shook his head yngvar thinks every forest abounds with wolves have you heard any wolves since coming to these mountains have you seen even so much as a wolfish footprint in the mud or snow no but if there were any wolves hereabouts we would have known about them long since she accepted his judgement and continued dabbing at the cut washing it gently when she had cleaned it she turned his arm towards the firelight and proceeded to pull the embedded shreds of his shirt from the wound the first threads came free dragging clots of blood and drawing a wince from rognvald am i hurting you no he said it is just a little cold thats all here she picked up his cloak and made to pull it up around his shoulders as she did so she saw that his back was a lumpen mass of welted scars poorly healed and livid still the sight caught her by surprise your back she gasped what happened to you the saracens he muttered in battle after he told her pulling the cloak around him they thought i might tell them the strength of the garrison at tripoli he paused among other things but you refused to tell them so they tortured you she guessed he looked at her sideways and then shook his head with reluctant resignation you told them said cait mildly appalled by this revelation aye he confessed i told them i am not proud of it mind but it was no secret anyway the city was not under siege travellers came and went as freely as birds the next merchant through the gates would have told them if i did notthey had only to ask then why did they torture you because he replied as if the subject wearied him prince mujir eddin had just come to the throne and the wazir hoped to impress him with his skill in dealing with christian prisoners when i answered him outright i made the wazir look foolish so he had me beaten in revenge i see replied cait pulling two more scraps of cloth from the wound she flipped the bloody threads into the fire then washed the cut again before binding it with strips of clean linen cloth had i a little unguent she said when she finished it would heal more quickly all the same i am much obliged my lady rognvald said flexing his bandaged arm i thank you he drew his shirt back on and sat for a moment regarding her in the firelight he lifted his hand as if to touch her hesitated then stood abruptly if you have no further need of me i will sleep a little before i take my watch cait bade him good night and watched him walk away then went to her own tent but found she could not sleep for thinking about alethea the thought of the young womanunprepared in so many wayswandering lost and alone in the high mountain wilderness kept her awake long into the night she kept seeing her sister struggling through the snow shivering freezing gasping out her last breath on a lonely mountainside her pitiful cries for help unheard and unheeded pangs of guilty remorse assailed her she stared into the dwindling fire and heard again her fathers dying words promise you will not avenge me let it end here chapter thirtyseven the sun rose as a pale red blot in a darkly ominous sky and cait rose too a servant brought her a bowl of warm water and she washed then held the basin for a time letting the heat seep into her fingers the rest of the camp was stirring and she heard the voices of the knights as they commenced the morning ritual of feeding watering and grooming the horses she sat clutching the bowl and listening to the knights and her heart quailed within her dread thick as the wintry mist shrouding the mountainside swept over her closing her eyes she bit her lip to keep from crying out all the while telling herself that her distress was born of agitation and frustration and that her spirits would improve as soon as they were on the trail once more but as her thoughts turned to renewing the search she remembered those they would be leaving behind and the stifling black desolation of the previous day descended upon her once more this day she thought hopelessly would be no different from any that had gone before beginning in futility ending in despair with nothing but bonecold monotony in between she held little confidence that they would be able to find the place abu had tried to describe and even if they did it would not make the slightest difference alethea would not be found and the search would go on indeed the search would go onand on and on and on for ever more without end she dragged herself from her tent and stood for a moment looking up at the dark unsettled sky clouds swirled on a swift east wind but the tall pines around the camp remained untouched the air was heavy there would be rain or snow before days end she could already feel the relentless numbing cold of the trail and her sense of aching dread increased rognvald appeared silently beside her caitriona she jumped as he spoke i did not mean to startle you i was just telling the men we should strike camp and move on we can break fast on the trail but i fear it would be unwise to remain at ali waqqars doorstep any longer what about paulo is it safe to move him perhaps not allowed the lord but we cannot leave him here very well he heard the defeat in her voice and said come my lady we must appear confident for the men she looked at him and wondered at the source of his fortitude why because he told her they are trusting in us he moved away as she made to follow halhuli called to her from across the camp he was standing before prince hasans tent wearing an expression she had not seen before she hurried to him what is wrong halhuli the prince is not well he replied when he did not rise this morning i went in to wake him i roused him with the greatest difficulty and gave him a drink i thought he would get up but i went in just now to find he has fallen asleep again cait frowned that is worrying she stooped to the entrance of the low round tent fetch lord rognvald the overseer hurried away and cait pulled back the tent flap tied it and stepped in the prince was lying on his back with his head on a cushion one arm across his chest the other outflung he was dressed in a loose robe and his turban lay to one side a small heap of winding cloth his mouth was open his breathing rapid and shallow she knelt beside him and touched her hand to his foreheadthe skin was hot with fever she took him by the shoulder and shook him gently there was no response she shook him again harder this time and called his name the prince slept on she was shaking him a third time and calling his name when rognvald arrived he ducked in regarded the sleeping prince and said here let us carry him outside where we can look at him properly a moment my lord suggested halhuli he gestured to the two servants standing with him taking the lower edge of the tent they unfastened the stays from the pegs and peeled back the heavy fabric rolling it up and over the hoops when they had finished he ordered them to make up the fire so the prince would not grow cold open his robe said cait rognvald knelt beside cait and parted the princes robe to reveal a small red puncture in the fleshy part of the upper chest the skin was raised and discoloured around the cut he was struck by an arrow she said i saw him brush it off rognvald pressed his fingers lightly to the wound and examined it closely there was little issue of blood he said sitting back on his heels i have seen men endure much more and fight all the harder the next day do you think the arrow was poisoned said yngvar he and the other knights had gathered around the stricken prince do they do such things wondered cait we have seen it at bosra svein assured her in horns they did this also the dogs spat dag alas confirmed halhuli it has been known he placed a hand on the princes chest the skin is hot and inflamed i think we must suspect poison the wound is not so deep rognvald pointed out perhaps the poison is not of sufficient strength to kill could we get him back to the palace do you think halhuli worried his face ashen gazed at his lord it is as allah wills if he is to die then it will be if he is to recover then that also will be allah the merciful bends all purposes to his own what do you want to do halhuli asked cait do you want us to take him home he nodded i should like to try we can make a litter for him volunteered yngvar and drag the poor man over mountain and valley said svein outraged at the idea it might be carried between two horses suggested dag but a sling would be better aye said svein a sling would be better he turned up his nose at yngvar a litter teh cut two stout branches rognvald ordered and lash them to the cantles of the saddles we will fashion a sling the knights attended to this and the others set about striking camp in the midst of their activity prince hasan awoke cait turned her back on him for a moment and when she turned around he was sitting up taking in the bustle around him with a slightly bewildered expression are we attacked he asked no replied cait you have been asleep we could not wake you so we are preparing to return to aljelal there is no need replied hasan i am perfectly able to ride we must not abandon the search on my account cait regarded him doubtfully you have been wounded she explained i do think it best to return to the palace nonsense he scoffed and made to rise the effort made him dizzy he lurched forward and caitriona caught him sit down she told him rest a moment the prince collapsed on his bed once more ah perhaps you are right he said he closed his eyes pressing a hand to the side of his head here drink a little she said pouring water into his horn cup his hand shook so much as he lifted it to his mouth that she had to steady his arm allah the merciful be praised exclaimed halhuli rushing up you are awake my lord bring me my clothes we are going home at once my lord he said and hurried away cait called for rognvald who returned a moment later to find prince hasan drawing on the clothes halhuli held out for him he tells us he feels well enough to ride cait said do you think it wise rognvald squatted down and regarded the prince i have no wisdom in the matter he answered at last if a man feels he is able to ride who can say otherwise precisely agreed the prince indicating the wounded paulos tent he said your man needs warmth and care which he will not receive on the trail if we leave now we can reach the palace before dark that would be best in any case rognvald conceded we will make the journey as easy as possible he stood and called to the knights to prepare the sling for paulo and ready the princes horse those of us who are ready will leave at oncethe rest can come after and catch up on the way no my friend hasan objected your destination is within sight i will not allow you to abandon the search now halhuli and my servants will attend me the rest of you must go on cait hesitated while she had no great hankering to resume the search the thought of going back to aljelal only to take up the trail another day filled her with an even greater dread but what if something should happen on the way she protested mildly listen to me ketmia the prince replied at all events we would be forced to return to the palace in a day or two for supplies take the provisions and go on ahead he is right rognvald concluded if abu was not mistaken we are closer now than ever before we dare not allow this chance to slip awaywe may not get another paulo and i will rejoin you in a few days when we have rested and our wounds have healed unless we find alethea first rognvald put in of course declared hasan you see find alethea and bring her to the palace very well cait relented thus it was agreed the final preparations were quickly made despite his feeble protests paulo was placed in the sling and the prince holding himself like a man who feared one false step would shatter his legs walked to his mount with rognvald on one side and his faithful katib on the other hasan climbed into the saddle i will see you in a few days he called as they started off farewell my friends cait and the others watched until the prince and his entourage were out of sight do not worry my lady said yngvar trying to comfort her they will reach the palace never fear aye said svein providing they do not meet up with any of your wolves the wind grew colder as the day wore on they spent much of the morning skirting ali waqqars valley lair and stopped to break fast once they had put the valley behind them while they were eating it began to snow the mountain abu had indicated lay directly aheadno more than a halfdays ride by their best estimationso they pressed on the snow persisted through the day drifting down through the tall pines in great silent feathery clumps concealing both the path and the mountain before them in a soft layer of white and covering the heads and shoulders of the knights and the rumps of their horses but they rode on climbing higher and higher into the gently swirling curtain of flakes yngvar was leading the way when cait saw him stop at the crest of the hill she lifted the reins and urged her mount to a trot and came abreast of him the slope of the hill dropped away to form a the rim of a bowlshaped valley there below them in the centre of the bowl lay a lake its surface smooth and dark as polished jet at the far side of the valley rose the mountain not golden now but brooding and dark its top obscured by the clouds its lower slopes covered with a dense forest of pineeach bough of every tree now bending beneath the heavy weight of snow this is the place said cait hardly daring to speak aloud for fear that it would vanish mysteriously leaving them no closer than before maybe we will not have to sleep in tents tonight yngvar said pointing away across the valley to the far side of the lake cait looked where he indicated and saw a cluster of buildings and a few enclosures for cattlelittle more than a smokegrey smudge in a field of white she turned and called behind her to rognvald and the others who were just coming up to the crest of the hill there is a settlement without waiting for the others cait started down into the valley keeping her eye on the tiny village which was already fading into the gloom of twilight she had reached the side of the lake and started around when rognvald caught her do you think alethea is there i pray she is cait replied but i hardly dare believe it might be true then i will believe it for both of us replied rognvald do you never grow tired she asked tired of the trail tired of the searchthe endless riding and riding always searching never finding the futility of it all i am weary to the bone with it and i would to god it were over one way or another i wish it would just end she looked at his face a pale softness in the winter gloaming unmoved by her sudden outpouring of despair i suppose now you despise me for being a weak and flighty woman my lady he said his voice low he did not turn his eyes from the snowcovered trail ahead you are the most stalwart woman i know that was all he said and they spoke no more but it gave cait a warm feeling that lasted long into the night chapter thirtyeight it was dark and the snow was deep by the time they reached the settlement if not for the faint glow of light from the windows of several of the houses they would have been lost in the snowy void of night rognvald halted a few dozen paces from the nearest dwelling a low hovel built of turf and timber and thatched with tightbundled reeds from the lake there was a small window covered with oiled sheepskin and set deep under the drooping eaves a fine ruddy glow showed in the window and under the edge of the rough door it is a cowbyre said dag regarding the rustic house but there is a fire at least the others remarked that they did not care if it was a hole in the ground so long as it was a dry hole let us see if they are of a mind to receive us said cait and rognvald dismounted and walked to the house he stooped to the door and rapped on the planking he waited rapped again and called out when nothing happened he pulled the leather strap which lifted the wooden latch pushed open the door and looked inside warm golden light spilled out on to the snow making the new whiteness glisten like fine samite there is no one here he reported to the others who sat looking on do you think they saw us coming and have gone into hiding said yngvar he would be a blind man who saw you coming and did not hide replied svein listen said rognvald holding up his hand for silence from somewhere in the village there came the distant belllike sound of voices lifted in song the words seemed to come drifting down out of the sky with the falling snowas if angels were singing the notes clear and ringing in the softly silent air cait listened to the slow majestic strains and her breath caught in her throat it was a song she had sung at home in caithness every yuletide since she was old enough to remember the words the realization brought tears to her eyes before she knew it they were running freely down her cheeks here she thought in this place how could it be quickly lest the others see her she rubbed them away with the backs of her hands do you hear said rognvald it cannot be latin said svein or arabic and it is not danish or norwegian added yngvar nor spanish i think offered dag none too certain rodrigo shook his head no cait told them it is gaelic you know it my lady asked svein i know it well she raised her face to the falling snow and sang lompaim siar go dti goiroias an chathair tintri dun an tsolais dun gleadhrach gloir dun feasa baile don tiarna loldanach her voice gentle and melodious in the snowsmothered silence wrought a magical change in the knights they stared at cait with rapt almost ecstatic expressions of amazementas if she had suddenly sprouted wings what does it mean asked rognvald when she finished it is an old invocation she replied it means i am turning towards the west towards goirais the fiery city fortress of light fortress of blazing glory fortress of wisdom home of the manygifted lord she broke off suddenly aware of the wondering stares of the knights it is part of a yuletide ritual performed by the cele de she explained yuletide remarked svein can it be the christ mass this way dag said starting off along the path leading into the settlement the others followed and they shortly arrived at a small village green at the end of the green was an odd round building of rough mountain stone larger than any of the surrounding houses and barns it was roofed with turf and topped by a wooden cross a round window above the chapel door allowed light to stream out into the darknessalong with the clear poignant strains of the song the congregation was singing the knights so rapt in their fascination with the song remained motionless in their saddles listening as the last notes of the graceful melody faded away if it is the christ mass said yngvar breaking the silence at last let us go in and join the celebration svein and dag were out of the saddle and hurrying towards the door before he finished speaking rodrigo and yngvar followed lady said rognvald it seems we are going to church so it seems my lord and not before time as they dismounted the congregation inside the chapel began singing again recognition caused caits heart to beat faster she halted in midstep to listen a fionnghil a lonraigh a feasaigh tiana anocht tiana naofa leanbh anocht seeing cait had stopped rognvald turned and heard her repeating the words of the song o bright one o radiant one o knowing one come tonight come holy child tonight she said translating the words for him the tall knight smiled with genuine pleasure then nodded to dag to proceed dag pushed open the door of the chapel and stepped inside with yngvar rodrigo and svein close on his heels the singing stopped instantly cait and rognvald entered to find the villagers gaping in amazement at the snowcovered halffrozen knightsas if at the wise kings appearing fresh from the judaean hills on their fateful journey the chapel blazed with the light of hundreds of candles and in the centre of the timber floor a large bronze bowl filled with glowing embers before this glowing bowl stood a priest in robes of undyed wool his hands still raised in supplication his mouth open the song fresh on his lips at caits appearance the priest lowered his hands he spoke a few words in a language cait did not know pax vobiscum she offered by way of reply stepping forward she quickly searched the congregation for her sister but did not see her and realized with a pang of disappointment that if alethea were here she would have made herself known by now pax vobiscum the priest answered excitedly pax vobiscum gloria in excelsis deo he moved quickly around the burning bowl and came to stand before cait lady of the blessed night he said in curiously accented latin i greet you with a holy kiss seizing both her hands in his he raised them to his lips and kissed them then led her by the hand into the centre of the round chapel this caused a hushed sensation among the villagersa group of fewer than seventy souls young and old the people gawked and murmured over their priest and the strange woman cait glanced around at the ring of watching faces once more in the forlorn hope that alethea might yet be found among themperhaps overcome by the sudden appearance of her sister and unable to step forward meanwhile the priest turned to the knights welcome friends he exclaimed pulling cait with him to the bright burning bowl come in come in close the door and warm yourselves by the fire please cait said turning to the priest at last we had no wish to disturb your service we heard the singing and thought merely to join you in your observance but you have disturbed us replied the priest even so we welcome the disturbance for it is an honour to entertain visitors on this most holy of all nights is it the christ mass it is daughter answered the priest he regarded her with a bemused expression now that she saw him better cait decided the priest was not so young as she had first thought him indeed he was she surmised as old as abbot padraigif not older yet his deportment and demeanour were those of a man half his age then by all means continue with your songs and prayers she said we would be pleased to listen the priest assented and turning to his congregation raised his hands once more he called them to attention and began singing again gradually the people resumed their songs and prayersif somewhat selfconsciously now for the presence of the strangers in their midst they were cait observed a small sturdy people shortlimbed and thickset with broad handsome faces it was the eyes she decided that gave them such an unusual appearancelarge and dark set deep above prominent cheekbones either side of their fine straight noses and each and every one gleaming with quick curiosity and humour the old orkneyingar told of the little dark people who had inhabited the islands long before the coming of the tallfolk she wondered if the people of this strange hidden place could belong to a similar race as the christ mass followed its hallowed sequence cait was moved by the extraordinary peculiarity of what she was hearingto be so far from home yet listening to people sing the old familiar songs in the same familiar accents she closed her eyes with the voices filling her ears she was once again back in caithnessas she remembered it a long time ago she was sitting in her grandmother ragnas lap in the church her grandfather murdo had built surrounded by men and women of the settlement and important guests and visitors the monks of the nearby monastery were singing their voices creating dizzying patterns as they rose swirling and soaring up to the cold clear stardusted heaven on the holiest night of the year before the gathered listeners stood her uncle eirik only tonight he was not her special friend he was the abbot straight and tall in his fine robes as he led the good brothers in their song and beside her his rough hand gently patting out the rhythm of the music on his knee her dear old grandfather murdo his hair white as the snow on the hills and rooftops of banvard his beard a grizzled frost on his cheeks and chin she saw it all so clearly and the memory made her heart catch in her throat the most potent yearning she had ever known rushed over her in a flood of longing so powerful it took her breath away she had no doubt this was the hiraeth old padraig had often spoken of the homeyearningan affliction of the traveller which produces a craving of such unrivalled magnitude that some poor wayfarers had been known to waste away in hopeless pining for their faroff home cait bore the ache of the hiraeth even as she exulted in the memory of that christ mass long ago and gradually the conflicting emotions produced in her a pleasurable calm as the voices announced the ageold gospel of the blessed messiahs birth she felt a peaceful acceptance of all that had been and would bean inexplicable recognition that somehow she was where she was meant to be however she had come whatever trials she had faced she belonged here her presence was ordained by forces beyond her imagining at last the service finished the priest blessed his congregation and then turned to his visitors my friends we would be honoured to have you stay with us and share our hospitality humble as it is i daresay you will not find better tonight nor i think a more heartfelt welcome anywhere your offer is most kind brother began rognvald forgive me i am brother timotheus the priest said quickly known to one and all as timo if as you have proclaimed tonight rognvald continued a simple barn was good enough for the holy child it will be good enough for us well said brother replied the priest but we can do better than that he turned and called several of the villagers from among those who were timidly eyeing the large fiercelooking newcomers the knights were surrounded by a knot of boys who showed a lively interest in the swords hanging from their belts dominico the priest said laying his hand on the shoulder of one of the men is head man of this village and these two fine young men are his sons i will instruct them to find places for you among the people if that is acceptable we are but a small village as you will have noticed and there is not a house large enough to hold you all nevertheless i can assure you of a warm dry place among kindly folk many a king could wish for as much yes and full many the timotheus broke off suddenly ah forgive me i am preaching again he smiled meekly i seem to do that more and more these days i cannot say why we would be pleased to accept your kind invitation cait told him so long as it does not overtax the charity of the people heaven forbid sniffed the priest it will be good for them he turned and spoke quickly to the village chief who with much nodding and smiling hurried away with his sons taking a fair portion of the population with him rognvald commanded the knights to go along and see that the horses were cared for they all clumped out into the snowy darkness what is the name of this place asked cait smiling at two little girls hiding behind their inquisitive elders it is called pronakaelit the priest said it means hidden valley cait repeated the word and asked what language is spoken here ah yes replied timotheus despite my best efforts they speak but little latin as you have astutely observed the tongue they prefer is their own their name for it is euskari but the songs cait pointed out were gaelic brother timotheus smiled proudly i know i taught them as it happens said rognvald we have come in search of a young woman tall and with long dark hair her name is alethea we were hoping to find her here were you indeed replied the priest with some surprise she has been here i can tell you that truly cait clasped her hands together and raised them to her chin hoping against hope that she had heard the priest correctly rognvald reached out and put his hand on her arm in anticipation of the news before either of them could ask what he knew the priest asked who is she that you should seek her so ardently she is my sister cait said is she well do you know where she has gone please said the priest holding up his hands to stem the flood of questions he feared were forthcoming i can tell you she is well and she is nearby god be praised breathed rognvald his voice a slow sigh of relief where demanded cait excitedly can we go there now peace my lady the priest protested gently i dare not say more alethea was abducted by bandits rognvald explained they carried her into these mountains and we have been searching for her since she was taken brother timotheus nodded as if he suspected that this had been the way of things all along i believe you my friends i assure you i do believe you and if it were up to me i would send for the girl at once and happily preside over your joyful reunion he spread his hands apologetically be that as it may however it is not so easy as that nor can i say more cait mystified by this irrational reluctance stared at the monk in bewilderment but why i promised annora that i would say nothing rognvald seeing the clouds gathering on caits furrowed brow moved to avert the storm who is annora could you tell her that we have come for alethea annora is abbess of the order of the klais mains the good sisters maintain an abbey near here klais mairis said cait repeating the words the name was so far as she could tell quite similar to the gaelic she knew it meant the grey marys is it far this abbey can we go there alas no at least not tonight said the priest but tomorrow i can send word to the abbey that you are here cait shook her head in dismay the kindly priest frowned with sympathy i am sorry daughter he said this is how it must be but be of good cheer for she is safe and well cared for and i have no doubt that in a day or two you will be reunited with your sister rognvald thanked the good brother for this assurance and cait forcing a smile thanked him too and said with as good a grace as she could muster we have waited this long i suppose a day or two longer will make no difference in any event it is good to know that she is safe and wellwherever she may be yes that is the spirit timo rubbed his hands now then you must be hungry and thirsty from your journey would you and your men care to join me in a simple repast it is only beans and bread mind for tomorrow is the first of many feast days we would be most happy to break bread with you replied cait overcoming her disappointment but nothing would please me more than to hear how one of the cele de came to be living in this remote fastness brother timotheus eyebrows arched high in surprise deus mews he exclaimed you know of the cele de oh i know enough to recognize them when i see them cait assured him rognvald regarded her curiously but said nothing you see my family has long supported a cele de monastery on our lands come along then daughter he said taking her hand excitedly you must come and sit with me and tell me everything the priest busied himself with snuffing the candles beginning with those on the altarpausing before each one and bowing three times before lowering the crookshaped snuffer over the flame he moved around the room with a sprightly step humming to himself and glancing every now and then at his visitors as if to reassure himself that they had not vanished as suddenly and inexplicably as they had arrived then taking up a lantern from beside the door timotheus led them out and around to the back of the chapel to a cell built against the church wall darting inside he collected his staff and hooded cloak and then led his guests across the village square to the settlements largest house the door was open and there was music coming from inside this is dominicos house he told them that is his baptism name mind i cannot pronounce his birth name inside they found the knights huddled together beside a generous hearth their feet stretched before a log fire while they listened to a pair of lively young men play music on a pipe and drum while womenfolk of various ages darted here and there with platters bowls and cups dominico stood in the middle of the room welcoming his guests singing loudly and calling orders to all the others in their incomprehensible tongue while his wife a small round woman called elantra directed the preparations with quiet efficiency glad yule my lady called yngvar as cait and rognvald entered they have already fed our horses and now they are going to feed us glad yule added svein lofting the cup in his hand they have ale too and black bread like home said dag waving half a loaf at them it seems the yuletide celebrations have begun after all remarked rognvald the people here are like children in many ways sighed brother timotheus they can never wait for anything dominico chattering excitedly gathered the late arrivals and herded them to a bench opposite the hearth he dashed away returning a moment later with two overflowing ale cups and a young girl bearing a tray of bread the darkeyed girl grave with the weight of her responsibility stood straight and looking neither left nor right offered the noble guests loaves of black bread from her tray while rognvald took charge of the cups cait accepted one of the loaves smiled pleasantly and thanked the girl whose stoic solemnity wilted at their exchange the household honour satisfied she turned and scampered away calling loudly for her mother the musicians meanwhile finished their song to the noisy acclaim of the knights who began stamping their feet and slapping their knees and clamouring for more the two boys grinned and quickly commenced another yet more spirited tune dominico clapping his hands and calling like a bird began whirling around spinning this way and that his feet beating time to the music he rounded on cait scooped her up and spun her on to the floor the next thing she knew she was caught up in the dance to the dizzy delight of one and all more and more villagers were crowding into the house by the moment some bringing jars of wine and ale and others bearing festive foods boiled eggs smoked meat and fish flat bread flavoured with anise when there was no more room in the house the merrymaking spilled out into the snow and then the neighbouring houses more musical instruments appeared tabors and shakers pipes made of gourds and clay wooden flutes of several sizes and an oddly shaped lyre with four strings they drank and sang and danced and then drank some more cait quickly became the most soughtafter partner as one after another of the male villagers young and old seized the opportunity to dance with their noble visitor once presented with two obstinate partners who asked at the same time she averted hurt feelings by taking on both at once to the exuberant approval of the women looking on amidst the singing and dancing the food came and went and the night with it one nights revelry spilled over into the next days celebration the light of a yuletide dawn was showing when cait finally found a chance to creep away she went into her hosts chamber loosed her swordbelt and put the weapon aside before sinking into a bed piled high with furs she closed her eyes and slept only to be awakened a short time later by the clanging of a bell outside the house chapter thirtynine cait sat up in bed so strong was the sense of familiarity she imagined she was home again in caithness the priests at banvard rang the bells to signal the beginning of the yuletide celebrations she wondered if brother timotheus did the same when the music began again she relinquished any expectation of sleep rose from her bed and made her way outside to a world of sparkling white made brilliant by the light of the rising sun the sky was clear and heartbreakingly blue and the high encircling mountain peaks burned with a rosy glow like fired bronze the villagers were making their way in procession to the chapel led by brother timotheus exuberantly swinging an oversize bell the air was biting cold and the pealing of the bell piercing in its clarity yngvar dag and rodrigo were in the forefront of the parade trampling triumphantly through the snow as if to make a path for those behind they were followed by dominico and his sons and all the rest neither rognvald nor svein was to be seen but cait fell into line behind the others and proceeded to the church the service was blessedly short brother timotheus simply read out a psalm and led his faithful flock in a few prayers the congregation sang a song and then they all trooped back outside where everyone hailed everyone else with an enthusiastic yuletide greeting cait was swept up in wave upon wave of hugging and kissing as one after another of the villagers embraced her then they all went off to resume the celebration as the last released her and hurried away she looked up to find rognvald standing before her glad yule lady caitriona he said it seems i am too late for prayers but not i hope for a greeting with that he opened his arms and folded her into a warm embrace and gave her a kiss that left her blinking at its sudden virile intensity glad yule my lord she said gazing up into his face he smiled his blue eyes keen and clear as the skies high overhead will you break fast with me it would be a pleasure she replied taking rognvalds arm they walked slowly enjoying one anothers company and the fine sparkling day the sound of the snow squeaking beneath her feet filled cait with a youthful joy she had not known for years it seems our search is soon concluded she said after a time when rognvald did not answer she glanced sideways at his face and saw that he was gazing at the mountains towering above the village their smooth snowdusted slopes gleaming in the new days light they appeared to cait like stately monarchs robed in winter furs and enthroned around the bowl of the valley gazing at their own splendour in the bright mirror of its lake tell me about the cele de he said who are they there is little enough to tell she began they are priests of an order that holds itself apart from romea small order but tenacious and fiercely loyal to its calling what is that to preserve the true path and guard the holy light rognvald nodded they are heretics then not in the least cait protested they simply embrace an older tradition than rome there were christians in the west before rome you know the church of the celts is older by far than the one decreed by emperor constantine and rognvald chuckled are you laughing at me she said defensively you sound like a priest now he replied trying to convert the unbeliever i suppose i am she allowed accepting his chiding the cele de are a small and much maligned sect and we grow protective are you one of these cele de she nodded all of my family belong to the sectever since my grandfather went on the great pilgrimage to jerusalem he discovered them in jerusalem no he met some priests aboard the ship that carried him to the holy land he would not have survived the journey without them when he returned he rewarded them with lands and money to build a monastery and she added with quiet defiance no matter what anyone says they are the kindliest most compassionate and thoughtful people you will ever meet if that is true why are they so reviled but they are not reviled protested cait you said they were maligned he pointed out it is the same thing no it is not she snapped there is a world of difference the cele de are never reviled no he looked at her askance if they were not would you defend them so heartily before she could challenge this observation he said what is this true path that they follow i am not going to tell you she replied crisply you will only make sport of it and rognvald stopped walking he was looking straight along the path beaten through the snow by the villagers what is it why have you stopped more visitors bandits cait looked around quickly but could not see anyone where just there he indicated a clump of villagers a few dozen paces before them cait had been looking for horses and riders and missed the two pale slender figures standing directly in her path like brother timotheus they were dressed in hooded robes of undyed wool and judging from the enthusiastic welcome they were receiving from the villagers they were well known and well liked they arrived last nightburst in on us during the service the priest was saying ah here are two of them now he motioned cait and rognvald to join them here i was just telling sister efa about you and this he said indicating the woman next to her is sister siaran gods peace to you sisters cait said i am pleased to meet you i am caitriona and this is lord rognvald of haukeland in norway both nuns pressed their hands together and inclined their heads politely god bless you and keep you they intoned together when everyone had become a little better acquainted brother timotheus said i believe these good people have business with abbess annora i was going to send word to you today although now as you are here i will let them speak for themselves before cait could open her mouth however the priest said but come it is cold and they will have made a warming drink for us let us discuss matters over our cups before the fire they proceeded to dominicos house where as timotheus had predicted a cauldron of hot spiced ale was just being poured into jarsmuch to the noisy delight of the knights who extolled the virtues of their host with rousing cheers as they drank his health and that of his sons and wife and daughters cait rognvald and the two sisters settled on benches in a corner of the room and the priest went to fetch the ale it is such a beautiful morning said cait easing her way into the conversation have you travelled far the sister called efa replied a small distance my lady that was all she said and when it appeared there was no more forthcoming rognvald spoke up your robes are very like brother timos here are you of the same order yes my lord she said and looked down at her hands folded tightly in her lap i see he said then you are cele de too the two glanced quickly at one another in nervous amazement you know of the cele de asked the one called siaran i know all about them he said confidently lady caitriona here is a stalwart defender of the order her familys lands support a monastery in the far northa place called caithness have you ever heard of it the nuns shook their heads it is true my lady asked a wideeyed sister efa your family maintains a monastery yes cait assured them and my uncle is abbot of the order truly wondered brother timotheus returning just then celebrations came between us somewhat last night but i still want to hear all about this haven in the north you must be aletheas sister volunteered sister siaran she is that said rognvald beaming with the pleasure of making these small revelations we have been searching for her explained cait quickly brother timo told us she was with you cait smiled trying to put the timid sisters at their ease i understand she is well yes my lady replied efa then lapsed into silence once more where is she i want to see her at once is it far the two sisters exchanged an uncertain glance but said nothing is there something which prevents me from bringing her home asked cait growing frustrated with their reticence allow me my lady said timotheus addressing the two young nuns he said tf i am not mistaken you have been instructed not to speak of this matteram i right sister siaran looking at her hands in her lap nodded there you see cried timotheus as if this were the answer to all their troubles but why should they refuse to speak about it i am her sister cait said we have been searching for her a very long time i want to see her and please please said timotheus quickly all in good time i imagine the abbess will have her reasons then i will not press you cait replied trying to remain calm and reasonable but you must take me to her please i need to see her you must understand but my lady protested efa looking to brother timotheus for help it may not be convenient the priest began i want to go to my sister she insisted her tone growing sharp i do not care if it is convenient or not we have travelled a very long way and people have died her voice broke and hot tears came to her eyes i have to see and know she is well rognvald put his hand on her shoulder and she allowed herself to be drawn close it is true he said to timotheus we have endured many hardships in the search it seems a needless cruelty to deny us when we are so close forgive me my friends said timotheus soothingly i have spoken without sufficient forethought he gave caits hand a fatherly pat you shall see your sister of course you shall this very day we will leave at once rognvald said and go as swiftly as horses can carry us oh no said the priest shaking his head in dismay it is not permitted what said the knight are you saying horses are not permitted men are not permitted replied timotheus nor weapons either the abbey contains women only you must stay behind my friend the abbess is most strict about this in all my years i have never known an exception perhaps i may be allowed to escort the women part way suggested rognvald would there be any objection to that do you think providing you left your weapons behind the priest agreed i suppose it would be allowed thank you brother cait said i am much obliged she stood quickly i will gather my things and make ready to go i would still prefer to announce your arrival timotheus answered but in light of your feelings i see no reason why we cannot forgo that formality yes why not when the sisters have concluded their visit you shall return to the abbey with them cait hurried away leaving the others to finish their festive ale when she returned a short while later she was dressed in her best clothes and her hair had been brushed and her face washed until the skin glowed she fairly hummed with happy anticipation as she hurried outside where rognvald had brought horses for cait and himself and one for the two nuns dubious riders at best to share brother timotheus and some of the villagers accompanied them to the edge of the settlement and bade them farewell the nuns pointed out the path and they quickly found themselves on a steeply rising trail leading into the mountains which towered above the village they rode in silence enjoying the crisp crystalline beauty of the day listening to the birds in the snowladen branches of the tall pines growing alongside the trail after a time they left the trees behind the track became more narrow and winding as it snaked up and up into a sky of blazing blue the snowcovered path bent inward following a fold in the mountainside the sides of the trail rose high and sheer as the walls of a fortress and when the riders emerged once more they could see the little village far far below snug in its hollow as if nestled in the palm of a gigantic hand the surrounding peaks like fingers another bend removed the village from sight and they came to a chasm dividing two peaks the gorge was deep and narrow spanned by a simple bridge made of rope and wood rognvald reined in and dismounted he examined the bridge and concluded that he dare not risk taking horses across the abbey is not far sister efa told them we will walk from here then this is where i leave you the knight said to the women as he dismounted he helped the nuns down from the saddle and then watched as they tripped lightly across the fragilelooking bridge then it was caits turn rognvald wished her gods own speed and said i pray you find all is well and eagerly await your return cait watching the swaying bridge with mounting apprehension nodded gripping the side ropes in either hand she took a deep breath and started across her eyes fixed firmly on the waiting figure of sister efa rognvald watched until she had safely reached the other side where she turned and waved him farewell then he gathered up the reins turned the horses and returned to the settlement beyond the chasm the trail passed between two steep baire rock slopes before arriving at a low tunnel which had been chiselled out of the mountain stone although the tunnel was dark and damp it was not long and cait emerged on the other side to find tfce trail winding gently down beside a racing mountain stream the three women walked along quiet in one anothers company an d soon arrived at a stand of tall thin birch trees they walked through the wood which ended shortly arid cait stepped out from among the trees into a high mountain glade at the far end of the snowdrifted meadow she could see a crramped huddle of buildings which she assumed formed the abbey of the grey marys they followed the trail beside the stream and soon cames to the first of the outbuildings two simple barns with adjoining stone enclosures for sheep and goats and four modest but wellthiatched storehouses solidlooking on their stone foundations next they passed the square expanse of a field its rippling ridges visible beneath thick snow at one end of the field was an orcriard of small welltended trees on one side of the grove stood a ffine tall stack c chopped wood and on the other side was a triple row of beehives the familiar sight of their highmounded white hurrnps sent a pang of homely longing through cait and her heart quickaened even from a distance she could tell that this was a place oof order and peace of humble industry and dutiful purpose closer sshe saw the tidy yard its smoothcobbled paving swept clean of snow on opposite sides of the yard were long rows of individual cells each with a single tiny window and a low wooden door on the third side of the yard stood a large amply proportioned house of two floors with shuttered windows and rising sharply behind this larger structure a rugged tawny shoulder of the mountain whose sheltering peak soared high above the neat little abbey there was no church or chapel that she could see but the abbeys unadorned uncluttered simplicity appealed to cait she warmed to the place even before she heard the singingwhich stopped her in her tracks with its clear angelic mellifluence what is that she said her breath catching in her throat the two sisters glanced at one another it is the prayer before the midday meal my lady answered siaran it is beautiful cait replied and was instantly reminded of abbot emlyns strong melodious voice as he stood before the festal table in murdos hall head back arms spread wide a song of blessing bubbling up from his throat as from a deep sweet spring it was she realized the second time in as many days that she had been brought up short by singingonce in the village and now here it reminded me of something she said as a pang of yearning pierced her heart it reminded me of home alethea will be there she said stirring herself once more let us go and join them the three hurried on quickly crossing the yard and coming to the door of the refectory the singing had stopped and cait could hear the low murmur of voices from within she paused at the door and allowed sister efa to open it and beckon her inside trembling with anticipation she stepped lightly across the threshold the large room was dim but warm a single wide table occupied the centre of the room with benches on either side for the thirty or so nuns who had gathered for their meal talk ceased as cait stepped into the room and every face turned towards her she glanced the length of the table for alethea but did not see her welcome said a kindly voice and cait turned to see a trim elderly woman hastening towards her she was dressed as the others in a long robe of undyed wool and like old abbot emlyn back home wore a large wooden cross on a leather loop around her neck her hair was white and the bones stood out on her wrists and hands but her step was quick and her dark eyes keen i am abbess annora we are just beginning our meal please join us god be good to you i am looking for my sister said cait scanning the table once more brother timotheus told me she would be here the older woman smiled you must be caitriona alethea has told us about you addressing the nuns at table the abbess announced the identity of their visitor and bade the sisters make her welcome cait offered them a hurried greeting then once more turned to the abbess who said alethea has been praying for you then she is here said cait hope flickering bright once more where is she can you tell her i am here she will want to know i have found her at last are you hungry asked the abbess would you like something to eat after your long walk thank you no said cait frustration sharpening her tone please i want to see my sister come with me she took cait by the elbow and led her through a door at the far end of the refectory the room they entered was small containing only a simple straw pallet bed in a raised box a chair and a table in one corner a fire cracked brightly on a tiny stone hearth your sister is well said abbess annora closing the door behind them moreover she is happy but you cannot see her just now why demanded cait feeling the heat of frustration leap up within her forcing down her anger she said pleaseyou must tell me i have come a very long way and caitriona said the elderly nun her voice soft and caressing as a mothers your sister is in preparation for a special ceremony which will take place tonight a ceremony repeated cait would she never see her sister again i do not understand what kind of ceremony alethea has been called to join our order tonight she will take the first step towards becoming one of us chapter forty alethea cait stared in disbelief at the kindly abbess to become a nun that is her dearest wish the strength seemed to flow from caits legs she sat down on the edge of the box bed but how can that be although she has not been with us long alethea has changed the change is profound and it is genuine she is as astonished by this as anyone annora smiled she has embraced the order with a zeal which gladdens the hearts of all who see her cait shook her head from side to side trying to take it in but weve come all this way she said fighting to keep her voice steady against the emotions boiling within her are you telling me that she will not be coming back with us caitriona the abbess said gently try to understand alethea has heard the call of god and she has answered her place is here i want to see her cait said bluntly i want to see her now rest assured you will see herall in good time alethea is alone with god and cannot be disturbed in good time cait snapped unable to hold back her frustration any longer is she a prisoner here she stood abruptly fists tight arms stiff at her sides i have endured hardships beyond sufferance i have spent day after day after day in the saddlecold and hungry and often wet but what of that four warriors a priest and one brave servant have forfeited their lives in pursuit of her freedomthey lie cold in their graves beside the trail and her voice faltered and alethea is not to be disturbed cait stared at the woman in a misery of disbelief as bitter tears came to her eyes through every trial she had persevered hoping against hope that thea would be found she had faced death destruction and discomfort of every kind only to be told her sister wished to be alone with god it was beyond her ability to comprehend if you will not help me declared cait i will find her myself turning on her heel she moved swiftly towards the door caitriona said the abbess sternly stop to her own amazement she halted her hand on the latch think what you are doing said annora if you ever had any feeling for your sister then i ask you to honour her wishes she did not enter into this decision lightly and she will not thank you for interfering now cait could feel the icy centre of her resolve melting away annora softened alethea is coming to the end of a period of prayer and fasting in preparation for the ceremony which will take place tonight tomorrow when the ritual is finished you will be together unable to make herself reply cait merely nodded the abbess took her hand come it is a splendid day why not spend it with us share our meal and then i will show you something of our work here and you will come to know us better although cait no longer felt hungry she allowed herself to be led back into the refectory where she ate a few bites and then gave up as black melancholy overcame her when the abbess offered to show her the rest of the abbey she complained of fatigue and asked instead to be shown where she might lie down and rest the abbess summoned one of the sisters a woman of similar age and appearance to cait this is sister besashe will take you to the guest lodge cait thanked her and followed the sister out across the cobbled yard to one of the cells we have few guests the nun told her but we keep a room ready for anyone the good lord sends our way it is this one on the end the sister lifted the wooden latch pushed the door open and stepped in oh it is cold in here but i will make up the fire and it will soon be warm enough the sister hurried away leaving cait to stare at the bleakly simple room a table large enough to hold a candle a threelegged stool and neatly stacked logs beside the tiny halfcircle hearth and a straw pallet topped with a rough woollen coverlet the rooms sole adornment was a wooden cross which had obviously been made by one of the nuns it was fashioned from two bent pine branches smoothed and bound together with a strap of braided leather and hung below the tiny round window cait was still standing in the centre of the room when besa returned with an armful of kindling and some live embers in a small pan i suppose alethea stayed here she said absently why yes for a time the sister placed the wood beside the hearth and gently shook the embers from the bowl she has her own cell now cait waited for her to say more but the nun proceeded to arrange the wood around the little heap of glowing coals after a moment cait said how long have you been here besa glanced at her and then quickly away again as if the question was distracting all my life she answered after a moment or very nearly but you are not from aragon cait suggested the sister lowered her face to the heap of kindling and blew on the embers no she replied sitting back on her heels i am not from aragon i was born on the other side of the mountains she leaned forward and blew on the embers once more thin threads of smoke were soon curling up from the hearth as a cluster of yellow flames bloomed among the twigs but this has been my home so long i do not remember any other you never visit your family i did once replied sister besa rising to her feet but no more she smiled wanly and moved to the door i will leave you in peace now but if you need anything my room is next to this one she closed the door quickly behind her and was gone cait sat on the stool watching the flames catch and burn more brightly when the fire appeared hearty enough she added several larger chunks of wood from the stack and then retreated to the bed where she stretched herself out after gazing petulantly at the agedarkened pine roof beams she eventually drifted into an uneasy sleep she dreamed of hoofprints and felt herself once again on horseback riding through deepdrifted snow in her dream she seemed to be fleeing someonealthough she twisted in the saddle and craned her neck from time to time she could not see who it might be still she could feel a disturbing presence gaining ground behind her and the dull malevolence mounted until she grew afraid to look around anymore and then just as she knew she must confront the swiftly approaching evil there came the slow tolling of a distant bell instantly she felt the unseen wickedness falter in its onrushing flight she turned in the saddle lashed her mount and raced up the steep mountain trail leading to the abbey above the wild drumming of her heart she could hear the rhythmic ringing of the bell the sound grew and seemed to take on a more urgent note and she awoke it took cait some time to realize that it was a real bell she had been hearing as the last sonorous stroke faded into the air she rose and stepped to the window the fire on the hearth had burned out and the short winter day had ended it was growing dark outside she crept to the door opened it and looked quickly out there was no one to be seen but she assumed the bell summoned the sisters to prayer and so went outrealizing halfway across the yard that she did not know where the chapel might be she had seen none when coming to the abbey nor had the abbess mentioned it she paused for a moment looking around the sky yet held a blush of fading sunset but the first stars were glowing high overhead a light wind was blowing down from the surrounding flametouched peaks and it made her cold as she turned to retreat into her cell she heard the bell again and decided to follow the soundwhich seemed to come from behind the nearby refectory she flitted quickly to the end of the building and saw in the rock curtain rising sheer from the ground a wide low entrance cut into the living stone of the mountain the snow was tracked with dozens of footprints leading into a cave as cait followed them to the dark entrance she heard singing from within after the first few paces the darkness was all but complete with one hand to the wall beside her and the other outstretched and waving before her she edged slowly on guided by the singing of the nuns the texture of the wall beneath her fingertips as she felt her way along suggested that the tunnel had been carved into the rock both the wall and the floor were smooth and fairly even the wall ended abruptly and the air suddenly became warmer and held the slightly musty smell of damp rock taking a hesitant step she entered a larger chamber a gentle almost imperceptible breeze blew over her face from left to right instinctively she turned in the direction of the airflow and saw the pale glimmer of candlelight on the rim of another tunnel opening a dozen paces to her left she reached the tunnel doorway just as the glint of light faded leaving her in darkness once more more confident now she proceeded down the corridor as before keeping her hand to the wall beside her the floor slanted downward she could feel it tilting away and the slight cant quickened her step as if in anticipation of what she would find when she reached the end the singing grew louder and then the tunnel opened out wide and she was standing in the higharched entrance of an enormous chamber in the near distance cait saw as through a gloomwrapped forest of limbless trees the shimmering of ghostly lights the trees she realized were the tapering slightly misshapen shafts of great stone pillars rising from the cavern floor to the unseen roof high above the light came from candles in the hands of the nuns whose voices set the vast empty spaces of the chamber reverberating with the rippling music of their song stepping cautiously forward into this peculiar frozen forest cait moved silently from tree to tree pausing at each trunk to look and listen before moving on againfearful of being discovered yet desiring above all else to be allowed to stay and observe closer she caught a whiff of incensea cloying sweet vapour that filled her head with the essence of lavender she felt her empty stomach squirm at the heavy scent and paused to swallow before moving on the singing stopped and so cait halted too she heard someone speaking but was too far away to make out the words presently the address finished and there followed a lengthy silence which was broken at last by the ringing of a bell the nuns began singing again and flitting from one column to the next cait crept carefully cautiously nearer when the music ceased cait peered discreetly from her hiding place behind the last rank of pillars now but a few paces from the first of three low wide steps which rose from the level floor to make a platform on which the grey marys had assembled before an altar adorned with a great golden cross with two lamps burning on either side in their gently wavering light the ornately patterned gold of the cross seemed to melt and move abbess annora stood motionless before the altar with hands raised shoulderhigh palms upward as if expecting to receive a gift on the floor between the abbess and the waiting sisters two richly embroidered lengths of cloth were spread on each a young woman knelt in an attitude of prayer dressed in the same drab grey robes as the others they were set apart only by the long crimson hoods that covered their heads both supplicants were bent over their clasped hands and both were trembling slightly although she could not see their faces cait easily recognized the slender willowy form of her sister alethea at long last alethea caits heart leapt in her breast and she pressed the back of her hand to her mouth to keep from crying out closing her eyes she slumped against the pillar and felt the cool stone bear her up as relief rolled over her in waves i believe o god of all gods that thou art the eternal father of light the voice was that of abbess annora and she was immediately joined by a chorus of sisters who repeated the phrase three times with but slight variation i believe o god of all gods that thou art the eternal father of life i believe o god of all gods that thou art the eternal father of all creation the ceremony was in gaelic although the inflection was odd and some of the words seemed curiously oldfashioned cait understood it readily enough for the chant had the same qualities she had heard since she was old enough to sit upright in church and listen to abbot emlyns bold handsome voice declaring the high holiness of the god of love and light and his conquering son oh thea she thought that you of all people should strike such a bargain she wondered what her father would make of it and then remembered that he was dead and would never know well better this she supposed than an unsuitable marriage and where alethea was concerned that had always been a live possibility the young womans gift for making the most ludicrous and improper alliances had long been a worry to almost all who knew hersave duncan alone now it appeared that his longsuffering faith was about to be repaid when she had better control of herself cait once again edged from behind the column after the recitation there followed another song which afforded cait the opportunity to steal to another pillar for a better view when the song finished two of the sisters approached the kneeling figures with long tapering unlit candles addressing the novices the abbess spoke in a low voice to each in turn and was answered whereupon the candle was offered the two women rose and approached the altar to light their tapers from the lamps burning there returning to their places both young women knelt once more set the lit candles in golden sconces which had been provided and then stretched themselves fulllength face down on the embroidered rugs and extended their arms to either side in emulation of the cross the abbess took her place before them her hands outspread above their heads and she began to pray when she finished the two novices rose and resuming their kneeling posture began to pray aloud saying thanks to thee great of light that i have risen today to the rising of my life may it be to thy glory allwise creator and to the glory of my own dear soul o great king aid thou my soul with the aiding of thy mercy with the aiding of thy love with the aiding of thy compassion even as i clothe my body with this wool cover thou my soul with thy swift sure hand help me to avoid every sin and the source of every sin forsake as the mist scatters on the face of the mountains may each ill thought and deed vanish from my heart there were more prayers and when these finished the novices rose and one of the sisters came forward bearing a jar of consecrated oil with which she anointed them dipping her finger and signing them with the cross on their foreheads then each of the novices pledged her life to the service of the community taking a holy vow which the abbess administered with solemn approval after the vows the nuns began singing again this time as they sang they arranged themselves in two concentric rings around the altar holding their candles before them cait took advantage of the movement and edged closer for a better look from behind her pillar she now viewed the hooded figures from the side alethea was nearest her though cait could not see her face returning to the altar the abbess picked up a small wooden cross on a leather loop stepping before alethea the older woman held out the cross for the younger to kiss alethea leaned forward slightly reached out took hold of the cross and brought it to her lips as she did so cait felt a pang of yearning pierce her heart this took her by surprise she had not thought to be moved by the ceremony in this way what did it mean she had little time to wonder about this however for abbess annora nodded and alethea reached up pulled back the hood and lowered it to rest on her shoulders it was then cait saw that her sisters head was completely shaved the sight made caits breath catch in her throat all that lovely long dark hair gone strangely the sight of her sister this way on her knees denuded head bent in prayer awakened cait to the solemn seriousness of her sisters decision oh thea she thought dear dear thea for once in your life i hope you know what you are doing the abbess moved to the other young woman and repeated the conferral of the cross then one of the sisters stepped forward holding two lengths of dovegrey cloth across her outstretched palms taking one of the cloths the abbess draped it around aletheas shoulders like a shawl leaning close she kissed the younger woman lightly on the forehead then raised her to her feet the procedure was repeated for the second novice whereupon the two newest members of the abbey were embraced by the abbess and each of the other sisters in turn thus were they welcomed into the intimate fellowship of the order cait thought the ceremony would end now and the grey marys would leave but as soon as the new sisters had received their welcome the nuns reformed their circle the abbess turned once more to the altar crossing her hands over her breast she bent her head and called out in the meeting of our hearts and minds thou in the calling of our souls dear lord thou in the weaving of life below with life above thou saviour lord and thou only so saying she stepped to the altar pressed her hands together and then placed her palms flat on either side of the huge golden cross as if she would remove itan unusual gesture and unexpected which drew caits attention as she watched the abbess withdrew her hands and cait saw that a door had opened in the base of the cross revealing a hollow place reaching in the abbess brought forth a footed cup cait could not see it clearly from where she stood but it seemed an ordinary drinking cup of wood perhaps or pottery a glint of candlelight traced the rim as the abbess turned and presented the cup to alethea who gazing steadily at the vessel extended her neck slightly as the abbess brought the cup to her mouth to drink no sooner had the cup touched her lips than the young woman gave out a loud cry she raised her head and in the candlelight cait saw her younger sisters face aglow with a strange light that seemed to dance over her features alethea cried out again and swooned crumpling slowly on to her side it was all cait could do to keep from rushing to her sisters aid instead she bit the back of her hand and forced herself to stay behind her pillar the cup was offered to the second novice who likewise accepted a drink and promptly sank to the floor a smile of ecstasy on her fresh young face at the same time cait became aware of a sweetening of the air as if a blossomscented breeze had suddenly wafted into the cave the two young women lay before the altar for a long silent moment the sight of them sleeping so peacefully their features suffused with such rapturous abandon produced in cait a longing she had not felt for a very long time oh to know such peace she thought after a while the abbess returned the cup to its hidden nook and then stood over the stricken novices stretching her hands above them she intoned now art thou the beloved of god receive these gifts from the gifting giver the grace of form the grace of voice the grace of good fortune in all things the grace of kindness the grace of wisdom the grace of charity the grace of modesty and fair virtue the grace of wholesouled loveliness the grace of pleasing speech so saying abbess annora stooped and placed a hand on each young womans head then resuming her place once more she said as you abide in christ he abides in you therefore through all things whatsoever shall befall you remember thou art the joy of all joyous things thou art the light of the suns glorious beaming thou art the door of generous hospitality thou art the shining star of guidance thou art the amity of the deer on the hill thou art the comeliness of the swan on the lake thou art the strength of the steed on the plain thou art the beauty of all lovely desires henceforth and for ever more amen the abbess placed her hand on the novices heads once more and said arise to life renewed with these words both young women rose and stood smiling looking slightly bewilderedas if they were indeed seeing the world for the first time abbess annora blessed the newest members of her order and the nuns reformed their ranks and began withdrawing from the rockcut sanctuary singing as they went taking up their candles once more the two young nuns fell into place behind them leaving the abbess alone for a moment after the others had gone abbess annora made reverence herself before the altar and then knelt head lifted high gazing up into the darkness of the cavern arms outstretched as if to receive a gift from her unseen lord cait watched and something about the simple devotion touched her and she wondered how long it had been since she had knelt like that and experienced the tranquillity of a free and open heart instantly she was seized by ferocious yearning to be at peace within herself once more when annoras prayers were finished cait waited until she could no longer hear her footsteps and then crept out from her hiding place behind the pillar she thought to take a candle from the altar so that she might find her way back through the tunnelled passages stepping quickly to the altar she reached for one of the candles and paused to look at the handsome golden cross what from a distance appeared a work of solid metal closer observation revealed to be carved wood overlaid with sheets of beaten gold at the base of the cross she saw the thin vertical crack which defined the door of the niche containing the communion cup moving closer she placed her hands on either side of the base in imitation of the abbess although she felt nothing save the cool smoothness of the metal the pressure of her palms caused the thin covering of gold to bulge slightly beneath her right hand she pressed the bulge with her palm there was a click the little door opened in the base of the cross and there was the cup thinking only to admire its simple uncomplicated shape she reached in and brought it out it was as she had guessed a simple footed bowl of pale deeply grained wood to which had been added a golden rim and the foot gilded in the gentle light of the candles the wooden bowl shone with a fine lustre where the touch of many hands had polished it over the years she tilted the cup and looked inside it was empty more than that it was dry which she thought odd for she had seen alethea and the other novice drink from the cup even if they had drained it there would still remain some residue of the wine they had tasted but there was none raising the vessel she put her nose into the bowl and sniffed the faintly sweet aroma she had smelled at the offering of the cup during the ceremony still lingered there the scent reminded her of beeswax and rose blossom but lighter and somehow fresher then more in imitation than expectation she touched her lip to the golden rim and tilted the cup a warm fluid met her tongue she gave a squeak of surprise and jumped back almost dropping the cup she steadied her hand and looked into the bowl which was now filled with a darkly gleaming crimson liquid chapter fortyone trembling cait closed her eyes and brought the cup to her lips the dark liquid seemed to flow of itself over the rim of the cup and into her mouth it bathed her tongue with a heavy sweetness like that of honeyed wine the taste so surprised her that she jerked the cup away what was it the nuns had prayed she wondered the words came at once to her lips and she spoke them out i believe o god of all gods that thou art the eternal father of all creation o great king aid thou my soul with the aiding of thy mercy with the aiding of thy love with the aiding of thy compassion cover thou my soul with thy swift sure hand raising the cup she drank deep of the sweet dark liquid a quick warmth spread from her throat it coursed through her body flowing through her limbs to the tips of her fingers and toes her heart beat faster cait looked again into the cup to see that it now contained more of the liquid than it had when she had first drunk her breath came faster and her temples throbbed a strange distress crept over her unseen needles pricked her throat and breast what have i done she thought her breath came now in quick bursts and gasps fearing she might drop the sacred vessel she carefully replaced the cup on the altar and made to step away remembering the candle she reached for it and saw that her hand was marked by a delicate tracery of tiny lines that seemed to glow from beneath her skinas if instead of blood her veins now pulsed with living light thrusting her hand behind her as if hiding it from sight would conceal what she had done she closed her eyes butwonder of wondersshe could now see through her eyelids the world was vastly altered for instead of a mountain cavern and rough stone altar she stood alone in the centre of a lowceilinged room a single large window opened on to an early twilight sky where a solitary star was shining the objects in the room and the room itself possessed the distinctive clarity of a dream all the same she did not feel as if she was asleep all her senses were keen and sharpnever had she been so aware so alert so alive the room in which she stood was large and before her a low table was prepared for a meal it was surrounded by rugs and cushions in the eastern manner and spread with a fine blue cloth there were bowls of various sizes and jars of several shapes and kinds but there was no food through the open window a soft breeze was blowing and she could hear the dull clinking of a cattle bell outside the soft evening air held the scent of the east of sunbaked earth of sandalwood and jasmine stepping around the table she moved to the window and peered out the room overlooked the rooftops of the surrounding buildings some of which had small palm trees in pots or booths of striped cloth stretched over wooden frames she heard the bell again and looked down into the narrow street below where a shepherd in a ragged cloak herded a small flock of sheep led by a shaggy longnecked goat from further up the street came the sound of laughter a group of men entered the streetsix or eight of them togetherdarkhaired bearded all dressed in loose belted robes and each carrying a cloak of light material rolled upon his shoulder they walked with the easy familiarity of brothers or soldiers full of bluster and confidence jostling one another goodnaturedly one or two had their arms around the shoulders of their fellows they were happy laughing talking loudly luxuriating in the exuberance of their companionship cait envied their enthusiasmso light so effusive men and sheep met in the middle of the street and there was a momentary impasse before one of the men gave out a shout and stamped his feet which sent the sheep leaping over one another in a frantic effort to get by the shepherd cried out in alarm and shaking his staff at the raucous youths he ran after his flock the men bleated like sheep and continued on up the street arriving beneath caits window where they stopped not wishing to be seen she backed away and a moment later heard voices in the house in the room below her then she heard feet on wooden steps and the voices grew louder they were coming up she spun around searching for a place to hide and saw at the far end of the room one of two wooden pillars which supported the central roof beam beside one of the pillars stood a large woven reed basket containing rolledup rugs moving to the pillar she slipped behind it as the company trooped into the room talking all the while in a language cait could not understand they were darkskinned young men most with short dark beards and long hair which some of them wore neatly plaited with curled sidelocks at either temple and others loose in a shaggy mane some of them she saw carried cloth bags which they proceeded to empty on to the table bread in large flat rounds dried fish and grapes more voices sounded from the street one of the men leaned out of the window and shouted down to those below as feet pounded on the stairs and more men burst happily into the room to be welcomed by their fellows sacks of food were produced and jars of oil in carriers of knotted grass cait became aware of the smell of roasting meat and two men appeared carrying a whole spitted lamb on an enormous wooden platter they had no sooner set down the roast lamb when three more men came in bearing a huge open jug of wine into which the jars on the table were immediately plunged several women arrived dressed in similar fashion to the men the cloth of their garments was finer stuff however and more brightly coloured and they wore flowers in their long black hair some brought bowls heaped high with blueblack olives and others bowls of dates stuffed with almonds the room was soon full of people and still more were crowding in with everyone talking at once the sound was a noisy babble but the commotion served to lessen caits fear of discovery plucking up her courage she moved to stand beside the pillar as the festivities commenced everywhere men and women were talking quickly excitedly eyes and teeth glinting with laughter suddenly one of the young men approached caits pillar and pulled a rolledup rug from the basket she made to step behind the pillar once more but the fellow merely smiled at her and hurried away the talking and laughter continued unabated but cait sensed a change in the room like an eddy in a swiftrunning stream the happy commotion suddenly swirled with new intensity and depth and the room suddenly seemed brighter she felt a shiver of excitement course through the gatheringas when the king arrives in a yuletide hall or the bride appears at a wedding party she searched for the source of the commotion and saw that more celebrants had entered and were clustered in a tight knot by the door she strained for a glimpse of who it might be then the crowd parted and he stepped into the room he wore a simple belted mantle the sleeves of which were rolled up to the elbows like the other young men his cloak was folded on his shoulder but where the others favoured the brighter colours his was the pale unassuming grey of daylabourers and the poor his beard was dark and curly his brow even his swarthy skin darkened by long days in the sun his eyes were large and deepset his glance quick and keen master yeshua called one of the young men how do you like the room we have found for you you have done well nathanael replied the master it was just as you said it would be yeshua cait whispered the name under her breath if in appearance he was a simple labourer in bearing he was an emperor head erect shoulders straight confidence and nobility flowed from every movement even from across the room cait could tell from his winsome smile that he was the source of the exuberance she and all the others felt he was the sun whose presence warmed all who stood within the circle of his bright radiance he was smiling and laughing with the others and as cait watched he removed his cloak and laid it aside he took up an empty bowl from the table and filled it with water from one of the jugs taking a cloth he wrapped it around his waist and began moving among the crowd of friends he stopped near to caits corner where two burly young men were talking he knelt down and without a word began washing the feet of one of the fellows the man laughed and stepped back cheerfully declining the service but yeshua persisted and so the fellow relented and allowed water to be poured over his dusty feet when he finished he turned to the second mana stocky roughhanded fellow who remonstrated more forcefully they were near enough for cait to hear what was said and as they spoke intelligible words gradually emerged from the welter of speech that filled the room master cried the man what are you doing get up from there heaven forbid you should wash my feet peace brother yeshua said let me do this never protested the young man his arms were big and his shoulders massive he stood a head taller than anyone around him and his voice boomed out with the force of a man who has lived his life in wide open places at his objection others standing nearby turned to see what was happening rather it is i who should wash you hardheaded kepha replied yeshua do you not understand unless i wash you now you can have no part of my kingdom later very well said the big fisherman thrusting out his arms then wash my hands and head as well take a bath if you must shimeon answered yeshua resuming his duty your big feet are labour enough for me the onlookers laughed at this and shimeon with much huffing and puffing suffered the humiliation of having his feet washed by his master yeshua continued on making a circuit of the room cait watched him as he went here and there pausing to wash his followers feet in his lap and dry them with the cloth he had tied around his waist some laughed at the novelty of the situation others grew quiet and submitted with solemn formality when he finished yeshua returned to the table and put on his cloak once more then addressing the gathering he spread his arms wide and said beloved friends the passover feast is ready come let us sit and enjoy it together for i tell you the truth i shall not eat it again until the kingdom is fulfilled cait could see that some wondered at the meaning of this invitation but their questions were swept away in the general rush to find places at the table clearly there were many more people present than would fit around the single table and some would have to make their places on rugs spread about the room as the genial crowd pushed forward two of the younger members jostled one another for a seat one bumped the other in his haste to claim a place his friend shoved him aside saying leave the table for the elders children sit over there yeshua heard them what is this he chided gently are we now become like roman kings who lord it over the people and claim every high place as their right having drawn the attention of the master the two grew embarrassed and shrank back may it never be instead let the greatest among you be like the least for in the kingdom to come you will eat and drink at my table and each and every one of you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel this brought a delighted laugh from those around him one at the end of the table called out i will be king shimeon to which someone else added ruler of the fishes and turtles in the sea kings will you be affirmed the master but in the kingdom to come the one who would rule must be as the lowliest servant in his house the two slunk away ashamed their places were quickly taken by others and everyone settled down some reclining on cushions others sitting crosslegged on their rugs when all was quiet yeshua blessed the food and the festal meal commenced soon they were all eating and talkinglaughter gusted in quick bursts most of which cait noticed originated at yeshuas side of the table loath to take her eyes from him cait drank in each small gesture each smile and nod the lift of an eyebrow the knowing glance as like a good shepherd he gathered his flock about him for a last meal how is this possible she wondered how is it happening then fearful that her questioning might somehow destroy the vision she silenced her doubts and gave herself wholly to the moment one of the women of the group rose from her place and picked up a pitcher she passed along the table filling cups with wine and came to where yeshua was sitting she filled his cup also and as she made to move on he reached out and took her hand in his pulled her to him and kissed her lightly on the cheek no one else saw this small intimacy which passed between the two or if they did accepted it as a commonplace unworthy of comment but cait felt a warmth rise within her and felt her face grow flushedas if it had been herself the master had honoured in this way he is a man after all she thought the darkhaired woman smiled touched his cheek and moved on yeshua stood and raised his cup as if he would drink the health of his followers instead he tilted back his head and said father of lights i give you thanks that you always hear me let this cup be to your honour and glory then taking up a round flat loaf from one of the baskets he blessed it likewise and said i am the living bread which has come down from heaven anyone who eats of this bread shall have eternal life with that he ripped the loaf in half and held out the two halves to those on either side of him the bread which i give you is my flesh take it and divide it among you from now on when you gather to break bread remember how my body was broken for you and for the sins of the world at these words a hush descended like a heavy curtain over the room cait sensed a quickening in her spirit and felt a thrill of excitement ripple through the room some understood but others did not what is he saying someone whispered what is this asked another he thinks the bread is his flesh taking up the cup once more he held it out before him and said this is my blood which is shed for you my beloved friends henceforth let all who drink from this cup do so in memory of me until i return a dissenting voice called out from among those at the table it was shimeon lord and master this is a hard thing you are saying who can understand it tell us that you speak in jest i tell you the truth anyone who will not eat the flesh of the son of man nor drink his blood shall not see the kingdom of god but anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will have life everlasting for i will live in him and he will live in me so saying he passed the cup to the young man sitting at his right hand the man accepted it but did not raise it to his lips yeshua saw his reluctance do not be afraid yochanan it is for you drink at this the man drank from the cup and hurriedly passed it back i wish you would not talk so master he said you know the temple priests are like hounds baying for your blood yeshua his face alight with the glory to come placed his hand over the top of the cup behold i am making a new covenant in my blood rejoice again i say rejoice for the kingdom of heaven is at hand a few of his followers cheered but most remained silent as the veiled meaning of the masters words awakened a dark apprehension taking the cup yeshua began to move among the groups of people he served them all men and women alike from the same cup and then as he passed by the place where caitriona was standing he paused and turned there you are he said as if he had been searching for her why hide in the shadows when you could rejoice in the light caits breath caught in her throat she was discovered she gazed at him her heart pounding in her ears unable to speak o small of faith he chided gently the bridegroom himself summons you to his feast put aside your doubts and fears and enter into the celebration unable to bear his scrutiny she bent her head and looked away someone called out from the other side of the room but cait could not make out the words then she felt the masters touch as he put his hand beneath her chin and turned her face to his woman why do you hide please master i do not belong here cait said scarcely aware that she had spoken the words seemed to come of themselves i am not worthy of your regard daughter he said gently my own dear child do you not know that the day of salvation is near behold the lord has prepared a banquet he has consecrated those he has invited he offered her the cup when she hesitated he placed it in her grasp and covered her hand with his own saying this is my blood which is shed for you drink all of it cait raised the cup and drank the wine it was raw in her mouth but she drained all that remained yeshua smiled removing his dovegrey cloak he placed it on her shoulders blessed are you beloved for though you were barren yet would your children be more numerous than stars he raised his hand to her cheek smiled and kissed her on the forehead just then one of the men who had been sitting at the table rose and hurried out yeshua turned go your way yhudah he called as swift footsteps descended the stair do what you must but do it quickly cait heard a door bang shut in the room below and then footsteps outside in the street shimeon was on his feet yochanan yaakov come with me we will go and bring him back no stay said yeshua stay i will be with you only a little longer let us rejoice while it is light for the darkness is coming when no man can rejoice these words were spoken to a stunned silence yeshua returned to his place at the table amidst a low rumble of murmuring which grew to fill the room as questions gave way to anxious shouting and calling on the master to explain the meaning of his worrying remarks the sound filled her ears as a meaningless babble and cait looked down at the cup in her hand and clutched it to her breast this i will keep and treasure to the end of my life she thought she pulled the dovegrey cloak around her shoulders and gazed with bittersweet longing at the master now surrounded by his closest followers who were demanding to know what he meant she closed her eyes again and clung to her blessing children more numerous than stars chapter fortytwo cait slowly became aware that she was lying on the floor before the altar her cheek cradled on her arm the cavern sanctuary was silent save for the faint plip plip plip which sounded nearby she raised her head one of the altar candles had gone out the other was burning low and molten wax was splashed steadily on to the bare stone she rose and glanced around guiltily as if afraid she had been observed and would now be punished for her presumption the sanctuary was empty she was alone then she saw the cup and the memory of her vision struck her with a force that rocked her back on her heels she swayed on her feet and clutched the side of the altar to steady herself she had been there she had seen the saviour she cait had touched him and he had touched her she lifted her fingertips to her forehead where he had kissed herthe place now burned with a tingling sensation as though flames of fire danced there inside she was filled with a strange quivery airiness as if she had been scoured hollow poured out and the newly emptied void filled with effervescent light lord and master she whispered to herself i want to walk in the true path once more guide me with your holy light she stood before the altar gazing at the cup her search for the relic had ended she had found the mystic rose what is more having experienced something of the vessels sacred and mystic power she knew she stood in the presence of true holiness and was far from worthy her hardhearted unthinking pursuit of the mystic rose was corrupted by ambition and unholy revenge and she felt the weight of her sin clinging to her dragging her down like a filthy bedraggled garment all she wanted was to be free of it and clean once more forgive me lord she sighed and bent her head breathing out a prayer of humble confession and breathing in the masters forgiveness she picked up the holy relic and carefully and with all reverence replaced it in the hollow at the base of the cross closing the little door she took up the remaining candle and with a last look around hurried from the rockcut sanctuary through the connecting corridor and the outer passage quickly retracing her steps from the cave the courtyard was dark still although the cloudfilled sky was blushing pink in the east and all but the brightest stars had faded away flitting out from behind the refectory like a shadow she made her way to the guest lodge and slipped back into her room with a last look behind her she closed the door quietly and removing her boots crept back into bed pulling the bedclothes around her to take away the chill she lay in bed and shiveredhalf with the cold and half with the excitement still tingling through her she had drunk from the holy chalice and a mystical communion had taken place she had met with god this knowledge produced an almost frightening ferment in her soul it filled her to bursting with an elation that fizzed and burned and threatened to overflow at any moment in wild laughter or wilder song or dazzling miracles her heart raced the palms of her hands were hot and dry her fingers tingled squeezing her eyes shut she relived the vision of the upper room remembering the touch of the lord jesu as he placed the cup in her hands it was all she could do to keep from crying out with the ferocious exuberance of her joy in a little while the bell rang and presently she heard the sisters stirring in the yard outside there came a soft rapping at her door and sister besa entered my lady it is time for morning prayers she said if you would like to join us you would be most welcome thank you said cait of course i will join you i would like nothing better throwing back the bedclothes she quickly slipped her feet back into her boots and followed the nun out into the courtyard where they fell into place behind the other sisters making their way to the refectory during the winter morning prayers were held in the long ovenwarmed hall as cait entered she heard a shrill squeal and was instantly enfolded in a fierce embrace thea she gasped before the air was squeezed from her lungs oh cait alethea clasped her tightly as if she would obliterate the days of their separation through physical force the abbess told me you were here i wanted to see you right away she thrust cait at arms length you look well cait you do and you thea replied cait her eyes travelled to her sisters shaven pate suddenly mindful of her shorn locks thea released her sister and raised a hand to her head i am a nun now she said smiling selfconsciously she paused reflecting on the wonder of it and then raced on once more but cait there is so much to tell you there was a ceremony last night i wish you had been there it was wonderful i wish you could have seen it she did abbess annora was standing not two paces away regarding cait with a stern expression did you not truly asked alethea you saw the ceremony it is true cait admitted with genuine contrition i heard the bell and followed the sisters into the cavern i saw it all and you have drunk from the holy cup the abbess said stepping close cait gasped thea her dark eyes growing wide it is true cait admitted to the abbess she said i meant no disrespect indeed i did not know it was against the rule of the order i merely thought to the abbess cut short her explanation it is nothing so simple as a rule of the order there are far more serious implications i am sorry she said truly i am but how did you know do you think someone so long in the service of the chalice would not know in the instant i saw you the abbess frowned with sharp displeasure come with meboth of you sister besa you come too leaving one of the other nuns to lead prayers sister annora led them to her room at the end of the hall sat them down on the bed and closed the door sister besa uncertain about what had happened took her place before the door please began cait you have every right to be angry i do not blame you in the least i would not have interfered in the ceremonyonly i was that desperate to see alethea at long last i beg your forgiveness i meant no harm that is a matter of small consequence the abbess crossed her arms over her narrow chest and regarded cait with a hawklike stare tell me did you see anything when you drank from the cup i did abbess answered cait what did you see cait lowered her eyes the vision was so perfect so beautiful she did not want to spoil it by putting inferior words to it the truth now demanded the abbess what did you see tell her cait urged alethea abbess annora is very fair the punishment will not be harsh cait shook her head if i hesitate it is not for fear of punishment it is because i do not trust myself to speak of wonders beyond my understanding at these words the abbess softened tell me perhaps i can help you i had a vision cait began i have never known anything like it for it seemed as if everything was happening all around me and i was there where were you asked the abbess i was in the upper room with jesu and his disciples it was the night of the passover feast at this revelation the abbesss face blanched pale both thea and cait saw the blood drain from her features abbess said thea rising to offer her seat on the edge of the bed are you well sit you down abbess said besa moving to her superiors aid she took her elbow rest a little and i will fetch you some water annora waved her aside holding up a hand to forestall any more offers of aid she gazed at caitrfona for a long moment as she struggled to regain her composure slowly her expression of startled distress gave way to acceptance so she said softly it has happened at last cait and alethea stared at the abbess but said nothing a long moment passed annora drew a breath and motioned cait to stand daughter give me your hands cait stretched out her hands the abbess took them and turned them over pushing up the sleeves to caits amazement there appeared deep red welts on both wrists she stared in disbelief at the bloodred marks holy jesu be praised gasped sister besa turning wide eyes to the abbess she made the sign of the cross and folded her hands beneath her chin and began to pray bending down the abbess lifted caits gown away from her feet remove your shoes she said cait did as she was told withdrawing first one foot and then the other each instep was marked by welts similar to those on her wrists rising the abbess said now your mantle cait hesitated there will be another mark on your side annora told her in imitation of the spear wound christ suffered on the cross i must see it to be certain please untying the laces at her neck cait removed her cloak and loosened the top of her mantle she pulled her arms from the sleeves and pushed the mantle down over her breasts to her waist she glanced down her torso hardly daring to look there below her ribs on the right side was another ugly bloodred welt larger than the others shaped like a ragged gash it did appear as if she had been stabbed and the blade had left a thin oblong slash in her flesh she touched it gingerly but though the skin was raised she felt no discomfort only the slightest tenderness there is no mistake concluded the abbess oh cait whispered alethea what have you done nothing a quiver of astonishment touched her voice does it hurt not in the least answered cait in a daze of wonder i feel nothing she pulled her mantle up over her shoulders once more what has happened to me she asked retying the laces they are the stigmata of christ the abbess told her see here she held out her arm and drew the long sleeve of her robe away from her wrists the blotches were faded to a pale pink hue and looked like scars from old wounds behold she said the mark of the rose it was true the marks did look something like miniature rosesespecially compared to caits which looked like fresh lacerations cait shook her head in disbelief what does it mean the elderly abbess traced the marks lightly with a thin fingertip it means dear child she replied lifting a hand to caits face that you are to be the next guardian of the chalice chapter fortythree chosen the abbess was saying her voice seemed to come from very far away and cait was having difficulty making herself understand the words you have been chosen caitriona she paused regarding the young woman before her with sympathy and now you have a choice you must decide whether to answer the call volunteered sister besa do you understand asked the abbess cait stared at the livid marks of the stigmata on her wrists and shook her head no in this way the succession is ensured abbess annora explained whenever a new guardian is required someone is chosen the stigmata are the visible signs that the choice has been made however no one can force you to serve that is your decision and you must make it on your own she smiled the lord has called you caitriona and now you must decide how you will answer will you help me abbess annora of course my dear i will help you in any way i can oh cait this is wonderful said thea putting her arms around her sisters neck god has marked you for his own think of it cait smiled doubtfully already she could feel the unwieldy bulk of responsibility beginning to settle upon her from the other room came the sound of a benediction spoken aloud and then the scraping of benches on the stone floor as the sisters began to break fast do you want me to tell the sisters asked besa not yet replied the abbess i think it would be best for caitriona to have a little time to herself just now i will call a special chapter meeting tonight and we can tell the others then she turned towards the door now we will eat and then you can have the remainder of the day to pray and ponder how you will answer to thea she said i know you are anxious to be with your sister and there is much you have to tell one another but in the circumstances i wonder if that could wait a little while i think caitriona would like to be alone for a time and you have new duties to perform of course replied alethea somewhat reluctantly i understand thank you thea we will talk later she kissed cait on the cheek and went out besa followed closing the door behind her will you stay with me asked cait i have so many questions and i would rather not be alone with them just now if that is what you wish replied annora in the end however it is to god you must go for guidance i can only tell you the way it has been for me that said cait is what i want to hear come let us walk the day is bright and the cold will clear your head they passed through the busy refectory a few of the nuns raised their heads from their meals as they passed both besa and thea glanced up briefly and then looked away again lest either by expression or sign they should draw attention to her for that cait was grateful the abbess led cait out into the yard then along the path leading to the barns and outbuildings they walked in silence cait took deep breaths of the cold mountain air and found it helped banish the fevered thoughts from her mind at the first barn they stopped to put some fodder into the crib for the animals the barn was warm and heavy with the sharp smell of sheep and their oily wool the abbess left the door open to allow the fresh air inside several of the ewes were already roundbellied with lambs including one poor old ewe which appeared ready to burst we call that one sara the abbess told her she was barren once but no more every year she has triplets or twins she reached out and stroked the animals woolly head but this lambing will be her last sara is getting too old like me she looked at cait it is time for someone younger to take my place abbess annora began cait surely i cannot hush daughter i did not mean youat least not yet as i said the choice is yours i merely meant that i have been feeling my age of late i know the time is coming when i must lay my burden down and step aside i see cait nodded brow puckered in thought all in gods good time child the abbess regarded cait in the dim light of the barns open door but there is something else i think i have a confession cait said once you have heard it you may change your mind about me abbess annora laughed do you know how many confessions i have heard over the years i doubt you will have heard this cait replied frowning there was nothing for it but to name the black deed and face her judgement she drew a deep breath and blurted the cupthe mystic rose came here to steal it an expression of wonder rearranged the elderly abbesss features well you are right in all my years i never have heard that and now that i hear it i am not at all certain that i believe it oh i assure you it is true sadly i am no better than the worst thief who ever lived neither do i believe that still i suspect there is a tale here and i would hear it come you can tell me while we see to the pigs they walked to the next barn to refresh the water in the pigs trough and while they went about this homely duty the abbess scratched the old boar behind his large ragged ears and listened to caits long and rambling explanation of the events that had brought her to the abbey and to this decisive moment she told it allabout her fathers murder how she had gone to confront the murderer to hold him to justice but had been thwarted by the appearance of the white priest and had stolen the precious letter instead the letter she explained described a great treasure she went on to tell how upon discovering the prize to be won she had raised a company of knights and travelled to aragon with the intent of claiming the holy cup of christ for herself she told about the attack on the trail and how thea had been abducted by bandits how they had searched and searched for her and how they had at last been found by prince hasan alnizar and taken to his palace in the mountains the resulting skirmish with ali waqqar and how abus dying words had led them to the village by the lake she finished saying i prayed to be gods instrument of justice i thought to use the mystic rose to lure my fathers killer to his doom for that i needed the holy chalice and i came here to take it overwhelmed by the enormity of her crimes cait lowered her head awaiting the abbesss censure you must think me a most brazen and contemptible sinner the audacity of my deeds amazes even me aye agreed annora observing cait with a shrewd appraising eye in truth it does amaze me also but i do not know what amazes the more that you should hold yourself so low or that you should fail to see the swift sure hand at work in these dark deeds to bring about his glorious purpose cait made to object but the abbess asked did you know that the sacred chalice was here why no replied cait after a moment when brother matthias was killed all knowledge of the cup was lost and we gave up any hope of finding it also alethea and abu were missing so we abandoned the search in order to rescue them you did not know the holy cup was here until you drank from it and then its true nature was revealed to you yes replied cait that is the way of it why did you do that do you suppose cait recalled the ceremony in the cave i saw alethea and the other nun drink from the cup and it produced such rapture that it roused me to envy it is not envy to see the joy of the lord manifest and want it for yourself rather it is the voice of the good shepherd calling you to himself she allowed cait to think about that for a moment and then said let us walk some more cait followed the abbess out into the bright sunlight and crisp cold air once more across the field some nuns were taking firewood from the pile and carrying it to the abbey yard we drink but twice from the holy cup annora told her once when we begin our life in the abbey and once when deaths dark angel approaches to gather us to our rest that is the same for all of us but not everyone enjoys the same experience of the cup some see visions it is true but visions are very rare and even more rarely the same as each soul is different each encounter with the holy cup is different too neither alethea nor sister lora saw what you and i have seen and of course neither of them received the stigmata abbess annora stopped walking turned and took cait by the shoulders do you not see that you have been led here all that has happened is according to his purpose perhaps allowed cait doubtfully not perhaps not maybe it is as certain as sunrise taking caits hand in hers she laid her fingertips lightly on caits wrist and the livid marks now hidden beneath the cloth of her sleeve tell me you cannot see that even now cait gazed at annora desperately wanting to believe what the abbess said might be true daughter i said you were chosen she squeezed cait for emphasis from the beginning your feet have been directed on the path which has led you here all is as it must be cait murmured to herself at the abbesss questioning look she said it is something abbot emlyn used to say recalling that old scrap from her childhood comforted her a little she clutched at it and held on tight the abbess released her and stepped away it is a beautiful day but my old bones do not like the cold i will leave you to think on this a while we will talk again in the evening the elderly woman walked back along the path and cait watched her until she disappeared behind one of the buildings so wise she thought so patient and understanding could i be like that she wondered perhaps as an abbess one might given sufficient time grow into such goodness she turned her face to the clear bright sunwashed sky the blue was a pale and delicate birdegg blue and the snowcovered peaks of the mountains round about shone with an almost aching brilliance pulling her cloak more tightly around her neck and shoulders she wrapped her arms around her chest and walked on lost in thought she did not heed where she was going but simply walked until the path ended and the trail leading down into the valley began although she could not see the village she knew that the yuletide festivities were continuing apace and rognvald was waiting for her the thought of him down there waiting knowing nothing of the extraordinary changes she was facing produced a restlessness in her rognvald and the knights her stalwart protectors and faithful companionsshe had promised to lead them home homethe thought of caithness far away brought a confused welter of images before her eyes the churchyard where her mother was buried and where she had vowed to bury the heart of her father the lands and fields and the wide restless bay the slatecoloured sea beneath storm clouds the coppercoloured hills when the heather was red suddenly the idea of remaining for ever within the close confines of the abbey seemed abhorrent to her it was astonishing enough that alethea should choose this life for herself it was inconceivable raising her hand she held her wrist before her face and was again awed by the deep red mark emblazoned on her flesh there for all the world to see was the indisputable sign of her calling the vision still burned in her mind with all the heat and force of a bonfire there was no denying what she had seenany more than she could deny the visible signs it had left in her flesh but neither could she deny who she wasa proud sometimes arrogant often stubborn woman yes and vengefulused to thinking her own thoughts speaking her own mind and having her own way her tolerance for fools incompetents and miscreants could be measured in the speed with which she dismembered them with a cutting remark or slashing reply anyone who knew her at all knew the sharp edge of caits tongue was a cruel and ready weapon how then in the name of gods sweet son could she endure the endless cycle of confession and forgiveness of weakwilled selfish and unthinking offenders the notion of shepherding a flock of nattering women and officiating over the mundane concerns and petty grievances of an allfemale fellowship left her cold as the snowtopped mountain peaks towering aloof and frozen in the distance and yet she reasoned perhaps this was precisely what it meant to be chosen perhaps god was calling her to a life of sacrifice never to know the love of a man never to hold a child of her own in her arms never to see her dear ones again to surrender her considerable will and live in continual everlasting submission to the one great will and never allow herself to be herself ever again thus she had come to an impasse she stood gazing at the trail as it passed between the towering shoulders of the mountains and it was as if the steep and rocky descent signified her dilemma to answer the call was to go down into the valley of despair from which there was no return god in heaven she thought miserably it is a fate worse than death what should i do the soughing of the wind in the high rocks made a distant whispery sound as if their ancient voices would speak to her and they did speak for as she listened she heard the sound of stormroused waves on the rough shingle of the bay below banvard she heard the rustle of bracken on the low sunsplashed hills she heard the driven rain rippling through the dry stubble of the grain fields as a child she had roamed the green wilderness of caithness in the long years of her fathers absence she had come to love the land and the people who lived in it caithness was the place that stirred her heart even now and nothingnot even the stigmata of christcould ever change that to live and die in a land not her own and never to see the high wild skies of caithness againthe thought was almost crushing i cannot do it she concluded the abbess said i have a choice god help me i cannot do it cait was all too aware of her many failings but selfdeception was not one of them she knew herself she knew her mind and where some women might cheerfully resign themselves to serving the simple needs of their sisters and the people of the village cait knew she would quickly tire of the tedium the dull routine of the daily round the endless repetition the deadening sameness life in the abbey would begin to chafe sooner or later she would begin to resent the choice resentment would harden into loathing and loathing into hate she would end up hating the abbey and in time that hatred would come to poison and pervert the very thing she was honour bound to uphold and protect no it was impossible she knew it in her heart and soulnot that knowing would make the telling any easier she drew a deep breath and made up her mind to tell abbess annora at once better by far to end it now before things went any further cait turned and started back along the trail to the abbey intent on relating her decision she had taken but a few steps however when she heard someone calling from the valley trail behind her she stopped looking back and saw a small figure toiling up the last incline to reach the abbey path it was a young girl she had begun shouting as soon as she saw cait on the path cait quickly retraced her steps reaching the girl as she collapsed at the end of the trail to lie gasping in the snow that she was from the village there was no doubt cait thought she recognized the young girl as the eldest of dominicos daughters her lips fingertips and cheeks were blue from the cold in her haste she had come away without her cloak or had lost it along the way her hands were scraped raw and through the holes in her mantle cait could see that her knees and shins were bloody where she had fallen and skinned herself on the rocks cait rushed to the child and flung her cloak over the trembling body gathering her up as she tried to rise what is it what has happened the child gasping clutched at her and jabbered in her incomprehensible tongue cait could neither understand the girl nor make herself understood taking the childs hands in her own she rubbed them and blew on them to warm the thin freezing fingers come she said when the girl had calmed somewhat i will take you to the abbess she will know what to do cait helped her to her feet and together they moved off along the path upon reaching the second barn the nuns who had been carrying firewood heard caits call and came running to her aid at sight of the nuns the girl started babbling excitedly again i found her on the path cait told them can any of you make out what has happened one of the nuns knelt down in the snow in front of the child and took her hands another stepped close and put her arm around the slender little shoulders the first nun spoke quietly and as cait watched the sisters expression of concern deepened brother timo says to come quickly the nun explained a great many soldiers have arrived in the village they have put all the people in the church and the priest says the abbess is needed at once what do the soldiers look like said cait ask her the nun holding the girls hands asked and listened to the answer then raised her eyes to cait she says they are very big and ride horses what about their clothing demanded cait impatiently what are they wearing again the nun asked and received the answer they are wearing cloaks the child interrupted to add another detail to her description the cloaks are white she says and have a cross in red just here the nun touched the place over her heart and on the back the other sisters regarded one another in bewilderment who can it be they asked one another know them cait replied fighting down the fear spreading like a sickness through her gut the templars are here chapter fortyfour templars abbess annora repeated the word uncertainly is that what you called them but who are they they are priested knights cait answered realizing how little the grey marys knew of the events beyond the protecting mountain walls they belong to a special order called the poor soldiers of christ and the temple of solomon but they are known as the templars and they are dedicated to the protection of pilgrims and travellers in the holy land and the defence of jerusalem they are renowned warriors alethea added fighting priests mused the abbess shaking her head at the strangeness of it whatever can they want with me they have come for the sacred cup cait told her have they indeed it is true replied cait i am sorry this admission caused a sensation among the gathered nuns they all began talking and crying out at once silence commanded the abbess silenceall of you return to your duties those of you who have finished may go to the chapel and pray the sisters did as they were told leaving cait alethea and the abbess alone what else do you know about this asked abbess annora when the others had gone she regarded cait sternly and i think i had better hear it all this time you led them here declared alethea accusingly they followed you so it would appear admitted cait unhappily to the abbess she said i should have told you everything from the beginning but yes i knew about the templars their leader is a man called renaud de bracineaux he was the one who murdered my father in constantinople the letter replied the abbess adding this information to that which cait had already told her it belonged to him yes cait admitted it belonged to him she looked to the wise abbess with pleading in her eyes begging for her understanding i knew he wanted the holy cup and i thought if i could get to it first i could use it to bring de bracineaux to justice and you would not shrink from carrying out that justice yourself i suppose no confessed cait i would not i see the abbess nodded her mouth pressed into a thin firm line what are you thinking abbess asked alethea after a moment i think i must go and speak to these soldiers of christ and learn how the matter is to be resolved i will go with you said cait i may be able to help cait no objected alethea they will recognize you not if i go in habit she replied hurry then annora said alethea go to the chapel and wait there with the sisters and tell them to pray for gods will to be revealed to us caitriona you come with me we will find you a mantle and robe and then we will go down to the villageand she added pointedly you can tell me anything else i ought to know along the way two nuns arrived in the village a little before sunset the sky was livid staining the undersides of the clouds violet and muddy orange the two lone figures made their way through the deserted village to the church where a number of whitecloaked men were gathered around a fire they had made outside the door of the timber building the abbess and her companion marched directly to the knight standing guard at the door and said i am abbess annora i was told someone wanted to see me the templar regarded the two women without expression both were dressed in the grey robes of their order hooded against the cold i will tell the commander you are here said the soldier and disappeared inside reappearing a moment later please come in abbess grand commander de bracineaux will receive you now the abbess and her companion stepped through the door and into the dim interior of the church brother timotheus met them just inside the door abbess annora he said rushing up thank god you have come i have been telling these men that there is no need to hold everyone like this i am certain matters can be settled peaceably to the satisfaction of all concerned cait looked past the village priest and saw de bracineaux sitting in one of dominicos chairs before the altar his white hair was matted and damp clinging to his head like wet leaves his face was red from the cold and wind but his eyes were keen as blades beside the templar sat archbishop bertrano gislebert stood behind his commanders chair and the fairhaired man named danjou was pacing in the shadows behind the altar the villagers were sitting on the floor in family groupssilent watching waiting she searched among them for her own knights but rognvald and the others were not there she wondered where they might be hiding the priest seeing cait opened his mouth to greet her but the abbess cut him off saying i came as soon as i received your message tell me what is the urgency and why are all the people here are they being held captive they are here to help us keep things from becoming shall we say needlessly complicated also to pay their respects said de bracineaux rising slowly from his chair after all it is not every day an archbishop comes to call at this bertrano also rose god be good to you abbess he introduced himself to her and said i think you will find that we are both serving at the pleasure of the pope and his templars in this matter so it would appear answered the abbess but perhaps someone could be so kind as to explain what it is that requires my most urgent attention it is very simple began the archbishop some little time ago i received word that the holy cup of christ was preserved in this village naturally i was intrigued and inasmuch as the stability of the region has lately come under threat due to the continuing reclamation of christian lands from the moors i decided to seek advisement in th enough said de bracineaux sharply he stepped forward pushing past the archbishop thank you bertrano for airing your explanation but if we stay to hear you finish it we will be here all night he took his place before the two nuns arms folded over his broad chest just tell me this he said gazing sternly at the abbess do you have the cup yes answered annora the holy relic of which you speak resides at the convent the commanders smile was greedy and wide good his holiness the pope has determined that the cup is to be delivered into my hands for safekeeping that i will not do answered annora until i know the reason the holy cup has been in our possession since the blessed apostle himself came to iberia you cannot expect me to give it up without good reason de bracineauxs gaze grew fierce yet i say you wigive it up allow me to speak put in the archbishop interposing himself between them this is my doing for it was my letter which alerted the pope to the danger of losing the cup to the moors very well de bracineaux growled if it will help bring the matter to a close we have wasted too much time here already dear abbess said bertrano stepping close the region is in turmoil war and strife are rampant throughout all the land it is the wish of his holiness the patriarch of rome that the cup should be removed to a place where it can be guarded in all safety you and the sisters of your order have performed your duty admirably well indeed i have nothing but the highest praise for your faithfulness and care and i will see to it that the pope learns of your long obedience but you must see that the time has come to make better arrangements for the safekeeping of what is certainly christendoms single most valuable object it simply cannot reside here any longerthat much at least must be clear to you annoras face hardened it is clear to me that you have created a problem where none existed certainly now that the world knows about the holy chalice its continued safety is compromised her thin lips pressed themselves into a line of harsh disapproval just so conceded bertrano i am sorry his remorseful gaze drifted to the templar commander and he added you will never know the depth of my regret there said de bracineaux impatience pinching his tone you have heard the reason will you now give us the cup we may be secluded here in the mountains but we are not blind to the dangers you mention the abbess replied crisply it would seem the time has come to make better arrangements for the cups safekeeping then you will give us the cup said de bracineaux his tone rising to a demand if the archbishop assures me in the name of his holy and sacred office that all he has told me is true and that this has been ordained by his superiors in the faith annora regarded bertrano closely then yes i will deliver the sacred cup of christ to you abbess no objected cait dismayed by what she was hearing she reached out to take annoras arm as if to protest the decision de bracineaux saw the movement and his hand snaked out seizing her by the wrist i think he said the abbess has made a wise decision revolted by the touch cait jerked her hand free from his grasp as she did so the hood slipped back on her head and the side of her face came into view she quickly replaced it but de bracineaux continued to stare at her the archbishop also saw and opened his mouth to speak but the abbess took cait by the shoulder and turned her towards the door wait for me outside sister as cait moved away the abbess turned to face the archbishop well what is your answer good abbess said bertrano watching as cait departed i am archbishop of santiago de compostela and however much i might wish it was otherwise at this moment all i have said of this matter is true however loathsome it is to find myself in agreement with the commander nevertheless on my holy and sacred office i do assure you of my veracity but know that it is with a heavy and contrite heart that i do so satisfied demanded de bracineaux you shall have the cup annora repeated i will deliver it to you following our last holy communion you understand i must allow the sisters of my order a chance to say farewell to the sacred vessel the service will be held tonight at the convent and we will bring the holy chalice tomorrow morning splendid sighed the archbishop much relieved we will await this historic occasion with gods own patience better still countered de bracineaux we will come and retrieve the relic and save you the trouble of bringing it to us thank you but that will not be necessary the abbess declined instead i will insist that you respect the hallowed tradition of our order which does not allow men to set foot within the boundaries of the convent cait glanced back as she opened the door to step outside she heard archbishop bertrano say let it be as you say until tomorrow then and then she was through the door and away they were silent on the way back to the abbey the short winter day ended and picking their way along the trail in the deepening twilight was difficult work so it was not until the moon rose and the stars came out that the way grew easier upon reaching the upper path the abbess turned and waited for cait to join her you do not agree with my decision i did not say that cait replied no allowed annora but your silence is most eloquent you think i am wrong to give it to them i do yes do you also see that i have no choice in the matter when cait did not respond the abbess stopped walking listen to me caitriona it is ordained oh yes i do believe so despite whatever you may think of the instruments god has chosen to perform this work the fact remains archbishop bertrano wrote a letter to the pope who has entrusted the templars to carry out his wishes she softened placing a hand on the younger womans shoulder they would have come for the cup in any event cait made to protest but the abbess raised a hand in admonition the pope is my superior before god i must obey regardless of the consequences cait asked bitterly i thought god had chosen me to be the next guardian of the cup she thrust her hands out to show the red welts on her wrists i was chosen that is what you said caitriona the ways of god are beyond reckoning even so i know he is at work in this we come to him with the shattered remains of our best intentions and he gathers all the broken pieces reforms and reshapes them and makes them new according to his purposes he is able to achieve his will in the world never doubt it there was nothing more to be said so they continued in silence the abbess knew the last stretch of the path along the fields and moved quickly cait followed her spirit in turmoil true she had already decided that she could not become the next guardian of the chalice yet she was far from prepared to see de bracineaux get his profaning hands on the sacred object she did not see how she could prevent that now the abbess had spoken and that was that although night was hurrying on and they were cold hungry and exhausted from their long climb upon their return to the abbey the abbess bade cait to sound the bell to gather the sisters when they were all assembled in the refectory annora announced tonight a strange and portentous thing has happened the archbishop of santiago de compostela has arrived in the village with a charge from his holiness the pope to take possession of our blessed cup a fretful murmur coursed through the assembled nuns as abbess of this order i am sworn to obey and have pledged my assent to the popes wishes some of the sisters took this hard they raised their voices and stretched out their hands pleading to know if there was not some other way the abbess turned a deaf ear to their cries peace dear sisters annora continued cease your pleading and have faith all shall be well i have requested a last communion with the cup and it has been granted each sister will partake of the cup this night now i want all of you to go and wash and put on your best habits let us pay a reverent and joyful farewell to the holy cup we have protected so long the sisters did as they were told and were soon gathering in the yard outside the refectory each with a candle to light the way to the chapel the gently flickering gleam on the snow mirrored the heavens as the nuns stood waiting one of the sisters began to sing and all quickly joined in their voices ringing in the crisp cold air they sounded like a heavenly choir cait thought as the angelic sound swirled up and up into the moonbright sky when all were assembled the abbess led them to the chapel cut into the rock of the mountain they processed along the deepshadowed passages the song echoing down unseen corridors and walls round about until they entered the cavernous sanctuary where they silently formed a wide circle around the altar after lighting the altar candles the abbess turned to the nuns and said beloved sisters in christ for generations beyond counting our order has remained faithful to its calling tonight our long vigil of obedience is at an end tomorrow we will deliver our lords sacred chalice to the agents of the pope and a new day of gods grace will dawn these words brought tears to the eyes of many of the older nuns and a gentle sniffling could be heard around the candlelit ring though the cup shall no longer form the centre point of our life here in the abbey nevertheless life will go on what our duty shall be we cannot yet tell but i know that whatever is given us we will strive to serve god with the same humility and faith that have distinguished our order from its beginning to this day my dear sisters your tears show that you have borne your duty with loving hearts and this is right and good but do not give in to sorrow rather let your hearts be glad for surely this is the longawaited sign that the day of the lord is upon us our redemption is drawing near here the old abbess turned to face the altar she knelt briefly and then approached the great golden cross which occupied the altar top placing her hands on either side of the cross she gently pressed the hidden catch and the door opened in the base making the sign of the crossonce twice three times while saying a simple prayer for purityshe then withdrew the holy relic from its hiding place in the base of the cross turning to the sisters she raised the chalice high and said this will be the last time we partake of the blessed cup together let us do so with the love of our lord in our hearts and the prayer on our lips that gods mighty purpose shall achieve its fulfilment in our sight taking the cup she bowed her head over it and stood for a long time in silent prayer then eyes closed she raised her face towards heaven and said father of lights in whom there is no darkness at all nor shadow of turning we the humblest of your many servants greet you with gladness and glory in the greatness of your holy name even as we remember the countless blessings you have showered upon us throughout these many years tonight according to your will which has been revealed to us through your emissary on earth we lay down our duty of care and relinquish the charge we have long maintained know that we have only ever sought the pleasure of your service o lord and we ask you to look kindly on the work of your servants for the sake of your son our saviour then beginning with the oldest member of the order abbess annora took the cup to the sisters and gave them to drink lingering before each one speaking softly offering words of comfort and hope cait standing next to alethea watched as the holy vessel made its slow way around the circle and wondered if she along with her sister would be included in the sacred rite as the cup came nearer she heard alethea praying to herself and so bent her head as well but what to say her thoughts and feelings were in such a ferment of confusion she did not know how to pray to honour the abbess she must go against her call by the white priest yet to obey the white priest she must betray the abbess in the end she fell back on her first and most heartfelt desire lord of hosts and ruler of destinies she prayed a great injustice has taken place the blood of my father your servant cries out to be avenged you whose judgement against the wicked is everlasting make me the instrument of your vengeance lord hear my prayer voices sounded in the passageway there was a shout she looked up and saw men with torches swarming into the sanctuary in the wildly flickering light she caught a glimpse of a red cross on a white cloak and knew the templars had come to take their prize chapter fortyfive the rockcut sanctuary was suddenly filled with templar knights swords drawn they rushed for the altar the circle of nuns collapsed into a tightly huddled knot around the abbess and the holy cup within moments they were surrounded by the whitecloaked knights some of the frightened sisters cried out in terror others fell to their knees hands clasped in desperate prayer as the naked blades encircled them from the centre of the closecrowded mass cait observed the nearest knights faces tight in the lurid light they stared with oddly hesitant severity at the quaking nuns young men for the most part they were not yet jaded by the constant warring of their order and unused to attacking womenmuch less nuns they glanced guiltily at one another growing more uncertain of their duty with every passing moment someone called a calming order from across the sanctuary cait looked out and saw sergeant gislebert approach a torchbearer on either side as he drew near the abbess pressed the holy cup into caits hands saying i will speak to him taking the chalice she felt a mild burning sensation in the marks of her stigmata as if the sympathetic wounds in her hands and feet and side were aroused by the nearness of the holy vessel the abbess turned and pushed through the protective cluster of distraught sisters to address the sergeant what is this she demanded angrily before he could reply she said you invade sanctified ground like brigands and violate the custom of our order to interrupt a sacred and holy sacrament by force of arms she stepped before him pushing the point of his sword aside with a bare hand by what authority do you perpetrate this sacrilege abbess annora stood defiant before him holding her frail body erect her whole being ablaze with holy anger the sergeant was taken aback by the force of her outrage he looked around as if seeking the aid of his absent superior i demand an answer said the abbess her voice sharp as a slap some of the templars shifted uneasily in their places by the authority of the master of jerusalem replied gislebert unhappily and under his command we have come for the sacred cup i agreed with your commander that we would bring it in the morning said the abbess we are not finished with our observance he wants it now muttered the sergeant dully where is it the blessed cup is in my keeping until i place it in the hands of the archbishop annora said and i say when that will be until then you shall not touch it gislebert out of his depth with this spirited woman seemed at a loss to know how to proceed in this confrontation he looked across at the trembling nuns and came to a decision at last you can take up the matter with the master turning away he called a command to his knights bring them he shouted bring them all the entire order with the abbess at its head was driven out into the frigid night and made to toil down the steep mountain pathways by the fitful light of the templar torches the knights embarrassed to be riding while the nuns were made to walk offered their mounts to the oldest captives and the rest dismounted at intervals and took up places along the way in the more perilous steeps where due to ice or loose rock the path had become unsound thus they lit the way for the order as silent but full of reproachful glances the grey marys made their slow way down to the village night was far gone when they reached the valley sergeant gislebert marched his straggling charges through the silent village to the church by the light of lowburning candles on the altar cait could see that the people were still theremost of them asleep in heaps on the floor grand commander de bracineaux dozed in his chair and archbishop bertrano was stretched out on the low platform beneath the altar baron danjou came awake as the door opened he stood and nudged the templar commander saying wake up de bracineaux the sergeant has returned with your lady friend at last said the commander sitting up as the nuns entered limping and staggering from their enforced ordeal in the dead of night he took one look at the line of exhausted women and cried what have you done gislebert i send you for the relic and you bring the entire convent just so mused danjou a perverse smile playing on his lips this affair ripens most deliciously the entrance of the sisters wakened the sleeping archbishop and townsfolk they roused themselves and stood some of the villagers seeing the distress of the sisters all of whom they knew and loved ran to their aid they sat the women down wrapped them in cloaks and mantles and chafed their hands to warm them cait and alethea found places at the back of the assembly near the door where are they cait wondered quickly surveying the dim interior for any sign of her knights what has happened to them despite her fatigue the abbess strode to where de bracineaux sat and said we agreed that i would deliver the cup tomorrow in my own good time why have you violated our agreement the archbishop alarmed by this unexpected development rushed to intercede what has happened dear sister abbess come sit you down to de bracineaux he said what is this commander what have you done to these poor women he ordered his soldiers to storm the convent the abbess declared loudly and bear the blessed cup away by force is this true demanded the archbishop aghast at the accusation be quiet snapped de bracineaux irritably undeterred the abbess said you would take by force that which was to be freely given what manner of man are you commander de bfacineaux an impatient man he glared at the abbess i might have granted you the condition we agreed upon if you had not dealt falsely with me preposterous said the abbess oh sneered the commander do you deny that you shelter a known enemy beneath the cloak of your order he thrust an accusing finger at cait that onebring her here as a nearby templar worked his way towards them cait removed the cup from inside her robe where she had carried it lest she stumble and drop it while on the trail keep this out of sight she whispered passing the sacred vessel to alethea she stepped out from among the sisters at the rear of the church and took her place beside the abbess so you thought i would not recognize you a second time de bracineaux said most unwise lady most unwise levelling his malignant gaze at cait he said see here archbishop this is the woman who stole your letter you know her i think i have seen her before yes the archbishop confessed to cait he said lady is it true did you steal the letter why ask her demanded de bracineaux angrily you know the truth of ithow else could she have cozened you with lies about my death let her speak said bertrano i would hear it from her own lips turning once more to caitriona he said is it true lady did you steal the letter from commander de bracineaux i did answered cait simply and i would do it again why what difference does it make charged de bracineaux rounding on her again she has admitted the theft and stands condemned out of her own mouth she must be punished for her crimeand all who aided her in this deception shall be punished as well he glared around the church as if he meant to begin seizing villagers then and there brother timotheus pushed his way forward heaven forbid he cried we know nothing of any crime this lady has shown us only kindness and respect she is a true noblewoman in every way no doubt she can appear so when it suits her said de bracineaux smugly the archbishop and i know otherwise archbishop bertrano turned sorrowful eyes on cait and asked again why did you take the letter was it to steal the holy cup for yourself i did take the letter she replied i went to the commanders room that night to avenge the murder of my father lord duncan of caithness renaud de bracineaux killed him in constantinople she said evenly pointing to the commander i wanted to find a way to hurt him and i allowed myself to imagine the blessed cup would help me to do that she paused and looked to abbess annora i was wrong yes of course said de bracineaux as the last details of the explanation fell into place you were with him in the church that day his face twisted in a paroxysm of hate and gloating triumph so duncan had a daughter i imagined he was alone otherwise i would have finished you too the archbishop turned astonished eyes on the grand commander of jerusalem is this true you murdered her father i settled an old debt yes replied de bracineaux carelessly as defender of jerusalem it is my right to vanquish the enemies of the holy land wherever i encounter them very messy my friend said danjou shaking his head slowly he regarded cait with an expression of delight that made her skin crawl it seems youve made an extremely resourceful enemy you want to be more careful archbishop bertrano said the abbess i refuse to deliver the sacred chalice of our saviour into the hands of a selfconfessed murderer if we are to surrender the holy relic i demand that it be given to pope adrian himself and no one else from your hands to his abbess answered bertrano in view of all that has come to light i agree that would be best no roared de bracineaux that we will not do it has been entrusted to me and i will fulfil my duty he stepped nearer so that he towered over the abbess i want the cup now give it over i will not de bracineauxs hand whipped out and caught the old woman on the cheek the force of the blow snapped her head sideways and she staggered backwards cait caught her as she fell and bore her up i will not ask you again old woman de bracineaux stood over the halfkneeling abbess bring me the cup brother timotheus rushed to interpose himself between the templar and the abbess he raised his hands before the commanders face crying peace peace fool get out of my way de bracineaux shoved the priest violently aside the cleric fell striking his head on the stoneflagged floor he groaned and lay still all at once the villagers rose up with a shout they had watched the conversations in bewildered silence but an attack on their beloved priest was something they understood they rushed forward in a mass swarming over the commander lashing at him with fists and feet sergeant roared de bracineaux as he fell danjou and gislebert swords in hand leaped to defend the fallen commander two of the templars near the door sprang forth wading into the clot of people cait still holding the abbess moved back through the surging crowd pulling the elderly woman back from the fray it was over in a moment when the shouting and chaos subsided three lay unconscious and four more were wounded gislebert danjou and the two templars stood over the commander with bloody swords defying anyone else to come near de bracineaux climbed to his feet he was bleeding from a split lip and sputtering with rage get these people out of here he shouted swinging his arm wildly in the direction of the cowering congregation this outrage will be avenged get them out the templars started forwards but before they could lay hands on any of the offending villagers the church door burst open master shouted the templar soldier who entered you are needed at once from outside someone shouted moors de bracineaux whirled towards the open door what hurry my lord we are attacked chapter fortysix commander de bracineaux glared at the messenger how many thirty my lord maybe more the templar commander turned and called danjou keep everyone in here then shouting for the sergeant to fetch his sword and shield he strode from the church and out into a raw red dawn as soon as he had gone the townsfolk rushed to the bodies of their wounded archbishop bertrano moved to the stricken priest and the nuns hastened to the aid of their injured abbess annora waved them off saying i am not hurt go and help the others stay where you are all of you shouted danjou but no one paid any attention to him within moments the door of the church was open and villagers were crowding the entrance cait motioned alethea to join her wait here with the abbess where are you going she asked but cait was already dashing away she pushed through the press at the door and looked out high clouds were coming in from the north drawing a veil across the pale dawn sky the templars were racing to their mounts as de bracineaux called them to arms above the shouting and clamour of men and horses could be heard the rhythmic drumming of hooves and through a gap between the nearer houses came the attacking riders as they rounded the lake and rode for the village a moment later the first rank came into view at the end of the wide expanse which served the town for a street even in the pale light of dawn cait could see from the turbans and battledress that the riders were indeed moorsand they were coming fast ah waqqar she gasped the bandits had found them and now joined the fray hands clenched in helpless desperation she watched as they drew swiftly closer now she could pick out individuals from among the dark mass of advancing riders there in the centre of the front rank was the bandit leader she recognized the imposing arrogant bulk and her heart sank but then a movement in the ranks caught her eye the riders parted and prince hasan appeared in the gap astride his black stallion his warriors at his back beside him rode halhuli like those with them they carried small round black shields and long slenderbladed lances the templars were quickly armed and mounted the speed with which they had prepared themselves to meet the enemy was remarkable and cait thought demonstrated their renowned and formidable discipline they had met arabs before and were not afraid with a single word from their commander they formed the battle line and rode out to meet the attack cait watching from the church door heard a movement behind her and someone grabbed hold of her arm to pull her back please she said i have to see de bracineaux misjudged you said baron danjou but i will not we cannot have you running loose out there can we that would not do at all who knows the trouble you might make contempt and revulsion roiled within her as she looked into the barons dead eyes i beg you she said swallowing down her loathing let me stay very well if only because i want to see it too we will stay here together you and i danjou moved close beside her maintaining his tight grip on her arm others were pushing in around them now villagers eager to witness the clash and nuns praying for deliverance the crowd gave a push and cait and danjou were carried out into the yard soon almost everyone from inside the church had joined them including archbishop bertrano and a very dazed and bewildered brother timotheus pressing a hand to his injured head the templars urged their horses to speed levelling their lances they prepared to meet the onrushing moors up from their throats arose a cry for god and jerusalem the battle cry ofthe templars was met and drowned by a mighty shout from the arabs allahu akbarf they cried spurring their mounts to a gallop over the snow they came the horses legs lost in a blurring cloud churned up by their swift hooves so that the riders seemed to glide like avenging angels flying to the fight now we see whether the moors have mettle enough to stand to a real fight observed danjou the templars are outnumbered cait pointed out dear deluded lady replied the baron the templars are forever outnumbered that is how they prefer it the two lines closed with heartstopping speed and cait unable to look away held her breath at the last instant the moors split their line dividing neatly in two the main body of the templars found themselves carried into the midst of a fastscattering enemy and suddenly exposed on either flank this brought a cry from the watchers at the church some of the nuns sank to their knees clasping their hands and crying to heaven others stood and gaped in openmouthed amazement all around her cait heard the quick babble of voices as the villagers discussed the manoeuvre excitedly and the nuns prayed with increasing fervour de bracineaux a bold and decisive commander realized the danger and signalled the retreat at once rather than allow his force to become surrounded he chose flight in an instant the templars wheeled their horses back they came the moors in close pursuit halfway to the church however there came a rattling movement and out from among the houses of the villages another mounted force appeared at its head was rognvald leading a score of arab warriors with dag and yngvar beside him and svein and rodrigo right behind the sudden and unexpected appearance of the knights sent the villagers into a rapture of delight danjou tried to shout them down but to no avail there was nothing he could do to make himself understood he appealed to the priest tell them to be quiet he shouted at brother timotheus shut them up if they do not speak replied the priest neatly surely the stones themselves will cry out rognvalds troops rounded on the retreating templars who now discovered themselves caught between two swiftly closing forces surrounded their retreat cut off the templars halted and de bracineaux formed his soldiers into a tight defensive circle shoulder to shoulder they took shelter behind a ring of stout shields and a lethal array of razorkeen lance blades the moors whirled around the circle shrieking with exultation not a blow had been struck and already the foe was forced into its final stand from which there would be no retreat around and around they flew the swift arabian horses spinning like black leaves in a whirlpool of white the templars remained unmoved as a boulder surrounded by surging rapids the battle began in earnest at first the great revolving wheel of warriors appeared content simply to surround the templars screaming whistling jeering and taunting as they spun around and around then suddenly one of the moors broke from the swiftly circling pack and drove in to strike a glancing blow at one of the templarsa quick darting chop of the sword and away again before the knight could react no sooner had he returned to his place than another moor repeated the slashing lunge and then another and another soon the moors were striking at willbut to no avail since the templars refused to break ranks and attack despite their superior numbers the moors gained no advantage the diving feints continued for a time and danjou thoroughly fed up with the lack of moorish courage in meeting the templar challenge headon vented his frustration cowardly bastards he sneered with profound distaste they refuse to stand and fight the craven dogs the moors circled the great wheel slowly revolving while those on the inner rim performed their wary darting sallies cait felt her heart buoyed by hope begin to sink the templars would not be drawn into a fight they could not win and hasans troops appeared unable or unwilling to force the confrontation she watched hands clenched beneath her chin as her own frustration grew a few more lunges a few more wild sweeping chops and suddenly a cry went up from the moorish ranks in the same instant cait saw the head of a templar lance spinning into the snow a moment later another lance head was carried off danjou saw it too and knew what it meant filthy devils he spat stand and fight he cried three more templars lost their lances in rapid succession the knights did not move they sat firmly in the saddle as if anchored there faces hard staring grimly ahead at the whooping gyrating foe now and again cait caught sight of rognvald yngvar dag or svein or one of the spanish knights as they careered around and around in the everrevolving dance the slashing attacks continued with increasing ferocity and speed the villagers gathered outside the church watched with dread fascination as one by one the lance blades fell to the reckless moorish swords still the templars held their ground indeed the first indication they gave that the attack was wearing on them came when one of their number threw down his headless battered lance and drew his sword de bracineaux steadied his men with a command the ring tightened further on itself and they held on it was not until fully half of the lanceheads had been hacked off that the templars broke from their rocklike stance when it came the charge was quick and savage cait did not discern any signal it seemed to her that one moment they were inert and resolute as when the battle began and the next instant all were in motion down went the ruined lances and out flashed the swords even as they spurred their mounts into the rotating wall of foemen they hit hard and fasttwenty templars striking as one the sound of the clash was like the crack of a gigantic tree the instant before it falls the force of the charge carried the templars deep into the revolving ranks of the moors those nearest the charge could not swerve out of the way in time and were simply struck broadside men and horses went down more than one arab was crushed beneath the weight of his mount the rearward ranks gave way to allow their comrades to escape the onslaught and all at once the moors were thrown into confusion suddenly all was rearing horses and flailing hooves the ferocity of the assault was devastating again and again the templars charged driving into their evasive enemy their swords rising and falling in deadly harmony surprised their formation broken the moors gave way before the assault the swirling arab ranks thinned at the point of attack and the templars seized the first opportunity they had been offered they drove into the weakened line and a small gap opened for the briefest of instants the way was clear by twos and threes the christian knights sped through the breach smashing through the terrible whirling wheel by the time the gap closed once more a dozen moors lay dead in the snow and not one of the templars was unhorsed cait counted the fallen from hasans force and then counted them again just to make certain but there was no mistake the princes advantage in numbers had shrunk the moors made an attempt to regain control of the field separating quickly into two divisionsone under rognvald and the other under hasan they threw out two wings one to either side of the templars as the christian knights reformed their ranks but de bracineaux was not about to allow his troops to become surrounded and trapped again as the two wings closed on the templars the commander directed the whole of his force to meet the line of assault at its nearest leading edge once again the templars heavier horses and armour proved sufficient not only to blunt the attack but to drive through the more lightly armed moors the arab wing scattered leaving four more dead or wounded behind and the christian knights quickly turned to face an onslaught of the combined enemy wings again cait counted the remaining combatantshasans troops including rognvald and her knights numbered thirty to the templars original twenty what was more the templars now had the houses of the village at their backs unless they were drawn into the open they could not be surrounded again now the field is even remarked danjou with evident satisfaction let the slaughter commence cait bit her lip and did not dignify the comment with a reply the archbishop meanwhile gathered the nuns around him and led the sisters in a prayer for a swift end to the battle and the peaceful resolution thus the two opposing forces faced one another across a narrow spacefewer than a hundred paces separating one from the other and here they paused the horses were growing tired steam rose from their nostrils and from their rumps and flanks for a brief moment all was silent save for the murmured prayers of the sisters and archbishop kneeling in the snow then there came a movement from the moorish line and cait saw rognvald ride out a few paces into the open alone renaud de bracineaux he called his voice loud in the hush for the sake of your men i ask you to surrender this brought a laugh from the templar commander who moved out a few paces to meet the norseman halfway surrender he laughed to you your confidence is commendable sir but it is misplaced we are winning this battle you have fought well rognvald acknowledged it would be a wicked waste to lead such good soldiers to their deaths lay down your arms and the killing can stop de bracineaux laughed again the killing has not yet begun he turned then and rode back to his waiting ranks i give you one last chance rognvald called after him by the god who made me templar unless you forsake the fight i swear you will not walk from this battleground the commanders reply came by way of a sudden charge even before de bracineaux reached the line his men were in motion spurring their horses forward rognvald raised himself in the saddle and with a sharp chop of his hand signalled hasans troops to meet the sortie the moors swept across the narrow space dividing the two forces it was only as the combatants closed on one another that cait realized that something had changed within the moorish ranks they now carried lances while rognvald was exchanging words with the templar commander the moors had replaced their swords with stout longshafted spears which they now levelled upon the onrushing templar knights the two forces collided with a crash like thunder the clash shook snow from the nearby rooftops and shuddered the frozen ground seven templars were unhorsed and two of those did not rise they lay in the snow with broken lanceshafts protruding from pierced ribs the force of the charge carried each side through and beyond the line of the other as soon as they broke free both sides turned and readied themselves for another foray again came the command again they spurred their mounts to speed again the clash shivered the frigid air cait looked away at the last moment and when she looked back four more templars lay in the snow only nine were left to stand against hasans thirty de bracineaux knew he could not risk another attack so this time as soon as they passed the templars reined up wheeled their horses and flew at the backs of the retreating moors they succeeded in cutting down three of hasans troops but the rest quickly surrounded the nine templars lances were no use in close fighting so they were abandoned in favour of the sword this was the fight de bracineaux wanted and once again the heavier armour and skill of his men began to tell against the more lightly protected moors one after another the moors fell to the templar bladesthree fell at once followed by three more and then two more in quick succession cait watched with growing apprehension as the templars slowly cut their way through the moorish ranks de bracineaux will have their hearts for supper said danjou almost glowing with exaltation at the splendid spectacle of carnage perhaps i should start the cooking fire now cait tried to pull away from him but he tightened his grip and held her to her place you wanted to watch my lady he gloated you will watch there came a movement from within the moorish ranks and cait saw her knights moving through the press to join battle with the templars who had been forced once more into a tight defensive circle rognvald with yngvar at his left hand pushed in on one side of the ring and dag svein and rodrigo forced their way in from the other the norsemen larger than their moorish comrades and used to fighting with heavy weaponsshouldered the brunt of the offensive driving in with relentless ferocity rognvald his arm rising and falling in deadly rhythm rained devastating blows on the templars before him shields helmets and swords were battered and broken before the norsemens onslaught the sound of their terrible hammering blows resounded across the battleground crack now a shield was riven crack now a helm split asunder crack a blade shattered disarmed the unlucky templar left the saddle diving for the ground rather than face rognvalds killing stroke whirling with dread purpose the norse lord singled out another foe slowly the balance of battle swayed once more yngvar and svein each succeeded in unhorsing an opponent leaving only six templars in action seeing they were at last beginning to overcome the stubbornly valiant templars hasans troops redoubled their efforts a great shout of triumph arose from the moors as they swarmed in for the final assault cait was watching prince hasan as he forced his way to rognvalds side and did not see the deadly struggle taking place at the far side of the dwindling band of templars but just as another templar knight fell before the norsemens blades a lone rider broke free from the mass and galloped towards them with yngvar and svein in pursuit the fleeing templar reached the church reining up a few paces from where cait and danjou were standing he was out of the saddle before his horse had come to a halt throwing off his battered helm he lurched towards them it was de bracineaux you he said reaching for cait you are coming with me chapter fortyseven bleeding from a deep cut to his forehead his face ashen with fatigue de bracineaux snatched cait from danjous grasp cait screamed and clawed at him but he grabbed her arm with his free hand and still clutching his sword threw his arm around her waist he lifted her off her feet and dragged her out from among the crowd gathered in front of the church here cried the archbishop rising from his prayers in the snow let her go this is not the way de bracineaux stay back priest said danjou shoving him down once more this is none of your concern in gods name bertrano cried i beg you let her go end the bloodshed struggling to his feet he started after the templar commander de bracineaux he called stop keep him away shouted the templar over his shoulder baron danjou moved to head off the interfering cleric i told you to stay back priest he grabbed the archbishop by the arm and pulled him around bother god with your prayers and leave the rest to us release me sir bertrano shrugged off danjous hold you will not presume to tell me what to do he turned and started after the commander and his captive once more calling for caitrionas release and an end to the fighting the baron grabbed bertranos arm and tried to pull him back but the big man shook off his assailant and bulled ahead he reached de bracineaux and put his hands on the templar put down your sword commander the archbishop called sue for peace i will speak to them he took hold of the templars sword hand and tried to break his grip let the woman go get back snarled de bracineaux elbowing the cleric aside danjou keep him away from me danjou seized the archbishop by the belt of his robe and pulled him back a few paces the churchman made a wild swing with his arm knocking the baron aside he turned and started once more for the templar danjou lunged after him stay back he growled bertrano shook him off and turned danjou darted after him appeared to make a grab but missed the archbishop took another step then stumbled and went down he writhed in the snow pressing a hand to his side several of the nuns hurried to his aid one of them screamed when she took hold of bertranos hand her own hand came away wet and red there was blood in the snow spilling from a gash in his side i warned you baron danjou said wiping the blade of his dagger with a handful of snow you should have listened kicking and scratching cait succeeded in squirming free but de bracineaux got his fingers in her hair and dragged her with him you have cost me dearly he wheezed his breath coming in ragged gasps now you are going to repay me in full cait lashed out at him with her fists swinging hard the blows muted by the mail and padding wrapping his hand securely in her hair he hauled her to her knees and pressed the ragged edge of his sword to her throat she felt the cold steel bite into the soft flesh of her neck and stopped struggling from the corner of her eye she saw two norse knights approaching that is close enough de bracineaux shouted as svein and yngvar came running up any closer and the lady will lose her head as if to demonstrate the veracity of this threat he tightened his grip in her hair and jerked her head up pressing the sharp blade harder against the base of her throat she felt something digging into her shoulder and realized it was the golden pommel of de bracineauxs dagger which was hanging from his belt if she could get her hands on it she might have a chance to defend herself let her go templar said yngvar we mean to treat you fairly do you think i would trust any of your promises replied the commander no i have a better idea throw down your weapons and she may yet live cait edged sideways slightly freeing the dagger from behind her shoulder de bracineaux punished her for the movement by jerking her head higher and pressing the blade harder still she heard a horse galloping swiftly nearer release her de bracineaux called the rider she heard the voice and took hope it was rognvald let her go and we will settle terms of peace i will give you my terms roared the commander this woman dies unless you give me the cup when no one moved to respond de bracineaux forced caits head down and started to draw the blade across her throat she felt the skin break and blood begin to ooze rognvald made to dismount but the templar commander shouted stay back he pulled caits head up and back stretching her throat to show the cut hed made bring me the cup he screamed now turning to those standing outside the door of the church rognvald called for the cup to be brought out you should think about your men rognvald told him there are nine templars still drawing breath their lives and yours are forfeit if you harm this woman the devil take them de bracineaux replied devil take you all he turned his head towards the church danjou where is that cup alethea appeared at the door of the church just then it is here she said bring it to me shouted de bracineaux bring it here to me holding the sacred vessel in both hands alethea stepped forward a way parted through the crowd as she moved walking slowly and with grave deliberation as if in a holy procession she held the cup high for all to see and the morning light glinted off the gilded rim creating a glowing halo of gold which hovered above her hands the commander saw the precious relic and his face twisted in an ugly gloating grin still he held his hostage firmly the swordblade hard against her throat cait could feel the warm blood trickling down her neck and soaking into her clothing she heard rognvald say something he was trying to dissuade the templar from carrying his scheme any further some of the nuns and villagers huddled outside the church began to weep and cry out in their anguish cait heard it all but the sounds meant nothing to her she could only watch with mounting dread as alethea drew stepbyslowdeliberatestep closer with the sacred chalice in her hands when alethea had come within three paces she stopped here girl de bracineaux snarled give it to me alethea looked steadily at him her features expressionless and slowly knelt in the snow here said de bracineaux angrily here to me she made no move to come nearer instead alethea stretched out her hands and raised the holy cup above her head as if in offering the templar commander shouted again for her to deliver the cup into his hands but alethea kneeling meekly in the snow remained unmoved holding the cup just out of his reach de bracineaux gave a grunt of impatience releasing his grip on caits hair but still holding the sword to her neck he reached out for the cup with his free hand leaning far forward he took a halfstep towards the cup arm extended fingers stretching he grasped the golden rim and plucked the holy chalice from between aletheas hands as he reached out the dagger at his belt swung free alethea rose with catlike quickness her long fingers closed on the weapon as she came up with a single smooth stroke she drew the knife from the sheath and drove the point of the blade up under de bracineauxs chin with a startled cry he dropped the cup and the sword cait fell forward on to her hands then collapsed face down in the snow de bracineaux seized aletheas wrist and tried to pull the dagger away wrapping her other hand around the templars alethea stepped nearer and with all her strength drove the knife blade to the hilt the two stood for a moment in a weird and deadly embrace and then with a muffled cry of rage and pain de bracineaux pulled his hand free he made a sweep with his arm and knocked the girl aside alethea fell back in the snow de bracineaux pulled the blade from his neck and turned on her he lurched forward slashing wildly with the dagger as blood coursed freely from the hole in his throat rognvald rushed in sword ready alethea lay where she had fallen gazing up at himneither trembling nor cowering in fear but with calm defiance commander de bracineaux took one step and then another blood cascaded from his wound staining his beard and soaking into his tunic he reached for her the knife gleaming red in the sun but as he made to strike de bracineauxs legs buckled beneath him he fell on his side blood spewing a bright crimson arc in the snow rognvald crouching behind his sword put himself between alethea and the templar de bracineaux hauled himself on to his knees regarding alethea dully as if trying to understand how a nun could have done such a contemptible thing to him he opened his mouth to speak but the words came out in a dark bloody bubbling which gushed over his teeth and chin and splashed down his white surcoat blotting out the red templar cross on his chest alethea rose to her feet pushed past rognvald and stood over de bracineaux gazing down with pitiless indifference at her stricken enemy unable to speak he lifted uncomprehending eyes to her impassive face his jaw worked forming a single word why because she said as the wounded templar slumped lower in the snow lord duncan had two daughters chapter fortyeight rognvald rushed to caits side and knelt beside her in the snow alethea took a quick step and kicked the dagger from de bracineauxs slack grasp she stooped and retrieved the blessed cup backing away as the templar made a last scrabbling grab for it my lady said rognvald you are hurt no replied cait as she tried to get up i the pain made her gasp rognvald eased her down once more rest a moment let me look at the wound dropping his sword he shook the glove from his hand and pressed his fingertips to the side of caits neck just below the jaw where blood was oozing in a thin crimson sheet down her throat it is a nasty cut he observed but not deep i think help me to my feet he was just gathering her into his arms to lift her when there came a sudden rush from behind rognvald glanced back to see baron danjou bearing down on thema savage leer on his face and a knife in his hand he ran with surprising quickness closing the distance in an instant rognvald spun around knowing even as he reached for his blade that he would be too late he placed himself between danjou and caitriona shielding her with his body yngvar darted in from the side flailing with his sword as danjou passed the blade slashed went wide danjou dodged the blow easily closing on them he prepared to strike cait saw the barons arm draw back and then halt its forward progress abruptly halted the baron spun around and into sveins fierce bonebending embrace danjou gave a little cry of surprise and cait saw his spine stiffen as the norsemans blade slid in beneath his ribs the baron roared in anger and pushed himself away slashing wildly with the knife rognvald snatched up his sword stepped in behind and with the action of a man putting a mad dog out of its misery made a quick chop at the base of the barons neck danjou staggered the dagger spinning from his hand as his knees gave way beneath him he looked up at cait with an expression of mild reproach damn it all he sighed then pitched forward on to the ground beside the dying templar then everything became confused for cait it seemed as if a dense cloud descended over her muffling sight and sound she felt rognvalds strong arms beneath her sensed movement and guessed that he carried her to the church alethea was there holding the holy chalice and several nuns flew around her fussing and clucking while they cleaned and bandaged the wound at her neck prince hasan was there too and some others including brother timotheus there were voices movement and then she felt fresh air on her face once more and saw the mountains gleaming in the sun dead bodies in the trampled bloody snow wounded men holding their seeping wounds nuns with white hands binding brown moorish limbs horses long winter coats lathered and wet heads down noses to the ground in exhaustion their flanks steaming in the cold sunlight and then it grew dark and when she awoke she was no longer in the church she had somehow been transported to dominicos house and there were people talking somewhere nearby but she could not see them she raised a hand to her injured throat and felt the cloth of her bandage she made to rise and the movement started a fierce pain throbbing in her neck she lay back down and waited for the pain to subside and listened to the voices in the next roomsombre subdued earnest after a time the throbbing eased to a raw ache she tried again to rise more carefully this time and succeeded in holding her head in a way that did not aggravate the wound again she was lightheaded and slightly wobbly on her feet but she steadied herself by the bed and then walked slowly to the next room rognvald was there together with prince hasan and brother timotheus while dominico and his family flitted around them preparing a meal yngvar and svein sat on a bench against the far wall their long legs stretched out in front of them dag and rodrigo sat on stools nearby jars in hand drinking in great thirsty draughts until the ale ran down their beards to a man all were so preoccupied that no one saw her standing in the doorway she took a step forward and elantra dominicos wife glanced up and ran to her side the others noticed the sudden movement and looked around to see cait walking gingerly aided by the diminutive woman my lady said rognvald he was on his feet and beside her in an instant come sit down he took her elbow and led her to the table as elantra scurried back to the hearth how do you feel well enough replied cait scarcely recognizing her own voice she sounded as if she had been swallowing chips of flint and it hurt to speak but aside from the ache in her throat and a brace of bruises on her arm she felt tolerably hale and whole it seems you shall not be rid of me just yet nor i hope for a very long time to come he said his voice low so that the others did not hear she glanced up and saw in his eyes a warmth of regard she had not seen before i am sorry ketmia said prince hasan rising from his place as they arrived at the table we came as soon as lord rognvald reached us with news of the templars arrival but if we had been here sooner cait did not let him finish it is who should thank you my lord taking his hands in hers she kissed him lightly on the cheek that is small thanks but it carries all my heart my debt to you is great and grows ever greater turning to rognvald she said i owe you more than i can say thank you good friend one day perhaps i will find a way to repay you she kissed him too and then sat down in the offered seat where is alethea she is helping the sisters who are caring for archbishop bertrano replied brother timotheus his tone grave he paused to swallow down his emotion they are doing all they can but his voice faltered and he left the rest unsaid it is not good ketmia hasan told her halhuli is with them whatever can be done for the priest will be done yet i fear there is little anyone can do but pray we were just discussing it when you joined us rognvald said his death will heaven forbid it timotheus put in we must not give up hope should the archbishop fail to recover rognvald said amending his words his death would place both hasan and the village in peril blame would inevitably fall upon the moors the prince explained there would be reprisals the spanish kings would insist cait nodded i see and then there is the question of what to do with the surviving templars said rognvald there are nine altogetherde bracineauxs sergeant among them they cannot have been privy to their commanders wicked schemes brother timotheus pointed out we must show clemency but we cannot allow them to simply ride away as if nothing happened said hasan would you imprison them said the priest seeing a tedious discussion stretching ahead of them cait stood please excuse me i want to see bertrano where is he he is in the church timotheus said we thought it best not to move him just yet allow me to attend you rognvald said rising he took her arm cait covered his hand with hers and let the touch linger for a moment then giving his hand a gentle squeeze she removed it saying i am well enough my lord stay and finish your talk i will return when i have seen how the good bishop fares she moved to the entrance where elantra opened the door for her then walked with her out into a fresh crisp day the sun was high it had passed midday and the sky was clear and bright and blue the dead had been removed from the battleground and were now placed in orderly rows beside the church where prince hasans men and most of the villagers were working over them removing armour weapons clothing and boots anything that could be of use to the living as she drew near the church she saw that someone had tried to dig a grave a long narrow rectangle had been scraped in the snow and the green turf beneath was cut but the ground was too hard so the work had been abandoned down by the lake she saw men working to erect a wooden pyre the corpses would be burned upon entering the church she stood for a moment to allow her eyes to adjust to the dim interior then she saw against the south wall a heap of wadded cloaks around it huddled three or four nuns and halhuli sitting on his heels his hands resting idly in his lap they turned to look as cait entered then returned to their vigil as alethea rose to greet her sister the two met and embraced without speaking they simply stood and held one another after a time cait whispered thank you thea they held one another for a little longer and then alethea said they were going to burn the village and the abbey once they got hold of the blessed cup they were going to destroy everything how do you know the templars confessed it dag and svein and the others were securing the prisoners and they told them de bracineaux had ordered them to destroy everything and kill everyone because he did not want anyone left alive to tell what had happened cait shook her head in bewilderment and started the pain clawing at her throat again alethea saw her wince and raised a hand to caits neck touching the bandage gently i think it will leave a scar i will recover they say bertrano may not alethea nodded his wound is very bad but it does not seem to pain him overmuch they walked together to the makeshift bed where the archbishop lay halhuli rose and said i have made him comfortable now we can but wait and pray the great healer to perform a wonder cait thanked him whereupon he inclined his head in a bow and departed the nuns made room for cait and alethea as they took their places beside the bishop bertrano lay quietly hands folded over his stomach as if in peaceful meditation cait thought he was asleep but when she had with aletheas help knelt down beside him bertrano opened his eyes and smiled weakly you still have your head my dear he said that is good and we still have the holy chalice she replied returning his smile i must ask your forgiveness archbishop none of this would have happened if not for me i am sorry if not for you and your dauntless sister dear lady de bracineaux would be halfway to jerusalem with the cup by now even so i do forgive you lying to an archbishop is a sinonly a very minor sin mind for everyone does it still i would not recommend making a practice of it he raised his hand and traced the sign of the cross in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit i absolve you cait leaned over and kissed him lightly on the cheek thank you my lord archbishop and you dear girl he said to alethea are a very brave and intrepid adversary i absolve you too any ill the commander suffered he brought upon himself he alone was the author of his demise my only thought was for my sister alethea replied and for the blessed cup he would have kept it you know bertrano told them once de bracineaux had it he would never have given it up well it is safe now said alethea no the archbishop shook his head weakly the holy cup will never be safe here again sooner or later others will come and it will be taken abbess annora appeared just then holding a steaming bowl on a tray sister besa was with her carrying a pile of clean folded cloths she acknowledged caits presence with a kindly nod and placed the tray beside the bed we must change the bandage she said as with aletheas ready help she knelt down beside cait in a moment said the archbishop to cait he said annora has been telling me that you have been chosen to become the next guardian of the sacred chalice so it would seem cait answered show him whispered alethea cait stretched out her hands palms up and drew back the sleeves of her robe so that the churchman could see the marks of the stigmata on her wrists archbishop bertrano placed a finger lightly on the livid mark the foolishness of god is wiser than the wisdom of men it is a heavy charge that is laid upon you daughter still your only freedom lies thereif you will accept it that i do believe so do i replied cait realizing as she spoke the affirmation that she had decided to answer the call good he smiled and a spasm of pain passed over his face he closed his eyes and held his breath when it was over he opened his eyes again they were a little duller this time his gaze slightly less intense perhaps you should rest now suggested thea soon i shall have all the rest i need archbishop bertrano replied let us change your bandage now said annora you will feel better a moment longer and then you can have me he replied i told caitriona that the blessed cup will not be safe here any longer because of my infernal meddling too many people know about it now if it remains here it will only bring trouble to the village they would never know a moments peace again he reached out and took caits hand but it has pleased god to choose you therefore i bid you take it take it far from here and hide it well one day the time will come when it can be revealed once more keep it safe until then cait lifted his hand and brought it to her lips by the strength and wisdom of god i will my lord archbishop there now that is settled bertrano smiled again now if i might make one last request of you dear abbess certainly annora replied anything i should like to receive the holy sacrament of the cup once before i die of course archbishop could we do it now do you think i do not wish to keep the ferryman waiting at once my lord the abbess retrieved the holy chalice from its place on the altar and cait and alethea watched as she proceeded to administer the holy rite to the dying man kneeling at his bedside she spoke so softly to him that none in the room heard what passed between them but in the end when bertrano drank from the cup a smile of such serenity and pleasure lit his features that each one present felt as if they had seen a little of heavens bright glory reflected on his face when the sacrament was finished the abbess returned the cup to the altar cait and alethea drew near the bed once more and bade the dying cleric farewell bertrano blessed them and then lay back he allowed the nuns to care for his wound then and while the abbess and sister besa changed his bandage cait and alethea crept away quietly together they paused briefly at the side of the church to view de bracineauxs bloodstained corpse the templar commander seemed smaller now and older death had diminished him he gazed with unseeing eyes to the boundless heavens the scar puckering his brow in a doleful expression cait looked at him and felt neither hate nor exultation at his defeat only sorrow at the lives his reckless pursuit had wasted after a moment they turned without a word and proceeded to dominicos house where the meal elantra had been preparing was now being served the norsemen were there tooall eating hungrily their bowls to their mouths sopping gravy with chunks of bread brother timotheus called for cait and alethea to join him at table with the others cait sent alethea ahead saying tell him i will join them in a moment i would speak to my knights first with that cait walked to where yngvar was sitting the norseman stopped eating and raised his face to her as without a word she bent and kissed him lightly on the cheek she then did the same with svein dag and rodrigo in turn your courage is matched only by your loyalty and skill she told them the knights looked with pleasure at their lady you have my admiration and my gratitude and she added as soon as we return home you shall have your reward my lady said yngvar glancing at svein and dag beside him it would be no small reward to be allowed to continue in your service we have been talking said dag and you will be needing good menatarms when you return home this is what we think and what does lord rognvald think he has given us leave to follow our own minds in this matter answered svein adding he is making plans of his own i think i see cait nodded very well then hear me all of you i will not say you no but neither will i agree just yet it is a long way to caithness and much can happen before we arrive you may change your minds if you do you will not be bound that is fair svein agreed for all of them and we will abide only tell us if you view our offer in a kindly light dear svein and all of you cait said i look upon your offer with nothing but the highest esteem i will never forget what you have done for me and alethea svein reached out took her hand and pressed it to his lips your servant my lady she turned to the spanish knight who sat looking on and you rodrigo have you decided also my lady nothing would give me more pleasure than to remain in your service these men have become my friends and i would not hesitate to cast my lot with them but i promised paulo i would wait for him he is improving but is still too weak to ride with your permission my lady i will wait as i have promised as to that said yngvar the prince has said we can winter with him at the palace he has sworn on the beard of the prophet that he will not break faith with us again added svein and after what i have seen today i believe him it is a generous offer allowed cait we shall see she left them to their meal and joined the others at table she tried to eat a little but it hurt her throat to swallow so she gave up and just sat listening to their talk the day faded and as twilight stole into the valley deepening the shadows and turning the sky to inky violet one of prince hasans men came to the house to say that the funeral pyre was ready they went out to the lakeside where a great tower of timber had been erected the moorish troops had formed a wide circle around the pyre and the villagers and some of the nuns had assembled on the slope of the shore to watch at the princes command halhuli stepped forward and taking up the torch raised it three times calling out in arabic each time he then passed the firebrand to the warrior next to him the man did likewise raising it to the chanted exhortation and then passing it on to the next in line and so on until all the surviving warriors had performed the rite at last the torch came to the prince he received it stepped forward and upon completing the third exhortation lowered the torch and touched it to the tinder which had been prepared flames licked out and up bright yellow in the blue dusk he moved to the next side of the foursided pyre and lit the tinder there too then proceeded to the remaining sides lighting each in turn when he had completed the circuit the flames were rising through the latticework of the pyre skipping from branch to branch leaping higher and higher into the darkening sky the shadows of the watchers flickered and danced in the orange glare of the fire on the snow inside the towerlike structure the corpses had been neatly wrapped in their cloaks and stacked on a stout platform and this caught fire giving off a silvery smoke as the bodies began to smoulder when the flames had caught hold and begun their work in earnest brother timotheus moved out from the circle and approached the burning tower raising his hands he called out in a loud voice to be heard above the crack and roar of the inferno he said thou goest home in this night in the depth of winter to thy eternal and perpetual home thou goest sleep friends sleepand away with sorrow sleep friends sleepin the absence of fear sleep friends sleepin the rock of all forgiving the black wrath of the god of life is upon the dank gloom of death as thou goest the white wrath of the lord of the stars is upon the dark path that leads beyond this worldsrealm thou great god of salvation pour out thy healing grace on these souls as the fire pours out its bright and eager heat and gather them into your wide and loving embrace for ever and for ever always and for ever amen when he finished he stepped back into the circle and the company watched in silence until the towering pyre began to collapse sending bright sparks spinning up into the nightdark sky so that the brave moorish dead would not have to suffer the ignominy of sharing a funeral fire with the enemy who had slain them prince hasan had commanded a separate smaller pyre to be made for the slain templars and their disgraced leader as the watchers began making their way slowly back to the village this second pyre was fired too but aside from timotheus who paused to offer up a prayer for mercy on behalf of the misled templars no one stayed to watch upon their return abbess annora met them outside dominicos house with word that archbishop bertrano was dead he was at peace to the end she told them and passed away lightly as a sigh i am sorry to hear it said rognvald he was a good man turning to prince hasan he said i am sorry too that your fears have been realized more blood will flow from this replied hasan ruefully such is the will of allah so be it there will be no more bloodshed declared cait firmly we will take the archbishops body back to santiago for burial and we will tell them that he died at the hands of the templars blame for his death will not be laid upon you or the people hereabouts i will see to that i am grateful ketmia unfortunately it is a far distance the prince pointed out by the time you reached santiago there would be little worth burying in summer perhaps remarked alethea but it is winter now and if we do not tarry along the way the cold will keep his body from corruption such things are known in norway offered rognvald it may work here even if it did not offered cait we would be no worse off than before but alethea is right if we are to have any chance at all we must leave without delay to hasan she said i am sorry but it appears we will not be able to take advantage of your kind offer to winter at aljelal alas replied hasan it would have been a rare and special pleasure nevertheless i understand still he added quickly perhaps you would not object if i see you safely on your way not in the least cait replied i can think of nothing i would like better she glanced up and saw the shadow of disappointment flit across rognvalds features as he turned away she slipped her hand through his arm well there is perhaps just one other thing she confided adding have you ever been to caithness my lord by the end of the next day all was ready at dawn the following morning the company bade farewell to brother timotheus and his faithful village flock and set off leading a wagon packed with snow and ice in which the archbishops body was preserved with them went prince hasan and a company of his moorish soldiers who would accompany them as far as palencia where gislebert and the nine surviving templars would be turned over to governor carlowith a request that they be detained long enough to allow a specially prepared report of their actions on behalf of the apostate commander de bracineaux to reach the pope and for cait and her company to reach the ship at bilbao at aljelal they stopped long enough to pick up a second wagon to follow the first in this wagon were paulowho insisted he was well enough to face the rigours of the roadand three nuns of the abbey of klais mairi chosen by abbess annora to begin a new order of the grey marys in caithness sister siaran sister besa and the newest member of the order sister alethea accompanying the sisters as a gift to the new order was a large gilded crossand snug in its hiding place in the base of the cross the most holy and sacred chalice the mystic rose epilogue the memory of that night remains as vivid and vital as this mornings sunrise i have merely to bring the image before my mindthe rockcut sanctuary the altar dressed in white the great gilt wooden cross shimmering in the candlelight the inner circle robed in white standing in attendanceand i am there again on my knees the blessed cup cradled in my hands it is empty as i look inside but as i raise it to my lips the bowl is suddenly filled with crimson liquid i take it into my mouth and taste the heavy sweetnessof life of hope of the everlasting joy of serving the eternal one with each remembrance i drink again from the holy chalice and my vow like the quickening liquid it contains is renewed to remember for me is to enter again the vision i was granted on that night not everyone sees a vision zaccaria told me then and not everyone who sees a vision sees the same thing you have been richly blessed brother true enough but as it is written from those to whom much has been given much shall be required my joy comes at a price which none but those who have likewise borne that heavy cost can ever know caitriona knew pemberton also that night as i took the sweet lifechanging liquid into my mouth and felt the holy fire spread through my dull limbs the cavernous room altar and men who presided over the sacramenteverything vanished i raised my eyes from the cup to see that i was kneeling before a man dressed in the robes of a simple priesta young man his hair dark and curly his beard a thick black mass of tight curls through which his quick smile broke like a flash of light from a cloudtroubled sky greetings friend he said i have been waiting for you brother andrew i had no need to askknowing it was he how may i serve you lord i am not a lord that you should kneel to me he reached down took my elbow does one servant kneel to another stand on your feet brother and let us speak to one another as servants together of the great king he took my hand and turned it over exposing the wrist and there imprinted on my flesh was the livid red woundlike stigma the mark of the rose the other wrist bore the sign too and i gazed upon the bloodred marks in wonder as you have been chosen brother andrew said so you must choose i plucked up my courage to reply but before i could speak he raised a hand in warning saying but i would not have you choose in ignorance for you must know that to be a guardian is both blessing and burden and i would have you count the cost tell me then any who take up the service of the cup will extend their lives in the world far beyond the age reached by other men and women of mortal birth you will neither age nor experience frailty infirmity or decrepitude your allotted span will be measured in scores not years and you will grow great in wisdom i was just thinking that the burden did not seem overwhelming when he said know also that you will live to see your friends grow old and die your children too and their children after them not only this you will watch many whom you would befriend drown beneath the tides of illness insanity and evil which sweep restlessly over the world you will see dear friends suffer and succumb you will see good men stumble and fall by the wayside through weakness and your heart will breaknot once but a thousand times i looked upon the woundlike marks on my wrists and at last began to understand what it meant to be a guardian and what was being asked of me could i shoulder such a burden i wondered could i watch those i loved fall one by one into the sleep of death could i stand aside and watch the sufferings of the world and not yield to the crushing pain it is a hard thing you ask of me i told him it is a hard thing yes he agreed as it is written many are called but few are chosen but if it helps to make the choice any easier hear me when i say there will be no more guardians after you my friend you will be the last you will live to see the glory of the great king acknowledged throughout the world when the treasure so faithfully preserved by the cele de is at last revealed in you the long obedience of these loyal servants of christ will be rewarded and it will be the glory of the ages it was then i realized what pemberton had been trying to tell me the pain is swallowed in peace and grief in glory he had been a guardian he had known the pain and grief that now stood before me and he wanted me to know that it would be all right that in the end the pain of my guardianship would be redeemed any grief i suffered would be swallowed in the glory to come ultimately the blessing would be far greater than the burden the time has come to decide brother said the white priest what will you choose it is an honour to be chosen i replied and i will do my best to prove myself worthy yes i will serve brother andrew smiled and offered me a blessing he then told me of the trials to come and how i must prepare myself to meet them we talked of this and of other things before he went away and i awoke from the vision with the burning certainty that the course before me had been established long long ago i was the last in a line that stretched back to a young man in the orkney isles to murdo who was not willing to stand by and see his birthright stolen foolish reckless headstrong and impetuous murdo and duncan and caitriona in their turn remained true to the vision they were granted to make of their place in the world a haven far far from the ambitions of smallsouled men and their ceaseless striving together they made a place where the most precious and sacred objects under heaven could reside undisturbed until the day of their unveiling when the world should again see and remember and believe
