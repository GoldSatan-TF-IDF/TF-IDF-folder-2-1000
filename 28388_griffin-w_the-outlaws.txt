w e b griffin the outlaws one el obeid airport north kurdufan sudan january the small convoytwo battered toyota pickups a ford f pickup and a land roverhad attracted little attention as it passed through alubayyid estimated population around alubayyid was the nearest seven kilometers town to the el obeid airport which was sometimes known as the alubayyid airport the town of alubayyid was sometimes known as el obeid in this remote corner of the world what a village or an airportor just about anything elsewas called depended on who was talking the men were all armed with kalashnikov rifles and all bearded and all were dressed in the long pastelcolored robes known as jalabiya and wearing both tagia skullcaps and a length of cloth called an imma covering their heads the beds of the trucks each held one or two armed men it was impossible to telleven guesswhat the cargo might be as it was covered with a tarpaulin the convoy looked in other words very much like any other convoy passing throughor originating inalubayyid on any given day by whatever name the town had been a transportation hub for nearly two centuries first there had been camel caravans then a rail line then roadsits a ninehour fivehundredkilometer trip from khartoumand finally six kilometers south of town the airport with a runway nearly a thousand meters long as it approached the airport the convoy slowed and the headlights were turned off it moved near to the end of the chainlink fence surrounding the airport and stopped remaining on the road a dozen meneveryone but the driversquickly got out of the vehicles the man who had been in the front seat of the land rover went to the floodlightnot much of a floodlight just a single fluorescent tubeon a pole at the end of the fencing and quickly shot it out with a burst from a caliber submachine gun the weapon was suppressed which meant that perhaps eighty percent of the noise along rifle cartridge would normally make was silenced he then quickly joined the others who were in the process of quickly removing the immas and skullcaps from their heads and finally their long jalabiya robes the discarded garments were then tossed into the land rover under the jalabiya robes they had been wearing black formfitting garments something like underwear except these had attached hoods which when they had been pulled in place covered the head and most of the face nightvision goggles and radio headsets were quickly put in place next they took from the land rover and the pickups black nylon versions of what was known in the us and many other armies as web equipment and strapped it in place on their bodies the man with the caliber submachine gunthe team leaderwas joined by two other men equipped with special weapons one was armed with a highpowered suppressed snipers rifle that was equipped with both night vision and laser sights the other had a suppressed uzi mm submachine gun the laws of physics are such that no highpowered weapon can ever be really suppressed much less silenced the best that could be said for the suppressed snipers rifle was that when fired it didnt make very much noise the best that could be said for the uzi was that when fired it sounded like a suppressed uzi submachine gun which meant that it wasnt quite as noisy as an unsuppressed uzi the sights on the snipers rifle which was a highly modified version of the russian dragunov svds caliber x r snipers rifle were stateoftheart when looking through the nightvision scopewhich had replaced the standard glass optical scopethe marksman was able to see on the darkest of nights just about anything he needed to and by sliding a switch near the trigger a small computer was turned on a laser beam was activated the computer determined how distant was the object on which sat the little red spot and sent that message to the crosshairs on the sight the result was that the shooter could be about ninety percent sure thatpresuming he did everything else required of a marksman since the rifle was invented such as having a good sight picture firing from a stable position taking a breath and letting half of it out before ever so carefully squeezing the triggerthe grain bullet would strike his target within an inch or so of where the little red dot pinpointed the team leader made a somewhat imperious gesture which caused another manwho had been standing by awaiting the orderto apply an enormous set of bolt cutters to the chainlink fence within a minute he had cut a gate in the fencing through which everyone couldand quickly dideasily pass the runway was about fifty meters wide an inspection which the team leader considered the most dangerous activity of this part of the operation was required a good leader he had assumed this responsibility himself he walked quickly in a crouch down the dotted line marking the center of the runway toward the small terminal building the man with the suppressed uzi walked down the runway halfway between the dotted line and the left side and the man with the snipers rifle did the same thing on the right all the others made their way toward the terminal off the runway about half on one side and half on the other most of them were now armed with the mini uzi which is smaller than the uzi and much larger than the micro uzi the kalashnikovs as much a part of their trytopassasthelocals disguises as anything else had joined the jalabiya robes and skullcaps in the land rover they had gone about halfway down the runway when a doga large dog from the sound of himbegan to bark or maybe it was the sound of two large dogs everyone dropped flat the man with the dragunov assumed the firing position turned on the night sights and peered down the runway he took his hand off the fore end and raised it with two fingers extended the team leader nodded the two shots didnt make very much noise and there was no more barking the team leader considered his options it was possible that the shots had been heard and equally possible that someone had come out of the terminal to see why the dogs were barking on the runway or that they had come outor were about toto see why the barking dogs had stopped barking that meant the sooner they got to the terminal the better but the problem of having to inspect the runway remainedthat was the priority the team leader activated his microphone he spoke in hungarian trucks lights outrepeat lights outto one hundred meters of the terminal hold for orders there was no need to give orders to the others they would follow his example he got to his feet and resumed his inspection this time at a fast trot still crouched over the sniper and the man with the suppressed uzi followed his example the men off the runway after a moment followed their example they came to the dogs lying in pools of blood where the animals had fallen about a hundred meters from the terminal building the team leader could now see the flicker of fluorescent lights in the terminal building itself and in the building beside it which he knew housed the menfour to sixand their familiesprobably twice that many peoplewho both worked and lived at the airport and he could hear the exhaust of a small generator that was powerful enough to power the lights he saw now and the two dozen or so fluorescent floodlights around the perimeter fence but it wasnt powerful enough to power the runway lights he looked up at the control tower there was no sign of lights flickering fluorescent or otherwise runway lighting would logically be on the same power as the control tower that meant he was going to have to find the much larger generator see if he could start it and see if there was enough diesel fuel to run it if he couldnt get the runway lights on the whole operation would fail he spoke hungarian into his microphone again change of plans cleanup will have to wait until we get some of these people to show us the runway lights generator and get it started for us commence operations in sixty seconds from he waited until the sweep second hand on his wristwatch touched the luminescent spot at the top time the next stage of the operation went well not perfectly no operation ever goes perfectly and that is even more true as the case was here when the intelligence is dated or inadequate and there has been no time for thorough rehearsals there had been several rehearsals but there had been no time to build a replica of the airport and its buildings and if there had been time they had had only satellite photography old satellite photography and thus not to be trusted to provide the needed information they had improvised using sticks and tape to represent the fence and the buildings and guessing where the doors on the buildings would be but despite this the team leader thought the operation had gone offso far at leastvery well the man with the bolt cutters had opened the gates to the terminal area and to the tarmac then one twoman team had entered the terminal to make sure there were to be no surprises from there and two teams of three men each had stormed and secured the building where the workers and their families lived the operator with the suppressed uziwho was the number twohad climbed up into the control tower the sniperwho was the number threehad gone first into the terminal building to make sure that team had missed nothing and then into the living quarters where he checked to see that everyone had been rounded up and securely manacled the operations scenario had used that term but the manacles actually used to restrain the locals was a plastic version of the garrote the locals were frightened of course but none of them seemed on the edge of hysteria which was often a problem with women and children another potential problem language didnt arise the team leader had been told to expect the locals might speak only the local languages and the team had been issued hastily printed phrase books in daza maba gulay and sara the trouble with phrase books was that while they permitted you to ask questions they were not much help in translating the answers all four of the men the sniper had manacled in the living quarters spoke french and so did most of the thirteen women and children to judge by their faces and whispered conversations one of the men was a tower operator and another was in charge of the generator the former reported that the radios in the tower seemed to be operable and that the runway lights could be turned on and off from the tower the latter reported that if he had his hands free he could have the generator started in three minutes the team leader signaled one of the operators to cut the plastic handcuffs from both the sniper took the generator man to wherever the generator was and the team leader took the tower operator to the tower he had just about reached the top of the ladder to the control tower when he heard the rumble of a diesel engine starting and as he put his shoulders through the hole in the tower floor the incandescent lightbulbs began to glow and then came on full there was a screeching sound from the roof as the rotating radar antenna began to turn all the avionic equipment in the tower was of american manufacture and both the team leader and his number two were familiar with it nevertheless the team leader ordered the control tower operator to get it running dual radar monitors showed a target twenty miles distant at twelve thousand feet altitude just the target no identification from a transponder light the runway the team leader ordered the tower operator threw a number of switches on a panel under the desk which circled the room as the sound of the diesel engine showed the addition of a load the lights on the runway and two taxi strips leading from it glowed and then were fully illuminated number two dialed in a frequency on one of the radios activate transponder he said in russian thirty seconds later a triangle appeared next to the target on the radar screen i have you at twelve thousand twenty miles the field is lit the runway is clear land to the south the target blip on the radar screen began moving toward the center of the screen the numbers in a little box next to the transponder blip began to move downward quickly from the team leader pointed to something under the desk the tower operator looked confused impatiently the team leader pointed again the tower operator dropped to his knees to get a better look at what was under the table that he was supposed to see the team leader put the muzzle of the caliber submachine gun against the tower operators neck at the base of his skull and pulled the trigger the short burst of fire made a thump thump sound and the tower operator fell slowly forward on his face then his legs went limp and his body completely collapsed there was no blood as often happened the soft lead bullets did not have enough remaining velocity after penetrating the skull to pass through the other side they simply ricocheted around the skull cavity moving through soft brain tissue until they had lost all velocity there might be some blood leakage around the eyes the ears and the nose but there seldom was much and often not any a team member entered through the tower floor hole the leader ordered stay until the planes on the ground then set these to twenty minutes these were four thermite grenades each had a radioactivated fuse and for redundancy in case the radio detonation failed a simple clock firing mechanism the team leader set the thermite grenades in place two on the communications equipment one on the radar and the last on the spine of the tower operator near the entrance wounds made by the rounds he took a last look around and then spoke to his microphone commence cleanup he ordered acknowledge before the team leader had carefully climbed completely down the ladder there was about thirty seconds of intense uzi fire as the site was cleaned of the remaining three men and their women and children the firing made more noise than the team leader would have preferred but the options would have been to either garrote the locals or cut their throats and that was timeconsuming often a little more risky and this way there was less chance of messy arterial blood to worry about as he watched one of his men carry a box of thermite grenades into the living quarters the team leader heard a rushing noise and a split second later when he looked up he could see two brilliant landing lights come on as the aircraft approached the field a moment later he could see the aircraft itself it was an unusuallooking airplane painted a nonreflective gray ostensibly making it invisible to radar that was a joke as soon as they had turned on the radar just now they had seen it twenty miles distant there were two jet engines mounted close together on top of the fuselage where the wings joined the fuselage just behind and above the cockpit this had made it necessary for the vertical fin and the horizontal stabilizers to be raised out of the way of the jet thrust the tail of the aircraft was extraordinarily thin and tall with the control surfaces mounted on the top the aircraft a tupolev tua was not going to win any prizes for aesthetic beauty but like the usaf a thunderbolt iiuniversally known as the warthogit did what it was designed to do and did so splendidly the warthogs heavy armament busted up tanks and provided other close ground support the tupolev tua was designed to fly great distances at near the speed of sound carrying just about anything that could be loaded inside its rather ugly fuselage and land and take off in amazingly short distances on very rough airfieldsor no airfields at all it was also an amazingly quiet aircraft the first the team leader had heard its powerful engines was the moment before touchdown when the pilot activated the thrust reversal system and even that died quickly as the aircraft reached braking speed on the landing roll and then stopped and turned around on the runway number three now holding illuminated wands directed it as it taxied up the runway and then signaled for it to turn before it had completed that maneuver a ramp began to lower from the rear of the fuselage bring up number one truck the team leader ordered the ford f came across the tarmac and backed up to the opening ramp at the rear of the nowstopped aircraft a small rubbertracked frontloader rolled down the ramp the driver and the four men riding on it were dressed in black coveralls the team leader saluted one of the newcomers who returned it problems the operation commander asked in russian none so far sir cleanup completed sir cargo inspected yes sir the team leader lied he had forgotten that detail well then lets get it aboard yes sir instead of a bucket the frontloader had modified pallet arms to the bottom of each arm had been welded two steel loops from each loop hung a length of sturdy nylon strapping the other two men who had ridden off the aircraft on the rubbertracked vehicle climbed into the bed of the f removed the tarpaulin which had concealed its contentstwo barrellike objects of heavy plastic dark blue in color and looking not unlike beer kegs they then removed the chocks and strapping which had been holding the rearmost barrel in place that done they carefully directed the pallet arms over the bed of the truck until they were in position for the nylon strapping to be passed under the barrel and the fastener at the free end to be inserted into the loop on the bottom of the arm the strapping had leveractivated devices to tighten the strappingand thus the barrelagainst the underside of the pallet arm tight one of the men called out in russian when that had been accomplished the frontloader backed away from the f pivoted in its length and then drove up the ramp into the aircraft the two men in the fs bed now removed the chocks and the strapping from the other barrel and very carefully rolled it to the end of the bed by then the frontloader had backed off the ramp turned again in its length and was prepared to take the second barrel bring up truck two the team leader ordered truck two arrived as truck one started to drive off the procedure of taking the barrels from the trucks was repeated exactly for the two toyota pickups truck fourthe land roverdid not hold any of the barrels but it held the discarded kalashnikovs these were carried aboard the aircraft set mechanical timers at ten minutes and board the aircraft the team leader ordered check your memory to see that you have forgotten nothing the operation commander ordered thirty seconds later the team leader replied i can think of nothing sir the operation commander gestured for the team leader to get on the airplane when he had trotted up the ramp the operation commander almost casually strolled up the ramp picked up a handset mounted on the bulkhead just inside and ordered get us out of here the ramp door immediately began to close when it was nearly closed the aircraft began to move thirty seconds later it was airborne the operation commander pulled off his masklike hood and looked at the team leader dont smile he said something always is forgotten or goes wrong at the last minute or both the team leader held up the radio transmitter which would detonate the thermite grenades the operation commander nodded the team leader flicked the protective cover off the toggle switch and threw it two the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february the door opened and a secret service agent announced ambassador montvale mr president joshua ezekiel clendennen who had acceded to the presidency of the united states on the sudden deathrupture of an undetected aneurism of the aortaof the incumbent twelve days before motioned for montvale to be admitted president clendennen was a short pudgy paleskinned fiftytwoyearold alabaman who kept his tiny ears hidden under a full head of silver hair charles m montvale came through the door he was a tall elegantly tailored sixtytwoyearold whose silver mane was every bit as luxurious as the presidents but did not do much to conceal his ears montvales ears were the delight of the nations political cartoonists they seemed to be so very appropriate for a man whoafter a long career of government service in which he had served as a deputy secretary of state the secretary of the treasury and ambassador to the european unionwas now the united states director of national intelligence the dni was caricatured at least once a weekand sometimes more oftenwith his oversize ears pointed in the direction of moscow or teheran or capitol hill good morning mr president montvale said can i offer you something charles the president asked his alabama drawl pronounced have you had your breakfast yes thank you sir i have hours ago coffee then please the presidents foot pressed a button under the desk would you bring us some coffee please he motioned for montvale to take a seat on a couch facing a coffee table and when montvale had done so clendennen rose from behind his desk and walked to an armchair on the other side of the coffee table and sat down the coffee was delivered immediately by a steward under the watchful eye of the presidents secretary thank you the president said we can pour ourselves and now please no calls no messages no interruptions yes mr president from anyone the president added montvale picked up the silver coffeepot and said you take your coffee black thank you charles the president said montvale poured coffee for both the president sipped his and then said you know what i have been thinking lately when ive had time to think of anything no sir harry truman didnt know of the atomic bombroosevelt never told himuntil the day after roosevelt died general groves walked in hereinto this officeran everybody out and then told truman that we had the atomic bomb that we had two of them ive heard that story mr president montvale said we had a somewhat similar circumstance here the first i heard of the strike in the congo was after it happened when we already were at defconone montvale didnt reply clendennen went on and he never told me about this secret organization he had running i heard about that only after hed died secretary of state natalie cohen came in here and said mr president theres something i think you should know that was the first id ever heard of the analysis operations organization they almost got us into a war and i was never even told it existed montvale sipped his coffee then said it was called the office of organizational analysis mr president and it no longer exists i wonder if i can believe that the president said i wonder how soon someone else is going to come through that door and say mr president theres something you should know i think thats highly unlikely mr president and i can assure you that the office of organizational analysis is gone i was there when the president killed it maybe he should have sent a couple of squadrons of fighterbombers the way he did to the congo to destroy everything in a twentysquaremile area and to hell with collateral damage the president said mr president i understand how you feel even if i would have been inside the area of collateral damage tell me about operations analysis charles and about you being there when our late president killed it he set up the office of organizational analysis in a presidential finding mr president when the deputy chief of mission in our embassy in argentina was murdered and put a lowly lieutenant colonel in charge at the time carlos castillo was a major mr president and you and natalie cohen went along with this the presidential finding was issued over our objections sir and at the time natalie was the national security advisor not secretary of state where did he find this major castillo what is he an italian a mexican cuban what a texican sir his family has been in texas since before the alamo hes a west pointer i seem to recall that lieutenant colonel oliver north who almost got us into a war in nicaragua was an annapolis graduate the president interrupted what do they do at those service academies charles have a required course how to start a war oneohone montvale didnt respond directly instead he said castillo came to the presidents attention over that stolen airliner you remember that mr president vaguely well an airliner a boeing that had been sitting for a year in an airport in luanda angola suddenly disappeared wethe intelligence communitywere having a hard time finding it those things take time something the president didnt always understand and as you know sir the president was very close to the thensecretary of homeland security matt hall he talked to him about this and either he or the secretary thought it would be a good idea to send someone to see which intelligence agency had learned what and when they had learned it hall told the president that he had just the man for the assignment major castillo who was just back from afghanistan and working for him as an interpreter aide and to cut a long story short mr president major castillo not only located the missing aircraft but managed to steal it back from those who had stolen it and flew it to macdill air force basecentral commandin tampa i heard a little very little about that the president said the president decided and i think he was right that the less that came out about that incident the better and make sure to keep clendennen out of the loop right the president said more than a little bitterly montvale didnt respond directly instead he said the people who stole the airplane planned to crash it into the liberty bell in philadelphia we would not have let that happen but if the story had gotten out the president believed there would have been panic president clendennen considered that a moment and then asked so where does the finding fit in all this the wife of one of our diplomats in argentina the deputy chief of mission j winslow mastersonjack the stack i know who he was charles not only was he the basketball player who got himself run over by a beer truck for which he collected a very large bundle but he was the son of winslow masterson who is arguably the richest black guyscratch blackthe richest guy in mississippi and they evensurprise surprisetold me that winslows son had been killed yes sir first they kidnapped his wife the minute the president heard about that he sent major castillo down there what castillo was supposed to do was keep an eye on the investigation and report directly to the president by the time castillo got to buenos aires masterson had eluded the state department security people who had been guarding him and gone to meet the kidnappers they killed him in front of his wife then doped her up and left her with the body what was that all about we didnt know it at the time but it was connected with the iraqi oilforfood scandal mrs mastersons brother was not only involved but had stolen money from the thieves they thought she would know where he wasshe didnt there was enormous friction between her husband and her brotherand they told her unless she told them where he was they would kill her children you didnt know this at the time no sir but when the president learned that masterson had gotten away from his state department guards and had been assassinated he went ballistic he had a slight tendency to do that didnt he the president said sarcastically and got on the phone to the ambassador and told him that castillo was now in charge of getting mrs masterson and the children safely out of argentina and which he did the president send a globemaster down there to bring mastersons body and his family home and when the plane got to the air base in biloxi air force one was sitting there waiting for it and so was the presidential finding the president had found that the national interest required the establishment of a clandestine unit to be known as the office of organizational analysis which was charged with locating and terminating those responsible for the assassination of j winslow masterson major carlos castillo was named chief he paused thats how it started mr president terminating is that nice little euphemism for murder right yes sir well that explains wouldnt you agree charles why the president didnt feel i had to know about this he knew i wouldnt stand for it theres nothing in the constitution that gives the president the authority to order the killing of anybody montvale thought well he knew you wouldnt like it but there is nothing you could have done about it if you had known short of giving yourself the floor in the senate and committing political suicide by betraying the man who had chosen you to be his vice president being morally outraged is one thing doing something about it at great cost to yourself is something else and if the story had come out theres a hell of a lot of people who would have been delighted that the president had ordered the execution of the people who had murdered jack the stack in front of his wife and even more who would have agreed that the murder of any american diplomat called for action not complaints to the united nations the only reason clendennen said that is to cover his ass in case the story of ooa gets out i never knew a thing about it when dni montvale told me the story after i had become presidenthe had been forbidden to tell me beforei was outraged ask montvale just how outraged i was the security was very tight mr president montvale said the access list the people authorized to know about ooa was not only very short but extraordinarily tightly controlled what does that mean there were only two people who could clear others for access to ooa information mr president major castillo and the president himself i was made privy to it of course but i was forbidden to share what knowledge i had with anyone elsenot even my deputy or my secretaryno matter how many top secret security clearances they had that isnt surprising when you think about it is it charles when you are ordering murder the fewer people who know about it the better montvale didnt reply just how many bodies did this major castillo leave scattered all over the world charles the president asked i really dont know mr president montvale said he reported only to the president and now that theres a new president dont you think its time somebody asked him where is he i dont know mr president youre the dni the president snapped shouldnt you know a little detail like that mr president will you indulge me for a moment i think it would be useful for you to know what happened visavis the congo i think a lot of people would find it useful to know what happened visavis the congo on christmas eve mr president there were several assassinations and attempted assassinations all over the world by major castillo on christmas eve unbelievable no sir directed against people with a connection to lieutenant colonelby then he had been promotedcastillo a newspaper reporter in germany for one an argentine gendarmeria officer for another a secret service agent on the vice presidential detail which one the president again interrupted his name is john m britton if memory serves mr president black guy the former vice president recalled smart as hell funny too i liked him i wondered what happened to him well sir immediately after the attempt on his life he was of course taken off your protection detail why sir if someone was trying to kill special agent britton and he was guarding you standing beside you the president stopped him with a gesture he had the picture what was jack brittons connection to castillo britton was a philadelphia police department detective working undercover in the counterterrorism bureau when castillo was running down the philadelphia connection to the stolen airliner castillo recruited him for ooa then how did he wind up in the secret service on my protection detail i believe you know supervisory special agent tom mcguire mr president he used to run the presidents protection detail yeah sure i know tom dont tell me he has a connection with castillo the president assigned mcguire to ooa to act as liaison between the secret service and castillo he was impressed with britton and when britton was no longer needed by castillo and couldnt return to philadelphiahis identity was now known to the terrorist communitymcguire recruited him for your protection detail and apparently special agent britton could not understand why an attempt on his life justified his being relieved from your protection detail and being assigned to a desk in saint louis he said some inappropriate things to his supervisors mcguire decided the best thing to do under the circumstances was send him back to ooa and he did why did theyand who is theytry to kill britton castillo believed the assassinations and assassination attempts on all the people i mentioned were retaliatory actions ordered by putin himself i find it hard to accept that vladimir putin would order assassinations any more than i would the president said but on the other hand once we start murdering people i think we would have to be very naive or very stupidhow about stupidly naiveto think the other side would not retaliate yes sir well castillo was apparently delighted to have britton back he put him on an airplane and sent him and mrs britton to argentina to get them out of sight and then loaded somemostof the others on his gulfstream and flew to europe on his gulfstream he had access to an air force gulfstream jesus christ yes sir he had access to an air force gulfstreamand he had a document signed by the president that ordered any government agency to give him whatever assets he asked for the president shook his head in disbelief but the gulfstream on which he flew to europe was a civilian aircraft leased by ooa montvale said he kept it at baltimorewashington where did the money for that come from mr president i wasnt in the loop i just know he had the airplane the president exhaled audibly and he asked well according to castillo shortly after he arrived in germany he was approached by two very senior svr officers whats that the president interrupted sluzhba vneshney razvedki the russian foreign intelligence service montvale explained the two officers were colonel dmitri berezovsky the svr rezident in berlin and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva the svr rezident in copenhagen they said they wanted to defect montvale paused and then went on i have to go off at a tangent here mr president at this time our cia station chief in vienna miss eleanor dillworth a highly respected longtime clandestine service officer and her staff had for some time and at considerable effort and expense been working on the defection of lieutenant colonel alekseeva and colonel berezovsky these arrangements had gone so far as the preparation of a safe house in maryland to house them while they were being debriefed so why did they contact castillo according to castillo they didnt trust miss dillworth castillo said when they came to him they offered to defect to him in exchange for two million dollars and immediate transportation to argentina on his plane this whole transaction apparently took place on a train headed for vienna so he made the deal shouldnt he have gone to the nearest cia officer either this miss dillworth or some other cia officer was he authorized to make a deal like that no sir he wasnt and yes sir he should have immediately contacted either me or someone in the cia incredible yes sir it is montvale agreed when this came to my attentionmiss dillworth reported to cia director powell that the defection of colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva had blown up in her face and that she suspected the presence in vienna of castillo had something to do with it she knew about castillo who he was by then mr president the existence of the ooa and the identity of its chief was not much of a secret within the intelligence community president clendennen nodded and motioned for montvale to go on dci powell reported the situation to me i immediately realized that something had to be done so you went to the president at that stage mr president colonel castillo was the presidents fairhaired boy i decided the best thing to do was go to general naylor naylor is a very good man the president said please dont tell me naylor was involved with the ooa only in the sense that castillo was a serving army officer and that general naylor had recommended castillo to the secretary of homeland security there was a legality involved too mr president so far as the army was concerned castillo was on temporary duty with the ooa from his regular assignment to the special operations command the special operations command is under general naylors central command the presidents face showed that he could easily have done without the clarification and he said impatiently well general naylor on being apprised of the situation agreed with me that the situation had to be brought under control by the situation you mean castillo yes sir and general naylor and i were agreed that our first priority was to spare the president any embarrassment that castillos actions might cause and the second priority was to get the two russians into the hands of the cia after some thought it was decided that the best thing to do with castilloand incidentally the best thing for castillo personallywas to have him retired honorably from the service a board of officers was quickly convened at walter reed after an examination of his record it was decided that he was suffering as a result of his extensive combat servicehis chest is covered with medals for valor in actionwith posttraumatic stress disorder that has rendered him permanently psychologically unfit for continued active service and therefore he should be medically retired the board awarded him a disability pension of twentyfive percent of his base pay general naylor appointed an officer a full colonel to present lieutenant colonel castillo with the findings of the board taking him with me i went to argentina in a gulfstream with the intention of bringing castillo home and to place the defected russians into the hands of the cia i took with me two members of my protection detail to guard the russians and frankly in case castillo proved obstreperous and did he prove to be obstreperous oh yes mr president obstreperous doesnt half cover it our ambassador juan manuel silvio told me that he hadnt heard castillo was in argentina and that he had heard nothing about colonel berezovsky or lieutenant colonel alekseeva the words were no sooner out of his mouthwe were having lunch in a restaurant around the corner from the embassywhen castillo walked in i asked him where the russians were he said at the moment he didnt know but if he did he wouldnt tell me because they had changed their minds about defecting letting that ride for the moment i explained his position to him and the colonel handed him the document he was to sign which would see him retired montvale drained his coffee cup put it beside the silver pot then went on castillo said i will sign that when the president tells me to and only then i told him that that was not an option and pointed to the secret service agents who were sitting at a nearby table i informed him that i was prepared to arrest him and hoped that wouldnt be necessary he pointed to some men sitting at a table across the restaurant and said they were officers of the gendarmeria nacional he added that at his signal they would approach anyone coming near him and demand their identification they would not permit his arrest he announced and if the people approaching him happened to be armed ambassador silvio would have to start thinking about how to get them out of jail since the secret service has no authority in argentina and is not permitted to go about armed castillo then said a restaurant was no place to discuss highly classified matters and suggested we move to the embassypresuming ambassador silvio would give his word that he would not be detained in the embassy and what did the ambassador do he offered us the use of his office and gave castillo his word that he would not be detained if he entered the embassy so we went to the embassy where castillo almost immediately told us what the russians had told him about a chemical warfare laboratoryslashfactory in the congo and that he and everybody in ooa believed the russians i told him that the cia had investigated those rumors and found them baseless he then said well the cia is wrong again we then called dci powell at langley and raised the question to him about a germ warfare laboratoryslashfactory in the congo dci powell repeated what i had told castillo the rumors were baselesswhat was there was a fish farm to which castillo replied that the cia was wrong again and that there was obviously no point in continuing the conversation i gave him one more chance to turn the russians over to me and to get on the gulfstream when he laughed at me i turned to the ambassador and said that it was obvious colonel castillo was mentally unstable and therefore the ambassador could not be held to his word that castillo could leave the embassy the ambassador replied that the last orders he had had from the president visavis colonel castillo were that he was to provide whatever assistance colonel castillo asked for and he didnt think that meant taking castillo into custody the ambassador then pushed the secure telephone to me and said words to the effect that i was welcome to call the president to see if he could be persuaded to change his orders but that if i made the call he would insist on telling the president that he could detect no sign of mental instability in castilloquite the oppositeand that in his personal opinion i and the cia were trying to throw castillo under the bus because they had somehow botched the defection of the russians and were trying to make castillo the fall guy for their own incompetence my god the president said as i could think of nothing else to say montvale said i then returned to washington lets call a spade a spade charles the president said as i could think of nothing else to say and i didnt want the president to know i had gone behind his back at least until i had time to come up with a credible reason i then returned to washington montvale flushed and realizing he had flushed was furious which made him flush even more deeply the cia does have a certain reputation for throwing people under the bus doesnt it charles especially those people who have embarrassed it montvale decided to wait until he was sure he had his emotions under control before going on silvio was right charles and you were wrong the president said the president gave him an order and he was obeying it disobeying it getting around it would have been damned near treason and you were wrong to ask him mr president i was trying to protect the president montvale said what you should have done was go to the president clendennen said its as simple as that youre the director of national intelligence charles not benjamin disraeli i realize now that i was wrong mr president montvale said the president made another impatient gesture for montvale to continue the next time i saw castillo was in philadelphia the president was giving a speech i didnt know castillo was coming the last word id had on him was that he was in las vegas in las vegas doing what i have no idea mr president im not even sure he was in las vegas anyway castillo showed up at the four seasons hotel the president gave him the opportunity to explain his incredible chemical warfare factory scenario the president obviously didnt believe it any more than anyone else did but castillo still had enough remaining clout with him for the president to turn to dci powell and direct him to send somebody to the congo castillo said ive already got some people in the congo mr president the president said jesus christ who and castillo told him colonel j porter hamilton and the president asked who the hell is colonel hamilton and powell who was really surprised blurted that colonel hamilton of the us army medical research institute at fort detrick was the ciasfor that matter the nationspreeminent expert on biological and chemical warfare are you telling me that castillo on his own authorityor no authorityactually sent an expert on biological warfare into the congo yes sir and not only that he put him on the phoneactually a secure radiotelephone linkwith the president right there in the four seasons how the hell did he manage to do that montvale said i really have no idea sir montvale thought but ill bet my last dime that lieutenant general bruce j mcnab of the special operations command was in that operation up to that ridiculous mustache of his still im not positive and certainly cant prove it so im not going to tell you i have been painfully cut off at the knees already today by you clendennen and once a day is more than enough and what did this expert say the phrase he used to describe what he found in the congo mr president was an abomination before god he said that if it got out of control it would be perhaps a thousand times more of a disaster than was chernobyl and urged the president to destroy the entire complex as soon as he could president clendennen didnt reply the mission was launched almost immediately mr president as you know and we were at the brink of a nuclear exchange president clendennen said pointedly that didnt happen sir i noticed the president said thickly sarcastic so what happened to castillo for rubbing the nose of the cia in chemicalbiological waste right after the president ordered the secretary of defense to immediately have an operation laid on to take out the fish farm he told castillo that ooa was dead had never existed and that what castillo was to do was make himself scarce until his retirement parade and after that to disappear from the face of the earth and castillo and the military personnel who had been assigned to ooa were retired at fort rucker alabama with appropriate panoply on january thirtyfirst there was a parade everyone was decorated castillo and a delta force warrant officer named leverette who took colonel hamilton into the congo and then got him out got their third distinguished service medals and then in compliance with their orders they got into the gulfstream and disappeared from the face of the earth you mean you dont know where any of these people are you dont even know where castillo is i know they went from fort rucker to louis armstrong international airport in new orleans and from there to cancun and from cancun i simply do not know mr president find out the next time i ask be prepared to answer yes mr president and where are the russians i dont know mr president i do know that the president told the dci that the attempt to cause them to defect was to be called off and that he was not even to look for them why the hell did he do that i would suggest mr president that it was because the information they provided about the congo was true the president considered that snorted and then said well charles that seems to be it doesnt it yes sir it would seem so thank you for coming to see me well be in touch three old ebbitt grill th street nw washington dc february no one is ever really surprised when a first or secondtier member of the washington press corps walks into the old ebbitt looking for someone for one thing the old ebbitt is just about equidistant between the white housea block away at pennsylvania avenueand the national press cluba block away at th street nw its right down the street from the hotel washington and maybe a threeminute walk from the willard hotel whose lobby added the term lobbyist to the politicaljournalistic lexicon furthermore the old ebbitts service menu ambiance and stock of intoxicants was superb the one thing on which all observers of the press corps agreed was that nothing appeals more to the gentlemen and ladies of the fourth estate than say a shrimp cocktail and a nice new york strip steak plus a stiff drink served promptly onto a table covered with crisp linen in a charming environment this is especially true if the journalist can reasonably expect that someone elseone of those trolling for a favorable relationship with the press lobbyists from the willard for examplewould happily reach for the check roscoe j dantona tall starting to get a little plump thirtyeightyearold who was employed by the washington timespostwas depending on to whom one might talk either near the bottom of the list of firsttier journalists or at the very top of the second tier roscoe walked into the old ebbitt nodded at the ever affable tony the maitre d at his stand and walked on to the bar along the wall behind tony he continued slowly down ittoward the rearand had gone perhaps halfway when he spotted the people he had agreed to meet they were two women and they were sitting at a banquette the one he had talked to said that he would have no trouble spotting them look for two thirtyish blondes at one of the banquettes at the end of the bar the description roscoe decided was not entirely accurate while both were bleached blonde one of them was far closer to fiftyish than thirtyish and the younger one was on the cusp of fortyish but there being no other banquette holding two blondes roscoe walked to their table roscoe began excuse me sit down mr danton the older of the two immediately said the younger one patted the red leather next to her roscoe danton sat down whatever this is i dont have much time he announced theres a press conference at fourfifteen this wont take long the older one said and i really think it will be worth your time a waiter appeared the older woman signaled the waiter to bring what she and her companion were drinking and then asked mr danton what is that youre having a bombay martini no vegetables she said that should give me courage to face the mob he said smiled at the waiter and told him the same for me please the older woman waited until the waiter had left and then reached to the fluffy lace collar at her neck she unbuttoned two buttons put her hand inside and withdrew a plastic card it was attached with an alligator clip to what looked like a dogtag chain she pressed the clip removed the card more or less concealed it in her hand and laid it flat on the tablecloth make sure the waiter doesnt see that please she said as she withdrew her hand danton held his hand to at least partially conceal the card and took a good look at it the card bore the womans photograph the seal of the central intelligence agency a number some stripes of various colors and her name eleanor dillworth it clearly was an employee identification card danton had enough experience at the cia complex just across the potomac river in langley virginia to know that while it was not one of the very coveted any areaany time cards worn by very senior cia officers with as much elan as a fourstar general wears his stars in the pentagon this one identified someone fairly high up in the hierarchy he met miss dillworths eyes and slid the card back across the table the younger blonde took a nearly identical card from her purse and laid it before danton it said her name was patricia davies wilson i told them i had lost that when i was fired mrs wilson said and kept it as a souvenir danton met her eyes too but said nothing she took the card back and put it in her purse whats this all about he finally asked when his silence didnt elicit the response it was supposed to miss dillworth held up her finger as a signal to wait the waiter delivered three bombay sapphire gin martinis no vegetables that was quick wasnt it eleanor dillworth asked thats why i like to come here patricia davies wilson said the three took an appreciative sip of their cocktails i was asking whats this all about danton said disgruntled employees mr danton patricia davies wilson said who as you know sometimes become whistleblowers eleanor dillworth said and then asked interested that would depend on what or on whom youre thinking of blowing the whistle danton replied i was about to say the agency patricia davies wilson said but it goes beyond the agency where does it go beyond the agency danton asked among other places to the oval office in that case im fascinated danton said what have you got have you ever heard of an intelligence officerslashspecial operator by the name of carlos castillo eleanor dillworth asked danton shook his head how about the office of organizational analysis he shook his head and then asked in the cia dillworth shook her head in the office of our late and not especially grievedfor president she said and apparently to be kept alive in the administration of our new and nottoobright chief executive but thats presuming montvale has told him what does this organization do what has it done in the past if we told you mr danton i dont think you would believe us eleanor dillworth said danton sipped his martini and thought probably not disgruntled employee whistleblowers almost invariably tell wild tales with little or no basis in fact he said i dont think i understand youre going to have to learn this yourself patricia wilson said well point you in the right direction but youll have to do the digging that way youll believe it how do i know you know what youre talking about danton challenged before i was recalled i was the cias station chief in vienna dillworth said ive been inwas inthe clandestine service for twentythree years before that bastard got me fired patricia wilson added i was the agencys regional director for southwest africa everything from nigeria to south africa including the congo you will recall the congo is where world war three was nearly started last month that bastard is presumably this mr costillo castillo with an a she said and lieutenant colonel not mister hes in the army okay danton said point me you said you were going to the fourfifteen white house press conference dillworth said ask porky dont take no for an answer john david jack parker the white house spokesman was sometimes unkindly referred tothe fortytwoyearold vermont native was a little on the far side of pleasingly plumpas porky parker and sometimes when his responses to questions tested the limits of credulity some members of the fourth estate had been known to make oinkoink sounds from the back of the white house press room okay ill do it how do i get in touch with you if i decide this goes any further eleanor dillworth slid a small sheet of notebook paper across the table if theres no answer say youre joe smith and leave a number four the press room the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february well thats it fellows jack parker said we agreed that these would last one hour and thats what the clock says ignoring muted oinkoink sounds from the back of the room he left the podium and headed for the door where he was intercepted by roscoe j danton of the washington timespost aw come on roscoe this onehour business was as much your idea as anybody elses well screw you danton said loud enough for other members of the fourth estate also bent on intercepting porky to hear and at the same time asking with a pointed finger and a raised eyebrow if he could go to parkers office as soon as the area emptied parker nodded just barely perceptibly danton went out onto the driveway and smoked a cigarette smoking was prohibited in the white house the rule strictly enforced when anyone was watching and then he went back into the white house what do you need roscoe parker asked tell me about the office of organizational analysis and colonel carlos costello castillo parker thought shrugged and said i draw a blank can you check sure in connection with what i have some almost certainly unreliable information that he and the office of organizational analysis were involved in almost starting world war three one hears a lot of rumors like that about all kinds of people doesnt one parker said mockingly there was one going around that the lambda legal foundation were the ones behind it somebody told them they stone gays in the congo shame on you danton said check it for me will you parker nodded thanks five the city room the washington timespost th street nw washington dc february roscoe dantons office was a small and cluttered glasswalled cubicle off the large room housing the city desk two small exterior windows offered a clear view of a solid brick wall he had wondered for years what was behind it his email had just offered him viagra at a discount and a guaranteed penis enlargement concoction he was wondering whether he could get away with sending either or both offers to the executive editor without getting caught when another email arrived from white house press office parkerwhpogov to roscoe j danton rjdantonwashtimespostorg sent feb subject costellocastillo roscoe after you left i had a memory tinkle about costellocastillo and the office of organizational analysis so i really triedwith almost no successto check it out i found a phone number for an ooa in the department of homeland security with an office in the dhs compound in the nebraska avenue complex when i called it i got a recorded message saying that it had been closed so i called dhs and they told me ooa had been closed they didnt know when when i asked what it had done they helpfully told me my guess was as good as theirs but it probably had something to do with analyzing operations at this point i suspected that you had been down this route yourself before you dumped it on me so i called the pentagon you would be astonished at the number of lieutenant colonels named castillo and costello there arewere in the army there is a retired lt col carlos castillo and hes interesting but i dont think hes the man youre looking for this one is a west pointer to which institution he gained entrance because his father a nineteenyearold warrant officer helicopter pilot posthumously received the medal of honor in vietnam the son followed in his fathers footsteps and before he had been out of wp a year had won the distinguished flying cross flying an apache in the first desert war he went from that to flying in the special operations aviation regiment most recently in afghanistan he returned from there under interesting circumstances first he had acquired more medals for valor than rambo but was also a little over the edge specifically it was alleged that he either had taken against orders or stolen a black hawk to undertake a nearly suicidal mission to rescue a pal of his who had been shot down nearly suicidal because he got away with it faced with the choice of giving him another medal or courtmartialing him the army instead sent him home for psychiatric evaluation the shrinks at walter reed determined that as a result of all his combat service he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder to the point where he would never be psychologically stable enough to return to active service they medically retired him his retirement checks are sent to doublebarc ranch midland texas i suggest this guy was unlikely to have tried to start world war iii from the psychiatric ward at walter reed sorry roscoe this was the best i could do if you get to the bottom of this please let me know my curiosity is now aroused best jack the message gave danton a number of things to think about he would not have been surprised to receive a onelinersorry nothing jackand this one meant that porky had spent a lot of time of which he understandably had little coming up with this answer possibility one his curiosity had been piqued and there had been time to do what he said he had done possible but unlikely possibility two this was a carefully thoughtout ploy to get danton off the track of a story which might if it came out embarrass the president the white house the department of state or the pentagon or all of the above possible but unlikely there was a hell of a risk as porky damned well knew in intentionally misleading a the washington timespost andor b roscoe danton personally a short sorry nothing jack email maybe but not a long message like this one including all the details of this castillo characters military service so what do i do forget it no i smell something here the thing to do is find this castillo character and talk to him see if he has any idea why meryl streep and the other disgruntled whistleblower whose thigh accidentally pressed against mine twice in the old ebbitt are saying all these terrible things about him but only after i talk to good ol meryl and her pal to see what else i can get out of them he tapped keys on his laptop opened a new folder named it castillo and downloaded porkys email into it then he found the piece of paper on which good ol meryl had given him her phone number he put this into the castillo folder and entered it into his blackberry then he pushed the call key one la casa en el bosque san carlos de bariloche patagonia rio negro province argentina february i believe in a democratic approach when having a meeting like this lieutenant colonel carlos g castillo usa retired announced and the way that will work is that i will tell you whats going to happen and then everybody says yes sir it was summer in argentina and castillo a wellmuscled sixfoottwo onehundredninetypound blueeyed thirtysixyearold with a full head of thick light brown hair was wearing tennis whites there were groans from some of those gathered around an enormous circular table in the center of a huge hall it could have been a movie set for a motion picture about king arthur and the knights of the round table when this thought had occurred to sandra britton phd dr britton had thought castillo could play sir lancelot two people one of each gender gave castillo the finger we told quote unquote those people in las vegas that we would give them an answer in three weeks castillo said three weeks is tomorrow go ahead ace lets get it over with edgar delchamps said he was a nondescript man in his late fifties the oldest man in the room he was wearing slacks with the cuffs rolled up and a dress shirt with the collar open i would like to suggest that we appoint a chairman for this and a secretary and i recommend mr yung for that castillo said cut the crap ace delchamps said everyone knows youre calling the shots but if youre going to make twogun something i more or less respectfully suggest you make him secretarytreasurer men who have spent more than three decades in the clandestine service of the central intelligence agency tend not to be impressed with army officers who had yet to make it even to west point while they themselves were matching wits with the kgb in berlin and vienna twogun youre the secretarytreasurer castillo said to david william yung jr yung was a roundfaced fivefooteight thirtysixyearold hundredfiftypound chineseamerican whose family had immigrated to the united states in the s in addition to a law degree he held a masters degree in business administration from the university of pennsylvania and was fluent in four languages none of them asian before he had become a member of the ooa he had been an fbi agent with a nearly legendary reputation for being able to trace the path of money around the world no matter how often it had been laundered before his association with ooa yung had neverexcept at the quantico fbi base pistol rangetaken his service pistol from its holster within days of being drafted into the ooa he had been in a gun battle and killed his first man but the twogun appellation had nothing to do with that that had come after delchamps who was not authorized at the time to be in possession of a firearm in argentina had yung whose diplomatic status at the time made him immune to argentine law smuggle his pistol across the border yung thus had two guns and was thereafter twogun twogun yung signified his acceptance of his appointment by raising his balled fist thumbs up and then opening up his laptop computer first things first mr secretarytreasurer castillo said give us a thumbnail picture of the assets of the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund twogun looked at his computer screen this is all ballpark you understand he said you want the history please castillo said we started out with those sixteen million in bearer bonds from shangrila yung said shangrila was not the mythical kingdom but rather estancia shangrila in tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay when castillo had led an ad hoc team of special operators there to entice dr jeanpaul lorimer to allow himself to be repatriated lorimer was shot to death by mercenaries seeking to recover from him money he had stolen from the iraqi oilforfood scam for which he had been the bagman in charge of paying off whomever had to be paid off his safe had contained sixteen million dollars worth of what were in effect bearer bonds which castillo had taken with him to the us when this was reported to the thenpresident of the united states the chief executive managed to convey the impressionwithout coming right out in so many wordsthat justice would be well served if the bearer bonds were used to fund the ooa the following day the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund came into being into which charley dipped to the tune of seven and a half million to buy the gulfstream yung went on call that eight million by the time we fixed everything and rented the hangar at baltimorewashington et cetera that left eight into which charley dipped for another two point five million to buy the safe house in alexandria that left five point five million the house in alexandria was used to house members of the office of organizational analysis while they were in the washington area and also to conduct business of a nature that might have raised eyebrows had it been conducted in the ooas official offices in the department of homeland security compound in the nebraska avenue complex in the district of columbia to which twogun went on mr philip j kenyon the third of midland texas contributed fortysix point two million in exchange for his stay out of jail card mr kenyon had mistakenly believed his in illicit profits from his participation in the iraqi oilforfood scam were safe from prying eyes in a bank in the cayman islands he erred the deal he struck to keep himself out of federal prison for the rest of his natural life was to cooperate fully with the investigation and to transfer the money from his bank account in the cayman islands to the account of the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund in the riggs national bank in washington dc there have been some other expenses roughly totaling two million yung continued what we have left is about fifty point five million give or take a couple of hundred thousand that dont add up twogun edgar delchamps challenged there shouldnt be that much according to your figures weve got two point something million more than we should have there has been some income from our investments twogun said you didnt think i was going to leave all that money in our bankour banks plural there are sevenjust drawing interest did you do we want to start counting nickels and dimes colonel castillo asked or can we get to that later nickels and dimes sandra britton a slim tall sharpfeatured blackskinned woman parroted incredulously we really are the other side of alices looking glass arent we possibly proving that opposites attract dr britton who had been a philologist on the faculty of philadelphias temple university was married to john m britton formerly of the united states secret service and before that a detective working undercover in the counterterrorism bureau of the philadelphia police department i was going to suggest sandra charley castillo said that we now turn to the question before us questions before us one do we just split all that money between us and go home how the hell can jack and i go home sandra interrupted not only can i not face my peers at temple after they learned that i was hauled off by the secret servicewith sirens screamingbut the aals turned our little house by the side of the road into the ok corral dr britton was making reference to an assassination attempt made on her and her husband during which their home and nearly new mazda convertible were riddled by fire from kalashnikov automatic assault weapons in the hands of nativeborn africanamericans who considered themselves converts to islam and to whom dr britton referred perhaps politically incorrectly as aals which stood for africanamerican lunatics if i may continue doctor colonel castillo asked dr britton made a gesture with her left hand raising it balled with the center finger extended vertically i rephrase castillo said do we just split that money between us and go our separate ways or do we stay together within what used to be the ooa and would now need a new name call the question anthony tony j santini said formally santini a somewhat swarthy balding short heavyset man in his forties until recently had been listed in the telephone book of the us embassy in buenos aires as an assistant financial attache he had been in fact a secret service agent dispatched to buenos aires to as he put it look for funny money before that he had been a member of the vice presidential protection detail he had been relieved of that assignment when he fell off the icecovered running board of the vicepresidential limousine he had been recruited for the ooa shortly after it had been established to locate and eliminate the parties responsible for the murder of j winslow masterson second the motion susanna sieno said she was a trim palefreckledskin redhead in a white blouse and blue jeans she looked like she and the man sitting beside herher husband paulshould be in a television commercial where the handsome young husband comes home from the office and chastely kisses his charming young bride after she shows how easy it had been for her to polish their kitchen floor with miracle glow actually between the sienos they had more than four decades in the clandestine service of the ciapaul having served twentytwo years and susanna just over twentywhich had been more than enough for the both of them to have elected to retire which they had done ten days before the motion having been made and seconded castillo said mockformally the chair calls the question do we disband and split the money all in favor raise your hand and hold it up until twogun counts okay castillo said a moment later now those opposed raise your hands yung again looked around the table i make it unanimously opposed yung said ooa lives ooas dead castillo said the question now is what do we do with the corpse delchamps said sweaty dmitriexcuse me tomand alfredo didnt vote i didnt think i had the right alfredo munz a stocky blond man in his forties said munz at the time of mastersons kidnapping had been an argentine army colonel in command of side an organization combining the argentine versions of the fbi and cia embarrassed by the incident and needing a scapegoat the interior ministry had as a disgusted charley castillo had put it thrown munz under the bus munz had been relieved of his command of side and forced to retire castillo had immediately put him on the ooa payroll dont be silly castillo said you took a bullet for us youre as much a part of us as anyone else munz had been wounded during the estancia shangrila operation hear hear yung said i didnt say the argentine kraut didnt have every right to vote delchamps said i simply stated that he sweaty and tom didnt vote if i have a vote sweaty said i will vote however my carlos votes sweaty also in tennis whites sat next to castillo she was a tall darkredhaired stunningly beautiful woman who had been christened svetlana once associated with this group of americans svetlana had quickly morphed to svet then to sweaty susannas eyebrows rose in contempt or perhaps contemptuous disbelief in her long professional career she had known many intelligence officers and just about the best one she had ever encountered was castillo the most incredibly stupid thing any spook had ever done was become genuinely emotionally involved with an enemy intelligence officer within twentyfour hours of lieutenant colonel c g castillo having laid eyes on lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva of the sluzhba vneshney razvedkithe svr the russian service for the protection of the constitutional system renamed from kgbon a viennabound railroad train in germany she had walked out of his bedroom in a safe house outside buenos aires wearing his bathrobe and a smug smile and calling him my carlos dr britton smiled fondly at sweaty when she referred to castillo now as my carlos she thought it was sweet sandra britton knew there really was such a thing as love at first sight she had married her husband two weeks after she had met him and now could not imagine life without him their meeting had occurred shortly after midnight eight years before on north broad street in philly when jack had appeared out of nowhere to foil a miscreant bent on relieving her of her purse watch jewelryand very possibly her virtue in the process the miscreant had suffered a broken arm a dislocated shoulder testicular trauma and three lost teeth britton had then firmly attached the miscreant to a fire hydrant with plastic handcuffs loaded the nearly hysterical dr britton in her car and set off to find a pay telephone there were not many working pay telephones in that section of philadelphia at that hour and to call the police it had been necessary to go to dr brittons apartment after britton had called police emergency to report that the victim of an assault by unknown parties could be found at north broad and cecil b moore avenue hugging a fire hydrant one thing had led to another sandra made jack breakfast the next morning and they were married two weeks later i dont think i have a vote tom barlow said but if i do ill go along with however sweatys carlos votes barlow a trim man of about castillos age and build whose hair was nearly blond and who bore a familial resemblance to sweatyhe was in fact her brotheruntil very recently had been colonel dmitri berezovsky the svr rezident in berlin castillo and sweaty gave barlow the finger i would say the motion has been defeated yung said i didnt see any hands and i have the proxies of jake pegleg the gunnery sergeant sparky and miller they all like the idea of keeping ooa going jake and sparky were respectively colonel jacob s torine usaf retired and former captain richard sparkman usaf torine had been in on ooa since the beginning when he had flown a globemaster to argentina to bring home the body of jack the stack masterson and his family torine had been quietly retired with all the other military members of ooa who had more than twenty years service when ooa had shut down sparkman who on active duty had served under torine on a number of black missions of the air force special operations command had been flying washington political vips around in a gulfstream and hating it when he heard a of ooa and b that colonel torine was involved he made his way through the maze designed to keep ooa hidden in the bushes found torine and volunteered to do whatever was asked in whatever torine was involved he had been accepted as much for having gotten through the maze as for being able to fill the neardesperate need ooa had for another pilot who a knew how to keep his mouth shut and b had a lot of gulfstream time as pilot in command when ooa was shut down sparky didnt have the option of retiring because he didnt have enough time in the service he also realized that he really couldnt go back to the air force after having been tainted by his association with ooa he knew the rest of his career in the air force would have been something along the lines of assistant procurement officer handheld fireextinguishing devices he had resigned there was an unspoken agreement that sparky would go on the payroll as a gulfstream pilot details to be worked out later presuming everybody was still out of jail gunnery sergeant lester bradley was in a similar situation another gunny one in charge of the marine guard detachment at the american embassy in buenos aires had sent thencorporal lester bradleya slight fivefootthree twentyyearold marine who could be spared most easily from more important dutiesto drive an embassy gmc yukon xl carrying two barrels of aviation fuel across the border to uruguay thirtysix hours later the yukon had been torched with a thermite grenade bradley who had been left to watch the yukon had taken outwith headshots firing offhand from a hundred meterstwo mercenaries who had just killed jeanpaul lorimer phd and then started shooting their kalashnikovs at castillo inasmuch as castillo thought it would be unwise to return corporal bradley to his embassy dutieswhere his gunnery sergeant would naturally be curious to learn under what circumstances the yukon had been torchedhe was impressed into the ooa on the spot the day that ooa ceased to exist the president of the united states had asked castillo is there anything else i can do for you before you and your people start vanishing from the face of the earth castillo told him there were three things first was that corporal bradley be promoted to gunnery sergeant before being honorably discharged for the good of the service the second thing castillo had asked of the president was that colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva be taken off the interpol warrants outstanding for them when they had disappeared from their posts in berlin and copenhagen with the obvious intention of defecting the russian government had said their motive had been to escape arrest and punishment for embezzlement the third thing castillo asked was that he and everybody connected with him and ooa be taken off the fbis locate but do not detain list the president had granted all three requests you have my word the first thing castillo thought when he heard that the president had dropped dead was that his word had died with him the chances that president clendennenespecially with director of national intelligence montvale whispering in his earwould honor his predecessors promises ranged from zero to zilch the retirements of major h richard miller jr avn usa who had been the ooas chief of staff and first lieutenant edmund pegleg lorimer mi usa had posed no problem although neither had twenty years of service miller a united states military academy classmate of castillos had suffered grievous damage to his leg when his helicopter had been shot down in afghanistan lorimer had lost a leg to an improvised explosive device in the same country they would receive pensions for the rest of their lives as castillo amp co had begun to fulfill their part of the agreement with potusdisappearing from the face of the earththey had made their way to las vegas where they were the guests of aloysius francis caseypresident chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the afc corporation castillo had first met casey when castillo had been a second lieutenant freshly returned from the first desert war working as aidedecamp to justpromoted brigadier general bruce j mcnab at fort bragg when casey showed up there casey announced that he had been the communications sergeant on a special forces ateam in the vietnam war and further told mcnab and his aidedecamp that he had done well after being discharged not only had casey earned a phd from the massachusetts institute of technology but he had started upand still owned more than ninety percent ofthe afc corporation which had become the worlds leading developer and manufacturer of data transmission and encryption systems aloysius casey second lieutenant castillo had immediately seen was not troubled with excessive modesty casey said that he attributed his great success to special forcesspecifically what he had learned about selfreliance and that there was no such thing as impossible and he said he had decided it was payback time he was prepared to furnish delta force free of charge with his stateoftheart communications and encryption equipment its three four years ahead of anything anybody else has casey had announced mcnab had sent castillo with casey to las vegason afcs learjetthat same day to select what afc equipment delta force could use immediately and to brainstorm with casey and his senior engineers on what advanced commo equipment delta could use if somebody waved a magic wand and created it for them the latter devices had begun to arrive at delta forces stockade at fort bragg about two months later when ooa had been set up castillo had naturally turned to caseywho now called him charley rather than as he had at first the boy wonderfor communications and cryptographic equipment and casey had happily produced it when charley had bought the gulfstream casey had seemed a little annoyed that charley had asked if casey would equip it with the same equipment charley at the time had thought that maybe he had squeezed the golden goose a little too hard and vowed he would not be so greedy the next time when they got the gulfstream back from the afc hangar at las vegass mccarran international airport it had not only the latest communications and encryption equipment installed but an entirely new avionics configuration i figured you needed it more than boeing casey said his annoyance with charley was because castillo had been reluctant to ask for his support for christs sake charley you should have known better casey said the gulfstream was again in las vegas not for the installation of equipment but to get it out of sight until a decision could be made about what to do with it charley had flown the gulfstream to las vegas the same day he had received his last order from the president you will go someplace where no one can find you and you will not surface until your retirement parade and after your retirement i hope that you will fall off the face of the earth and no one will ever see you or hear from you again understood charley had said yes sir and walked out of the room after a quick stop at baltimorewashington international to pick up major dick miller he had flown to las vegas with newly promoted verbal order potus and about to be discharged gunnery sergeant lester bradley and mr and mrs jack britton immediately on arrival castillo had learned that providing equipment to special operations people free of charge had not been aloysius caseys only contribution to the national security of the nation limousines met them at mccarran and drove them to the venetian hotel and casino where they were shown to a private elevator which carried them to a duplex penthouse at the foot of a curving glassstepped staircase which led to the lower floor castillo saw dmitri berezovskynow equipped with a bona fide uruguayan passport in the name of tom barlowsergeant major jack davidson aloysius francis casey and about a halfdozen men castillo could not remember having seen before sitting on a circular couch that appeared to be upholstered with gold lame casey waved him down max castillos hundredpluspound bouvier des flandres immediately accepted the invitation flew down the stairs four at a time barked hello at the people he knew and then began to help himself from one of the trays of hors doeuvres not understanding what was going on castillo had gone down the stairs slowly as he did he realized that he did in fact recognize a few of the men one of them was a legendary character who owned fourmaybe fiveof the more glitzy las vegas hotels but not this one came a flash from castillos memory bank another was a wellknown perhaps even famous investment banker and another had made an enormous fortune in data processing castillo had remembered him because he was a naval academy graduate everybody pay attention casey had said laughing you dont often get a chance to see charley with a baffled look on his face okay aloysius you have pulled my chain what the hell is going on around here colonel the naval academy graduate said with a distinctive southern accent what we are is a group of people who realize there are a number of things that the intelligence community doesnt do well doesnt want to do or for one reason or another cant do we try to help and weve got the assetsnot only cashto do so weve been doing this for some time and were all agreed that now that you and your ooa associates arehow do i put thisno longer gainfully employed how did you hear about that castillo interrupted the naval academy graduate ignored the question you might want to come work for us youve got the wrong guy castillo said simply the intel community hates me and thats a nice way of describing it well telling the dci that his agency is a few very good people trying to stay afloat in a sea of leftwing bureaucrats may not have been the best way to charm the director even if i happen to know he agrees with you colonel the man who owned the glitzy hotels said this is our proposal in a few words you keep your people together keep them doing what they do so well and on our side well decide how to get the information to where it will do the most good and in a manner that will not rub the nose of the intelligence community in their own incompetence he paused and the pays pretty good right off the top of my head no castillo said my orders from the president are to go someplace where no one can find you the investment banker interrupted him until your retirement parade and after that fall off the face of the earth something like that how could hetheypossibly know about that nobody had been in that room except the secretaries of state and defense and the director of the ciathe president had told montvale to take a walk until he got his temper under control does that mean these people have an in with any of them or with all of them of course it does jesus h christ i think we would have all been disappointed colonel the naval academy graduate said if right off the top of your head you had jumped at the proposition so how about this think it over talk to the others in the meantime stay hereno one can find you here i can personally guarantee thatuntil your retirement parade and then after you fall off the face of the earth call aloysius from wherever that finds you and tell him what youve all decided in compliance with his orders castillo had stayed out of sight at the venetianit could not be called a hardship sweaty had been with him and there is no finer room service in the world than that offered by the venetianuntil very early in the morning of his retirement parade then he and dick miller had flown sergeant major jack davidson and cwo colin leverette in the gulfstream to fort rucker after some initial difficulty they had been given permission to land they had changed into class a uniforms in the plane there was some discussion among them about the wisdom under the circumstances of removing from their uniforms those items of insignia and qualification which suggested they had some connection with special operations but that had been resolved by mr leverette fuck em uncle remus said this is the last time were going to wear the suit lets wear it all there was a sea of red general officers personal flags on the reviewing stand the fourstar flag of general allan naylor the central command commander stood in the center of them beside the threestar flag of lieutenant general bruce j mcnab who commanded the special operations command there were too many two and onestar flags to be counted among the twostar flags were those of dicks father major general richard h miller sr retired and major general harold f wilson retired general wilson as a young officer during the vietnam war had been the copilot of wojg jorge alejandro castilloright up until castillo charleys father had booted wilson out of the huey that would be shot down by enemy fire ending castillos life and finding him posthumously awarded the medal of honor the band played as it marched onto the parade ground before post headquarters and those persons to be decorated marched front and center and were decorated and the retirement orders were read and the band played again and the troops passed in review and that was it they had been retired from the army the four of them got into a waiting dodge caravan and were driven back to cairns field then as castillo was doing the walkaround and as miller was returning from filing their flight plan two army chevrolet sedans and two army dodge caravans drove onto the tarmac in front of base operations general allan naylor got out of one of the sedans and lieutenant general mcnab got out of the other major general retired miller got out of one of the caravans and major general retired wilson and his grandson randolph richardson iii got out of the other it was an awkward moment all around i wanted to say goodbye and good luck general naylor said there was a chorus of thank you sir well i suppose if you castrate too many bulls general mcnab said youre going to get gored sooner or later dont let the doorknob hit you in the ass on your way out general naylor looked askance at general mcnab general miller took his son to one side for a private word general wilson took his grandson and castillo to one side for a private word general wilson had known all along that castillo was the natural father of his grandson the boy and castillo had learned of their real relationship only recently sir randolph richardson iii asked where are you going randy i just dont know am i ever going to see you again it took castillo a moment to get rid of the lump in his throat absolutely positively and soon he managed to say randy put out his hand castillo shook it fuck it he embraced his son felt his son hug him back and then let him go he wanted to say something else but this time the lump in his throat wouldnt go away your mothers waiting lunch for us randy general wilson said and led the boy back toward the caravan gulfstream broke ground about four minutes later it flew to louis armstrong international airport in new orleans where it took on fuel and went through customs and immigration procedures and then flew to the seaside resort city of cancun on mexicos yucatan peninsula colonel jake torine and captain dick sparkman who had been retired that day from the usaf with considerably less panoplyeach had received a fedex package containing their retirement orders and their distinguished service medalswere already there gunnery sergeant lester bradley usmc had received a similar package from the department of the navy the gulfstream refueled torine and sparkman took off for las vegas where the plane came to be parked in one of the afc hangars until a decision about its future could be reached at the moment gulfstream was leased dry from gossinger consultants a wholly owned subsidiary of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh of fulda germany which had bought the aircraft from lopez fruit and vegetables mexico a wholly owned subsidiary of castillo agriculture inc of san antonio texas whose president and chief executive officer was fernando lopez and whose corporate officers included one carlos castillo that status would have to be changed twogun yung had announced no matter what decision was reached about the offer of those people in las vegas at cancun airport international several hours later cwo leverette retired and sergeant major davidson retired boarded a mexicana flight to mexico city there leverette now traveling on a honduran passport under another name would board a varig flight to sao paulo brazil and davidson traveling under his own name on an israeli passport would board a mexicana flight bound for lima peru castillo had watched the takeoff of the mexicana flight to mexico city from the tarmac on the cargo side of the cancun airfield then he had climbed into a peruaire cargo plane the had flown up that morning from santiago chile with a mixed cargo of chilean seafood and argentine beef citrus fruits and vegetables the food was destined for cancun provisions ltda and would ultimately end in the kitchen of the grand cozumel beach and golf resort and in the galleys of cruise ships which called at cancun peruairecargo cancun provisions ltda the grand cozumel beach and golf resort and at least four of the cruise ships were ownedthrough a maze of dummy corporations genuine corporations and other entities at least twice as obfuscatory as the ownership of gulfstream by a man named aleksandr pevsner in the late union of soviet socialist republics pevsner had been simultaneously a colonel in the soviet air force and a colonel in the kgb responsible for the security of aeroflot worldwide when the kgb was faced with the problem of concealing its wealth hundreds of billions of dollarsfrom the people now running russia who were likely to put it in the state treasury they decided that the wealthmuch of it in gold and platinumhad to be hidden outside russia and who better to do this than colonel aleksandr pevsner he knew peoplemany of them bankersall over the world pevsner resigned from the air force bought several exsoviet air force cargo aircraft at distress prices and soon began a profitable business flying mercedes automobiles and other luxury goods into moscow the kgbs gold platinum precious stones and sometimes cashoften contained in fuel barrelsleft moscow on the flights out for the latter service pevsner had been paid a commission of usually ten percent of the value his relationship with the kgbits first chief directorate now the svrhad soured over time as the svr had regained power under vladimir putin the new svr had decided that if pevsner were eliminated he could not tell anyone where their money had gone and they might even get back some of the commissions they had paid him there had been a number of deaths almost entirely of svr agents and pevsner was now living with his wife and daughter in an enormous mansion on a severalthousandhectare estate in the foothills of the andes mountains protected by a security force castillo called pevsners private army the mansionwhich had been built during world war iibore a remarkable similarity to carinhall reichsmarschall hermann gorings estate in germany not really joking pevsner and castillo said it had probably been built by either admirers of the number two nazior even for goringwhen the nazi leadership was planning to keep nazism alive under the operation phoenix program by fleeing to argentina castillo had met pevsnermore accurately pevsner had arranged to meet castillowhen castillo thought pevsner was a likely suspect in the disappearance of the from aeroporto internacional quatro de fevereiro in luanda angola pevsner had learned of castillos suspicions from his chief of security a former fbi agent castillo had been snatched from the mens room of the hotel sacher in vienna and taken to the vienna woods at gunpoint on meeting castillo pevsner decided the wisest path for him to follow was to help castillo find the missing aircraft he really didnt like to kill people unless it was absolutely necessaryincredibly he was a devout christianand killing castillo would certainly draw more american attention to him and his business enterprises the missing airplane was found with his help and there was no sudden burst of activity by the americans looking into pevsner and his affairs but the real reason pevsner was able to feel he had really made the right decision not to kill castillo came when pevsner was betrayed by the former fbi agent who set up an assassination ambush in the basement garage of the sheraton pilar hotel outside buenos aires the team of svr assassins found themselves facing not only janos pevsners massive hungarian bodyguard but a number of members of the ooa who had learned what was about to happen in the brief if ferocious firefight which ensued janos was seriously wounded and all four of the svr wouldbe assassins had been killed one of the russians had been put down by corporal lester bradley usmc with a headshot at thirty meters distance from lesters model a acp pistol that had of course made aleksandr pevsner think of charley castillo as a friend but there had been another unexpected development shortly after they had been struck with cupids arrow sweaty had told her carlos that the reason they had wanted to come to argentina was because she and her brother had a relative living there they were cousins his mother and the mother of sweaty and tom were sisters they didnt know where he was and she hoped her carlos would help her find him his name sweaty had said was aleksandr pevsner behind the flight deck of the peruairecargo there was a small passenger area equipped with a table a galley and six seats which could be converted to beds at the press of a switch castillo sat down beside sweaty and a stewardess showed him a bottle of argentine champagne her eyes asking if it met his pleasure he nodded and she poured champagne for him and sweaty and for tom barlow and twogun randy came to my retirement parade castillo told sweaty he asked if he was ever going to see me again oh my poor carlos sweaty said and took his hand and kissed it max who seemed to understand his master was unhappy put his paws on castillos shoulders and licked his face the peruairecargo flew nonstop from cancun to santiago chile for some reason the chilean immigration and customs officials who had a reputation for meeting all incoming aircraft before the doors were open were not on the tarmac castillo sweaty tom twogun and max were thus able to walk directly and without attracting any attention from the to a learjet which was conveniently parked next to where the had stopped the learjet began to taxi the instant the door had closed a short time later it landed at the san carlos de bariloche airport in argentina just the other side of the andes mountains coincidentally the argentine immigration and customs authorities like their brothers in santiago seemed not to have noticed the arrival of the learjet no one saw its passengers load into a mercedes sedan and led and trailed by mercedes suvs drive off fortyfive minutes later charley was standing on the dock on the edge of the casa en el bosque property and looking out across lake nahuel huapi what are you thinking my darling sweaty asked touching his cheek that i just have in compliance with orders dropped off the face of the earth okay castillo said the motion to split the money and run having failed were still in business but as what were going to have to form a corporation twogun said what are we going to call the corporation castillo pursued do what aloysius did use the initials sergeant major retired davidson suggested the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund becomes the lcbf corporation second the motion cwo colin leverette retired said and then when everybody agrees i can go fishing he and davidson had made their way to bariloche the day before their passports had not attracted any unwelcome attention any objections castillo asked and then a moment later said hearing none the motion carries its now the lcbf corporation or will be when twogun sets it up which brings us to twogun uhoh twogun said i suggest we appoint twogun by any title he chooses to assume and at a suitable wage as our money and legal guy i think we should hire agnes to keep running administration and keep dianne and harold on at the house in alexandria mrs agnes forbison a very senior civil servant gs the highest pay grade had been one of the first members of ooa as its chief of administration dianne and harold sanders were both retired special operators they had been thinking of opening a bedandbreakfast when uncle remus leverette told them castillo needed someone to run a safe house just outside washington they had jumped at the opportunity and castillo had jumped at the opportunity to have them hed been around the block with harold on several occasions and dianne in addition to being an absolutely marvelous cook was also an absolutely marvelous cryptographer okay leverette then said after we approve that can i go fishing castillo said then theres the final question what do we do about the offer from those people in las vegas i was afraid youd bring that up ace delchamps said i have mixed feelings about that we told them wed let them know today castillo said no they told us to let them know by today delchamps said im not happy with them telling us anything call them up charley jack britton said and tell them were still thinking about it second the motion davidson said why not castillo said the one thing we all have now is time on our hands all the time in the world any objections there were none and the motion carried im going fishing leverette said and grabbed his fly rod from where hed left it on a table then headed for the door two office of the managing editor the washington timespost th street nw washington dc february the managing editors office was across the newsroom from roscoe dantons office substantially larger and even more crowded the exterior windows opened on th street and the interior windows overlooked the newsroom the latter were equipped with venetian blinds which were never opened managing editor christopher j waldron had begun smoking cigars as a teenager and now at age sixtytwo continued to smoke them in his office in defiance of the wishes of the management of the washington timespost and the laws of the district of columbia his only capitulation to political correctness and the law had been the installation of an exhaust fan and a sign on his door in large red letters that said knock before entering this served usually to give him time to exhale and to place his cigar in a desk drawer before any visitor could enter and catch him in flagrante delicto which as he often pointed out meant while the crime is blazing there had been complaints made about his filthy habit most of them from the female staff but also from those of the opposite and indeterminate genders but to no avail chris waldron was about the best managing editor around and management knew it roscoe danton knocked on waldrons door waited for permission to enter and when that came went in closing the door behind him chris waldron reclaimed his cigar from the ashtray in his desk drawer and put it back in his mouth he raised his eyebrows to ask the question well danton said i am fully aware that i am neither woodward nor bernstein but thank you for sharing that with me waldron interrupted but i have a gut feeling im onto a big story maybe as big as watergate and i want to follow it wherever it goes and i had such high hopes that youd really stopped drinking waldron said and then made two gestures which meant sit down and tell me about it so what do we know about these two disgruntled employee whistleblowers waldron asked the younger one wilson was an agricultural analyst at langley before she got married to wilson whos a career bureaucrat over there the gossip which i havent had time to check out is that hes light on his feet he needed to be married and she needed somebody to push her career anyway she managed to get herself sent through the farm and into the clandestine service they sent her to angola and then she got herself sent back to langley a combination of her husbands influence and her vast experienceeleven months in angolagot her a job as regional director for southwest africa everything from nigeria to the south african border she was where she wanted to be back in washington with her foot on the ladder to greater things she was not very popular with her peers what got her fired according to her this colonel castillo said terrible things about her behind her back about her handling of that that was stolen remember that waldron nodded what sort of things she didnt tell me not that she would have told me the truth but anyway that got her relieved from the southwest africa desk and assigned to the southern cone desk the what uruguay argentina and chileotherwise known as the southern cone from which she got fired waldron asked and when danton nodded asked why i got this from a friend of mine whos close to the dci and doesnt like her somebody sent the dci a tape on which our pal c harry whelan jr proudly referred to her as his personal mole in langley c harry whelan jr was a prominent and powerful washingtonbased columnist that would do it i guess you check with harry danton nodded and did he admit knowing this lady more or less when i called him i said harry ive been talking with patricia davies wilson about you to which he replied dont believe a thing that lying bitch says then i asked is it true somebody told the dci she was your personal mole over there and harry replied go fuck yourself roscoe and hung up i can see where losing ones personal mole in the cia might be a trifle annoying waldron said butjudging from what youve told me about this ladymight one suspect she is what our brothers in the legal profession call an unreliable witness oh yeah roscoe agreed but the other one dillworth is different how different well for one thing everybody i talked to liked her said she was really good at what she did and was sorry she got screwed how did she figuratively speaking of course get screwed she was the cia station chief in vienna she had been working on getting a couple of heavyhitter russians to defect really heavy hitters the svr rezident in berlin and the svr rezident in copenhagen who happen to be brother and sister dillworth was so close to this coming off that she had had langley send an airplane to vienna and had them prepare a safe house for them in maryland and it didnt come off colonel castillo showed up in vienna loaded them on his plane and flew them to south america she told you this no what actually happened was that dillworth said she wasnt going to tell me what had happened because i wouldnt believe it she said she would point me in the right direction and let me find out myself that way i would believe it is this russian defectors story true theres an interpol warrant out forroscoe stopped and consulted his organizer and then went ondmitri berezovsky and svetlana alekseeva who the russians say stole several million euros from their embassies in germany and denmark and you know that castillo took these russians to south america how do you know my friend who is close to the dci and doesnt like ambassador montvale told me that montvale told the dci that he was going to south america to get the russians and that when he got down there castillo told him the russians had changed their minds about defecting and you believe this i believe my friend so what happened is that when castillo stole the russians from dillworth blew her operation the agency canned her that got dillworth in a little hot water i mean when the russians didnt come in after she said they were but what got her recalled was really interesting right after this they found the svr rezident in vienna sitting in the backseat of a taxi outside our embassy he had been strangled to deaththeyd used a garroteand on his chest was the calling card of miss eleanor dillworth counselor for consular affairs of the us embassy curiouser and curiouser waldron said the agency thought she did it no they dont know who did it but that was enough to get her recalled from vienna she thinks castillo did it or really had it done why and for that matter why did he take the russians to argentina you said he was turned we have another aldrich ames this one a killer aldrich hazen ames was the central intelligence agency counterintelligence officer convicted of selling out to the soviet union and later russia i just dont know chris from what ive been able to find out about him castillo doesnt seem to be the traitor type but i suppose the same thing was said about ames until the fbi put him in handcuffs and what have you been able to find out about him that he was retired at fort rucker alabamaand given a distinguished service medal his second for unspecified distinguished service of a classified natureon january thirtyfirst he was medically retired with a twentyfive percent disability as the result of a medical board at walter reed army hospital thats what i got from the pentagon when i went to walter reed to get an address phone number and next of kin from the post locator he wasnt in it a diligent search by another friend of mine revealed that he had never been a patient at walter reed never ever not once not even for a physical examination or to have his teeth cleaned and being the suspicious paranoid person you are you have decided that somethings not kosher i suppose you could say that yes what do these women want revenge is dillworth willing to be quoted she assures me that she will speak freely from the witness box if and when castillo is hauled before congress or some other body to be grilled and until that happens speak to no other member of the press but me ditto for mrs patricia davies wilson she has visions in other words of senator johns in some committee hearing room with the tv cameras rolling glaring at this castillo character and demanding to know colonel did you strangle a russian intelligence officer and leave him in a taxicab outside the us embassy in vienna in order to embarrass this fine civil servant miss eleanor dillworth answer yes or no senator homer johns jr democrat new hampshire was chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and loved to be on tv roscoe laughed and added would you repeat the question senator waldron laughed then offered his own answer senator i dont have much of a memory ive been retired from the army because i am psychologically unfit for service i just dont recall well then colonel did you or did you not steal two russians from under miss dillworths nose and fly them to argentina roscoe picked it up two russians senator i dont have much of a memory et cetera waldron still laughing reached into another drawer of his desk and came out with two somewhat grimy glasses and a bottle of the macallan twelveyearold single malt scotch whisky he poured nectar of the gods he said only for good little boys and naughty little girls they tapped glasses and took a sip thats not going to happen roscoe waldron said unless we make it happen and im not sure if we could or even if we should in other words let it drop i wondered why you brought out the good whisky i didnt say that waldron said you open for some advice roscoe nodded dont tell anybody what youre doing anybody if theres anything to this and i have a gut feeling there is there are going to be ten peopleten powerful peopletrying to keep it from coming out for every one whod give you anything useful roscoe nodded again i can see egg on a lot of faces waldron said including on the face of the new inhabitant of the oval office hes in a loselose situation if something like this was going on under his predecessor and he didnt know about it itll look like he wasnt trusted and if he indeed did know there was this james bond outfit operating out of the oval office stealing russian defectors from the cia not to mention strangling russians in vienna and doing all sorts of other interesting if grossly illegal things why didnt he stop it so what do you want me to do one thought would be for you to go to beautiful argentina and do a piece for the sunday magazine you could call it tacos and tangos in the southern cone roscoe nodded thoughtfully then said thank you watch your back roscoe the kind of people who play these games kill nosy people three us army medical research institute fort detrick maryland february there were three packages marked biological hazard in the morning fedex delivery it was a rare morning when there wasnt at least one and sometimes there were eight ten even a dozen this didnt mean that they were so routine that not much attention was paid to them each package was taken separately into a small room in the rear of the guard post there the packagemore accurately the container an oblong insulated metal box which easily could have contained cold beer were it not for the decalcomania plastered all over itwas laid on an examination table on the top was a blackedged yellow triangle inside of which was the biological hazard indicator three halfmoonsnot unlike those to be found on the tops of minarets of muslim houses of worshipjoined together at their closed ends over a circle below this black letters on a yellow background spelled out danger biological hazard beside thisin a red circle not unlike a no parking symbolthe silhouette of a walking man was bisected by a crossing red line the message below this in white letters on a red background was authorized personnel only this was apparently intended to keep curious people from opening the container to have a look at the biological hazard this would have been difficult as the container was closed with four lengths of fourinchwide plastic tape two around the long end and two around the short the tape application device had closed the tapes by melting the ends together the only way to get into the container was by cutting the tape with a large knife it would thus be just about impossible for anyone to have a look inside without anyone noticing once the biological hazard package was laid on the table it was examined by two score or more specially trained technicians it was xrayed sniffed for leakage and the presence of chemicals which might explode and tested for several other things some of them classified only after it had passed this inspection was the fedex receipt signed the package was then turned over to two armed security officers most of these at fort detrick were retired army sergeants one of them got behind the wheel of a batterypowered golf cart and the other after putting the container on the floor of the golf cart got in andthere being no other place to put themput his feet on the container at this point the driver checked the documentation to the final destination oh shit he said its for hamilton personally j porter hamilton was the senior scientific officer of the us army medical research institute it was said that he spoke only to god and the commanding general of the us army medical research institute but only rarely deigned to do so to the latter although he was triply entitled to be addressed as doctorhe was a medical doctor and also held a phd in biochemistry from oxford and a phd in molecular physics from mithe preferred to be addressed as colonel he had graduated from the united states military academy at west point with the class of and thought of himself primarily as a soldier colonel hamilton had the reputation among the security force of being one really hardnosed sonofabitch this reputation was not pejorative just a statement of the facts colonel hamiltona very slim very tall asceticlooking officer whose skin was deep flat black in colorshowed the security guards where he wanted the biological hazard container placed on a table in his private laboratory after theyd left he eyed the container curiously it had been sent from the daryl laboratory in miami florida just who they were didnt come to mind they had paid a small fortune for overnight shipment which also was unusual he went to a closet took off his uniform tunic and replaced it with a white laboratory coat he then pulled on a pair of very expensive gloves which looked like normal latex gloves but were not sergeant dennis he called dennis was a us army master sergeant a burly redfaced irishman from baltimore who functioned as sort of a secretary to colonel hamilton hamilton had recruited him from the walter reed army medical center hamilton doing what he thought of as his soldiers duty often served on medical boards at walter reed dealing with wounded soldiers who wantedor who did not wantmedical retirement dennis had been one of the latter he did not wish to be retired although he had lost his left leg below the knee and his right arm at the shoulder there was no way hamilton had decided that dennis could return to the infantry on the other hand there was no reason he could not make himself useful around building at fort detrick if that was the option to being retired he made the offer and when dennis accepted hed asked can you arrange that colonel i can arrange it sergeant dennis the chief of staff has directed the army to provide whatever i think i need for my laboratory just think of yourself as a human erlenmeyer flask dennis appeared sir what do we know of the daryl laboratory in miami florida never heard of it sir good i was afraid that i was suffering another senior moment right after we see what this is find out who they are and why they sent me whatever this is you want me to open it colonel i want you to cut the tape thank you ill open it dennis took a tactical folding knife from his pocket fluidly flipped open the stainlesssteel serrated blade and expertly cut the plastic tape from the container hamilton raised the lid inside he found a second container there was a large manila envelope taped to it and addressed simply colonel hamilton hamilton picked up the envelope and took from it two eightbyteninch color photographs of six barrellike objects they were of a heavy plastic dark blue in color and also looked somewhat like beer kegs on the kegs was a copy of the miami herald the date could not be read in the first shot but in the second photograph a closeup it was clearly visible february my god colonel hamilton said softly jesus christ colonel sergeant dennis said pointing did you see that hamilton looked the envelope had covered a simple sign and now it was visible danger biohazard level of the four levels of biological hazards one through four the latter posed the greatest threat to human life from viruses and bacteria and had no vaccines or other treatments available hamilton closed the lid on the container go to the closet and get two level a hazmat suits what the hells going on dennis asked after were in our suits hamilton said calmly two minutes later they had helped each other into the level a hazmat suits these offered the highest degree of protection against both direct and airborne chemical contact by providing the wearer with total encapsulation including a selfcontained breathing apparatus the suits donned by colonel hamilton and master sergeant dennis also contained communications equipment that connected them hands off with each other as well as to the post telephone system and to hamiltons cellular telephone call the duty officer and tell him that i am declaring a potential level four disaster hamilton said have them prepare level four biolab two for immediate use have them send a level four truck here to move this container personnel to wear level a hazmat gear a level four biolabthere were three at fort detrickwas in a manner of speaking a larger version of the level a hazmat protective suit it was completely selfcontained protected by multiple airlocks it had a system of highpressure showers to decontaminate personnel entering or leaving a vacuum room and an ultravioletlight room all air and water entering or leaving was decontaminated and of course within the bubble there was a laboratory designed to do everything and anything anyone could think of to any kind of a biologically hazardous material colonel hamilton then pressed a key that caused his cellular telephone to speeddial a number the number was answered on the second ring and hamilton formally announced this is colonel j porter hamilton encryption level one active a metallic voice said three seconds later hamilton then went on there was delivered to my laboratory about five minutes ago a container containing material described as biohazard level four there was also a photograph of some six plastic containers identical to those i brought out of the congo on them was lying a photo of yesterdays miami newspaper all of which leads me to strongly suspect that the attack on the laboratoryslashfactory did notrepeat notdestroy everything i am having this container moved to a laboratory where i will be able to compare whatever is in the container with what i brought out of the congo this process will take me at least several hours in the meantime i suggest we proceed on the assumption that there are six containers of the most dangerous congo material in the hands of only god knows whom when i have completed my tests i will inform the director of the cia of my findings he broke the connection and then walked to the door and unlocked it for the hazmat transport people he could hear the siren of the level four van coming toward building one laboratory four the afc corporationmccarran facility las vegas nevada february laboratory four was not visible to anyone looking across mccarran international airport toward what had become the center of afcs worldwide production and researchanddevelopment activity this was because laboratory four was deep underground beneath hangar iii one of a row of enormous hangars each bearing the afc logotype it was also below laboratories one two and three which were closer to ground level as their numbers suggested one being immediately beneath the hangar when aloysius francis casey afcs chairman had been a student at mit he had become friendly with a koreanamerican student of architecture who was something of an outcast because of his odd notion that with some exceptionsaircraft hangars being oneall industrial buildings which would include laboratories should be underground this had gotten j charles who in as much trouble with the architectural faculty as had caseys odd notions of data transmission and encryption had done the opposite of endearing him to the electrical engineering and mathematics faculties years later when casey decided that he had had quite enough thank you of the politicians and weather of his native massachusetts to last a lifetime and wanted to move at least the laboratories and some of the manufacturing facilities elsewhere he got in touch with his old school chum and sought his expertise site selection was problem one las vegas had quickly risen to the head of the list of possibilities for a number of reasons including location tax concessions to be granted by the state and local governments for bringing a laboratory production facility with several thousand extremely wellpaid and welleducated workers to sin city and the attractions of sin city itself at whos suggestion just about everything would go to vegas charley who phd mit aia had pointed out to aloysius casey phd mit that all work and no play would tend to make his extremely wellpaid workers dull it was hard to become bored in las vegas whether ones interests lay in the cultural or the carnal or a combination of both construction had begun immediately and in earnest starting with the laboratories that would be under hangar iii they were something like the biolabs at fort detrick in that they were as pure as they could be made the air and water was filtered as it entered and was discharged the humidity and temperature in the labs was whatever the particular labs required and being below ground cut the cost of doing this to a tiny fraction of what it would have cost in a surface building they were essentially soundproof and finally the deeper underground that they were the less they were affected by vibration say a heavy truck driving by or the landing of a heavy airplane almost all of aloysiuss gadgets in development were very tiny and quite delicate much of the work on them was done using microscopes or their electronic equivalent vibration was the enemy what casey was working on now in laboratory four his personal labmy latest gadget as he put itwas yet another improvement on a system he had developed for the gambling cops or as they liked to portray themselves the security element of the gaming industry many people try to cheat the casinos most are incredibly stupid but a small number are the exact opposite incredibly smart imaginative and resourceful both stupid and neargenius wouldbe thieves alike have to deal with the same problem one has to be physically in a casino if one is to steal anything surveillance cameras scan every inch of a casino floor often from several angles and the angles can be changed the people watching these monitors know what to look for if some dummy is seen stealing quarters from grandmas bucket on a slot machine row or some neargenius is engaged with three or more equally intelligent coconspirators in a complex scheme to cheat the casino at a twentyone table they are seen security officers are sent to the slot machine or the twentyone table the wouldbe thieves and cheats are taken to an area where they are photographed fingerprinted counseled regarding the punishments involved for cheating a casino and then shown the door the problem then becomes that stupid and neargenius alike tend to believe that if at first you dont succeed one should try try again they come back now disguised with a phony mustache or a wig and a change of clothing specially trained security officers who regularly review the photographs of caught crooks stand at casino doors and roam the floors looking for familiar if unwelcome faces when casey had first moved to las vegas he had been very discreetly approachedthe day he was welcomed into the las vegas chamber of gaming hospitality and other commerceby a man who then owned threeand now owned fiveof the more glitzy hotelcasinos in sin city the man approached casey at the urinal in the mens room of the via veneto restaurant in caligulas palace resort and casino and said he wanted to thank him for what he was doing for the boys in the stockade in bragg i dont know who or what the hell youre talking about casey had replied immediately but casey of course knew full well who the boys in the stockade in fort bragg weredelta force their base had once been the post stockadeand what he was doing for themproviding them with whatever they asked for absolutely free of charge or didnt ask for but got anyway because casey thought it might be useful sure you do the man had said the commo gear it was very useful last week in tunisia how the hell did you find out about that casey had blurted we have sources all over whos we like you people who happen to be in positions where we can help the good guys and try quietlyvery quietlyto do so id like to talk to you about our group some time these people have names they were furnished give me a day or two to check these people out casey said then come to see me the first person casey had tried to call was thenmajor general bruce j mcnab who at the time commanded the special forces center at fort bragg he got instead thenmajor charley castillo on the phone castillo did odd jobs for mcnabboth had told casey thatand hed become one of caseys favorite people since theyd first met and when casey had asked castillo had flatlyalmost indignantlydenied telling anyone about the tunisian radios mentioned in the casino pisser and of ever even hearing of the man who claimed to own the glitzy las vegas hotels general mcnab however when he came on the line was so obfuscatory about both questionseven aware that the line was encryptedthat casey promptly decided a mcnab knew the guy who owned the three glitzy casinos b had told the guy where the radios used in tunisia had come from c had more than likely suggested he could probably wheedle some out of casey which meant he knew and approved of what the guy was up to and thus d didnt want castillo to know about a through c that had been surprising for years from the time during the first desert war when thensecond lieutenant castillo had gone to work for thencolonel mcnab casey had thoughtin fact i was toldthat castillo was always privy to all of mcnabs secrets casey prided himself on his few friends and on having no secrets from them he had quickly solved the problem here by concluding that having no secrets did not mean you had to tell your friends everything you knew but rather if asked to be wholly forthcoming if castillo asked about these people in las vegas he would tell him if he didnt ask he would not and as quickly he had decided if these people were okay in general mcnabs book they were okayperiod unless of course something happened that changed that casey had called the man who owned the three glitzy hotelsand was in business discussions leading to the construction of the largest hotel in the world roomsand told him he was in what do these people need casey asked he was told secure telephones to connect them all while afc had such devices sitting in his warehouse these were not what he delivered to the people in las vegas the secure telephones they used thereafter had encryption circuitry that could not be decrypted by even the legendary national security agency at fort meade maryland casey knew this because the nsas equipment had come from afc corporation and after that and after writing several very substantial checks to pay his share of what it had cost those people to do something that had to be donebut for one reason or another couldnt be done by the various intelligence agenciescasey realized that he had become one of the group no one said anything to him he didnt get a membership card he just knew he became friendly with the man who owned the glitzy hotels and not only because one of his hotels had a restaurant to which lobsters and clams were flown in daily from maine the man who owned the hotels was from new jersey politicians and high taxes not the cuisine had driven him from the garden state they took to taking together what they thought of as one of gods better mealsa dozen steamed clams and a pair of threepound lobsters washed down with a couple of pitchers of beeronce or twice a week one day en route to the restaurant casey had witnessed one of the gambling cops intently studying the face of the man who happened to be walking ahead of casey whats that all about casey had asked his new friend the casino owner between their first pitcher of beer and the clams and their lobsters and the second pitcher the problem of controlling undesirable incoming gamblers was explained there has to be a better way to do that than having your gambling cops in everybodys face casey said let me think about it the afc prototype was delivered in three weeks and operational a week after that all the photographs of miscreants in the files were digitalized additional digital cameras were discreetly installed at the entrances in such positions that the only way to avoid having ones face captured by the system would be to arrive by parachute on the roof the computer software quickly and constantly attempted to crossmatch images of casino patrons with the database of miscreants on the security servers when a hit was made the gambling cops could immediately take corrective action to protect the casino the owner was delighted and ordered installation of the system in all his properties as quickly as this could be accomplished but casey was just getting started the first major improvement was to provide the gambling cops with a small communications device that looked like a telephone when a hit was made every security officer in the establishment was immediately furnished with both the digital image of mr unwelcomeor grandma unwelcome there were a surprising number of the latterand the last known location of said miscreant it hadnt been hard for casey to improve on that soon the miscreants name aliases and other personal data including why he or she was unwelcome was flashed to the gambling cops as soon as there was a hit the next largeand expensivestep had required the replacement of the system computers with ones of much greater capacity and speed the owner complained not a word when he got the bill he thought of himself after all as a leader in the hospitality and gaming industry and there was a price that had to be paid for that the system now made a hit when a good customer returned to the premises presumably bringing more funds to pass into the casinos coffers through the croupiers slots he was greeted as quickly and as warmly as possible and depending on how bad his luck had been the last time provided with complimentary accommodations victuals and spirits often the gambling cops assigned to keep them happy were attractive members of the opposite gender good grandmother customers interestingly enough seemed to appreciate this courtesy more than most of the men the new system soon covered all of the hotels owned by the proprietor and the database grew as guests pertinent detailsbank balances credit reports domestic problems known associates carnal preferences that sort of thingwere added for a while as he had been working on the system casey had thought it would have a sure market in other areas where management wanted to keep a close eye on people within its walls prisons for example afcs legal counsel had quickly disabused him of this pleasant notion the aclu would go ballistic his lawyers warned at what they would perceive as an outrageous violation of a felons right to privacy while incarcerated he would be the accused in a class action lawsuit that would probably cost him millions what casey was doing when his cellular buzzed in the lab deep beneath hangar iii was conducting a sort of graduation ceremony for a pair of students who had just completed how this works he had just presented the graduates with what looked like fairly ordinary blackberrys or similar socalled smartphones actually by comparison the capabilities of the caseyberry devices that casey had given the two students made the blackberry look as stateoftheart as the wood fire from which an apache brave informs his squaw that hell be a little late for supper by allowing puffs of smoke to rise the students were first lieutenant edmund pegleg lorimer mi usa retired and former gunnery sergeant lester bradley usmc when the office of organizational analysis had been disbanded and its men and women ordered to vanish from the face of the earth casey had had a private word with castillo about them neither bradley nor lorimer had a familyperhaps more accurately a family into whose arms they would be welcomed with joyand neither had skills readily convertible to earning a decent living as a civilian there was not much of a market for a onelegged spanishenglishportuguese interpreter or for a fivefoottwo hundredthirtypound twentyyearold who could give marksmanship instruction to annie oakley further there was the problem that they too were expected to fall off the face of the earth and never be seen again both men casey had told castillo had become skilled in the use of the stateoftheart communications equipment that ooa had been using casey intended to keep providing similar equipment to delta force and with some additional training bradley and lorimer could assume responsibility for training delta troopers to operate and maintain it so far as their falling off the face of the earth casey said they would be hard to find in las vegas and next to impossible to find if they moved in with him at the home charley who had built for the caseys on a very expensive piece of mountainside real estate that overlooked las vegas now that mrs casey had finally succumbed to an especially nasty and painful carcinoma there was nobody in the place but the mexican couple who took care of casey and to keep them busy when they werent dealing with the equipment for delta force or keeping an eye on the communications network used by those people they would be welcomedand well paidby the gaming industry as experts in the digital photo recognition and data system not thirty seconds after casey had handed lorimer and bradley their new cell phones vibration announced an incoming message on the peoples circuit and casey thought he had inadvertently pressed the check functioning key but he checked the screen and saw that there was indeed an incoming message its from colonel hamilton i wonder what the hell he wants when inside his level a hazmat gear colonel j porter hamilton had pressed the transmit button for his cellular phone and given his name the following had happened an integral voice recognition circuit had determined that he was indeed colonel j porter hamilton and at about the time a satellite link had been established between hamilton and las vegas had announced that encryption level one was now active by the time hamilton spoke again to report the delivery of biohazardous material to his laboratory and what he planned to do about it the cell phones in the hands of those people had vibrated to announce the arrival of an incoming call their cell phones automatically recorded the message and then sent a message to hamiltons phone that the message had been received and recorded he had then broken the connection when those called answered their telephones either when the call was first made or whenever they got around to it they would hear the recorded message a small green led on the telephone would indicate that the caller was at that moment on the line a red led would indicate the caller was not casey saw that the red led was illuminated hamiltons offline i wonder what he wanted as he touched the answer key he saw that both lester and pegleg were doing the same thing hamiltons message was played to them all i wonder what the hell thats all about casey wondered out loud he said identical to what i brought out of the congo pegleg said what did he bring out of the congo both pegleg and aloysius looked at lester whose face was troubled you know what hamiltons talking about lester casey asked bradley looked even more uncomfortable casey waited patiently and was rewarded for his patience colonel torine would sir bradley said finally how many times do i have to tell you to call me aloysius casey said he pushed a button on his caseyberry jake aloysius he said a moment later got a minute can you come to my lab captain sparkman would know too bradley said sparkman with you casey said to his telephone and a moment later bring him too casey pushed another button and said pass torine and sparkman and then looked at pegleg and lester theyre in the hangar he pointed upward colonel jacob torine usaf retired and mr richard sparkman formerly captain usaf got off the elevator ninety seconds later they were dressed almost identically in khaki trousers polo shirts and zipper jackets and had large multibutton watches on their wrists their belts held cases for rayban sunglasses they both had clear blue eyes no one would ever guess that they were pilots whats up listen to this casey said and handed him his caseyberry and motioned for lester to hand his to sparkman both listened to colonel j porter hamiltons message sparkmans eyebrows rose in surprise torine said oh shit and then asked when did you get this just now not good news torine said what is the exact opposite of good news casey said whats he talking about what did he bring out of the congo torine exhaled he looked around the laboratory i dont suppose this place is bugged casey shook his head we went over there in deltas torine said it was painted in the color scheme of subsaharan airways he stopped why am i telling you this you know go on jake casey said we landed at kilimanjaro international in tanzania uncle remus and his crew went by truck to bujumbura in burundi theres an airport at bujumbura but castillo decided wed attract too much attention if we used it particularly if we sat on the runway for a couple of days maybe longer uncle remus infiltrated hamilton back into the congo from bujumbura and then when hamilton found what he found and the shit hit the fan we got a message from uncle remus to move the airplane to bujumbura yesterday and have it prepared for immediate takeoff we were there about three hours when uncle remus his crew and hamilton showed up they had with them a halfdozen of what looked like rubber beer kegs blue he demonstrated with his hands the size of the kegs uncle remus asked me if we could fly to the states with the halo compartment depressurized and open i dont understand that lester said halo compartment for high altitude low opening parachute infiltration from up to forty thousand feet pegleg explained the rear halfthe halo compartmentof the fuselage can be sealed off from the rest of the fuselage and then where that rear stairway was opened to the atmosphere got it lester said i told him yes torine went on and hamilton said thank god as if he meant it i asked him what was going on and he told me the beer barrels contained more dangerous material than i could imagine and extraordinary precautions were in order he would explain later he asked me how cold the halo compartment would get in flight and i told him probably at least sixty degrees below zero and he said thank god again and sounded like he meant it this time too then he and uncle remus and his team loaded the barrels in the halo compartment when they came out everybody stripped to the skin they took a shower on the tarmac using the fire engine and some special soap and chemicals hamilton had with him then they put on whatever clothing we had aboard flight suits some other clothing and got in the front and we took off before we had climbed out to cruising altitude we got some company a flight of fae super hornets from a carrier in the indian ocean they stayed with us until we were over the atlantic where they handed us over to some super hornets flying off a carrier in the atlantic we headed for north carolinapope air force at fort bragg we were refueled in flight halfway across the atlantic and when the refueling was over we were handed over to a flight of air force fs who stayed with us until we got to pope when we got to pope we were directed to the delta hangar and immediately towed inside and the doors closed then maybe two dozen guys in sciencefiction movie space suits swarmed all over the airplane some of them went into the halo compartment and removed the barrels i later learned they were sealed and then loaded aboard a citation three and flown to washington they took everybody off the airplane and gave us a bath unbelievable soap chemicals some kind of powder it took half an hour and then they held useverybody but hamilton and uncle remus they went on the citation with the barrelsfor twentyfour hours for observation gave us another bath and finally let us go general mcnab was waiting for usdid i mention they held us in the hangarwhen they finally turned us loose he gave us the standard speech about keeping this secret for the rest of our natural lives or suffer castration with a dull knife what was in the barrels jake casey asked softly did hamilton tell you torine nodded he said two of them contained laboratory material and the other four had tissue samples when i pressed him on that he said that two of the barrels contained body parts from bodies he and uncle remus dug up near this place and the other two held the bodies of two people one black and one white that uncle remus took down when they had to get into the laboratory he said he needed them for autopsies jesus casey said and now we learn that not everything was destroyed sparkman said the word i got was there was nothing left standing or unburned in a twentysquaremile area what the hell is this all about i dont know casey admitted but i just had this thought it doesnt matter to you guys ooa is dead youve fallen off the face of the earth youre out of the loop this has nothing to do with you why dont i believe that aloysius torine asked softly probably because youre an old fart like me and have learned that when things are as black as they can possibly get they invariably get worse two us army medical research institute fort detrick maryland february the declaration of a potential level four disaster at fort detrick by colonel j porter hamilton mc caused a series of standing operating procedures to kick insomething akin to a row of dominoes tumbling one domino knocking over the one adjacent but in this instance damned faster when master sergeant dennis called the post duty officer he actually called the garrison duty officer on coming to work for colonel hamilton dennis had quickly learned that the colonel often had trouble with army bureaucracy and that it was his job to provide the colonel with what he wanted which often was not what he asked for the garrison duty officer immediately expressed doubt that master sergeant dennis was actually asking for what he said he was a potential level four disaster you sure about that sergeant yes sir colonel hamilton said he was declaring a potential level four disaster the garrison duty officer consulted his sop dealing with disasters and checked who was authorized to declare one there were three people who could on their own authority declare a potential level four disaster the garrison commander colonel j porter hamilton and the garrison duty officer let me speak to colonel hamilton sergeant the garrison duty officer said hes on his phone major now do you want to send a level four van over here personnel in level one hazmat suits or should i call for it you have that authority yes sir i do and i have authority to have level four biolab two opened and on standby you want me to do that too sir why dont you do that sergeant while i bring the garrison commander up to speed on this and sergeant see if you can have colonel hamilton call her yes sir master sergeant dennis said the duty officer called the garrison commander major lott maam maam we seem to have a problem what kind of a problem maam colonel hamiltons sergeant just called and said the colonel wanted to declare a potential level four disaster there was a pause then the garrison commander said let me make sure i understand the situation you say colonel hamiltons sergeant called and told you colonel hamilton wants to declare a potential level four disaster is that it yes maam thats it i thought id better bring you up to speed on this maam the garrison commander thought what you were supposed to do you stupid sonofabitch was sound the goddamned alarm sirens get a level four van over to hamilton get a level four biolab on emergency standby and thenand only thencall me and youre a goddamn major jesus h christ she said calmly listen carefully what i want you to do major is first sound the alarm sirens then send a level four van to colonel hamiltons laboratory and when youve done that get a level four biolab on emergency standby got all that yes maam then do it the garrison commander said and broke the connection major lott raised the cover of the alarm activation switch and then pressed on the switch sirens all over began to howl he then consulted the standing operating procedure to see what else was required of him to dothus knocking over the first of the dominoes the provost marshal was notified the first thing listed on his sop was to lock down the fort nobody in nobody out he did so the second thing on his list was to notify the garrison medical facility to prepare for casualties the third thing listed was to notify the secret service detachment on the base he did so and then continued to work down his list the first thing on the secret service detachment sop was to notify local law enforcement agencies with fort detrick equidistant between washington dc fortyfive miles and baltimore maryland fortysix miles there was a large number of law enforcement agencies in that area each of which was entitled to know of the problem at fort detrick the secret service agent instead first called his special agent in charge at the department of homeland security at the nebraska avenue complex in the district of columbia he told him about the potential level four disaster but had to confess that was all he knew ill handle it the sac said the secret service agent began calling the numbers on his list of law enforcement agencies to be notified the sac at homeland security attempted to contact the secretary of homeland security but was told he was in chicago with mayor daley he then got the assistant secretary for enforcement on the telephone and told him about the potential level four disaster at fort detrick ill be damned he said ill handle it he contacted the garrison commander on a hotline assistant homeland security secretary andrews colonel he said i understand youve got a little problem over there the garrison commander had by then spoken with master sergeant dennis who had told her about the container that had arrived with the morning fedex shipment when she had told andrews this he said ill take immediate action andrews then called the sac back told him to get on the horn to his people at detrick and have them grab the container and not let anybody else near it hows the quickest way for me to get there the assistant secretary asked it would probably be quicker in one of our yukons than trying to get a chopper mr secretary i can have one at your door in ninety seconds do it five and a half minutes later a black secret service yukonred and blue lights flashing from behind its grille and with another magnetbased blue light flashing on the roofskidded to a stop in front of the main building and picked up assistant secretary andrews the sac was in the front seat where the assistant secretary preferred to ride andrews thought ninety seconds my ass that took five minutes plus and we need to roll get in the back he said only then did the assistant secretary remember he had had another option he could have told the sac to get out but it was too late he took a seat in the second row and siren screaming and lights flashing they were on their way to the potential level four disaster at fort detrick three office of the presidential press secretary the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february there were a halfdozen television monitors mounted on the wall of john david porky parkers office one for each of the major television networks and the other three for the major cable news programs the sound of only one was on the volume low but on porky parker was more or less addicted to watchinglistening to wolf news not because he liked it but the opposite he hated it wolf news gave him the most trouble it seemed to be dedicated to the proposition that all politicians from potus down were scoundrels mountebanks and fools and that it was wolf newss noble duty to bring every proofor suggestionof this to the attention of the american people the problem was compounded for porky by the fact that the people of wolf news were very good at what they did and with great skill went after the scoundrels mountebanks and fools regardless of political affiliation wolf news used the fourth and final part of gioacchino antonio rossinis william tell overture to catch peoples attention whenever there was breaking news most people recognized the music as the theme for the lone ranger motion picture and television series that was happening now and when porky faintly heard the stirring music he reached for the remote control as a pavlovian reaction and raised his eyes to the screen he had the sound turned up in time to see and hear the wolf news anchoronduty proclaim there is breaking news wolf news is on top of it back in sixty seconds there then followed a sixtysecond commercial offering the wall street journal delivered to ones home for only pennies a day then the screen showed what looked like the scene of a major traffic accident there were at least thirty police cars all with their red and blue lights flashing it had been taken from a helicopter at the upper right corner of the screen a message unnecessarily flashed live live from a wolf news chopper porky was a second from muting the sound when the voice of the onduty wolf news anchor announced what were looking at from a wolf news chopper is the main gate of fort detrick maryland we dont know yet what exactly is going on here but we do know that the post has been closed down nobody gets in or out and that the director of the central intelligence agency just choppered in and a senior official of the department of homeland security not yet identified just arrived in a vehicle with a screaming siren in another pavlovian reflex porky reached for his white house telephone and told the operator to get him the commanding general of fort detrick on a secure line colonel russell this is the white house switchboard this line is secure mr parker wishes to speak with the commanding general this is the garrison commander mr parker wishes to speak with the commanding general we dont have a commanding general im the senior officer the garrison commander one moment please colonel this is john parker the presidents press secretary this is colonel florence russell what can i do for you mr parker whats going on down there the garrison commander for a moment considered correcting the pompous political lackey with whats going on up here porky fort detrick is damn near due north of dc but instead said we have a potential level four biological hazard disaster mr parker what does that mean exactly the operative word is potential we may have repeat may have a biological hazard disaster level four the most serious kind what happened all i can tell you mr parker is that our chief scientific officer colonel j porter hamilton has declared a potential level four biological hazard disaster and we have taken the necessary actions to deal with that colonel russell i repeat what does that mean per sop we have shut down the post alerted the hospital and notified the proper authorities until we hear from colonel hamilton thats all we can do may i speak with colonel hamilton please im afraid thats not possible at the moment mr parker why not colonel hamilton is in level four biolab two and theres no telephone in there theres a telephone hes not answering it perhaps if you told him the white house is calling he might change his mind to do that mr parker i would have to get him on the line and hes not picking up can you tell me what hes doing i can tell you what i think hes doing a package was delivered to him shortly before he declared the potential disaster i think its reasonable to presume hes examining the contents of that package to what end colonel to see if what it contains justifies changing the current status from potential to actual or from potential level four to a lesser threat designation we wont know until he tells us the president colonel is going to want to know colonel hamilton is not answering the telephone in the laboratory mr parker i understand dci powell is there yes he is would you like to speak with him mr parker not right now colonel you understand that im going to have to tell the president that the only person who seems to know whats going on wont answer his telephone i suppose thats true colonel russell said ill get back to you colonel parker said and then feverishly tapped the switchhook in the telephone handset cradle to get the switchboard operator back on the line yes mr parker get me dci powell powell mr parker is calling mr powell the line is secure mr powell john parker what the hell is going on over there john the director of central intelligence began and then stopped after a long moment he resumed john i was just about to call the president i think it would be best if he decided what to tell you about this parker heard the click that told him powell had just broken the connection porky parker normally had unquestioned access to the president anywhere at any time but now when he approached the door to the oval office one of the two secret service men on duty put on an insincere smile and held up his hand to bar him the second secret service agent then opened the door and called in mr president mr parker parker heard president clendennens impatient reply not now then he heard another male voice mr president may i respectfully suggest that were going to need parker after a moment parker recognized the voice as that of ambassador charles m montvale the director of national intelligence there was a brief pause and then clendennen even more impatiently drawled all right let him in the secret service agent at the door waved parker into the oval office the president was at his desk slumped back in his highbacked blue leatherupholstered judges chair ambassador montvale was sitting in an armchair looking up at the wallmounted television monitor secretary of state natalie cohen was sitting sideward on the couch facing montvale also looking at the television the president looked at parker and pointed to the television parker moved to the opposite wall leaned on it and looked up at the television surprising parker not at all the president was watching wolf news there was a flashing banner across the bottom on the screen breaking news breaking news the wolf news anchoronduty was sitting at his desk facing c harry whelan jr a banner read c harry whelan jr wolf news distinguished contributor whelan was answering a question and although he hadnt heard it parker knew what the question was whats going on at fort detrick well of course i dont know steven c harry whelan jr said somewhat pontifically but it seems to me with the director of central intelligence thereplus that unnamed senior official from homeland securitythat the situation there whatever it is is under control if i had to hazard a guess i would say we have a case of highlevel arfarf arfarf harry you dont know the term whelan asked surprised the anchoronduty shook his head well far be it from me to suggest anything at all that would cast any aspersion whatever on my good friend central intelligence agency director jack powellor for that matter on the unidentified senior homeland security officialbut hypothetically speaking if president clendennen had two dogssay a labrador and a cocker spanieland they started chasing their tails the sound they would be making would be arfarf the camera paused for a moment on mr whelans facehe looked very pleased with himselfand then a picture of the front page of the wall street journal replaced it and a voiceover deeply intoned for only pennies a day the screen went black i hate that sonofabitch president clendennen said a full thirty seconds later porky parker broke the silence may i ask whats going on at fort detrick president clendennen glared at him secretary of state natalie cohen came to his rescue mr president youre either going to have to make a statement or have jack make one in your name that might prove to be difficult madam secretary president clendennen said sarcastically as we dont seem to have the first goddamn clue about whats going on at fort detrick he let that sink in and then went on and if what the dci has just told me is true i dont think we should broadcast that little gem from the white house mr president what exactly did dci powell say ambassador montvale asked he said this colonel had gotten word to him that he strongly suspects that the attack we made on the quote unquote fish farm in the congothe attack that brought us this closehe held his thumb and index fingers perhaps a quarter of an inch apartto a nuclear exchangedid not kill all the fishes youre talking about colonel hamilton mr president montvale asked the president nodded how could he know that thats what powell said that he got a message to that effect from hamilton what does hamilton say hes not answering his telephone the president said bitterly then picked up his telephone get me powell he ordered and then not twenty seconds later said is he still not answering his phone there was a short reply the minute he comes out of that laboratory put him in your helicopter and bring him here he put the telephone handset into its cradle and now we wait clendennen said the president of the united states the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence wait for some lousy colonel to find time for us four us army medical research institute fort detrick maryland february colonel j porter hamilton medical corps us army came through the outer portal of level four biolab two wearing only a bathrobe the crest of the united states military academy was on the breast and the legend west point was on the back he found in the room the garrison commander the director of central intelligence the assistant secretary of homeland security the special agent in charge at the department of homeland security the fort detrick provost marshal two secret service agents and master sergeant dennis youll have to pardon my appearance colonel russell colonel hamilton said not a problem colonel colonel florence russell replied hamilton turned to dci powell and said i can only surmise that those people relayed my message to you powell nodded colonel my name is mason andrews im the assistant secretary of homeland security i would be grateful first things first hamilton interrupted sergeant dennis could i impose upon you to take your car and get me a uniform from my quarters im afraid the keys to my car are in there in my uniform way ahead of you colonel dennis said fresh uniforms in the lobby ill go get it good man hamilton said mr powell and i will be in the locker room he looked at colonel russell colonel would it offend you if i suggested that you come with us you could turn your back while i dress not at all she said the presidents really curious about whats going on here colonel dci powell said he wants to see you at the white house theres a helicopter would you prefer to wait until were at the white house hamilton said i have to bring colonel russell up to speed on this before i go anywhere ill go with you and colonel russell powell said so will i assistant secretary andrews said i think not hamilton said excuse me andrews bristled i can tell you what you need to know right here there is no immediate threat he turned to the provost marshal and added as soon as you can youre to establish a guard around one where the package was originally examined two my office and three this building to which no one is to enter without the specific approval of myself master sergeant dennis or of course colonel russell and you may lift the shutdown colonel russell will have more details after we have spoken yes sir the provost marshal said you had better impound the golf cart on which the package was movedbring it and the two security people who drove it here dennis will see to their bath just a precaution better safe than sorry i always say master sergeant dennis came back into the room carrying a plastic bag in his prosthetic hand he handed it to hamilton good man hamilton said as he took it then he said dennis they are going to bring the golf cart and the security drivers here see that they get a complete bath then do the same to the golf cart yes sir colonel russell mr powell if youll be good enough to come with me am i correctly inferring colonel that i was not included in that invitation mason andrews asked icily he didnt wait for hamilton to reply andobviously on the edge of losing his temperwent on perhaps you didnt hear me colonel when i told you that i am the assistant secretary of homeland security if he had intended to cow hamilton he failed mr secretary or is it mr assistant secretary hamilton replied i know that mr powell is cleared for this sort of information i dont know how much the president wants you to know i am not about to risk the ire of the president by telling you any more than i already have andrews flared now goddamn it you listen to me colonel mr andrews dci powell interrupted why dont you let the president settle this youre welcome to ride with us to the white house the assistant secretary of homeland security took a moment to get his temper under control perhaps that would be best he said finally thank you five the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february thank you for coming so quickly colonel president clendennen said the sarcasm was lost on hamilton i came as quickly as i could mr president hamilton said i know you were on wolf we all saw you both taking off from fort detrick and landing here and we all saw c harry whelan jr tell his several million viewers he believes you were coming here to deliver the bad news please tell me hes wrong actually mr president its a mixed bag the news could be much much worse well clendennen drawled pronouncing the word whale tell me the good news there is no cause for immediate alarm i told colonel russell what was necessary for her to do and that once she had done that she could lift the shutdown i have changed the potential level four biological hazard disaster to level two biological hazard incident what does that mean exactly that in my judgment there is reason to believe that all congox under my control is contained in a safe environment and there is no immediate risk to the general public congox what is that it is what i call this virus or organism or whatever it is what i brought from the congo just before the fish farm was attacked which is it an organism or a virus im afraid i dont really know sir more than like a combination of both an organismus perhaps or a virusism those are terms i made up in the last week or ten days there is no scientific terminology that i know of to describe congox colonel press secretary john d parker said did i understand you to say there is no immediate danger to the public i was speaking with the colonel parker the president said unpleasantly mr president if the colonel can assure us that there is no immediate danger to the public i thinkto counter that comment of c harry whelan jr on wolf newsyou should make a statement to that effect and as soon as possible immediately we really have to control this before it gets out of hand the president glared at parker mr president ambassador montvale put in i think porkys right parker glared at montvale which wasnt lost on the president what do you think i should say porky clendennen asked mr president if you make any statement it carries great importance i mean to suggest that it will give the impression that this situation is more serious than the colonel suggests it is in other words you want to make the statement that would be my recommendation mr president i agree with porky ambassador montvale said that makes it twice doesnt it the president asked and then went on and what would you say parker sir something along the lines of this there was an incident early this morning at fort detrick that has attracted a good deal of media attention the president has just spoken with the chief scientific officer at fort detrick who has assured him there is no cause for concern what it was was the routine triggering of a safety system erring on the side of caution to repeat there is no cause for concern something like that mr president the president was thoughtful for a long moment then he asked read that back please a female voice came over a loudspeaker and recited parkers suggested statement at the end of the first sentence where it says has attracted a good deal of media attention strike that and change it to has apparently caused much of the media to start chasing its tail once again arfarf the rest of it is fine type that up for mr parker are you sure you want to do that mr president secretary of state natalie cohen asked the president ignored her and gestured for parker to leave the office then he turned to hamilton okay colonel now lets have the bad news hamilton inhaled audibly before he began to speak i think we have to presume mr president that the attack on the establishmentthe laboratoryslashmanufacturing facilityin the congo was not successful there is a quantityi have no idea how muchof congox in unknown hands how do you know that the president asked softly because a quantity of itseveral kilograms plus another several kilograms of infected tissuewas delivered to me at fort detrick this morning it is identical to the congox and the infected tissue i brought out of the congo where did it come from the president asked then interrupted himself no tell me what this stuffcongoxis and what it does i dont know what it is im working on that as to what it does it causes disseminated intravascular coagulation acronym dic and can you tell me what that means in laymans terms dic is a thrombohemorrhagic disorder characterized by primary thrombotic and secondary hemorrhagic diathesis usually fatal try it again colonel the president ordered not unpleasantly and this time in laymans terms yes sir dic is sometimes called consumptive coagulopathy since excessive intravascular coagulation leads to consumption of platelets and nonenzymatic coagulation factors the president interrupted hamilton by holding up his hand and shaking his head you might as well be speaking greek colonel try it again please keeping in mind that youre dealing with a simple country boy from alabama yes sir hamilton said paused in thought and then announced almost happily sir dic causes coagulation to run amok coagulation as in blood hamilton nodded go down that road colonel and see where it takes us the president said coagulation is the process in this connection which causes liquid human blood to turn into a soft semisolid mass he looked at the president to see if the president was still with him the president responded by smiling encouragingly and making a gesture with both hands for him to continue if you think of the vascular system of the body mr president as a series of interconnected garden hoses and of the heart as a pump that pushes blood through that system he paused to see if his student was still with him and when the president nodded went on imagine if you will sir that the blood is transformed into a very thick mud the pump cannot push the mass through the vascular system it is overwhelmed it stops and death occurs by what a layman might call a heart attack that too mr president hamilton said that too the president parroted the mud the nowcoagulated blood then begins to attack the garden hose as sort of a parasite it feeds on it so to speak eats it you mean hamilton nodded and when its finished so to speak with the vascular system it begins to feed on the other tissues of the body in some sort of unusual enzymatic manner which i have so far been unable to pin down youd better run that past me again colonel the president said enzymatic manner hamilton considered for a moment the level of knowledge the president might have think of meat tenderizer mr president do you know how that works i cant say that i do clendennen confessed meatand that would of course include human fleshis held together by a complex protein called collagen this makes it quite tough to chew in the raw state ive noticed the president drawled dryly cooking destroys these proteins making the meat chewable but so does contact with certain enzymes most commonly ones extracted from the papaya these proteolytic enzymes break the peptide bonds between the amino acids found in complex proteins such as flesh what youre saying is that congox is some sort of meat tenderizer the president asked why is that so dangerous unlike the enzymatic tenderizers one finds in the supermarket which lose their strength after attacking the peptide bonding between the amino acids of meat the congox enzymesif they are indeed enzymes and i am not yet prepared to make that callseem to gather strength from the collagens they attack in a manner of speaking they are nurtured by it what happens when they run out of meat the president asked and then corrected himself out of something to eat hamilton didnt answer directly grocery store tenderizer doesnt work on bones he said congox does whenever it finishes turning the meat into sort of a mushperhaps strengthened by taking nutrition from that processit attacks bones they are turned into mush when the entire process is completed what is left is a semisolid residue which then enters sort of a coma forgive the crudeness mr president but what remains bears a strong physical resemblance to what one might pass when suffering from diarrhea a semisolid brown or brownish black mass and what happens to that it apparently receives enough nutrients from the atmosphere to maintain lifei hesitate to use that term but i cannot think of anotherfor an indefinite period if it is touched by flesh the process begins again the only way it is contagious so to speak is if theres physical contact with it is that what youre saying when it is in the dormant coma stage yes sir but when it is feeding so to speak on flesh it gives off microscopic particles which if inhaled also start the degenerative process how can it be killed my initial tests suggest the only way it can be killed is by thorough incineration at temperatures over a thousand degrees centigrade the residue i am coming to believe may then be encased in a nonporous container glass or some type of ceramic would work i think but there one would have the risk of the glass or ceramic breaking aluminum seems to form a satisfactory barrier as a matter of fact i used simple aluminum foil to isolate the material i brought out of the congo i had nothing else and the congox material that was sent to my laboratory today was wrapped in aluminum foil like a christmas turkey president clendennen asked more like i would say mr president cold cuts from a delicatessen very carefully so there was little or no risk that the foil could be torn the people who sent me the congox obviously seem to know what they are doing and who would you guess colonel were the people who sent you the congox more importantly why do you think they did ive given that some thought mr president hamilton said and the tone of impatience in the presidents voice was clearly evident they wanted us to know that the attack on the fish farm was unsuccessful hamilton said that they have congox we have to presume they know a great deal more about it than i have been able to learn in the few days ive had to work with it they are making the point that the threat which existed before we learned of the fish farm and attempted to destroy it exists now why wouldnt they try to keep that secret so they would have the element of surprise if they decide to use congox on us thats the question to which i have given the most thought hamilton said it was selfevident that they wanted us to know we failed and that they have congox the question is why thats the question i asked colonel the president said i think they want something from us hamilton said very seriously and what colonel do you think that might be i have no idea hamilton said absolutely no idea president clendennen looked around the oval office the honorable natalie cohen secretary of state ambassador charles m montvale director of national intelligence the honorable john j powell director of the central intelligence agency and the honorable mason andrews assistant secretary of the department of homeland security were sitting on the chairs and couches around a glasstopped coffee table not one had said a word during the bad news exchange between the president and colonel hamilton odd clendennen said to them i would have bet two bits to a doughnut that yall would be falling all over yourselves to offer sage political advice and profound philosophical opinions concerning our little dilemma no one responded the president grunted then announced one i believe everything colonel hamilton has told us about this terrible substance two we are not about to react to this threat the way my predecessor did we bombed everything in a twentysquaremile area of the congo into small pieces and then incinerated the pieces since somebody still has enough of a supply of this stuff to share it with us i think we have to concede that the only thing that bombing did was bring us within a cats whisker of a nuclear exchange and give those people who dont like us much anyway good reason to like us even less so what were going to do now is proceed very carefully and only when were absolutely sure of what were doing i will now entertain suggestions as to how we can do this he paused and then went on you first andrews there was no immediate reply well the president pursued not very pleasantly mr president mason andrews said in addition to the obvious i think we have whats the obvious the president interrupted well we have to decide whether we are going to raise the threat level to orange or perhaps red i tend to think the latter not we have to decide the president said i have to decide somebody tell me why raising the threat level from yellow wouldnt cause more problems than it would solve he looked around the oval office comments anyone there were none what else is obvious the president demanded well sir we have to find out who sent this stuff to the colonel andrews said first of all it wasnt sent to colonel hamilton the president said it was sent to us the government me as president not to colonel hamilton it was sent through him because these bastards somehow knew he was the only man around who would know what it was and they knew he would tell me secondly at this momentand i realize this could change in the blink of an eyethere is no immediate threat if these people wanted to start killing americans they would have already done so mr president ambassador montvale offered their intention might be to cause panic clendennen nodded thats what im thinking and im not going to give them that thats why the threat level stays at yellow the president was then silent visibly in thought for a long moment then he cocked his head to one side a smile crossed his lips as if to signify he was pleased with himself he said fully aware that this is politically incorrect i have just profiled the bastards who sent colonel hamilton the congox i have decided that the congox was sent to the colonel by a foreign power or at the direction of a foreign power or powers and not for example by the rotary club of enterprise alabama or any sister or brother organization to which the rotarians may be connected however remotely ambassador montvales eyes widened and for a moment he seemed to be on the edge of saying something in the end he remained silent the ramifications of this decision the president went on are that finding out who these bastards areand it is to be hoped what the hell this is all aboutfalls into what i think of as the cias area of responsibility rather than that of the fbi or the department of homeland security he looked at dci powell those are your marching orders jack get onto it i will have the attorney general direct the fbi to assist you in any area in which you need help mr president with all respect mason andrews said this crime this threat to american security took place on american soil this situation is clearly within the purview of homeland sec what situation andrews the president interrupted him what threat to american security no one has been hurt whats happened is that a securely wrapped package of what the colonel has determined to be what he calls congox was sent to colonel hamilton in a container clearly marked as a biological hazard thats all there has been no damage to anyone not even a threat of causing damage if we had these people in handcuffs theres nothing we could do to them because they havent broken any laws that i can think of what we are not repeat not going to do is go off halfcocked for example we are not going to resurrect my predecessors private james bondwhats his name costelloand his band of assassins and give them carte blanche to roam the world to kill people or anything like that what we are going to do is have montvalehe is the director of national intelligencevery quietly try to find out who the hell these bastards are and what they want i think colonel hamilton is right about that they want something that means they will probablyalmost certainlycontact colonel hamilton again what that means since we cant afford to have anything happen to him is that homeland security is going to wrap the colonel in a secret service security blanket at least as thick as the one around me thats your role in this andrews thats your only role and then were going to wait for their next move no action of any kind will be taken without my express approval the president met the eyes of everyone in the oval office and then quietly asked is there anyone who doesnt understand what i have just said there were no replies that will be all thank you the president said one the hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary february the silver twomonthold topoftheline mercedesbenz s drove regally across the szabadsag hid and on the other side of the danube river turned left toward the hotel gellert which was at the foot of the gellert hill budapest which began as two villages buda and pest on opposite sides of the danube river had a long and bloody history gellert hill for example got its name from saint gerard gellert an italian bishop from venice whom the pagans ceremoniously murdered there in ad for trying to bring the natives to jesus buda and pest were both destroyed by the mongols who invaded the area in the villages were rebuilt only to suffer rape and ethnic cleansing when the ottoman turks came conquering pest in and buda fifteen years later by the time the szabadsag hid was built in the villages had been combined into budapest and hungary had become part of the austrohungarian empire emperor franz josef personally inserted the last riveta silver rivetinto the new bridge and then with imperial immodesty named the structure after himself the bridge itself was droppedlike all the other bridges across the danubeinto the river when the russians and the germans fought over hungary during the second world war it was the first bridge rebuilt after the war by the sovietcontrolled government and named the liberty bridge when the russians were finally evicted it became the freedom bridge the silver mercedesbenz turned off the road running alongside the danube and onto the access road to the hotel gellert then stopped gustav a barrelchested man in his fifties who appeared to be a chauffeur but served as a bodyguard and more got quickly out from behind the wheel and opened the rear passenger door a tall man who looked to be in his midsixties got out he adjusted a broadbrimmed jetblack hatone side of the brim down the other rakishly upand then turned back to the car bending over leaning into the car when he came out he had two bouvier des flandres dogs the larger a bitch was several times the size of a very large boxer the other was her son a puppy on a leash the puppy was about the size of a small boxer as the man had taken them from the car another burly man in his sixties had gotten out the other side of the car carrying an erminecollared black leather overcoat the burly mans name was sandor tor in his youth tor had done a hitchrising to sergeantin the french foreign legion on his return to budapest he had become a policeman he had been recruited into the avh the allamvedelmi hatosag hungarys hated secret police and again had risen to sergeant when the russians had been driven from budapest and known members of the allamvedelmi hatosag were being spat on and hung mussolinistyle en masse from any convenient streetlight tor had found sanctuary in the american embassy and only then had the cia revealed to the new leaders of hungary the identity of the man who had not only saved the lives of so many anticommunists and resistance leadersby warning them via the cia that the avh was onto thembut also had been one of the rareand certainly the most reliablesources of information about the inner workings of the avh which hed gained at great risk to his life from his trusted position within the secret police thus the best that sandor tor could have hoped for had he been exposed was a quick death from avh torture rather than a slow one tor was decorated by the hungarian government and appointed as inspector of police but that despite having triumphed over the forces of evil didnt turn out to be a movie scenario in which he lived happily ever after there were several facets of this for one his peers in the police reasoning that if he had been keeping a record of the unsavory activities of the avh it was entirely likely that he would keep a record of theirs both feared and shunned him and tor didnt like being a cop without an agenda he had done what he had done not only because he hated the communists generally but specifically because his mother and father and two brothers had been slowly strangled to death in the basement of the avh headquarters at andrassy ut getting back at the communists was one thing spending long hours trying to arrest burglarsfor that matter even murdererswas something else and his wife margo had cancer they had had no children he applied for early retirement and it was quickly granted sitting around the apartment with nothing to do but watch cancer work its cruelty on margo was difficult then tor heard of the return to budapest of the german firm gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh the companys intention was to reclaim the propertiesfarms a brewery several vineyards a newspaper business and other assetsseized from them by the communists he also heard they were looking for someone to head their security after he filled out an application form at gossinger gmbhs newly reopened downtown offices he heard nothing for three weeks and had decided that they werent interested in his services then there was a telephone call saying that if he was still interested a car would pick him up in an hour and take him for an interview he almost didnt go margo had insisted and he went the cara new topoftheline mercedes with vienna platestook him to the legendary hotel gellert at szent gellert ter overlooking the danube river from the gellert hill tor thought he would be interviewed probably in the restaurant or the bar by a personnel officer of the gossinger organization instead he was led to the elevator which carried him to a top floor apartment overlooking the danube which apparently occupied that entire corner of the building an interior door opened and an enormous dog came out walked to him sniffed him then sat down normally tor was not afraid of dogs but this one frightened him he thought it had to weigh well over fifty kilos even when the dog offered his paw he thought carefully before squatting to take it you come well recommended said a voice in hungarian with a budapester accent max usually shows his teeth to people he doesnt like often they wet their pants tor had looked up to see a tall silverhaired man who seemed to be in his sixties standing in the doorway my name is eric kocian the man said come in well talk and have a drink he opened the door wide and waved tor inside a spacious and wellfurnished apartment kocian walked to a sideboard and turned holding a bottle in his hand wild turkey rare breed all right with you he asked i dont know what it is tor confessed one of the very few things the americans do superbly is make bourbon whisky this is one of the better bourbon whiskys my godson gave me a case for my seventyseventh birthday seventyseventh birthday tor had thought my god hes that old sir i dont know im supposed to be interviewed for a job and so you are dont you drink yes sir i drink good my experience has been you cant trust people who dont kocian poured him a large squarish glass halffull of the bourbon whisky this is what they call sipping whisky but if you want water and ice kocian pointed to the sideboard this is fine thank you tor said may i ask about your wife how is she how does he know about my margo not very well im afraid kocian waved him into a leatherupholstered armchair and seated himself in an identical chair facing it if you decide to take this position kocian announced she will be covered under our medical care program most german physicians are insufferably arrogant and tend to regard their patients as laboratory specimens but they seem to know what theyre doing maybe theyll have answers you havent been able to find here am i being offered the position tor asked on the cusp of incredulity i have one or two other quick questions first kocian said quick questions but you dont know anything about me i know just about everything about you that interests me kocian said are you still on the cias payroll i was never on their payroll tor said thats not what i have been led to understand i never took a cent if i had been exposed they promised to try to get margo out of hungary and give her some sort of pension but you thought before the avh arrested you they would have arrested her for her value in your interrogation so you didnt give it much thought tor nodded i would have to have your word that you would no longer cooperate with the cia in any way i havent talked to anyone in the cia for over a year that wasnt my question i can promise you that tor said no cooperation with the cia welcome to the executive ranks of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh just like that tor asked and then blurted we havent even talked about what im going to do or how much what you are going to do is relieve me of keeping hungarian fingers out of my cash box prying eyes out of any part of our business provide such other security as i deem necessary and keep otto gorner off my back so far as compensation is concerned i suggest that twice what you were being paid as an inspector would be a reasonable starting salary there are of course some perks as my godson would say including an expense account and a car tor knew that otto gorner was the managing director of the gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh empire but who is this godson youve mentioned your godson twice where does he fit in here his name is karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger youre a policeman is that enough of a clue for you tor chuckled you know who otto gorner is tor nodded otto has the odd notion that i have to be protected from myself and others in particular the russians he has managed to convince my godson of this nonsense it will be your job to convince both of them that you are doing so while at the same time making sure that whomever you charge with protecting me from the russians and myself are invisible to me yes sir let me top that off kocian said tor looked at his glass and was surprised to see that it was nearly empty he didnt remember taking one sip sandor tor had been director of security for gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh hungary for six months when margo died the doctors in germany with great regret had been unable to do anything for her when it was apparent the end was near margo asked to be returned from berlin to budapest so that she could die in her own bed eric kocian and a medical team from telki private hospitalbudapests bestwere waiting with an ambulance at the keleti palyaudvar railway station staff from the kitchen of the hotel gellert was waiting at the tor apartment margo died at four in the morning the next day at the time her husband was asleep in a chair at one side of her bed and eric kocian was asleep in another chair on the other side of the bed margo was buried the next day beside sandors mother and father in the farkasreti cemetery in buda the western part of budapest tor had foundnot without great effortwhere their communist murderers had disposed of their bodies and had them exhumed and reinterred in the farkasreti cemetery he never learned what had happened to the bodies of his murdered brothers when margos crypt had been cemented closed eric kocian had said you dont want to go back to your apartment come with me and well have a drink they had gone to the hotel gellert and stayed drunk together for four days sometime during that period sandor had realized that while he might now be alone in the world except for his employerfriend eric kocian eric kocian was similarly alone in the world except for his godson whom he apparently rarely saw and his friendemployee sandor tor early in the morning of their fifth day together sandor tor led eric kocian to the thermal bathsbuilt by the romansbelow the hotel where they soaked had a massage and soaked again and then they had a haircut and shave at noon they were at work sandor returned only once to the apartment he had shared with margo he selected the furniture he wanted to keep and had it moved to the gellert where kocian had arranged an apartment for him on the floor below his own sandor tor draped the erminecollared black leather overcoat over eric kocians shoulders the bitch who answered to the name madchen headed for a row of shrubbery to meet the call of nature kocian led the puppy named max to the shrubbery you and gustav go to bed kocian ordered ill see you in the morning tor got back in the mercedes which then carried him to the hotel entrance when gustav had parked the cara spot near the door was reserved for ithe followed tor into the hotel lobby gustav got on the elevator to check the apartment out before kocian got there and tor walked to a column and stood behind it in a position from which he could watch kocian enter the lobby and get on the elevator kocian came through the door four minutes later and walked toward the elevator bank a tall welldressed man who had been sitting in an armchair reading the budapester tages zeitung suddenly dropped the newspaper to the floor and walked quickly to where kocian was waiting for the elevator where in the name of the goddamn virgin mary and all the fucking saints did that sonofabitch come from tor had almost made it to the bank of elevators when the door opened gustav saw him coming and stopped then stepped back against the elevators rear wall kocian madchen and max got on the elevator tor followed i thought i told you to go to bed kocian said tor took a micro uzi from his underthearm holster held it at his side and then pushed the button which would send the elevator to the top floor i mean herr kocian no harm the tall welldressed man said in german and then repeated it in hungarian the elevator door closed and the elevator began to rise pat him tor ordered now raising the muzzle of the micro uzi gustav quickly but unhurriedly thoroughly frisked the tall welldressed man nothing gustav said referring to weapons but he now held a russian diplomatic passport a hungarian foreign ministryissued diplomats carnet a plasticsealed card about the size of a drivers license and a businesssize envelope he examined the carnet saw that it read commercial counselor russian embassy and then handed the carnet to tor actually im colonel vladlen solomatin of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki the tall welldressed man then said in hungarian and for the third time said i mean herr kocian no harm youre from the sluzhba vneshney razvedki kocian asked in russian its the foreign intelligence service of the russian federation colonel solomatin said yes i am i know what the svr is colonel kocian said the elevator door opened kocian looked over his shoulder to make sure there was no one in the landing foyer and then backed out of the elevator motioning for solomatin to follow him put the elevator out of service kocian ordered i mean you no harm herr kocian solomatin said again you keep saying that kocian replied what is it you do want from me colonel vladlen solomatin of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki a service sir your help in righting a great wrong specifically solomatin turned to the chauffeur who was still holding solomatins diplomatic passport and the envelope he reached for the envelope may i he asked gustav looked to kocian for guidance kocian nodded and gustav allowed solomatin to take the envelope solomatin removed a letter from the envelope and extended them to kocian i am asking that you get this to colonel berezovsky or lieutenant colonel alekseeva kocian read the letter sluzhba vneshney razvedki february yasenevo kolpachny moscow tel moscow second directorate colonel v n solomatin my dear cousin dmitri gods blessings and the warmest greetings to you lora sofya and svetlana i am very happy to be able to tell you that the committee has finally reached the only conclusions that they could in the circumstances that the charges of embezzlement of state funds laid against you and svetlana were without any basis in fact that the late colonel evgeny evgenyvich alekseev who laid the charges against you both was at the time bereft of his senses more than likely suffering from paranoia and had been so suffering for a considerable period of time possibly as much as a year or even longer that while it was clearly the responsibility of the both of you to bring your suspicions regarding colonel alekseevs instability to the attention of general yakov sirinov your failure to do so in the circumstances and your vacating your posts without authority was understandable other points made during the committee hearing by general sirinov put to rest once and for all the allegation that you defected if they intended to defect the general said they would not have left with only the clothing on their backs and what cash they had in their pockets and if they had wound up in the hands of mi or the cia even involuntarily you know our people would have told us at the conclusion of the committee hearing general sirinov was ordered to do whatever was necessary to locate you make you aware of what has happened and to bring you home he has delegated that responsibility to me telling the committee that if he were you or svetlana the only person he would trust would be me i have been given the authority to take any steps i consider necessary embassies of the russian federation worldwide have been directed to provide you with whatever you need including funds and to facilitate your return to the motherland in this connection when i suggested to general sirinov that considering what injustices had occurred you and svetlana might question even my motives he said he would have no objection to your leaving lora and sofya wherever they may be for the time being and directed me to provide funds for their support they can join you here when you are satisfied that you have been welcomed home as loyal russians i really hope to see all of you here together soon may god protect you both on your return journey your loving cousin vladlen as kocian handed the letter to sandor tor he said i have no idea who either of these people are colonel please herr kocian solomatin said i am really trying to help them to right an injustice well kocian said dryly the sluzhba vneshney razvedki does have a certain reputation for causing injustices but this is the first ive ever heard of them trying to right any he shook his head sorry colonel i cant help you herr kocian the last confirmed sighting of colonel berezovsky his wife and daughter and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva was when they got on lieutenant colonel castillos airplane at schwechat airfield in vienna kocian looked him in the eyes and said colonel castillo someone else i never heard of the colonel is sometimes still known by the name he was given at his christening karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger inasmuch as you stood as one of his godfathers herr kocian i find it hard to believe youve forgotten kocian didnt respond herr kocian i swear before god and by all thats sacred to me that i am telling you the truth and i am begging you to help me kocian said nothing will you at least get the letter to colonel castillo solomatin asked plaintively after a long moment kocian said gustav please be good enough to escort colonel solomatin to his car give him back his passport and carnet and the letter gustav asked kocian looked at the letter for a long moment and then folded it and put it in his jacket pocket he walked toward the door to his apartment thank you herr kocian may god shower you with his blessings solomatin said gustav motioned for him to get back on the elevator when gustav walked into kocians apartment a half hour later the old man was sitting in a charles eames chair with his feet on its footstool holding a glass of whisky madchen lay beside him max was sitting beside tor his head cocked as if to ask what the hell are you doing tor was sitting on a louis xvi chair that looked to be of questionable strength to support his bulk a section of a bookcase that lined that wall of kocians sitting room had been swung open revealing a hidden compartment with a communications device on a custombuilt shelf tor had fed the communications device the letter solomatin had given kocian and now took it from the device and walked to kocian and handed it to him there was no car outside gustav said i offered him a ride to wherever he wanted to go he accepted and said the russian embassy a volkswagen with diplomatic plates got on my tail as we got off the szabadsag hid and followed us to baiza what i think is there were two cars that one and anotheror at least some russian sonofabitch with a cell phonehere they were waiting for us at the bridge and what happened at baiza kocian asked referencing the embassy of the russian federation at baiza budapest he got out of the car and walked to the gate the gate opened for him before he got there they expected him when i looked in the mirror the volkswagen that had been on my tail was gone kocian waved the letter solomatin had given him did you get a good look at this gustav when gustav shook his head kocian handed it to him and gustav read it well kocian said gustav shook his head again i dont have a clue he said except if i have to say this it smells you dont think the svr forgives defectors tor said sarcastically gustav gestured toward the communications device what does herr gossinger think there is one flaw in that miraculous device kocian said it doesnt work unless the party youre calling answers which my godson has not yet done he paused pointed to the telephone on the table near him and said see if you can get him on the horn sandor try the house in pilar tor rose from his fragilelooking chair walked to the couch by the phone sat heavily down then from memory punched in a long number on the keypad he held the receiver to his ear what time is it in buenos aires kocian asked its after midnight here so a little after eight tor said then added its ringing and handed the receiver to kocian kocian reached over to the table and pushed the phone bases speakerphone button hola a male voice answered with whom am i speaking kocian asked in passable spanish who are you calling im trying to get carlos castillo he doesnt seem to be answering his other telephone you have the wrong number senor the man said and broke the connection sonofabitch hung up on me kocian said handing the receiver back to tor tor turning away so that kocian would not see his smile punched in the number again waited for the ring and then hit the speakerphone button hola my name is eric kocian i need to speak to carlos castillo and dont tell me i have the wrong damn number how are you herr kocian the male voice said politely sorry i didnt recognize your voice i should have given you my name kocian said paul sieno right yes sir i thought i recognized your voice when you told me i had the wrong number kocian said is carlos handy actually sir hes not where is he can you give me a better number i dont have one sir thats unusual isnt it charleys flyfishing with his girlfriend in patagonia herr kocian what did you say charley went fishing with his girlfriend herr kocian in patagonia he left word not to bother him unless the sun went out what if i told you this is very important paul and what girlfriend would that be i can get word to him herr kocian maybe tonight and certainly by morning and the girlfriend there was a long pause then paul said herr kocian if you dont know about sweaty im sorry but youre not going to hear it from me are you telling me hes drunk and off in the woods with some floozy some floozy named sweaty thats what you said her name is right sweaty well i can tell you hes probably not drunk because sweaty doesnt like him to drink too much and that i can get word to him to call you probably tonight and certainly by morning your afcs working right as a matter of fact paul my miraculous afc communications device is not working at all the reason i called on the

addressee to see it until carlos has got it sieno said and then there goes the afc mr kocian it shows you as online im ready to receive send the message it came through fine herr kocian paul sieno

my best regards to mrs sieno will do sieno said then gave the afc the order break it down the green led indicating the afc was connected to another afc device at encryption level one went out two club america miami international airport concourse f miami florida february roscoe j danton of the washington timespost was not in a very good mood eagleeyed officials of the transportation security administration had detected a colibri butane cigar lighter and a nearly new bottle of boss cologne in his carryon luggage and triumphantly seized both the discovery had then triggered a detailed examination of the rest of the contents of his carryon luggage this had uncovered a bic butane cigarette lighter in his laptop case and three boxes of wooden matches from the old ebbitt grill in his briefcaseovernight bag two small boxes of matches he was told he should have known was the limit with the proof before them that they had in their hands if not an al qaeda terrorist cleverly disguised as a thirtyeightyearold presbyterian from chevy chase maryland then at the very least what they categorized as an uncooperative traveler the tsa officers had then thoroughly examined his person to make sure that he wasnt trying to conceal anything elsea rocketpropelled grenade launcher for examplein his ear canal or another body orifice with no rpg or other potential weapon found he was finally freed dantonconvinced that his near crimes and misdemeanors had probably caused him to miss aerolineas argentinas flight nonstop service to buenos aireshad then run all the way down concourse f to gate hoping to be proven wrong there he learned that technical difficulties of an unspecified nature were going to delay the departure of flight for at least two hours as he walked the long way back down the concourse to the club america he recalled that c harry whelan had called miami international airport americas token third world airport say what you want about harryand theres a lot all bad to be said about harrybut the sonofabitch does have a way with words which is probably why hes always on wolf news i wonder what they pay him for that roscoe found a seat from which he could have a good view of one of the television sets hanging from the ceiling then he made three trips to the bar ultimately returning to his seat with two glasses of scotch whisky a glass of water a glass of ice cubes a bowl of mixed nuts and a bowl of potato chips then he settled in for the long wait when he looked up at the television he saw c harry whelan in conversation with andy mcclarren the anythingbutamiable star of wolf newss most popular program the straight scoop the screen was split on the right mcclarren and whelan were shown sitting at a desk looking at a television monitor on the left was what they were watching at least two dozen police cars and ambulances almost all with their emergency lights flashing looking as if they were trying to get past some sort of gate a curved sign mounted over the gate read welcome to fort detrick their passage was blocked by three us army hmmwvs each mounting a caliber machine gun hmmwv stood for highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle with the acronym a little hard to pronounce the trucks were therefore commonly referred to as humvees that was the scene earlier today at fort detrick harry andy mcclarren said can you give us the straight scoop on what the hell was going on youre not supposed to say naughty words on television roscoe thought as he sipped his scotch but i guess if youre andy mcclarren host of the mostwatched television news show you can get away with a hell every once in a while a lot of arfarf whelan said what the hell does that mean careful andy thats two hells probably the most you can get away with three hells like three small boxes of wooden matches will see the federal government landing on you in righteous indignation thats the soundyouve heard itdogs make when chasing their tails you said that earlier today didnt you yes i did to describe various senior bureaucrats rushing around chasing their tails and so did president clendennen or his spokesman whatshisname john david parker whelan offered more or less fondly known as porky okay so porky said the press was playing arfarf too which meant they were chasing their tails right and so they were andy do you really want to know what i think went on over there i want the straight scoop mcclarren said thats what we call the show okay take notes there will be a quiz whelan said you know andy right that the united states has vowed never to use biological weapons against our enemies uhhuh this was largely because senator homer johns the junior senator from new hampshire thinks that while it is perfectly all right to shoot our enemies or drop a bomb on them it is unspeakably evil to use poison gas or some kind of biological weapon on them you think poison gas is okay harry i think poison gas and biological weapons are terrible whelan said but lets talk about poison gas in world war one the germans used poison gas on us and we used it on them it was terrible in world war two the germans didnt use poison gas and neither did we you ever wonder why youre going to tell me right because between the two wars the army developed some really effective poison gas when we got in the war and american troops were sent to europe so were maybe a halfdozen ships loaded with the new poison gas we got word to the germans that we wouldnt use our poison gas first but if they did we were prepared to gas every last one of them they got the message poison gas was never used interesting then science came up with biological weapons our army in my judgment wisely began to experiment with biological weapons this happened at an obscure little army base called fort detrick the idea was that if our enemieswere talking about russia hereknew we really had firstclass biological weapons they would be reluctant to use their biological weapons on us like the atom bomb harry whelan nodded like atomic bombs andy we werent nuked by the russians because they knew that if they did then moscow would go up in a mushroom cloud they called that mutual assured destruction the same theory was then applied to biological and chemical weapons then we had a president running for reelection senator johns and his pals thought painting him as a dangerous warmonger would see their guy in the white house when the incumbent president saw in the polls that this was working he quickly announced that he was unilaterally taking the united states out of the chemicalbiological warfare mutual destruction game he announced we wouldnt use them period and ordered the destruction of all such weapons sitting around in ordnance warehouses this saw him reelected but johns wouldnt let him forget his campaign promise so the armys biological warfare laboratories at fort detrick were closed and the fort became the home of the us army medical research and materiel command what could be more opposite to biological warfare than medical research even senator johns was satisfied that the forces of virtue had triumphed and we would never use evil biological warfare against our enemies but army medical research should it seemed logical to assume concern itself with what would happen to our soldierseven our civilian populationshould our enemies use biological warfare against us with that in mind the medical corps began to study the biological weapons in the russian inventory if they knew what the russians were going to use against us we could come up with antidotes et cetera how would we know what biological weapons the russians had enter the cia really harry whelan nodded again they bribed the appropriate russian scientists and soon samples of the russian biological inventory began to arrive at fort detrick for evaluation by the medical corps since it was the cias duty to evaluate the efficacy of enemy weapons and since the best place to determine that was fort detrick and since the medical corps was a little short of funds the cia thought it only fair that they pay for the investigation this had the additional benefitsince cia expenditures are classifiedof keeping senator johns and his pals from learning what was going on getting the picture andy thats a hell of an accusation harry whelan did not reply directly and inasmuch as the cia was interested in knowing how soon the united states could respond in kind to a biological attack they asked the medical personnel at fort detrick to determine how the russian biological weapons were manufactured and to estimate how long it would takeshould the unthinkable happenfor us to get our manufacture of such up and running or even to compare the russian biological weapons against our own from the bad old dayssamples of our own had been retained for laboratory purposesand see how long it would take to start to manufacture whichever seemed to be the most lethal what youre suggesting harry andy mcclarren said solemnly is that the cia once again was engaged in doing things theyre not supposed to once again doing things that the congress had forbidden them to do you sound like senator johns andy and once again youre both wrong the cia has the responsibilitygiven them by congressto find out as much as they can about our enemies capabilities and intentions thats what they werearedoing at fort detrick and thank god that they are give me a forexample harry mcclarren said thickly sarcastic how about a hypothetical andy shoot lets suppose that the cia which really is not nearly as incompetent as you and people like senator johns think it isor for that matter as incompetent as the cia wants people like you and johns and our enemies to think it is run that past me again harry mcclarren said they call that disinformation andy the less competent our enemies think the cia is the less they worry about it can i get back to my hypothetical why not mcclarren said visibly miffed lets say the cia heard that the bad guys say the russians were operating a secret biological weapons factory in some remote corner of the world youre talking about that alleged biological weapons factory in the congo mcclarren challenged whelan ignored the interruption he went on and they looked into it and found that there was indeed a secret factory in that remote corner of the world making what mcclarren challenged more than a little nastily they didnt know so what they did was go to this remote corner of the world why dont you just say the congo harry if that makes you happy andy lets say hypothetically speaking of course that the incompetent cia went to the congo and violating the laws of the sovereign state of the republic of the congo broke into this factory and came out with samples of what the factory was producing ha mcclarren snorted and took it to fort detrick where it was examined by the medical corps scientists and that these scientists concluded that what the cia had brought to them was really bad stuff and lets say that the cia took this intelligence to the president not this one his predecessor and lets say the president believed what the cia was telling him what he should have done was call in the secretary of state and tell her to go to the un and demand an emergency meeting of the security council to deal with the problem now lets say for the purpose of this hypothetical forexample that the president realized hethe countrywas facing what they call a real and present danger and also that the minute he brought to the attention of the united nations what the cia had learned the bad guys would learn we knew what they were up to by the time the bluehelmet keystone kops of the un went to the congo to investigate these outrageous allegationsand this is presuming the russians andor the chinese didnt use their veto against using the blue helmetsthe factory would either have disappeared or been converted to a fish farm so he acted unilaterally and thank god he had the cojones to do so and it doesnt bother you harry that he had no right to do anything like that we could have found ourselves in a war a nuclear war that takes an act of congress youre dead wrong about that too andy whelan said patronizingly rather than argumentatively whether he did so without thinking about it or with the intention of annoyingeven angeringmcclarren it caused the latter reaction the one thing andy mcclarren could not stand would not tolerate was being patronized his face whitened and his lips grew thin how so he asked very softly under the war powers actim really surprised you dont know this andy i thought everybody didthe president as commander in chief has the authority to use military force for up to thirty days whenever he feels its necessary he has to tell congress hes done so and if they dont vote to support him within those thirty days the president has to recall the troops but for thirty days he can do whatever he wants damn it andy mcclarren thought as his face turned red the president does have that authority under the war powers act either this condescending smartass just set me up to make an ass of myself orworsewithout any assistance from him i just revealed my ignorance before three point five million viewers the only thing that can make this worse is for me to lose my temper whelan went on so you see andy in this hypothetical forexample were talking about the president did have the authority to do what he did mcclarren knocked over one of the two microphones on the desk they were props rather than working microphones but mcclarrens three point five million viewers didnt know this mcclarren thought jesus what can i do for an encore spill coffee in my lap whalen smiled at him sympathetically and went on he didnt have to ask congress for anything the whole event was over in three days what they call a fait accompli andy mcclarren straightened the microphone and then flashed whelan a brilliant smile i dont believe a word of that harry he said you werent expected to whalen responded every bit as condescendingly as before it was all hypothetical andy all you were supposed to do was think about it what im wondering is what all your hypothetical stuff has to do with all those police cars at the gate of fort detrick have you got the straight scoop on that or just more hypothesis he made hypothesis sound like a dirty word well andy my gut feelingmy hypothesis if you preferis that when porky parker made his statement he was doing something he doesnt often do which was porky was telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth there was some kind of accident in one of the laboratories somebody dropped an erlenmeyer flask on the floor six white mice or a couple of monkeys escaped their cages i have no idea what something happened the material in those labs is really dangerous they did what they were supposed to do they declared a potentialoperative word potentialdisaster the post was closed down until the problem could be dealt with when it was dealt with they called off the emergency procedures while all this was going on the cia and homeland security and every police force between here and baltimore started chasing their tailsarfarfand when the evervigilant press got wind of this they got in their helicopters and flew to fort detrick where they chased their tails in the skyarfarfuntil they were run off if there was any danger to anyone at fort detrick today it was from the clowns in the helicopters nearly running into each other the army scientists there know what theyre doing that could be i suppose andy mcclarren said very dubiously but what i would like to know is roscoe j danton saw the image of mcclarren on the club america tv replaced with an image of the logotype of aerolineas argentinas and a notice announcing the immediate departure of aerolineas argentinas flight nonstop service to buenos aires from gate christ danton complained out loud they told me it was delayed for at least two hours he stood up and a firm believer in the adage that if one wastes not one wants not drained his drinks the aerolineas argentinas announcement then was replaced first with the whirling globes of wolf news and then by the image of an aged former star of television advising people of at least sixtytwo years of age of the many benefits of reverse mortgages roscoe who had been hoping to get another glimpse of the royally pissedoff andy mcclarren said shit then he hurriedly walked out of club america one united statesmexico border near mcallen texas february what the fuck is that united states border patrol agent guillermo amarilla inquired in spanish of senior patrol agent hector hernandez as the latter stepped hard on the brakes of their green jeep station wagon the station wagon skidded on the rutted dirt road coming to a stop at nearly a right angle on one side of the road was a sugarcane field on the other was waisthigh brush the brush extended for about one hundred fifty yards ending at the bank of the rio grande the demarcation line between the united states and the estados unidos mexicanos was at the center of the river which at that point was just over one hundred yards wide the dirt road ten yards from where the jeep had stopped was blocked an oblong insulated metal box was sitting on a plank suspended between two plastic fivegallon jerrycans nailed to the plank was a large sign handletteredpeligroso anddanger amarilla and hernandez without speaking were out of the vehicle in seconds both held remington model gauge pump shotguns crouching beside the station wagon hernandez carefully examined the brush and amarilla the sugarcane field undocumented immigrants sometimes vented their displeasure with border patrol agents efficiency by ambushing border patrol vehicles amarilla straightened up and continued looking after perhaps sixty seconds he asked you hear anything hernandez shook his head and stood erect you think thats a wetback ied amarilla asked both men had done tours with their national guard units in iraq and had experience with improvised explosive devices it could be a fucking bomb guillermo i dont see any wires amarilla said you dont think a cell phone would work out here hernandez sought the answer to his own question by taking his cell phone out of his shirt pocket cell phones work out here he announced maybe they left guillermo offered and maybe theyre waiting for us to get closer should i put a couple of loads in it and see what happens no it could be full of cold beer these fuckers would love to be able to tell the story of the dumb fucks from la migra who shot up a cooler full of cerveza guillermo took a closer look at the container its got signs on it he said he reached into the station wagon and came out with a battered pair of binoculars after a moment he said it says danger biological hazard what the fuck he handed the binoculars to hernandez who took a close look he exhaled audibly then reached for his cell phone and hit a speeddial number hernandez here he said into it i need a supervisor out here right now at mile thirtythree there was a response to which hernandez responded ill tell him when he gets here just get a supervisor out here now ten minutes later a bell ranger helicopter settled to the ground at mile thirtythree two men got out both had wings pinned to their uniforms one was a handsome man with a full head of gray hair and a neatly trimmed mustache he had a gold oak leaf pinned to his uniform collar points in the army it would be a majors insignia field operations supervisor paul peterson was known more or less fondly behind his back as our gringo the second man who had what would be an army captains railroad tracks pinned to his collar points was supervisory border patrol agent domingo garcia he was known behind his back as hard ass both men walked to hernandez and amarilla who were leaning against their jeep station wagon what have you got hard ass inquired not very pleasantly hernandez pointed to the obstruction in the road then handed the binoculars to peterson peterson peered through them and studied the obstruction after a long moment he said what in the fuck is that two ministro pistarini international airport ezeiza buenos aires province argentina february at the same moment that supervisory border patrol agent domingo hard ass garcia had put the binocs to his eyeswhen it was in mcallen texas it was in buenos airesroscoe j danton of the washington timespost stepped off the ramp leading from aerolineas argentinas flight as he entered the ezeiza terminal proper he thought for a moment that he had accidentally gone through the wrong door he found himself in a large dutyfree store complete with three quite lovely young women handing out producttouting brochures clever he said admiringly and out loud someone down here has figured out a good way to get the traveling public into the dutyfree store place the store as the only passage between the arriving passenger ramp and the terminal but screw them i wont buy a thing he started walking through the store fifty feet into it though he had a change of heart he had come to a display of johnnie walker black label scotch whisky and remembered what he had learned as a boy scout be prepared three boxes of his favorite intoxicant were cellophanewrapped together and offered at a price he quickly computed to be about half of what he paid in washington dc he picked up one of the packages and went through the exit cash register charging his purchase to hisactually the washington timespostsamerican express corporate credit card he examined his receipt carefully and was pleased it read that he had charged for unspecified merchandise in the store if it had said three bottles johnnie walker black label scotch there would have been a note from accounting reminding him that intoxicants could be charged to the washington timespost only when connected to business entertaining and as he had not identified on his expense report whom he had entertained it was presumed that the whisky was for his personal consumption and therefore the would be deducted from his next paycheck and in the future please do not charge personal items to the corporate credit card accounting he theorized would probably give him the benefit of the doubt in this instance because it didnt say whisky and assume he had purchased for example items of personal hygiene which were considered legitimate expenses when he was traveling or maybe a battery for histhe washington timespostslaptop computer he would not lie on his expense account but he would take full advantage of the provisions regarding business travel in his employment contract he was entitled for example to firstclass accommodations on airliners when traveling outside the continental united states on a flight lasting six hours or longer on flights under six hours in lengthsay washingtonlondonhis contract provided for business class it was for that reason that he had traveled on aerolineas argentinas when the washington timespost corporate travel department had told him that only business class was available on delta and american he made them per his contract book him firstclass seating on the argentine carrier his experience had taught him that once he accepted less than that to which he was entitled the bastards in corporate travel henceforth would try to make it the rule danton also was entitled by his contract when on travel lasting more than twentyfour hours to a hotel rated at four stars or better and therein a tworoom suite rather than a simple room in the case of this trip corporate travel had suggested they make a reservation for a tworoom suite for him at the fourstarrated plaza hotel in buenos aires the plaza wasnt a fivestar hotel but boasted that it contained the oldest restaurant in buenos aires a worldfamous bar and was directly across plaza san martin from the argentine foreign ministry to danton that suggested that it wasnt going to be the argentine version of a marriott and he had accepted corporate travels recommendation carrying the johnnie walker he went through the immigration checkpoint without any trouble his luggage however took so long to appear on the carousel that he became genuinely worried that it had been sent to havana or moscow but it did finally show up and he changed his suspicions toward the officers of the transportation security administration back in miami who were he thought entirely capable of putting some clever chalk mark on his luggage signaling everyone in the know that it belonged to an uncooperative traveler and if it couldnt be redirected to moscow or havana then to the absolute end of whatever line it was in when the customs officials sifted through his suitcase and laptop briefcase with great careand especially when they asked him if he was sure he was not trying to carry into the republica argentina more than ten thousand us dollars in cash or negotiable securities or any amount of controlled substanceshe was sure he saw the stealthy hand of the tsa at work corporate travel had told him that he should take a remise rather than a taxi from the airport to his hotel explaining that buenos aires taxis were small and uncomfortable and their drivers wellknown for their skilled chicanery when dealing with foreigners remises travel had told him which cost a little more were private cars pressed into parttime service by their owners who were more often than not the drivers they could be hired only through an agent who had kiosks in the terminal lobby the remise in which roscoe was driven from ezeiza international airport to plaza san martin and the plaza hotel was old but clean and well cared for and the driver delivered a lecture on buenos aires en route when the remise door was opened by a doorman wearing a gray frock coat and a silk top hat and two bellmen stood ready to handle the baggage roscoe was in such a good mood that he handed the remise driver his american express card and he told him to add a twentypercent tip to the bill ten percent was roscoes norm even on the washington timespost s dime the driver asked if roscoe could possibly pay in cash preferably dollars explaining that not only did american express charge ten percent but also took two weeks or a month to pay up he then showed roscoe the english language buenos aires herald on the front page of which was the current exchange rate one us dollar was worth pesos if you give me a onehundreddollar bill ill give you three hundred and ninety pesos the remise driver offered roscoe handed him the bill and the driver counted out three hundred and ninety pesos into his hand mostly in small bills roscoe then got rid of most of the small bills by counting out two hundred pesosthe agreedupon priceinto the drivers hand the driver thanked him shook his hand and said he hoped el senor would have a good time in argentina roscoe liked what he saw of the lobby of the plazalots of polished marble and shiny brassand when he got to reception a smiling desk clerk told him they had his reservation and slid a registration card across the marble to him on the top of it was printed welcome to the marriott plaza hotel shit a marriott corporate travels done it to me again roscoe had hated the marriott hotel chain since the night he had been asked to leave the bar in the marriott hotel next to the washington press club after he complained that it was absurd for the bartender to have shut him off after only four drinks at the plaza though he felt a lot better when the bellman took him to his suite it was very nice large and well furnished and he could see plaza san martin from its windows he took out the thick wad of pesos the remise driver had given him and decided that generosity now would result in good service later he did some quick mental math and determined the peso equivalent of ten dollars which came to thirtyeight pesos rounded this figure upward and handed the bellman forty pesos the bellmans face did not show much appreciation for his munificence well fuck you pedro he thought as the bellman went out the door ten bucks is a lot of money for carrying one small suitcase roscoe then shaved took a shower and got dressed the clock radio beside the bed showed that it was just shy of two oclock as he set his wristwatch to the local time he thought it was entirely likely that the us embassy ran on an eighttofour schedule with an hour or so lunch break starting at noon and with any luck he could see commercial attache alexander b darby as soon as he could get to the embassy miss eleanor dillworth had told him that darby was another cia clandestine service officer a good guy and if anybody could point him toward the shadowy and evil colonel castillo and his wicked companions it was darby roscoe took out his laptop and opened it intending to search the internet for the address and telephone number of the us embassy buenos aires no sooner had he found the plug to connect with the internet and had turned on the laptop than its screen flashed low battery he found the power cord and the electrical socket his male plug did not match the two round holes in the electrical socket the concierge said he would send someone right up with an adapter plug roscoe then tipped that bellman twenty pesos thinking that the equivalent of five bucks was a more than generous reward for bringing an adapter worth no more than a buck this bellman like the last one did not seem at all overwhelmed by roscoes generosity roscoe shook his head as he plugged in the adapter ninety seconds later he had the embassys addressavenida colombia and its telephone number both of which he entered into his pocket organizer embassy of the united states mr alexander b darby please there is no one here by that name sir hes the commercial counselor theres no one here by that name sir have you a press officer yes sir may i speak with him please its a her sir ms sylvia grunblatt connect me with her please ms grunblatts line ms grunblatt please roscoe ms grunblatts not available at the moment when will she be available im afraid i dont know may i leave a message yes of course please tell her mr roscoe j danton of the washington timespost is on his way to the embassy and needs a few minutes of her valuable time got that will you give it to me again please slower three the embassy of the united states of america avenida colombia buenos aires argentina february it was a tenminute drive from the plaza hotel to the american embassy the taxicab meter showed that the ride had cost fifteen pesos roscoe dug out his wad of pesos handed the driver a twentypeso note and waited for his change five pesos is too much of a tip two pesos ought to be more than enough the driver looked at the twenty and then up at roscoe when roscoe didnt respond the driver waved his fingers in a give me more gesture roscoe pointed to the meter the cab driver said argentine pesos he then pointed to the note roscoe had given him and said uruguay pesos he then held up his index finger and went on one argentine peso ishe held up all his fingersfive uruguay pesos you pay with uruguay pesos is one hundred uruguay pesos roscoe looked at his stack of pesos they were indeed uruguayan pesos that miserable sonofabitch remise driver screwed me he counted the uruguayan pesos he had left he didnt have enough to make up the additional eighty pesos the cab driver was demanding he took a onehundreddollar bill from his wallet the cab driver examined it very very carefully and then first handed roscoe his twentypeso uruguayan note and then three onehundredpeso argentine notes he stuck the american hundred in his pocket roscoe was still examining the argentine currency trying to remember what that sonofabitch remise driver had told him was the exchange rate when the cab driver took one of the argentine hundredpeso bills back he then pointed to the meter and counted out eightyfive argentine pesos and laid them in roscoes hand roscoe then remembered the exchange rate it was supposed to be argentine pesos to the dollar not muchas gracias the cab driver said and drove off fuck fuck fuck roscoe said as he began walking toward the small building guarding access to the embassy grounds my name is roscoe danton he said to the rentacop behind a thick glass window id like to see mr alexander b darby the commercial counselor you got passport american passport the rentacop asked in a thick accent suggesting that he was not a fellow american roscoe slid his passport through a slot below the window the rentacop examined it carefully and then announced no mr darby here then id like to see miss what the fuck was her name miss rosenblum the press officer no miss rosenblum we got miss grunblatt public affairs officer then her please what your business with miss grunblatt im a journalist a senior writer of the washington timespost you got papers have i got papers you can bet your fat argentine ass pedro that i have papers one at a time roscoe took them from his wallet first he slid through the opening below the window his pentagon press pass then his state department press pass and finallythe ne plus ultra of all press credentialshis white house press pass they failed to dazzle the rentacop even after he had studied each intently but finally he picked up a telephone receiver spoke briefly into itroscoe could not hear what he was sayingand then hung up he signaled for roscoe to go through a sturdy translucent glass door roscoe signaled for the return of his passport and press passes the rentacop shook his head and announced when you come out you get back roscoe considered offering the observation that at the pentagon the state department and the white house they just looked at press passes and gave them back but in the end decided it would probably be counterproductive he went through the translucent door on the other side of which were two more rentacops behind a counter and another sturdy glass door this one transparent and through which he could see neatly trimmed grass around a pathway leading to the embassy building itself its just as unbelievably ugly as the embassy in london roscoe decided obviously designed by the same dropout from the university of southern arkansas school of bunker and warehouse architecture the door would not open roscoe looked back at the rentacops one of them was pointing to the counter the other was pointing to a sign on the wall no electronic or incendiary devices beyond this point incendiary devices are they talking about cigar lighters what in there one of the rentacops demanded pointing at roscoes laptop case my laptop im a journalist i need it to take notes not past this point you got cellular phone organizer butane lighter guilty on all points you got or not got i got roscoe said and then put them on the counter keys set off wand one of the rentacops said you got keys better you leave them too roscoe added his key chain to everything else one of the rentacops came from behind the counter waved the wand around roscoes body and then gestured toward the glass door this time it opened a us marine in dress trousers and a stiffly starched opencollared khaki shirt was waiting for him outside the main entrance to the embassy building he had a large revolver in a holster suspended from what looked like a patentleather sam browne harness mr danton thank god an american mr danton roscoe danton an alumnus of the parris island school for boys at your service sergeant if you will come with me mr danton the sergeant led him into the building through a magnetic detector and down a corridor to the right he pointed to a wooden bench if you will sit there mr danton someone will attend to you shortly please do not leave this area roscoe dutifully sat down the marine sergeant marched away there was a cork bulletin board on the opposing wall after perhaps thirty seconds roscoe more from a desire to assert his journalist status than curiosityhe had been thinking fuck you sergeant i aint in the crotch no more you cant order me aroundstood up and had a look at it among the other items on display was the embassy daily bulletin it contained the usual bullshit roscoe expected to see and at the end of it was unofficial items for sale his eyes flickered over it bingo he said aloud immediately after an offer to sell a baby carriage in likenew condition likenew condition what did they do turn the baby back inwas an absolutely fascinating offer of something for sale bmw royal blue excellent shape k miles all papers in order for sale to us diplomatic personnel or argentine nationals priced for quick sale can be seen at ohiggins ask doorman alex darby phone five seconds after roscoe had read the offer the paper on which it had been printed was off the wall and in his pocket he sat back down on the bench and trimmed his fingernails maybe they have surveillance cameras maybe they saw me tear that off if they did so what mr danton ms grunblatt will see you now sylvia grunblatt was sitting behind a large cluttered desk she was not svelte but neither was she unpleasingly plump she had very intelligent eyes what can the embassy of the united states do for roscoe j danton of the washington timespost she greeted him how about a cup of coffee for openers i would be in your debt roscoe said she poured coffee into a mug and handed it to him sugar canned cow he shook his head what brings you to the paris of south america grunblatt asked im writing a feature with the working title tacos and tango sure you are she said what did you do get demoted im one of your fans mr danton and you dont write features for the sunday magazine how about one with the lead us diplomats living really high on the taxpayers dollar in the paris of south america if you were going to do that you wouldnt tell me i came down here to see alex darby roscoe said nobody here by that name she said you mean nobody here by that name now right we had a commercial counselor by that name but hes gone retired when was that i dont seem to recall i could find out for you but then we would get into privacy issues wouldnt we or security issues you know who cut his checks miss grunblatt one its ms grunblattbut you can call me sylvia if mizz sticks in your craw and you may call me roscoe sylvia and two i have no idea what youre talking about mr darby was our commercial counselor who fed you that other wild notion eleanor dillworth another longtime toiler in the clandestine service of the agency whose name we dare not speak you know eleanor do you eleanor came to me actually she and her friend patricia davies wilson came to me do you know patricia ive heard the name somewhere eleanor came to you both of them did whistles to their lips and whoat whomdid they wish to blow their whistles they seem to feel the villain is an army officer named castillo major charley castillo his christian name is carlos you know him she nodded and said if hes the same man he was sent down here when our consul general j winslow masterson was kidnapped sent by whowhom our late president who then after jack masterson was killed put him in charge of getting mastersons family safely home tell me about major castillo danton said tell you what roscoe you tell me what you think you know about castillo and if i can ill tell you if youre right nice try sylvia excuse me if i tell you what i know about this guy then you will know how close i am to learning what you dont want to tell me about him roscoe i am a public affairs officer it is my duty to answer any questions you might pose to the best of my ability providing of course that my answers would not include anything that is classified you ever hear what c harry whelan has to say about public affairs officers such as yourself she shook her head quote their function is not the dissemination of information but rather the containment thereof they really should be called misinformation officers end quote oh god hes onto us there is nothing left for me to do but to go home and slit my wrists he chuckled sylvia made the time out signal with her hands can we go off the record roscoe briefly what exactly did eleanor tell you i presume that off the record means that youre not going to send an urgent message to foggy bottom telling natalie cohen what eleanor told me girl scouts honor okay actually she didnt tell me much she said i wouldnt believe what an evil man this guy castillo is unless i found out myself what she did was suggest that castillo had stolen two russian defectors from her when she was in vienna and then pointed me at alexander darby sylvia looked at him thoughtfully for a moment and then said eleanor and i go back a long time meaning you have taken darbys place as the resident spook she shook her head and raised her right arm as if swearing to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her god meaning we go back a long time she said eleanor is very good at what shes done for all those years if she says charley castillo stole two heavy russian spooks from under her nose that means there were two russian spooks and she believes charley castillo stole them she said that it cost her her job stories like that are circulating and ive heard them sylvia said what i cant figure is why charley would do something like that unless someonemaybe even our late presidenttold him to and i cant imagine why he brought them here he brought russian spooks here ambassador montvale thinks he did how do you know that a friend of mineyou dont need to know whowas in the rio albathats a restaurant around the corner magnificent steaks you ought to make an effort to eat thereat a table near my ambassadors he was having lunch with montvale castillo walked in montvale told him all would be forgiven if he gave him the russians castillo told him to attempt a physiologically impossible act of selfreproduction montvale threatened to have him arrested he had a couple of secret service guys with him castillo said if the secret service made a move they would be arrested by a couple of gendarmeria nacionaltheyre the local heavy copshe had with him the meeting adjourned to the embassy i guess they were afraid someone might hear them talking when the meeting was over montvale went to the airport without any russians got on his citation four and flew back to washington castillo walked out of the embassy and i havent seen him since reminding you that were off the record my ambassador who is a really good guy thinks castillo is a really good guy interesting one more interesting thing right after we bombed whatever the hell it was we bombed in the congo a lot of people around here including alex darby suddenly decided to retire what people no names but a secret service guy and a legal attache which is diplomatspeak for fbi agent and even a couple of people in our embassies in asuncion paraguay and across the river plate in uruguay are you going to tell me where i can find alexander darby i dont know and dont want to know where he is the last time i saw him was at ezeiza the airport she nodded alex is somebody else ive known for a long time a really good guy i drove him to the airport he went home she paused before replying alex applied for and was issued a regular passport i drove him to the airport he left the countrywent through immigrationon his diplomatic passport then he went back through the line and entered the country as a tourist on his regular passport when he came out he handed meas an officer of the embassyhis dips passport then i drove him to his apartment i havent seen him since you going to tell me where that apartment is were back on the record mr danton i cannot of course violate mr darbys privacy by giving you that information im sure you understand of course and thank you very much mizz grunblatt anytime mr danton we try to be of service thats comforting did you ever hear what winston churchill said about journalists mr danton cant say that i have churchill said journalists are the semiliterate cretins hired to fill the spaces between the advertisements oh god hes onto us now i suppose theres nothing left for me but to slash my wrists thats a thought good morning mr danton four apartment b ohiggins belgrano buenos aires argentina february i will miss the view alexander b darbya small plump man with a pencilline mustachesaid as he stood with liam duffy edgar delchamps and his wife and gestured out the windows of the darbys apartment on the thirtysecond floor it occupied half of the top floor of the fouryearold building high enough to overlook almost all of the other apartment buildings between ohiggins and the river plate what youre supposed to be going to miss you sonofabitch is your loving wife and adorable children julia darbya trim woman who wore her black hair in a pageboysaid and was immediately sorry strike that alex she added i was just lashing out at the fickle finger of fate its okay honey and i really dont think it will be for long hope springs eternal in the human breast julia said solemnly and the movers never show up when theyre supposed to edgar delchamps said as solemnly the apartment showed signs that the movers were expected any moment cardboard boxes were stacked all over and suitcases were arranged by the door and it is always the cocktail hour somewhere in the world so why not here and now alex said julia smiled at edgar and liam and said every once in a great while he has a good idea the embassys glasses are in the cupboard so all we have to do is find something to put in them the booze is in the suitcase with the seven stuck on it alex said and looked at the suitcases by the door which of course is the one on the bottom he switched to spanish give me a hand will you liam liam duffya welldressed muscular ruddyfaced blond man in his fortieslooked to be what his name suggested a true son of erin but he was in fact an argentine whose family had migrated to argentina more than a century before they went to the stack of suitcases moved them around and in about a minute alex darby was able to triumphantly raise a bottle of twelveyearold famous grouse malt scotch whisky the house telephone rang julia answered it its the concierge she announced somebodys here to look at the car tell him to show it to him alex said he walked into the kitchen carrying the whisky liam followed him ninety seconds later the telephone rang again and again julia answered it when alex and liam returned from the kitchen julia announced its the movers which one his julia said nodding at duffy have them sent up alex said im way ahead of you my darling julia said as she reached for her glass seconds later the doorbell chimed signaling there was someone in the elevator foyer duffy went to the door and opened it then waved three men into the apartment they were all wearing business suits but there was something about them that suggested the military the suitcases to the left of the doorway duffy said in spanish be very careful of the blue one with the number seven on it si mi comandante one of them said did they find a pilot for the aero commander duffy asked si mi general all is ready at aeroparque jorge newbery whoopee julia darby said and the people to stay with familia darby duffy asked in place mi comandante whoopee again julia said duffy nodded at the men the doorbell rang again duffy pulled it open a thirtyeightyearold presbyterian from chevy chase maryland stood there mr darby roscoe danton asked im alex darby come in roscoe entered the apartment and offered his hand to him roscoe danton he said that was a quick look at the bmw wasnt it darby asked actually mr darby im not here about the car i came to see you danton said im a journalist at the washington timespost eleanor dillworth sent me darbys reaction was pavlovian one spook does not admit knowing another spook unless he knows whoever is asking the question has the right to know spooks also believe that journalists should be told only that which is in the best interests of the spook to tell them im afraid theres been a mistake darby said politely im afraid i dont know a miss duckworth dillworth roscoe made the correction even as he intuited things were about to go wrong eleanor dillworth comandante general liam duffy also experienced a pavlovian reaction when he saw the look in darbys eyes he made a barely perceptible gesture with the index finger of his left hand the two men about to carry luggage from the apartment quickly set it down and moved quickly to each side of roscoe danton the third man who was already on the elevator landing turned and came back into the apartment looking to duffy for guidance duffy made another small gesture with his left hand rubbing his thumb against his index finger this gesture had two meanings money and papers in this case the third man intuited it meant papers he walked to danton and said reasonably pleasantly in english papers please senor excuse me roscoe said julia darby looked annoyed rather than concerned gendarmeria nacional the man said documents please passport and other identity roscoe wordlessly handed over his passport the third man made a give me the rest gesture roscoe took out his wallet and started to look for his white house press pass the third man snatched the wallet from his fingers and handed it and the passport to liam duffy my press passes are in there roscoe said including my white house duffy silenced him with a raised hand examined the passport and the contents of the wallet and then handed all of it to darby then he made another gesture patting his chest with both hands the two men standing beside him instantly started to pat down roscoe finally signaling that he was clean except for a wad of currency a sheaf of papers several ballpoint pens a box of wooden matches and two cigars they handed everything to duffy how did you happen to come to this address mr danton darby asked courteously roscoe decided to tell the truth i saw the forsale ad for the bmw in the daily bulletin at the embassy he said he pointed to the sheaf of papers what were you doing at the embassy i went there to see if they could point me at you why would you want to be pointed at me i told you eleanor dillworth said you would be helpful in what way that you could point me toward colonel carlos castillo i know no one by that name an argentine army officer an american officer mr darby roscoe replied stopping himself at the last second from saying as you fucking well know i dont know whats going on here mr danton darby said but apparently someone has given you incorrect information im sorry youve been inconvenienced how did you get here in a taxi where are you staying the plaza hotel well the least we can for you is give you a ride back there darby said we can do that cant we liam absolutely liam said nice to have met you mr danton darby said and gestured toward the door likewise roscoe danton snapped sarcastically and ill pass on the free ride thank you just the same comandante general liam duffy locked eyes with danton and evenly said let me explain something to you senor there are some irregularities with your documents what kind of irregularities danton interrupted angrily duffy ignored him he went on im sure they can be quickly cleared up possibly even today and certainly by the morning our usual procedure is taking people with irregular documents to our headquarters then we would notify the us embassy and ask them to verify your documents sometimes they can do that immediately in the case of someone like yourself a distinguished journalist im sure they would go out of their way to hasten this procedure call the public affairs officer danton interrupted again sylvia grunblatt she knows who i am duffy ignored him again and by late today or certainly by tomorrow morning a consular officer would come by our headquarters verify the legitimacy of your documents which would then be returned to you and you could go about your business but in the meantime you would be held we cant as im sure you understand have people running around buenos aires with questionable documents now partly because i am anxious to do everything i can for a prominent north american journalist such as you purport to be and partly because senor darby feels sorry for you what im willing to do is take you to your hotel and let you wait there with the understanding of course that you would not leave the plaza until your documents are checked and we return them to you believe me senor the plaza is far more comfortable a place to wait than the detention facilities at our headquarters danton held up both hands at shoulder height i surrender he said the plaza it is comandante will you take this gentleman to the plaza si mi comandante what the hell was that all about julia darby asked if i were still an officer of the clandestine service alex darby replied i would hazard a guess that it has something to do with this he held up a copy of the letter colonel vladlen solomatin had given to eric kocian in budapest if i were still an officer of the clandestine service edgar delchamps said i would know not only what roscoe danton is up to but also what comrade colonel solomatin is up to you think im wrong liam duffy asked no vladimir putin may very well have dispatched one of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki hit squadsor several of themto whack us all delchamps said but i dont think roscoe danton is a deepcover svr asset who came out of his closet to do the deed hes a pretty good journalist actually what was that about eleanor pointing him at alex at charley julia asked did he make that up i dont think so eleanor got fired when charley stole her defectors shes pissed understandably alex darby said i think shed like to watch as charley was castrated with a dull knife i dont think she likes me much either delchamps said and you know why alex said i dont julia said quickly changing the subject delchamps said i suggest we get the hell out of dodge as quickly as possible just as soon as the movers come i can leave somebody here to deal with the movers liam said and sylvia has the car keysand the power of attorneyto sell the car darby said moving julia and the boys to the safe house in pilar until its time to go to ezeiza seems to be the thing to do honey will you go get the boys no julia said im a mommy mommies dont like it much when their sons look at them with loathing disgust and icecold hate you go get them its not that bad honey alex argued people whohell people who sell air conditioners get transferred with little or no notice all the time their children get jerked out of school its not the end of the world you tell them that she said theyll like saint albans once they get used to it alex said somewhat lamely why because you went there julia challenged no because al gore and jesse jackson jr did alex said and after a moment added ill be right back with my pitiful abused namesake and his pathetic little brother when the door to the elevator foyer had closed behind her husband julia asked what are you going to do edgar eventually i mean delchamps considered the question a long moment before replying i dont know julia he said like alex this business of of selling air conditioners is all i know what i wont be doing is hanging around the gate at langley with the other dinosaurs telling spy stories i didnt know what alex did for a living until the night he proposed julia said and then he told me he was in research for the agency they call that obfuscation delchamps said you never got married did you he shook his head the telephone rang this time it was the embassy movers five the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february what am i looking at charles president joshua ezekiel clendennen inquired of ambassador charles m montvale the director of national intelligence before montvale could reply the president thought he knew the answer to his question and went on this is thewhat should i call itthe package that caused all the uproar at fort detrick yesterday right and why am i looking at this now instead of yesterday these photographs were taken less than an hour ago mr president montvale said on a dirt road one hundred fifty yards inside our border near mcallen texas the president looked at him waiting for him to continue a routine patrol by the border patrol found that sitting on the road at about half past seven texas time the intel took some time to work its way up the chain of command the border patrol agents who found it reported it to their superiors who reported it i know how a chain of command works charles the president interrupted homeland security finally got it to me just minutes ago montvale said cut to the chase for christs sake the president snapped is that another load of congox or not we are proceeding on the assumption that it is mr president and working to confirm that one way or the other what the hell does that mean the president interrupted again as soon as this was brought to my attention mr president i contacted colonel hamilton at fort detrick i was prepared to fly him out there and is that whats happening no sir colonel hamilton felt that opening the beer cooler onsite would be illadvised beer cooler yes sir the outer container is an insulated box commonly used to keep beer or for that matter anything else cold theyre commonly available all over the fbi has determined the one sent to colonel hamilton was purchased at a sams club in miami i dont know why im allowing myself to go off on a tangent like this but why dont you just call it an insulated box perhaps we should sir but the congox at fort detrick was in a blue rubber barrel resembling a beer barrel in the insulated okay okay i get it so whats with colonel hamilton colonel hamilton said further that in addition to the risk posed by opening the insulated box onsite to determine whether whatever it holds was congox or not he would have to take all sorts of various laboratory equipment so youre moving it to detrick right is that safe we believe it is the safest step we can take sir and thats under way yes sir the insulated box will beby now has beentaken to the corpus christi naval air station in a border patrol helicopter from there it will beby now is beingtransported to andrews air force base here in a navy ch thats a gulfstream four mr president thank you for the clarification charles the president said sarcastically one can never know too many details like that and when the beer coolerslashinsulated box gets to andrews is everything set up there to cause another public relations disaster like the one we had yesterday an army helicopter will be standing by at andrews sir to fly the insulated container to fort detrick it should not attract undue attention sir it better not mr president what caused the the disaster is probably the word youre looking for charles the president said excitement at fort detrick yesterday was colonel hamilton declaring a potential level four biological hazard disaster that probably wont happen today the president snorted and then asked so whats going to happen when the insulated container from texas is delivered to hamilton he will determine whether the container contains more congox and if it does excuse me if it does contain more of this noxious substancenow thats an understatement isnt it noxious substancewhat is he going to do about that the colonel has been experimenting with hightemperature incineration as a means of destroying congox he has had some success but he is not prepared to declare that the solution so we then have several questions that need answering dont we one what is this stuff two how do we deal with it more important three whos sending it to us and four why are they sending it to us yes sir thats true and you have no answers i think we can safely presume sir that it was sent to us by the same people who were operating the fish farm that we destroyed in the congo i think we can safely presume that we didnt destroy everything that needed destroying in the congo cant we im afraid we have to proceed on that assumption mr president and you have no recommendations sir it seems to me our options range from sending natalie cohen to moscow and teheran to get on her knees and beg for mercy all the way up to nuking both the kremlin and wherever that unshaven little iranian bastard hangs his hat in teheran there are more options than those extremes mr president such as sir it seems to me that if whoever sent these two packages of congox wanted to cause us harm they would have already done so that thought has also run through my mind clendennen said sarcastically it would therefore follow they want something what we have to do is learn what they want would you be surprised charles if i told you that thought has also run through my mind montvale didnt reply i want you to set up a meeting here at say five the president said well brainstorm it you natalie the dci the fbi director the secretary of defense the heads of homeland security and the dia and colonel hamilton too by then hell probably know if this new stuff is more congox or not in any event he can bring everybody up to speed on what he does know yes sir thats probably a good idea i thought you might think so president clendennen said six the office of the director of national intelligence eisenhower executive office building th street and pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february truman c ellsworth whose title was executive assistant to the director of national intelligence learned only after having served in that position for three months that the title was most commonly used by members of the secretarial sorority to denote those women who were more than just secretaries those females who had in other words their own secretaries to do the typing filing and fetching of coffee by the time he found out it was too late to do anything about it ellsworth a tall silverhaired rather elegant man in his fifties had chosen the title himself when charles m montvale had asked him to again leave his successful even distinguished law practice in new york to work for him as his deputy in the newly created directorate of national intelligence he wouldnt have the title of deputy montvale explained because there was already a deputy director of national intelligence whom montvale privately described as a connected cretin who had been appointed by the president in the discharge of some political debt montvale said he would makeand he quickly had madeit clear that truman c ellsworth was number two in the office of the director of national intelligence and that any title would do ellsworth chose executive assistant because an executive is someone who executes and he was inarguably going to be montvales assistant in this role while charles m montvale sat on his office couch truman c ellsworth sat behind montvales desk and called first the secretary of state natalie cohen whom he knew socially well enough to address by her first name and told her that the president had asked the boss to set up a five oclock meeting at the white house to discuss a new development in the congo business she said she would of course be there then truman called in turn wyatt vanderpool the secretary of defense john jack powell the director of the central intelligence agency mark schmidt the director of the federal bureau of investigation and lieutenant general william w withers us army the commanding general of the defense intelligence agency he told them somewhat more curtly that the ambassador had told him to call them to summon them to a five pm brainstorming session at the white house visavis the new development in the congo affair he wasnt able to reach the secretary of homeland security but he did get through to assistant secretary of homeland security mason andrews ellsworth returned the telephone receiver to its cradle and reported as much to ambassador montvale i got through to everybody but dhs charles i had to settle for mason andrews i wish i had thought of this when you had jack powell on the line montvale said thought of what charles castillo may be involved in thisprobably is in some wayand i have no idea where he is ellsworths eyebrows rose i daresay that the colonel retired in compliance with his orders has dropped off the face of the earth i want to know where he is montvale said i forgot that the president told me the next time he asked he expected me to be able to tell him where castillo is well you can tell jack powell to start looking for him when you see him at the white house thats seven hours from now montvale said get him on a secure line please truman i will speak with him ellsworth reached for a red telephone on the desk and said into it white house will you please get dci powell on a secure line for ambassador montvale one estancia san joaquin near san martin de los andes patagonia neuquen province argentina february from the air the landing strip at estancia san joaquin looked like a dirt road running along the chimehuin river which arguably was the best troutfishing river in the world it was only when the manager of the estancia heard the aero commanderwhich he expectedoverhead and threw a switch that the aeronautical function of the dirt road became obvious the switch a caused lights marking both ends of the runway to rise from the ground and begin to flash and b another hydraulic piston to rise this one with a flashing arrow indicating the direction of the wind the sleek twinengined highwing airplane touched down and taxied to a large thatchedroof farm building near the road there part of what looked like the wall of the farm building swung open and as soon as the pilot shut down the engines a halfdozen men pushed the aircraft into what was actually a hangar there was a bell ranger helicopter parked inside the doorwall closed the marking lights sank back into the ground and the airfield again became a dirt road running along the tranquil chimehuin river edgar delchamps was the first to emerge from the airplane max ran to greet him which he did by resting his paws on delchampss shoulder as he kissed him it was a long moment before the dog had enough and delchamps could straighten up funny i would never have taken you for a trout fisherman charley castillo greeted him castillo was wearing a yellow polo shirt khaki trousers a battered stetson hat and even more battered western boots haha delchamps responded delchamps pointed to the helicopter and raised his eyebrows our hosts castillo said alek loans it to me from time to time when i have something important to do like going fishing alex darby came out of the airplane next followed by liam duffy and finally a man wearing a gendarmeria nacional uniform and pilots wings darby and castillo shook hands liam duffy wrapped his arm around castillos shoulders and hugged him ace your pal alek wouldnt happen to be here would he delchamps asked as a matter of fact he is why do i think alek is not here to fish delchamps said because in a previous life you were trained to be suspicious castillo replied youre going to have to adjust to our changed circumstances when he saw the look on delchampss face he went on but since you ask at a few minutes after seven this morning alek and i were out on the beautiful rio chimehuin catching our breakfast then pevsner doesnt know about the letter charley liam duffy interrupted nodding at the pilot were going to have to get primer alferez sanchez to the airport primer alferez alferez sanchez who had piloted the aero commander was the equivalent of first lieutenant in the gendarmeria and castillo saw his unhappy look hes thinking im being gotten rid of so i wont learn whats going on here and hes right to be pissed liam could have handled that better the last thing we want is a pilot who knows more than he should harboring a grudge duffys sometimes the sort of commander whose officers loathe him sanchez what did you think of the new avionics in that old bird castillo asked switching to spanish and smiling at the pilot fantastic the pilot replied all i had to do was take it off and land it the navigation was entirely automatic and when i dropped out of the cloud cover i was lined up with the runway were working on that castillo said the idea is to eliminate pilots like you and me im not sure id like that senor as i was just telling my friend here one has to adjust to changed circumstances im sorry theres no time to offer you a drink but aerolineas argentinas waits for no man and if you dont get to the san martin de los andes airport in the next fortyfive minutes i understand senor the pilot said and then came to attention with your permission mi comandante duffy nodded the pilot saluted and duffy returned it sanchez castillo said dont tell anyone about the avionics el comandante made that clear on the way here senor delchamps waited until the pilot had left the hangar and then said tell me about the changed circumstances ace i hardly know where to start castillo said try starting with telling me whether or not pevsner has seen solomatins letter gladly castillo said okay starting at the beginning aleks man went on the net as scheduled at ohfourtwenty hundred zulu aleks man went on the net our net i thought you knew that all of us are retired and have fallen off the face of the earth we now have people to do things like going on the net at onetwenty in the morning delchamps and darby both shook their heads this was unexpected so aleks guy castillo went on went on the net at ohonetwenty local time at ohonetwentytwo colonel v n solomatins letter came through five by five at ohonetwentyfive alek telephoned me here waking me from the sleep of the innocent to tell me he had a letter from cousin vladlen and that he wanted me to see it as soon as possible paul sieno told me kocian wanted to get the letter to you without anyone else seeing it dont anyone let alek know youre surprised that he has seen it we now have no secrets from alek jesus christ delchamps said so i told him that id fire upcastillo pointed to the bell rangerat first light go pick him up and he could show me cousin vladlens letter or better yet bring him back here and he could have breakfast with sweaty and me wed all read cousin vladlens letter and then go fishing to kill the time until you darby and duffy got here since that was the best idea hed heard so far this week alek said that was fine and hed bring tom barlow along since the letter was addressed to him in the first place so colonel berezovsky is here too darby asked i wondered where he was aside from my belief that colonel dmitri berezovsky has also fallen off the face of the earth castillo said i have no idea where he might be tom barlow however is at the san joaquin lodge and sweaty has seen the letter no doubt certainly sweaty has seen it how could i possibly not show it to her alek would have anyway delchamps shook his head in resignation okay can we go now you dont want to know what else has happened castillo asked im afraid to ask well we had another offer of employment from those people in las vegas castillo said to do what it seems that someone sent colonel hamilton a rubber beer barrel full of whatever it was hamilton brought out of the congo jesus h christ darby exclaimed and they wanted us to find out who did it and why and delchamps asked i told them sorry we have all fallen off the face of the earth what the hell is that all about darby asked its none of our business castillo said they were supposed to have destroyed everything in a twentymile area around that place in the congo darby said so they said castillo said you think theres some sort of connection between that and solomatins letter darby asked i dont know but you can count on alek asking you that question he gestured toward an open rear door of the hangar two shiny olivedrab land rovers sat there i think we can all get in one of those cant we castillo asked two the lodge at estancia san joaquin was a singlestory stone masonry building on a small rise perhaps fifty feet above and one hundred yards from the chimehuin river it had been designed to comfortably house feed and entertain trout fishermen from all over the world never more than eight at a time usually four or five who were charged three thousand dollars a day the furniture was simple and massive the chairs and armchairs were generously padded with foamfilled leather cushions the wide windows of the great room offered a view of the chimehuin river and the snowcapped andes mountains there was a wellstocked bar a deer head with an enormous rack above the fireplace a billiards table a full bookcase and two fiftysixinch flatscreen televisions mounted so one of them was visible from anywhere in the room there were four people in the great roomplus a bartender and a maidwhen castillo and the others walked in tom barlow his sister susan and aleksandr pevsner a tall darkhaired manlike castillo and barlow in his late thirtieswhose eyes were large blue and extraordinarily bright the fourth man was janos pevsners hulking bodyguard of whom it was said that he was never farther away from pevsner than was max from castillo there were fourteen interpol warrants out for the arrest of pevsner under his own name and the seven other identities he was known to use barlow was dressed like castillo in khaki trousers and a polo shirt pevsner was similarly clothed except that his polo shirt was silk and his trousers were fine linen the men were at the billiards table susan who was leaning over a coffee table fork poised to spear an oyster was dressed like castillo and her brother except her polo shirt was linen and her khakis were shorts short shorts her clothing and posture left virtually nothing to the imagination about her bosom legs and the contours of her derriere funny edgar delchamps said i would never have taken sweaty for a fisherman susansweaty looked up from the platter of oysters popped one in her mouth smiled at delchamps and gave him the finger it was a gesture she had learned from castillo and subsequently had used with relish frequently pevsner carefully laid his cue on the billiards table then walked to delchamps darby and duffy and wordlessly shook their hands tom barlow waved at them im sure youre hungry pevsner said i can have them prepare supper for you now or if youd rather theres oysters and cold lobster towhat is it charley saysmunch on to hold you until dinner how the hell do you get oysters and lobster in the middle of patagonia darby said as he walked to the coffee table to examine what was on display i have a small seafood business in chile pevsner said that triggered a tidal wave of doubt and concern in castillo surprising him both by its intensity and the speed with which it hit him and then grew it started with his reaction to pevsners saying he had a small seafood business in chile a small seafood business my ass castillo had thought sarcastically its called cancun provisions limited and it flies a boeing lr full of seafood to cancun every other day the is owned by peruaire and you own that too was that natural modesty alek or was the modesty a pavlovian reflex of a former kgb colonel say as little as possible deflect attention how much can i really trust comrade polkovnik pevsner right now he tells me im family in loveintending to marryhis cousin susan formerly podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva of the svr but how long will that last if whatever the hell is going on here threatens his wife and children or his way of life most of the charges laid against him are bullshit but on the other hand i know he supervised the beating to death with an angle iron a man who betrayed him or used the angle iron himself probably the latter my friend alek is not a nice man edgar delchamps neither likes nor trusts alek and has told me so bluntly and i know i can trust delchamps hes been dealing with russian spookssuccessfully dealing with themfor nearly as long as i am old castillo was as suddenly brought out of his unpleasant reverie as quickly as he had entered it there were soft fingers on his cheeks the scent of perfume in his nostrils and light blue eyes intently searching his my darling sweaty asked whats the matter nothing you look like youd seen a ghost he shook his head said im fine baby he put his hand on her back and felt her warmth though the linen shirt sweaty rose on her toes and kissed him on the lips with great tenderness edgar delchampss face showed signs of amused scorn castillo gave him the finger with the hand that had been against sweatys back and announced i need a drink he mimed to the bartender what he wanted the bartender a shavenheaded barrelchested man in his thirties nodded and reached for a bottle of wild turkey bourbon castillo knew that the crisp white bartenders jacket concealed a micro uzi submachine gun the bartender was one of the nearly one hundred exmembers of the kgb or the svr whom pevsner had brought out of russia to work for him and from the looks of him the bartender was probably exspetsnaz there was the snap of fingers the bartender looked at pevsner who held up two fingers and then pointed to two armchairs by the coffee table the bartender nodded pevsner waved castillo toward the armchairs sweaty steered castillo away from the armchair and to the couch and then sat beside him pevsners face showed much the same amused scorn as delchampss face had castillo reacted by leaning over to sweaty and kissing her max walked to the coffee table sniffed decided he would pass on the seafood and went and lay at castillos feet the bartender served the bourbon to pevsner and castillo then looked to the others for orders sweaty shook her head delchamps ordered in russian scotch whisky on the rocks two chunks only and a glass of water on the side how did he know hes russian was that a way to find out the bartender looked at darby and duffy and in english said what may i get for you gentlemen pevsner looked genuinely amused and he even made a little joke when everyone had their drinks and had taken seats around the plates of cold lobster chunks and oysters laid out on the coffee table well pevsner said now that were all here whatever shall we chat about tom barlow took the chair pevsner had wanted castillo to sit in bringing with him an icecovered bottle of vodka and a frozen glass my call delchamps asked pevsner gestured for him to go on is that letter genuine delchamps asked is it really from cousin vladlen or did solomatin just sign what somebody put in front of him thats two questions edgar tom barlow said yes i think the letter is genuine and i think cousin vladlen wrote it but he would have signed anything put in front of him by general sirinov cousin vladlen has built his career by doing whatever he is told to do i know people like that in the agency delchamps said smiling is he really your cousin his father is our mothers brother barlow said pointing at sweaty how come cousin vladlen didnt get burned when you and sweaty took off general sirinov may have believed him when he said he had no hint what svetlana and i were planning vladlens a respected oprichnik a what darby asked thats right castillo said you werent here for this history lesson were you i dont know what youre talking about darby said an oprichnik is a member of the oprichnina the secret police statewithinthestate that goes back to ivan the terrible castillo said and looked at sweaty did i get that right sweetheart do i get a gold star to take home to mommy she smiled and shook her head resignedly ill explain it to you later alex castillo said tell me about general sirinov delchamps said general yakov sirinov runs the fsb and the svr for putin pevsner said putin as in prime minister putin as in prime minister vladimir vladimirovich putin formerly president of the russian federation and before that polkovnik of the kgb and before that oh that putin delchamps said castillo and barlow chuckled you think putins personally involved in this castillo asked up to the nipples of his underdeveloped chest pevsner said im getting the feeling you dont like him much delchamps said pevsner chuckled is anyone interested in the possible scenario ive come up with pevsner then said does a bear shit in the forest delchamps asked in russian theres a lady present edgar castillo said shes not a lady shes an svr podpolkovnik delchamps said sweaty gave him the finger a former lieutenant colonel of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki she corrected him which has nothing to do with whether or not im a lady i hate to tell you this sweaty but its a stretch to think of anyonehow do i put this delicatelyconsorting with ace here as being a lady sweaty and castillo both gave him the finger anyway delchamps said according to that letter all is forgiven come home that sounds as if someone still thinks of you as an svr podpolkovnik in good standing alek do they really think anyone is going to believe that letter castillo asked that tom and sweaty are going to be welcomed home as loyal russians i am a loyal russian svetlana said but loyal to russia not to vladimir vladimirovich putin thatloyalty loyalty to russia or even loyalty to vladimir vladimirovich putin personallymay be at the bottom of this pevsner said what do you mean putin wants dmitri and svetlana to come home is he stupid enough to think theyd be stupid enough to go back castillo asked no one who knows himand i know vladimir vladimirovich very wellhas ever suggested hes stupid pevsner replied and dmitri tom knows him even better than i do i hate to use the word genius tom barlow said but how about evil genius svetlana suggested why not barlow said chuckling so what is the evil genius up to castillo asked i wonder if you understand charleyat least as well as edgar and alek dohow important it is for the fsb and the svr to appear both to the people and more important to its own members as allpowerful and without fault castillos temper flared but when he spoke his voice was low and soft those who knew him knew that meant he was really angry i dont even know what the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti and the sluzhba vneshney razvedki are he said speaking russian with a saint petersburg accent perhaps before we go any further someone will be kind enough to tell me i hate to tell you this alek delchamps said in russian but i think you just pissed ace off after a moment during which pevsner looked carefully at castillo he said more important edgar i once again underestimated my friend charley i tend to do that it probably has something to do with his sophomoric sense of humor no offense was intended charley offense taken polkovnik pevsner castillo said in other words screw you friend alek pevsner shook his head and smiled let me continue pevsner said not long ago all was right in the world of vladimir vladimirovich putin he had both finally taken over the kgb and its successor organizations and was president of the russian federation he could start to restore the russian empire with a good deal of help from me he had managed to keep most of the kgbs money out of the hands of those misguided souls who thought it belonged to the people of russia he would have to deal with me eventually of course i knew too much and i had too much of what he considered the kgbs money but that could waitwhat does charley saycould sit on the back burner until the right time came he was so happy with the way things were going that when general sirinov came to him with an idea to tweak the american lions tail at little cost and with minimum riskusing a group of converts to islam there would be minimal russian involvementhe told him to go ahead what he was going to do was have the muslims crash an airliner into the liberty bell in philadelphia there was an old american airplane sitting deserted on a runway in angola this plane would be stolen equipped with additional fuel tanks flown to philadelphia and he made a diving gesture with his hand i always thought he came up with that idea himself tom barlow said he could have pevsner said but sirinov has the better imagination it doesnt matter i think of the both of them as one as putinslashsirinov point taken barlow said enter friend charley pevsner said waving a hand in castillos direction a lowly us army major who not having a clue about what was going on jumped to the conclusion that the evil arms dealer vasily respin or the smuggler alex dondiemo or even the more mysterious and wicked aleksandr pevsner had stolen the from the field at luanda angola for their criminal purposes and set out to reclaim it everyone was aware that dondiemo and respin were two of the identities pevsner used when he thought it was necessary when this came to my attention through a man i had working for me and at that point trustedhoward kennedy thats the exfbi agent who was beaten to death by parties unknown in the conrad casino in punta del este darby asked thats the fellow kennedy looked into major castillo and reported what he had learned to me some of thisfor example that major charley castillo was also karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger majority shareholder of the gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh empire and that he was working directly for the american presidentmade me rethink my original solution to the problem which was delchamps asked an indian beauty mark pevsner replied matteroffactly tapping the center of his forehead with his index finger that sometimes takes care of problems like that delchamps said god wouldnt let you kill my charley sweaty said seriously possibly i never underestimate the power of divine intervention pevsner said but at the time i thought it was just common sense my primary motive was to avoid drawing attention to myself but now that i think about it at the time i was asking gods help to avoid taking anyones life unnecessarily so perhaps svetlana youre right and god was involved charley smiled when he saw alex darbys face it showed that he was having difficulty with sweatys and pevsners matteroffact references to the almighty they dont sound much like godless communists do they alex maybe more like members of the flaming bush church of christ in porters crossroads georgia so pevsner went on i arranged to meet charley in vienna to see if i could reason with him come to some kind of understanding what you did alek castillo interrupted was have that sonofabitch kennedy blindside me while i was taking a leak in the mens room of the sacher hotel bar then he dragged me at gunpoint up to the cobenzl lovely spot delchamps said i know it well just hearing cobenzl makes me think of fairhaired madchen and hear the romantic tinkle of the zither this earned him a look of mingled disbelief and annoyance from pevsner after a moment pevsner said the moment i first saw charley i realized that it would be painful for me to have to give him a beauty spot and svet now that i think about i did ask god to help me spare his life darby was now really confused he kept looking at delchamps and duffy to get their reaction to pevsners continued references to the deity but knowing of the genuineif more than a little unusualdeep faith of pevsner and the other russians their faces showed neither surprise or confusion and thats the way it worked out pevsner went on charley and i had a cigar and a little cognac watching night fall in vienna and then we went to dinner at the drei hussars charley furnished around the corner from the opera house by the time it was over alek and i were buddies pevsner gave him an annoyed look charley pevsner continued said that he would do what he could with the president to call off the cia and the fbithey were then trying very hard to find meif i would help him find the missing aircraft i took a chance and trusted him i admit that finding the missing wasnt difficult for me i operate a number of airplanes in subsaharan africa and all of my crews always keep their eyes open for things in which they think i might be interested cutting a long story short charley was able to take the back from the muslims before they could do any damage with it and as he said he would he got the president to call off the fbi and the cia i did not know of general sirinovs plan to tweak the american lions tail and sirinov had no reason to suspect that i even knew charley much less that i was the one who had been instrumental in upsetting it he did learn of course that charley had flown the aircraft into macdill air force base in florida charley was thus added to sirinovs list of people to be dealt with when the opportunity presented itself next friend charley messed up another svr operation sirinov sent a teamunder cuban direccion general de inteligencia major alejandro vincenzoto lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov his fsb man in charge of operations in argentina chile and uruguay to eliminate a man who knew too much and had also made off with sixteen million dollars of the svrs money when that escapade was over vincenzo and his men were dead and charley had the sixteen million dollars since komogorov needed somebody to blame for that disaster he decided to blame it on me reasoning that if i were dead i couldnt protest my innocence so he paid a large sum of money to my trusted assistant the late mr howard kennedy to arrange for me to be assassinated in the garage of the sheraton hotel in pilar outside buenos aires when that was over i was alive and komogorov wasnt corporal lester bradley had put an indian beauty spot on his right eye the others on his team were taken out by others working for friend charley and mr kennedy went to meet his maker shortly thereafter all of this tended to reduce the allpowerful faultless image of both the fsb and the svr which meant that the power of sirinov and vladimir vladimirovich was becoming questionable sirinov decided to settle the matter once and for all with a great deal of effort sirinov ordered the simultaneous assassinations of a man in vienna known to be a longtime deep cover asset of the cia a reporter for one of charleys newspapers who was asking the wrong questions about russian involvement in the oilforfood program liam duffy who had interrupted a previously successful svr drug operation in argentina and paraguay and so theyre all connected alex darby said oh yes please let me finish pevsner said and the assassination of another of charleys men a policeman in philadelphia who knew the muslims who planned to crash an airplane into the liberty bell were not smart enough to conceive of much less try to execute an operation like that by themselves and suspected the svr was involved when only the assassinations of the cia asset in vienna and of the journalist were successful sirinov had to report this failure to putin so far as vladimir vladimirovich is concerned there is no such thing as a partial success and sirinov knew that the only thing worse than reporting a failure to vladimir vladimirovich was not having a credible plan to make things right and he had one dmitri and svetlana had been ordered to vienna to participate in a conference of senior svr officers the cover was the presence in vienna of bartolomeo rastrellis wax statue of peter the first which the hermitage had generously loaned to the kunsthistorisches museum the tages zeitung journalist whom he had managed to eliminate was going to be buried with much ceremony in marburg an der lahn germany there was no question that eric kocian and otto gorner managing director of gossinger gmbh would be there with a little bit of luck so would karl von und zu gossinger who was not only the owner of the gossinger empire but lieutenant colonel castillo who had been causing the svr so much trouble all threeplus at least some of charleys people who would be with himcould be eliminated at the same time toms train would pass through marburg on its way to vienna so sirinov dispatched a team of hungariansexallamvedelmi hatosagto marburg with orders to report to polkovnik berezovsky sirinov knew dmitritomcould be counted upon to supervise their assassination assignment with his wellknown skill for that sort of thing and then catch the next train to vienna well that turned out to be an even greater disaster for general sirinov as we all know through gods infinite mercy svetlana said very seriously she crossed herself svet pevsner said seriously you may very possibly be right but theres also the possibility that it was the incompetence of the cia station chief in vienna that saved charley and kocian from the ministrations of the allamvedelmi hatosag it was the hand of god svetlana said firmly possibly sweaty it was the hand of god that contributed to miss eleanor dillworths incompetence delchamps said same result right svetlana looked at him coldly not surebut deeply suspectingthat he was being sarcastic eleanor is not incompetent alex darby said loyally come on delchamps said she was incompetent in vienna the rezident there what was his name podpolkovnik kiril demidov barlow furnished he used to work for me demidov was onto dillworth delchamps said firmly maybe he didnt know it was tom and sweaty but he knew thatjesus christdillworth had a plane sitting at schwechat airfield ready to haul some defector or defectors away from the kunsthistorisches museum you dont know that darby protested i know that your pal eleanor should have known that demidov was going to take out the kuhls and once that happened she didnt have a clue what to do next i asked her she said she was waiting for instructions from langley if i may continue gentlemen pevsner said a little impatiently i didnt trust her edgar tom barlow said ignoring pevsner i dont know if it was that i thought she wasnt professional or what it was the hand of god svetlana insisted but once i saw the picture in the frankfurter rundschau of charley getting off his private jet barlow went on i decided that svetlana and i were going to leave europe on that aircraft if i had to give him sirinov and all the exallamvedelmi hatosag people and from that moment until we walked into aleks house here everything went smoothly svetlana said does no one see the hand of god in that i do castillo said when sweaty looked at him he sang jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so dont mock god charley she snapped furiously and moved away from him on the couch well pevsner said dmitri and svetlana were not intercepted in vienna and that was the end of that except of course that liam applied the old testament eyeforaneye principle to lavrenti tarasov and evgeny alekseev who had come to argentina in search of tom and svetlana not quite delchamps said alexs good buddy miss dillworth sicced a reportera good one roscoe j danton of the washington timesposton charley he came to alexs apartment just before we got out of there a reporter what did he want castillo asked he wanted you ace he probably wants to know why you stole sweaty and tom out from under miss dillworths nose and if dillworth told him about that i wouldnt be at all surprised if she told him you left the vienna rezidentwhat was his name demidovsitting in a taxi outside our embassy with an allamvedelmi hatosag garrote around his neck and her calling card on his chest i had nothing to do with that as you goddamn well know the story going around is that some old company dinosaur did that you sound like you think i had something to do with it delchamps said do i castillo said sarcastically funny thing about those old company dinosaurs charley youre too young of course to know much about them but they really believe in what it says in the old testament about an eye for an eye and if they do something like what happened to demidov they never ever fess up to it changing the subject just a little tom barlow said i think we should throw this into the facts bearing on the problem just as soon as sirinov and or vladimir vladimirovich heard that the americans had taken out the fish farm they realized that information had to have come from me you dont know that castillo argued in our profession charley tom said we never know anything all we ever have is a hypothesisor many hypothesesbased on what we think we know touche castillo said we all forget that at one time or another barlow said castillo met his eyes and thought that was kind of you tom but all it did was remind everyone in this room that i am the least experienced spook in it which truth be told i am one of the things i was tasked to do in berlin was make sure that the fish farm got whatever it needed barlow went on its not hard to come up with a hypothesis that sirinov and vladimir vladimirovich reasoned that since polkovnik berezovsky knew about the fish farm and it was destroyed shortly after polkovnik berezovsky defected to the americans whose cia had looked into the matter and decided the factory was indeed a fish farm polkovnik berezovsky told the americans what it really was you knew what the cia thought charley asked of course barlow said you had have a mole of course but you dont need a mole to learn things like that barlow said actually you can often learn more from a disgruntled worker who wouldnt think of betraying her country than from an asset on the payroll your pal dillworth for example alex delchamps said what is it they say hell hath no fury like a pissedoff female eleanor is a pro darby said again showing his loyalty she pointed roscoe danton at charley delchamps argued what hypothesis does that suggest darby looked at delchamps angrily looked for a moment as if he were going to reply but in the end said nothing castillo said whats your hypothesis tom about the stuff from the congo suddenly showing up at fort detrick well its clear its got something to do with this barlow replied what i dont know it could have something to do with vladimir vladimirovichs ego pevsner said he couldnt resist the temptation to let us know that we didnt wipe the fish farm off the face of the earth delchamps offered pevsner nodded if hes got that stuff he could have used it and he didnt castillo said thoughtfully so whats next delchamps said i buy that stickitupyourass motive alek but i dont think thats all there is to it pevsner nodded his agreement so charley has to tell those people in las vegas that hes changed his mind about working for them barlow said why would i want to do that castillo replied the office of organizational analysis no longer exists i am in compliance with my orders to fall off the face of the earth and never be seen again sweaty and i are going to build a vinecovered cottage by the side of the road and live happily therein forever afterward there goes that sophomoric sense of humor of yours again pevsner snapped how so castillo replied vladimir vladimirovich is going to come after you and svetlana pevsner said you ought to read a little mao zedong he wrote that the only real defense is active defense did he really castillo said i wonder where he got that probably from suntzu svetlana said seriously thats where most people think machiavelli got it suntzu castillo asked thats the chinaman who turned two hundred of the emperors concubines into soldiers and won the war with them ive always been an admirer of his it was one hundred eighty concubines svetlana said he got their attention by beheading the first of them who thought it was funny and giggled and then he beheaded the second one who giggled and then so on down the line until he came to one who understood that what was going on was no laughing matter does anybody else think sweatys trying to make a point delchamps asked innocently let me make a point several points castillo said seriously one as far as the intelligence community is concerned im a pariah so is everybody ever connected with the ooa they hated us when we had the blessing of the president and now hating us is politically correct ill bet right now both the company and the fbihell all the alphabet agencieshave a locate but do not detain bulletin out on us theyre not going to help us at all quite the opposite if we start playing james bond again well find ourselves counting paint flecks on the wall at the florence maximum security prison in colorado and if i have to say this well have less than zero help from anybody i think youre wrong about that charley barlow said we know that let me finish tom castillo said sharply point twoprobably the most important thingis that any operation we might try to run would have to have a leader and c castillo retired cannot be that leader what did president johnson say i shall not seek nor will i accept youre wrong about that too ace delchamps said i for one wont goand i dont think any of the others willunless youre running the show and we have to go since the option to that is sitting around waiting for some svr hit squad to whack us and romeo what about the fair juliet youre going to just sit around holding sweatys hand waiting for the hit squad to whack her worse drag her back to mother russia you dont know how the others will feel castillo said more than a little lamely hypothesis theyll all go any questions delchamps said count me in charley alex darby said i wouldnt know where to start castillo said im not sure if youve ever heard this before barlow said but some people in our line of work think collecting as much intelligence as possible as quickly as possible is a good way to start and how would i go about doing that thats what i started to say a moment ago barlow said you were there charley in that suite in the venetian hotel in las vegas when those people as much as told us that the director of central intelligence is either one of them or damn close to them i dont remember that castillo said the man who was a naval academy graduate quoted verbatim to you the unkind things you said to the dci something about the agency being a few very good people trying to stay afloat in a sea of leftwing bureaucrats who do you think told him about that i remember now castillo said but i really had forgotten thats not much of a recommendation is it charley i said id take your orders delchamps said but you saw the godfather yes of course both brando and the sonpacino de niro i never can keep them straighthad a consigliere think of me as robert duvall think of us both as robert duvall barlow said it was al pacino i dont think so delchamps said can either of my consiglieri suggest how i can get in touch with those people well if you hadnt been gulping down all that wild turkey id suggest you fly everybody to carinhall in aleks chopper but since you have been soaking up the booze i guess well have to drive over there and get on caseys radio no castillo said theres a casey radio in the aero commander it fits delchamps asked surprised aloysiuss stuff is so miniaturized its unbelievable castillo said but call your house alek and tell your man to stand by theres no printer in the airplane and youd better call down to the airstrip and have them push the plane from the hangar yes sir podpolkovnik castillo sir svetlana said and saluted him then she saw the look on his face my darling i love it when youre in charge of things it makes me feel comfortable and protected it makes me think aces had too much to drink delchamps said aloysius you think the offer from those people is still open castillo asked castillo was sitting in the pilots seat of the aero commander delchamps was in the copilots seat svetlana was kneeling in the aisle and her brother was leaning over her pevsner duffy and darby were sitting in the cabin max and janos were standing watchfully outside by the nose of the airplane i told them youd change your mind casey said this thing sort of scares me charley there was another beer keg of that stuff sitting on a road near the mexican border in texas this morning another one castillo asked another one they left it where the border patrol couldnt miss it its been taken to colonel hamilton at fort detrick were waiting to hear from him to tell us if its exactly the same thing well send me whatever intel you have everything you can get your hands on everything aloysius done what shape is the gulfstream in ready to go tell jake to take it to cancun theyll expect him you dont want him to pick you up down there no ill come commercial svetlana was tugging at his sleeve she rubbed her thumb and forefinger together mouthed money and then held up two fingers aloysius im going to need some cash castillo said no problem how much will those people stand still for two hundred thousand where do you want it castillo was now aware svetlana was shaking her head in what looked like incredulity but could have been disgust send it to otto gorner and tell him to put it in my personal account otto will have it within the hour anything else thats all i can think of let me know aloysius casey said and thanks charley break it down castillo looked over his shoulder at svetlana youre going to tell me what i did wrong arent you my love i meant two million dollars now those people are going to think they can hire you for an unimportant sum the more people pay you the more important they think you are well my love youll have to excuse my naivete this is the first time ive signed on as a mercenary well my darling youd better get used to it what youd better get used to ace delchamps said is thinking of sweaty as robert duvall three the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february it had proven impossible to gather together all the people the president had wanted for the meeting the secretary of defense was in europe at a nato meeting and the commanding general of the defense intelligence agency had gone with him the secretary of homeland security was in chicago when charles m montvale the director of national intelligence and colonel j porter hamilton mc usa walked into the oval office the secretary of state natalie cohen john powell the director of the central intelligence agency and mark schmidt the director of the federal bureau of investigation were sitting in chairs forming a rough semicircle facing the presidents desk so were assistant secretary of homeland security mason andrews standing in for the secretary and general allan b naylor usa commanding general of united states central command who was representing both the secretary of defense and the commanding general of the defense intelligence agency presidential spokesman jack porky parker sat at a small tablejust large enough to hold his laptop computerto one side of the president im sorry to be late mr president montvale said its my fault mr president hamilton said i was engaged in some laboratory processes i couldnt interrupt not even for the commander in chief clendennen asked unpleasantly if i had stopped doing what i was doing when mr montvale asked me to it would have caused a two or threehour loss of time hamilton said i considered a fifteen or twentyminute delay in coming here the lesser of two evils until just now colonel i wasnt aware that colonels were permitted to make decisions like that clendennen said sarcastically hamilton didnt reply what were you doing that you considered important enough to keep us all waiting for you to finish clendennen asked actually i had several processes working mr president hamilton uncowed said the most important of them being the determination that congox and congoy were chemicallyperhaps i should say biologicallyidentical whats congoy the president interrupted i have so labeled the material from the mexican border and are they identical that is my preliminary determination mr president colonel two questions general naylor announced sir clendennen didnt like having his questioning of hamilton interrupted by anyone and had his mouth open to announce excuse me general but im asking the questions when he changed his mind clendennen liked general naylor and had been pleased when he had shown up to stand in for the secretary of the defense and defense intelligence agency general he knew he could always believe what naylor told him this was not true of the people he was standing in for the secretary of defense had assured president clendennen that the infernal laboratory in the congo had first been completely reduced to pebbles and then incinerated clendennen had never heard the dia general mouth an unqualified statement theyre related obviously naylor began first do you know with reasonable certainty who developed this terrible substance and second how would you say they intend to use it against us sir i have nothing to support this legally or scientifically but something tells me the origins of this substance go back at least to world war two and perhaps earlier than that go down that road clendennen ordered during the second world war sir both the germans and the japanese experimented with materials somewhat similar to congox that is to say biological material that could be used as a weapon the japanese tested it in china on the civilian population and the germans on concentration camp inmates and did it work the president asked all we have is anecdotal mr president hamilton said there is a great deal of that and all of it suggests that it was effective there is strong reason to believe material similar to this was tested on american prisoners of war by the japanese do we know that or dont we the president asked impatiently a number of pows were executed by the japanese immediately after hiroshima their bodies were cremated and the ashes disposed of at sea naylor said nice people the president said and there is further evidence mr president that the chinese sent several hundred american pows captured in the early days of the korean war to czechoslovakia where they were subjected to biological material apparently similar to something like this again no proof we know the prisoners were sent to czechoslovakia but no bodies not one were ever recovered we still have graves registration people looking why dont we know more about the chemicals about whatever was used on the prisoners at the time mr president naylor said the greatest threat was perceived to be the possibility the russians would get their hands on german science visavis a nuclear weapon and rocketry we were quite successful in doing so but the effort necessary was at the expense of looking more deeply into what the germans had been doing with biological weapons in the pacific actually we acquired what anecdotal information we have about the executed and cremated pows primarily because macarthur was passionately determined to locate try and hang as quickly as possible those japanese officers responsible for the atrocities committed against our prisoners they were so to speak just one more atrocity the president considered that for a moment so then what is your theory about this colonel hamilton he asked hamilton began its pure conjecture mr president i thought it might be the president interrupted sarcastically and gestured for hamilton to continue hamilton ignored the interruption and went on it is possible that at the end of world war two the russians came into possession of a substance much like congox they might even have acquired it from the japanese there was an interchange of technical information they very likely acquired at the same time the german scientists working with this material much as we took over wernher von braun his rocket scientists and the rockets themselves if this is trueand even if it is not and russian scientists alone worked with itit had to have become immediately apparent to them how incredibly dangerous it is why is it so incredibly dangerous the president interrupted yet again hamilton looked at clendennen a long moment then carefully said with respect mr president i believe im repeating myself but the congox in my laboratory when placed under certain conditions of temperature and humidity gives off microscopic particlesairbornewhich when inhaled into the lung of a warmblooded mammal will in a matter of days begin to consume the flesh of the lung meanwhile the infected body will also be giving offbreathing back into the airthese contaminated infectious particles before the host has any indication that hes been infected when i was in the congo and saw the cadavers of animals and humans who had died of this infestation i told the presidentour late presidentthat the fish farm should there be an accident had the potential of becoming a greater risk to mankind than the nuclear meltdown at chernobyl had posed thats pretty strong isnt it colonel the president asked now that i have some idea of the danger mr president hamilton said that was a massive understatement is there a way to kill this material naylor asked ive had some success with incineration at temperatures over one thousand degrees centigrade hamilton said looked at the president and added thats about two thousand degrees fahrenheit mr president i seem to recall the secretary of defense telling me that the attack produced that kind of heat the president said then where did the two separate packages of congox come from secretary of state natalie cohen asked therere only two possibilities ambassador montvale said the attack was not successful everything was not incinerated and someonei suspect the russianswent in there and picked up what was missed or the russians all along had a stock of this stuff in russia and thats what theyre sending us why what do they want cohen asked were not even sure its the russians are we mark schmidt the director of the fbi asked are we mr director of national intelligence the president asked are we sure whos been sending us the congox not at this time mr president montvale replied have we the capability of sending someone into the congo assistant secretary of homeland security mason andrew asked to do in the greatest secrecywhat do they call itdamage assessment not anymore natalie cohen said there was a long silence madam secretary the president asked finally icily would i be wrong to think that you had a certain colonel costello in mind when you said that she met his eyes i had lieutenant colonel carlos castillo in mind yes sir she said i was thinking that since he managed to successfully infiltrate colonel hamilton into the congo and more importantly exfiltrate him werent you listening madam secretary when i said that in this administration there will be no private bands of special operators i thought i had made that perfectly clear castillo and his men have been dispersed he was ordered by my predecessor tothe phrase he used was fall off the face of the earth never to be seen again i never want to hear his name mentioned again much less to see him is everybody clear on that absolutely clear yes mr president secretary cohen said there was a murmur as everyone responded at once yes sir yes mr president absolutely clear mr president mr president there may be a problem in that area porky parker said the president looked at him in surprise perhaps even shock the president thought he had made it absolutely clear to parker that the spokesmans role in meetings like this was to listen period what did you say jack the president asked softly mr president roscoe danton of the washington timespost is looking for colonel castillo how do you know that he came to me sir and what did you tell him i told him i had no idea where he was parker said charles sir montvale replied where is castillo i dont know mr president i told you the next time i asked that question i would expect an answer im working on it mr president but so far without any results wonderful its so nice to know that whenever i want to know something all i have to do is ask my director of national intelligence there was another thirtysecond silence and then the president went on far be it from me to try to tell the director of national intelligence how to do his job but i have just had this probably useless thought if roscoe danton is looking for colonel castillo perhaps he has an idea where he is has anyone thought of that wheres danton there was no reply find out for me charles will you please ill get right on it mr president montvale said four the office of the director of national intelligence eisenhower executive office building th street and pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february i cant think of anything else to do can you ambassador montvale asked truman c ellsworth his executive assistant when ellsworth had called the washington timespost for roscoe j danton they refused to tell him where he was they said they would contact danton and tell him ambassador montvale wanted to speak with him ellsworth finally called the publisher bradley benjamin iii and told him what had happened and asked for his help mr benjamin told him that what he had already been offered was all he was going to get and please give ambassador montvale his best regards since both truman c ellsworth and charles m montvale would swearbecause they believed itthat they were incapable of letting anger or a bruised ego interfere in the slightest with their judgment or the execution of their offices what happened next was attributed to the fervor with which they chose to meet the presidents request to locate mr roscoe j danton the national security agency at fort meade maryland was directed as the highest priority to acquire and relay to the ambassadors office any traffic by telephone or over the internet containing mr dantons name the department of homeland security was directed to search the flight manifests of every passenger airliner taking off from either reagan international airport or dulles international airport during the past fortyeight hours for the name of roscoe j danton and if found to immediately report his destination and time of arrival thereat the secret service was ordered to obtain the residential address of mr roscoe j danton and to place such premises under aroundtheclock surveillance and to immediately report any sighting of mr danton they were further ordered to send agents to the national press club to see if any clue to his whereabouts could be obtained the cooperation of the fbi was sought and obtained to put out an immediate locate but do not detain bulletin on mr danton i just had an idea mr ellsworth said when asked if he could think of anything else that could be done he told the white house operator get the washington timespost for him again this time the corporate travel department montvales eyebrows rose but he didnt comment hello corporate travel ellsworth then said yes hi brad benjamin just told me you would know where i can find roscoe danton not sixty seconds after that he said got it thank you hung up the phone and turned to ambassador montvale and reported danton went to buenos aires they made a reservation for him at the marriott plaza the marriott plaza montvale replied obviously surprised thats what they told me you want me to put in a call to our ambassador i wouldnt believe that sonofabitch if he told me what day it is the cia station chief then get me john powell ill have the dci call the station chief and tell him ill be calling ellsworth told the white house operator to connect the director of national intelligence with the director of central intelligence on a secure line and then pushed the loudspeaker button and handed the receiver to montvale jack charles m montvale i want you to give me the name of the station chief in buenos aires and something about him and then call him and tell him ill be calling on an errand for the president hang on a second charles powell replied he came back on the line ninety seconds later got a little problem charles we had a really good man there alex darby but he went out the door with castillo a kid just out of the farm has been filling in for darby until bob lowe another good man can clear his desk in mexico city i dont know if lowe made it down there yet well please call the kid and tell him ill be calling clendennen charles m montvale mr president ive located mr danton hes in the marriott plaza hotel in buenos aires that would suggest he knows where colonel castillo is wouldnt you say thats a strong possibility mr president i presume your next call will be to the ambassador down there i was thinking of calling the cia station chief mr president okay your call that might be best now that i think of it theres a small problem there mr president the acting station chief is a young man just out of agency training john powell just told me that the man hes sending down there to replace the former station chief who sir fell off the face of the earth with castillo has not reported for duty so what are you planning to do i thought i would send truman ellsworth down there sir just as soon as he can get to andrews i dislike micromanagement charles as you know but if i were in your shoes i would go down there myself take whatshisname with you if you like yes sir thats probably the right thing to do it would be better if someone of your stature were the person to suggest to costello that he would be illadvised to get anywhere near our little problem you understand me yes sir keep me advised president clendennen said and montvale heard the click that signaled the commander in chief had terminated the call ill call andrews and have the plane ready truman ellsworth said their presidential mission began in a twogmcyukon convoy from the executive office building the first secretserviceagentdriven blacktintedwindow yukon held the driver the two secret service agents assigned to protect montvale and the two assigned to protect ellsworth the second yukon carried montvale and ellsworth and everyones luggage on the way to andrews air force base montvale and ellsworth consoled themselves for having to travel all the way down to argentina by agreeing that it wouldnt be that bad a trip the cathe air force designation for the gulfstream von which they would fly was just about as nice an airplane as airplanes came it had a range greater than the odd miles between washington and buenos aires and could cruise nonstop at mach or a little faster than five hundred miles per hour there was room for eight passengers which meant that montvale and ellsworthrank hath its privilegescould make the most of the journey spread out on bedsize couches or they could sit up on the couches and have a drink or two from the portable bar in one of the secret service agents luggage and they were sure to get one of the two gulfstream vs at andrews ellsworth had made a point of telling the commanding officer of the presidential flight detachment that he and montvale were traveling at the direct personal order of president clendennen that however did not come to pass at andrews they learned that one of the two gulfstream v jets had carried mrs sueellen clendennen to montgomery alabama where the first ladys mother was sick in hospital both montvale and ellsworth habitually took a look at the reports of the presidential security detail they therefore knew the presidents motherinlaw was not in a hospital per se but rather an assistedliving facility and that her being sick therein was a sort of code which meant the old lady had once again eluded her caretakers and acquired a stock of intoxicants that was moot they knew they were outranked by the first lady and the second gulfstream v at andrews was not available to them either as it was being held for possible use by someone else who outranked them the speaker of the house of representatives who could be counted upon to throw a female fit of monumental proportions if a gulfstream v was not immediately available to take her to her home in palm beach if she suddenly felt the urge to go there that left only a cawhat the air force called the gulfstream iiifrom the halfdozen kept by the air force for vip transport at andrews for their flight to buenos aires while just about as fast as a ca the ca is a somewhat smaller aircraft with a maximum range of about thirtyseven hundred miles that meant that not only was a fuel stop necessary en route to buenos aires but that the couches on which montvale and ellsworth would attempt to sleep were neither as wide nor as comfortable as those on the gulfstream v would have been they had finally gotten off the ground at andrews just before midnight flight time was a few minutes under twelve hours the fuel stop added another hour and fortyfive minutes there was a onehour difference between time in washington and in buenos aires they would arrive if there were no problems at jorge newbery airport in buenos aires at about one in the afternoon one estancia san joaquin near san martin de los andes patagonia neuquen province argentina february aleksandr pevsner took a sip of his afterdinner brandy then took a puff on his afterdinner cigar and then pointed the cigar at castillo castillo also had a cigar but no brandy in the morning he was going to have to fly the bell ranger to the airport at san carlos de bariloche where pevsner had decided earlier his learjet would be waiting to fly them over the andes to el tepual international airport in puerto montt chile they would travel to cozumel on a peruaire cargo plane carrying foodstuffs for the cruise ship trade and pevsners grand cozumel beach amp golf resort castillo would have to do that twice there wasnt room in the helicopter to fly everybody at once i have been thinking friend charley pevsner announced uhoh castillo replied pevsner shook his head in resignation and then went on two things first i think it would be useful if i went to cozumel with you i have contacts in mexico that might be useful and if youre going to use the beach and golf as a base certain arrangements will have to be made comments makes sense tom barlow said i agree svetlana said pay attention marlon brando delchamps said your consiglieri have been heard from this meets with your approval charley who am i to argue with my consiglieri but i wonder what you would have said if i had said thats a lousy idea second ive been thinking that it would be best if you flew the aero commander to puerto montt that would both save us time in the morning and we would be less conspicuous the latter depends of course on whether you can fly that airplane over the andes can you quick answer no castillo replied the commanders cabin is not pressurized and the service ceiling is about thirteen thousand feet there are lots of rockfilled clouds in the andes much higher than that actually the average height is about thirteen thousand feet pevsner said could you fly around the peaks probably castillo said id have to look at the charts and i dont have any charts janos call down to the hangar and have them bring the necessary aerial charts pevsner ordered and when youve finished that call the house and have our luggage prepared if after i look at the charts and decide i can fly around the peaks id still have to make two flights castillo said we cant get everybody in the commander at once have you considered that youd have to make two flights in the lear too taking the little airplane still makes more sense svetlana said concur tom barlow said there they go again delchamps said what would you do without them whispering sage advice in your ear don carlos tom barlow chuckled svetlana gave him the finger two el tepual international airport puerto montt chile february the first flight in the aero commander from estancia san joaquin through the andes mountains had carried alek pevsnerwho had said he wanted to make sure things went smoothly in puerto monttplus janos tom barlow sweaty and of course max the casey avionics worked perfectly and everyone but the pilot seemed to enjoy the flight in the early light of day the snowcapped andes were incredibly beautiful the pilot spent much time during the flightwhenever the altimeter showed that he was at or just over thirteen thousand feetremembering that the us army had taught him that at any altitude over twelve thousand feet the pilots brain is denied the oxygen it needs despite its grandiose title el tepual international was just about completely deserted when they landed there was no peruaire cargo jet in sight just three chevrolet suburbans whose drivers looked more slavic than one would expect of chileans svetlana immediately exercised her female right to change her mind and announced she would return to estancia san joaquin with castillo to pick up alex darby and edgar delchamps that could be because my lover cant bear to be even briefly separated from me but on the other hand it could be because former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva of the svr thinks she had better keep an eye on the crazy american to make sure that he doesnt do something stupid the second flight went smoothly and this time the pilot elected to fly more closely to the terrain rather than trying to attain as much altitude as he could and when he turned on final approach he saw that there was another aircraft on the tarmac a peruaire boeing lr jesus thats one great big beautiful sonofabitch when he taxied up close to it feeling like one of the little people gulliver had encountered in his travels he saw that a swarm of workers had just about finished loading it with refrigerated containers what was the tripleseven freighters revenue payload i think alek said just over a hundred tonsone hundred twelve tons was what he said jesus thats a lot of seafood and beef ten minutes after he landed at el tepual he was strapped into one of the ten seats in the passenger compartment just behind the s cockpit the plane began to taxi and when it turned onto the main runway the pilot simply advanced the throttles and it began the takeoff roll one of marlon brandos consiglieri caught his hand with one of hers and crossed herself with the other three jorge newbery international airport buenos aires argentina february as the gulfstream iii carrying ambassador montvale and his party had made its approach to the airport montvale had remembered that the last time he had met with the sonofabitch in argentina lieutenant colonel c g castillo had pointed out to him that inasmuch as they were in a foreign and sovereign nation his secret service security detail did not enjoy diplomatic immunity and therefore had no right to bear arms and were thus liable to be arrested for doing so he elected not to mention this to anyone if there was a problem ambassador juan manuel silvio would have to deal with it and deal with it he would have to im here at the direct order of the president of the united states i look forward to making that point to that slick bastard and pal of castillos before the gulfstream iii had reached the end of its landing roll jorge newbery ground control directed it to the commercial side of the airfield on the bank of the river plate there they were met by argentine immigration and customs officers and two members of the staff of the united states embassy they were passed through both bureaucratic procedures quickly and without incident importantly no argentine official searched the persons of anyone which neutralized the problem of his armed security detail at least for the moment there were two diplomats from the american embassy on hand to meet the gulfstream one introduced himself as colonel c c call me cc downs the military attache he said he was there to take care of the crew there were three crew members the male pilot a major the male copilot a captain and a stout woman wearing the chevrons of a senior master sergeant she had delivered a stewardesstype speech about the safety features of the ca ordered everybody to fasten their seat belts and then taken a seat from which she had arisen only once to announce that intoxicants were prohibited aboard air force ca aircraft and if the secret service agent in the process of pouring scotch into glasses for the montvale party continued to do so she would have to make an official report to her superiors cc said he would take care of the crew and that mr spears would know how to contact them when their services were required he then loaded the crew into an embassys yukon and drove off mr i ronald spears was carried on the books as an assistant consular officer but was in fact the acting cia station chief for buenos aires he had assumed that duty following the unexpected retirement of alexander w darby the director of the central intelligence agency had first planned to replace darby with paul sieno the cia station chief in paraguay only to learn that sieno too had suddenly retired presumably to join lieutenant colonel castillo in his disappearance from the face of the earth and was therefore not available next the cia station chief in mexico city robert t lowe had been ordered to buenos aires to replace darby but he was still in the process of clearing his desk in mexico city i ronald spears was twentyfour years old looked to be about nineteen and had graduated from cia training four months before apparently unaware that the director of national intelligence and his deputy each had secret service protection details spears had brought to the airport a single embassy yukon into which the four secret service agents montvale ellsworth and their luggage could be loaded only with great difficulty spears lost no time somewhat smugly telling ambassador montvale that he had taken the liberty of changing the reservations ambassador montvale had requested the ambassador and his party would now be housed in the alvear palace hotel rather than the marriott plaza as spears had learned that the former was much classier than the latter with great effort montvale did not say what he wanted to say instead he asked do you happen to know spears if mr danton is in the marriott plaza mr who ambassador montvale at that point montvale remembered that he had asked jack powell the dci only to tell the acting station chief that he was going to buenos aires and had not asked him to tell the acting station chief to start looking for either roscoe j danton or lieutenant colonel castillo my first order of business is to see the ambassador montvale then announced so well go to the embassy first the pleasure of envisioning that confrontationmr ambassador i am here at the personal order of the presidentwas quickly shattered when spears told him that the ambassador and most of his staff would be out of town until the next day i shouldnt be surprised by that the moment that sonofabitch heard i was coming down here silvio got on his horse and galloped his miserable ass out of town certainly someones minding the store right spears yes sir mizz sylvia grunblatt has the duty and she is the embassy press officer mr ambassador roscoe j danton is either still in the marriott plaza or he isnt and even if the press officer cant tell me where to find castillo she might know where that station chiefdarbyis and darby can lead me to castillo at the very least this female has the authority to order up another vehicle and driver riding around buenos aires in a stuffedtothegills yukon is simply not acceptable take me to see miss grun whatever you said her name is montvale ordered grunblatt mr ambassador mizz sylvia grunblatt miss grunblatt the president has sent mr ellsworth and me down here to have a word with lieutenant colonel c g castillo do you know who i mean yes i do mr montvale do you happen to know where i can find him im afraid not grunblatt said theres been a journalista good one roscoe j danton of the washington timespostdown here looking for him too whats that all about you said has been may i infer that mr danton is no longer here the last i heard he was in the marriott plaza what about alexander darby miss grunblatt if you dont mind mr montvale i prefer ms after a perceptible pause the director of national intelligence said excuse me mizz grunblatt what did you mean mr montvale when you asked what about alexander darby i assume you know he resigned i dont suppose it would surprise an experienced foreign service officer such as yourself mizz grunblatt if i told you mr darby had duties beyond those of commercial attache if youre asking did i know that alex was a spook yes i did ive known that he was in the agencys clandestine service since we served in rome and thats oh twenty years ago and do you know where he is now by any chance mizz grunblatt havent a clue the last time i saw him was at ezeiza the airport he was going where do you know what he did mr montvale was go through the departing argentina immigration procedure on his diplomatic passport and then he turned right around and came back so to speak into argentina on his regular passport he then gave meas an embassy officerhis diplomatic passport and carnet then i drove him here to the embassy where he got out of my car and got in a taxi then hes still in argentina would you know where i didnt say that hes still here i dont know if he is or not i know his wife and children arent here any longer i put them on a plane to the states but not mr darby no not mr darby i dont know where alex is do you happen to know where mrs darby was going i do and ill give you the address once you tell me youre acting in an official capacity ive already done that thats right you have grunblatt said she picked up a pen and wrote an address on a piece of notepaper and handed it to him montvale glanced at it saw that it meant nothing to him then handed it to one of his secret service men hang on to that yes sir the secret service agent looked at it and then said mr ambassador i know what this is this west boulevard drive its the alexandria house colonel castillo and the others had i drew the duty there a couple of times when it was under secret service protection mizz grunblatt im going to have to get on a secure line to the secret service in washington grunblatt considered that a moment then said yes i can arrange that for you i presume youd prefer to talk from a secure location youre damned right i would theres absolutely no reason for you to hear what im going to say could that be arranged itll take me a minute or two to set it up she said youll have to go to the commo room i understand thank you very much not a problem grunblatt said as she pushed herself out of her chair and while im on the phone mizz grunblatt do you suppose you could rustle up another car for me all we have is a yukon and were stuffed into it like sardines the call i can do the car i cant all of our vehicles are out of town with the ambassador tomorrow afternoon if he returns as scheduled it should be no problem at all is that cuban sonofabitch capable of that taking all the cars with him so that i have to ride around town like a fish in a can secret service claudeen this is the state department switchboard i have ambassador montvale on a secure line for the senior agent on duty hold one please for supervisory special agent mcguire it will be a moment ambassador montvale not a problem montvale knew supervisory special agent thomas mcguire he had once been in charge of the presidential protection detail a good man more important he knows who i am mcguire tom this is charles m montvale good afternoon mr ambassador how are you sir much better now that ive got you on the phone tom i need someone with a grasp of the situation what situation is that sir there are two facets of it tom im sure you know what happened to the office of organizational analysis thats not much of a secret sir and youve heard im sure about whats been going on in the last few days at fort detrick yes sir well im in buenos aires the president sent mr ellsworth and me down here to locate colonel castillo to make sure he understands that he is not to go anywhere near that problem i am to personally relay that presidential order to castillo once i find him castillos in argentina sir i dont know where he is but ive come across a lead one of the members of the nowdisbanded ooa was an agency officer named alexander w darby he retired when castillo got the boot now i cant find him but i have reason to believe his wife got a pencil yes sir is in a house at seventytwo hundred west boulevard drive in alexandria isnt that the place we used to protect yes it is thats what i meant by your having a grasp of the situation now what i want you to do is send a couple of your best men out therebetter yet go yourselfand see if darby is there and if hes not ask his wife if she knows where he is im sure darby knows where castillo is have you got a first name on the wife sir call her mrs darby you irish moron no im afraid not well then ill just call her mrs darby thatll work now tom there is a possibility that she might deny he is there and another possibility slight but real that castillo himself might be there and even a remote possibility that two russians were looking forformer svr colonel dmitri berezovsky and former svr lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseevamay also be in that house castillo is just arrogant enough wouldnt you agree to try to hide himself and the russians in plain sight so to speak would you spell those russian names for me please montvale did so then added so do a really thorough job of searching the place yes sir and what do i do if i find these people if you find darbyyou irish moronyou find out from him where castillo and the russians are if you find castillo or the russians you detain them and immediately notify the president or his chief of staff yes sir and whom do i see at justice for the warrants sir what warrants the search warrant for the premises and the arrest warrants for castillo and these russians you dont need a warrantyou cretinyoure acting on the authority of the president yes sir i understand and from whom do i get that sir get what the presidential authority i just gave it to you sir it has to be in writing i would suppose if im to act on the authority of the president president clendennen would have to sign it himself well what did i expect mcguire is part of the washington bureaucratic establishment you dont rise in thatfor that matter stay in thatunless you have mastered the fine art of covering your ass tom im not sure if president clendennen would be available to do that at this time so heres what i want you to do just go out there with enough of your people to place the premises under aroundtheclock surveillancediscreet surveillance this situation requires as im sure you understand the greatest discretion yes sir i understand do you happen to know either darby or his wife tom ive met them sir then could you just knock at the door unofficially and tell mrs darby you were in the neighborhood and took a chance to see if darby was at home that would work sir and if he is then you tell him that youre looking for colonel castillo that you have a message for castillo from me that has to be personally delivered yes sir and if he directs me to colonel castilloi mean if i find himthen what do i do you dont actually have to talk to him tom just locate him put him under really tight surveillance then call my office and tell them to get word to me that youve found colonel castillo ill take it from there yes sir ill get right on it good man i cant tell you how pleased i am that you were on duty tom i know i can rely on you thank you sir ill do my best there may be just about a dimes worth of silver in this black cloud darby might be at the house in alexandria he might know where castillo is and he might tell mcguire montvale found i ronald spears waiting for him outside the communications room get in touch with that air force colonel spears tell him to keep the pilots off the booze something has come up that might require my immediate return to washington yes sir do that immediately after you drop me off at the hotel yes sir four west boulevard drive alexandria virginia february dianne sanders a grandmotherly type in her early fifties was wearing an apron over her dress when she answered the chimes well hello mr mcguire what brings you to our door im hoping mrs darby is here tom mcguire said can i wonder why you might hope that or would that be impolite come on dianne mcguire said ill see if mrs darby is at home if youll please wait lock up the liquor mrs julia darby said thirty seconds later the secret service is here she walked up to mcguire and said im not sure if im glad to see you or not but ill give you a kiss anyway she stood on her toes and kissed his cheek are you here socially or otherwise tom she asked otherwise im afraid uhoh why did i suspect that dianne sanders asked i have been ordered here by ambassador montvale to see if alex is here and if not to ask you to tell me where he is did he say why he was curious he hopes alex will point him to charley castillo he says he has a message for him why didnt he come himself he called me from buenos aires ahha the plot deepens julia darby said is alex here she shook her head can you point me either to him or charley the question is not whether i can but whether i will if i pointed at somebody you would feel dutybound to tell montvale right yes i would i cannot tell a lie especially to a senior officer of the united states secret service she said she then took a moment to orient herself and pointed in the general direction of south america to the best of my knowledge and belief both of them are somewhere down there your cooperation is deeply appreciated you were pointing at south america right in that general direction yes can you will you be more specific she shook her head not even if i told you that ambassador montvale told me hes acting for president clendennen especially if you told me that one final question julia youre not concealing two exsvr officers on the premises are you i will answer that question no i am not and you wouldnt know where such people would be either right julia darby again pointed toward south america they could be down that way she said but on the other hand maybe not those svr people are slippery you know he chuckled is my interrogation over or is there anything else youd like to

my husband is shopping he shops i cook should be back anytime now dianne sanders had spent most of her working career as a cryptographer and later as a highly respected cryptographic analyst harold her husband had been a delta force special operator until he developed heart disease and had been medically retired for a while he had been what he described as a camp follower taking care of their house while dianne stayed on active duty that hadnt worked and eventuallyhell with both our retirements we can live pretty damned welldianne had retired too that hadnt worked either they both had been climbing the walls of their garden apartment in fayetteville north carolina when cwo colin leverette aka uncle remus who had been around the block many times with harold asked them if they would be interested in running a safe house for charley castillo outside washington harold had been around just as many blocks with castillo as he had with uncle remus and the sanderses had jumped at the chance to get out of the garden apartment julia darby made bloody marys and handed them to tom and dianne take a sip of that and then go back on duty she said he did so and said okay ask me how alex is julia said okay hows alex i hope that miserable sonofabitch and his hotpants largebreasted twentyyearold argentine girlfriend freeze together in ushuaia she said where or what is ushuaia its the

admiringly and tapped his bloody mary against hers how do you spell ushuaia five penthouse b the grand cozumel beach amp golf resort cozumel quintana roo mexico february en route to cozumelsomewhere over perua dozing castillo woke to find sweatys head resting on his neck upon smelling her perfume he realized with more than a little pleasure that there was going to be enough time between their arrival in cozumel and dinner for what the frenchwho sometimes do things with a certain stylecalled a cinq a sept he dozed off again considering this pleasant possibility to be wakened perhaps an hour after that by one of the pilots of the boeing offering him a very nice luncheon plate fresh from the microwave sweaty already had hers castillo waited until the pilot had moved away then asked her in french ma chere what does a fivetoseven mean to you five to seven means what it sounds like she replied in russian i have no idea what a fivetoseven means just as soon as we get to our room in the hotel ill show you ahe pronounced the term phoneticallysankahset she kissed his cheek but i have other plans for you just as soon as we get to our room in the hotel my darling svetlana then removed any doubt he might have had that there was a certain sexual overtone to her remark by quickly groping him it was not to be when they got to penthouse b they were not alone everybody who had been on the plane was with them we had to move some guests alek pevsner explained that shouldnt take long i always like to know whos in the room next to mine how long is long castillo asked as in shouldnt take long pevsner ignored him and went to the bar and reached for a bottle of bourbon alex darby opened a sliding glass door and inhaled appreciatively the final death blow to my marriage will come when my wife hears im in a penthouse in cozumel by the sea he announced while she is in the snow and slush of washington trying to find some roof over her and our abused children is that good or bad delchamps asked max pushed darby out of his way having seen penthouse bs swimming pool which had obviously been put there for his use he immediately decided that a quick dip after the long flight was just what he needed a bouvier des flandres is a large animal and can cause a substantial splash when diving into a pool the splash reached darby everyone laughed pevsner went to a bathroom and returned with a towel for darby by then max having enough aquatic activity had climbed out of the pool and was now standing on the edge of the pool shaking the water from his body the fur of a bouvier des flandres can hold an astonishing amount of water pevsners shirt and trousers had received a good deal of flying water and there were drops all over his face which was now pale with anger and tightlipped everyone waited for pevsners explosion when it didnt come castillo poured gasoline on the smoldering embers well it was high time you had a bath castillo offered and max was just being helpful pevsner looked at him and then said i have just had a horrible thought i cant wait to hear what that is castillo replied those adorable puppies you gave my elena and dmitris sofya are going to turn into uncontrollable beasts like that pevsner took another look at his drenched trousers and announced believe it or not this place makes it clear on all the advertising that it is not a petfriendly hotel i hear that they make exceptions for friends of the owner castillo said sometimes the owner is sorry he has certain friends pevsner said as he patted his clothing with a towel sweaty i think he means me castillo said say something rude to him why doesnt everybody get out of here so that i can have a shower sweaty said methinks the lady has carnal desires on our leaders body delchamps said throwing water on that topic pevsner said colonel torine and the others are on their way from the airport they just got here castillo asked the manager just told me i told him to send them here when they arrive pevsner said and glanced at svetlana while were waiting for rooms further delaying svets bath and the satisfaction of her other desires tom barlow said now she will say something rude very probably pevsner said and smiled warmly at her and castillo castillo thought my god aleksandr pevsner youre good ive known you long and well enough to know when youre really pissed off and the last time i saw you this pissed was when you learned that howard kennedy had betrayed you if you could youd happily throw max off the balcony a la ivan the terrible who svetlana told me threw dogs off the kremlin walls so he could watch them try to walk on broken legs but right now you need all the help you can get to protect you and your family from putin and the svrwhich means you think thats a real threat which is nice to knowand you cant afford to piss me offwhich means you think i have what you dont have and cant do without which is also nice to knowso you smile warmly at the uncontrollable beasts owner and his girlfriend as if you agree that hes an adorable puppy and you didnt mind getting soaked at all they call that professional control and its one facet of character i dont have and really wish i did ten minutes later the doorbell chimed and when alex darby answered it seven former members of the nowdefunct office of organizational analysistwo more than castillo expectedwalked in they were colonel jake torine usaf retired former usaf captain richard sparkman former usmc gunnery sergeant lester bradley major h richard miller jr usa retired first lieutenant edmund lorimer mi retired chief warrant officer five colin leverette retired and former fbi special agent david william yung jr i knew in my bones that there would be no rest for the weary leverette greeted him how they hanging charley colin leverette was an enormous black man a legendary special operations man known to his close friendsand only his close friendsas uncle remus you and twogun got yourselves kicked out of uruguay did you castillo said and turned to torine you actually went to uruguay to pick them up wasnt that a little out of your way it was a supply run charley torine said and then seeing the confusion on castillos face added about which i gather you didnt know im always the last to know anything jake you know that we went down there with a planeload of the newest casey radios torine said thats not precise we went down there with a bunch of the newest casey radios you wont believe how small the new ones are and they dont need the directv dish antenna leverette said colonel torine was kind enough to take pity on us when we met him in montevideo and told him that unless he took us with him we couldnt get here in less than seventytwo hours he was weeping piteously torine said he said you needed him to do what uncle remus castillo asked to get you out of whatever trouble youre in leverette said and your excuse twogun castillo asked i came to deliver this yung said and handed castillo a small package whats this two hundred thousand in usedtherefore nonsequentially numberedhundreds fresh from the cashiers cage at the venetian yung said when casey told me youd asked for the money i told him to give it in cash to jake it would have been too easy to trace if it went into and out of your personal german account i dont recall asking for volunteers castillo said oh come on charley leverette said come and let uncle remus give you a great big kiss screw you castillo said moving with astonishing speed for his bulk leverette walked quickly to castillo wrapped his massive arms around him which pinned castillos arms to his sides and then proceeded to wetly kiss both of castillos cheeks and then his forehead castillo saw that pevsner was smiling thats a genuine smile because uncle remus is kissing me or because hes really happy to see the reinforcements leverette finally turned castillo free now leverette announced just as soon as i have a little something to cut the dust of the trail we will see what charleys problem is and set about solving it i already have the essential ingredient he dug in his pocket and came out triumphantly with a small bottle peychauds bitters i never leave home without it i shall also require rye whiskygood rye whiskysome simple syrup absinthe lemons ice and a suitable vessel in which to assemble the above i feel better already castillo said what is he talking about pevsner asked a sazerac castillo said and what is a sazerac tom barlow asked nectar of the gods leverette said gods reward to the worthy he examined the stock of intoxicants in the bar finally coming up triumphantly with a bottle of van winkle family reserve rye in his left hand and a bottle of wild turkey rye in his right these will do nicely but i cant find any syrup absinthe or lemons presumably there is room service lester castillo ordered get on the horn and tell room service that mr pevsner requires immediately what uncle remus just said yes sir bradley said and started for the telephone youre all going to sit around and get drunk is that the idea pevsner asked unpleasantly we have a serious problem and leverette interrupted him charley i hate to tell you this but im starting to dislike your russian buddy again me too edgar delchamps said who do you think youre talking to pevsner demanded angrily somebody who thinks hes ivan the terrible jr leverette asked innocently castillo laughed but even as he did he realized that was not the wise thing to do not one more word from anybody svetlana snapped not one everyone looked at her in surprise castillo and leverette had much the same thought at the same moment but leverette was the first to say it out loud be careful he said in russian sweaty just put on her podpolkovniks hat youd better be careful castillo said thats way over your word limit what podpolkovnik alekseeva said was not one more word i said from anybody and that includes you svetlana snapped for gods sake charley youre in command act like a commander everyone looked at castillo to see what his reaction to that would be his first reaction was a sudden realization this is getting out of control and the commander is in large measure responsible sweatys right about that his next reaction was on the other hand sweaty should not have snapped at the commander like that telling him to act like a commander one of the problems of having women subordinates is that one cannot jump all over their asses when they deserve it especially when said female subordinate is sharing ones bed this sort of situation was not dealt with in problems of leadership at west point nor anywhere else since ive been in the army correction during the time i was in the army so what are you going to do now general macarthur so that everyone can see you are in fact acting like youre in command confidently in command theres a hell of a difference between being in command and being confidently in command and those being commanded damned well know it you better think of something and quick colin leverette came to his rescue i know what leverette said lets start all over what svetlana asked no mr pevsner leverette went on we are not all going to sit around and get drunk were going to have onepossibly twosazerac cocktails and then were going to get down to business pevsner didnt respond castillo looked between them and thought i believe uncle remus just saved my ass what is that for the two hundred and eleventh time that was your cue mr pevsner delchamps said to say i should not have said what i did please forgive me pevsner looked at him incredulously its a question of command aleksandr tom barlow said his tone making it clear that now he was wearing his polkovniks hat if charley the commander doesnt object to something you have no right to now ask uncle remus to forgive your runaway mouth you have just earned my permission podpolkovnik berezovsky leverette said to call me uncle remus now everyone looked at pevsner uncle remus is waiting mr pevsner delchamps said after a long moment after another long moment pevsner smiled and said if an apology for saying something i should not have said is the price for one of mr leverettes cocktails i happily pay it castillo had another unpleasant series of rapid thoughts well pevsner caved and quicker than i thought he would problem solved wait a minute aleksandr pevsnerunlike menever says anything until he thinks it through he knew the apology meant he understood he cant question me but what about the first crack he made was that an attempt to put himself in charge if wed caved that would have put him in a position to questionquestion hell disapproveof anything alek you sonofabitch his chain of thought was interrupted by the arrival of the butlernot a bellman penthouses a and b shared the fulltime services of an aroundtheclock butlerbearing simple syrup absinthe a bowl of ice a bowl of lemon twists and a tray of oldfashioned glasses the first thing we will doactually lester will do leverette announced is fill the glasses with ice this will chill them while i go through the rest of the process now how many are we going to need everyone expressed the desire to have a sazerac leverette arranged all the oldfashioned glasses in two rows you understand sweaty he said that one of my sazeracs has been known to turn a nun into a nymphomaniac ill take my chances stop talking and make the damned drink first we muddle the syrup and the peychaud bitters together leverette announced when ive done that we will carefully measure three ounces of rye per drink and a carefully measured amount of ice into the mixing vessel he picked up a champagne cooler and quickly rinsed it in the sink of the wet bar this will serve nicely as a mixing vessel he said and then demonstrated that his notion of a carefully measured three ounces of rye and ice per drink was to upend the bottle of wild turkey over the champagne cooler and empty it he shook it to get the last drop then repeated the process with the bottle of van winkle family reserve he then added four handfuls of ice cubes he stirred the mixture around with one of the empty bottles youll notice that i did not shake but rather stirred i learned that from doubleohseven he said then looked at bradley lester dump the ice lester emptied into the sink the melting ice from all the glasses i will now pour the absinthe and lester will swirl i know he will do a good job of swirling because i taught him myself leverette then picked up the bottle of absinthe and ran it very quickly over the lines of glasses in one motion this put perhaps a teaspoon of the absinthe in each glass lester then picked up each glass swirled the absinthe around and then dumped the absinthe into the sink leverette picked up the champagne cooler lester picked up a silver strainer and held it to the lip of the champagne cooler to hold back the ice cubes as leverette poured the chilled liquid content of the cooler into the glasses there is a slight excess leverette announced as he looked into the cooler stick this in the fridge lester waste not want not as my saintly mother was always saying leverette then picked up handfuls of the lemon twists and squeezed them in his massive hands which added not more than two drops of the essence into each glass finished he announced triumphantly he handed one to castillo and another to pevsner he handed a third to sweaty and took a fourth with him as he walked to the couch he raised his glass to pevsner took an appreciative sip and then asked and what do you think mr pevsner pevsner sipped his cocktail unusual pevsner said but very good i will pretend that i dont know the only reason you said that is because you knew i would tear off both of your arms and one leg if you hadnt and will accept that as a compliment youre insane pevsner said with a smile genius is often mistakenly identified as insanity leverette said im surprised you didnt know that now shall we deal with our problem he came to attention gestured at castillo and gave the nazi salute mein fuhrer you have the floor pevsners eyes rolled in disbelief castillo rose from his chair walked to the bar and leaned his back against it twogun he began i think youd better take notes yung gave him a thumbsup then reached for his laptop computer to bring everybody up to speed castillo began lets start with what we do know first somebody sent colonel hamilton a barrel of congox then in budapest colonel vladlen solomatin of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki handed eric kocian a letter asking him to get it to tom barlow the letter said in essence come home all is forgiven i think its likely the two actions are related about as likely as the sun will come up tomorrow svetlana said she waited for a chuckle when she didnt get one she looked at castillo we wont know castillo said about the sun rising until tomorrow morning will we svet until then its just likely that it will and the way this works svet is that no one offers an opinion clever or otherwise until i ask for it got it her face colored and her eyes flared angrily but she didnt reply well commander casanova guess whos not going to get laid tonight castillo took a sip of his drink then went on lets start with the congox where did it come from that raises the question did we destroy it all in the attacks on the fish farm or not colin sir i respectfully suggest colonel torine can answer that better than i can leverette said jake castillo asked torine nodded charley you know as well as i do except for nukes there is no such thing as total destruction of anything by high explosive or incendiary saturation bombing the question then becomes how much was not destroyed and i suggest colin can answer that better than i can he a was there and b hes done a lot of damage assessment castillo motioned with his hand toward leverette the fish farm was a collection of concrete block buildings none of them over three stories most of them just one leverette said the few i got into had basements and i saw a halfdozen buried and halfburied steeldoor revetmentslike ammo bunkers lets say the bombs and the incendiaries took out ninetyfive percent of everything jake castillo said torine nodded his agreement leaving five percent he said until we run into a stone wall lets try this scenario castillo said five percent of the congox in barrels survived the bombing lets say thats six barrels two of them got to the states how and by what means tom im sure one of the first things sirinov did after the bombing alex darby interrupted general yakov sirinov who runs the svr for putin barlow nodded and went on what he did was send in a vympel spetsnaz team for damage assessment and to see if anyone was still alive castillo said can we presume a the spetsnaz made it into the fish farm and b while they were there foundmore important took control ofthe six barrels of congox if tom is talking about spetsgruppa v leverette said and looked at barlow barlow nodded he said also known as the vega group of kgb directorate b the russian delta force charley leverette said theyre damned good it is because they are so good that they were selected to provide security for the congo operation barlow said i was surprised that you didnt encounter at least one or two of them uncle remus when you were there leverette met his eyes for a moment quickly changing the subject leverette said making it clear there had been a confrontation with at least one or two spetsnaz special operators and that they had lost so they found the six barrels of congox what did they do with it this is conjecture barlow said based on my knowledge of how sirinovs mind works the spetsnaz were parachuted onto the site from a great height probably from a specially adapted ilyushin il passenger transport on a flight path duly reported to aviation authorities the parachutists would not have opened their canopies until they were quite close to the ground so they would appear only momentarily if at all on radar screens thats what we call halo castillo said highaltitude low opening copyright billy waugh leverette said castillo torine and pegleg lorimer chuckled or smiled or both excuse me barlow said the first guy to do that was billy waugh a friend of ours leverette explained castillo said okay back to the question of now that spetsnaz has six beer barrels full of congox what do they do with it they would have to truck it out barlow said but sinceusing uncle remuss ninetyfive percent destruction factorthere would be no trucks at least not as many as would be needed left at the fish farm i dont know how they could have done that they leave the fish farm area and steal some trucks castillo said and then truck it out but where to any field where a tupolev tua can get in jake torine said and that wouldnt have to be much of a field you know about the tu jake tom asked ive never seen one but oh yeah i know about it torine said i dont castillo said ugly bird torine said can carry about as much as a caribou cruises at about mach point nine helluva range midair refuelable and its stateoftherussianart stealth and it can land and take off from a polo field the story i get is that the agency will pay a hundred twentyfive million for one of them you do know about it barlow said raising his drink in a toast demonstrating he was clearly impressed torine returned the gesture and they both sipped their sazeracs okay picking up the scenario castillo said the spetsnaz load their six barrels of congox onto their stolen trucks and drive it to some dirt runway in the middle of africa and then load it and themselves onto this what was it tupolev tua torine furnished which then takes off and flies at mach point nine to where to russia castillo pursued no they dont want congox in russia they know how dangerous it is svetlana said they remember chernobyl thats why the fish farm was in the congo could this airplane make it across the atlantic sure with an enroute refueling it could fly anywhere torine said wheres anywhere cuba mexico distancewise sure barlow said but politically theyd spot it on radar right castillo said charley it has stealth technology torine said and even if it didnt it could fly under the radar so why not cuba tom castillo asked the castro brothers would be too expensive barlow said both in terms of cash and letting them in on the secret more the latter sirinov doesnt like to be obligated to anybody then right into mexico edgar delchamps said getting it across the border into the states would be easy i think we could say getting it across the border was easy castillo said but i have a gut feeling mexico is notwas notthe final stop alex darby then said drop off the congox and enough people to get two barrels of this stuff into the states via mexico then fly the rest of it on to where venezuela delchamps suggested hugo chavez is in love with communism and has yet to be burned by the russians as the castros were burned and god knows fat little hugo is no rocket scientist sirinov could easily have put him in his pocket barlow pointed at delchamps and said youre on it edgar okay then now what leverette said weve located the congox in venezuela what do we do about it we start to proveor disprovethe scenario castillo said first step in that will be when we get from aloysius the intel hes going to get from the dci you dont know thats whos giving him the intel hes promised to send my darling svet said castillo at the last split second kept himself from saying something loving and kindfor example what part of dont offer a goddamn opinion unless i ask for it didnt you understand my precious instead he said who else could it be svetlana replied the value of the intel we get from casey is only as reliable as the source and we dont know its coming from the cia do we so i suggest we take what casey sends us with a grain of salt she got you ace delchamps said listen to your consigliere yeah she did castillo admitted okay sweaty give us your take on the come home all is forgiven letter from cousin vladlen you havent figured that out it is meant to let your government off the hook my darling itll come out that weve returned to russia castillo interrupted what do you mean weve returned to russia you asked me a question let me finish answering it svetlana said maybe i should have said if we return to russia and it comes outand it wouldthen your government couldnt be accused of cruelly and heartlessly sending us home to the prison on lubyanka square your press will get that letter it says all is forgiven your government can then say all they did when they loaded us aboard an aeroflot airplane was help us go home to our loving family score another one for sweaty delchamps said the us government is not going to put you on an aeroflot plane castillo said you better hope ace delchamps said over my dead body castillo said thank you my darling svetlana said i will pray that it doesnt come to that me too tom barlow said may i offer a suggestion charley sure before we get whatever casey is going to send us why dont we all independently try to find fault with our scenario castillo nodded sure good idea and while were all doing that independently come up with a scenario on how to deal with this another good idea castillo said are we going to try to grab this stuff in venezuela lorimer asked what i would like to do is grab that tupolev tua in venezuela torine said everyone was quiet for a long moment then pevsner said ill check but i think everybodys rooms should be ready by now shall we meet here in say an hour and have another of leverettes cocktails and then dinner one claudios shell super service station state highways and centreville maryland february there was nothing unusual about the gmc yukon xl that turned off state highway into the gas station indeed there were two near twinsthree if one wished to count a chevrolet suburbanalready at the pump islands the driver of the arriving yukon pulled up beside one of the pumps got out and fed the pump a credit card other doors opened and three menall dressed in plaid woolen jacketsgot out and walked quickly toward the mens room suggesting to a casual witness that it had been a long time between pit stops a chrysler grand caravan turned off state highway and drove right up to the mens room door the vans sliding door opened and three menalso in plaid woolen jackets and also apparently feeling the urgent call of naturehurried into the restroom a minute or so later the first of the men came out of the restroom and got into either the yukon or the grand caravan in two minutes everybody was out of the mens room the caravan backed up and stopped at a pump the yukon driver walked quickly to the mens room by the time he came out the driver of the caravan had topped off his tank and returned to the wheel by the time the yukon driver got behind his wheel the caravan was out of the station ninety seconds later so was the yukon if anyone had been watching it was unlikely that they would have noticed that one of the men who had gone to the restroom from the yukon had gotten into the grand caravan when he came out and that one of the caravan passengers had gone to the yukon when he came out of the mens room the man in the front passenger seat of the grand caravan turned and offered the man who had just gotten in a silver flask what is it they say about beware of russians passing the bottle a franklin lammelle deputy director of the central intelligence agency asked and its a little early for vodka even for me its not vodka frank its remy martin cultural counselor sergei murov of the washington embassy of the russian federation replied in that case sergei i will have a little taste lammelle said and reached for the flask he held it up in a toast and said heres to winston churchill who always began his day with a taste of fine cognac both men were stocky in their midforties fairskinned and wore small rimless spectacles murov had a little more remaining hair than lammelle they could have been cousins murov was the svrs washington rezident lammelle knew this and murov knew that lammelle had known that since the russians had proposed murov to be their embassys cultural counselor ten minutes later the convoy turned onto piney point farm lane a quarter of a mile down the lane tenfoothigh chainlink fences became visible behind the vegetation on both sides of the road on the fencing at fiftyfoot intervals there were signs private property trespassers will be prosecuted finally the caravan came to the first of two chainlink fence gates across the road outside the outer gate there was a black ford sedan with maryland state police lettered on the body two state troopers in twotone brown uniforms sat in the front seats when the caravan came a stop one got out of the passenger door and carefully examined the minivan but made no attempt to do anything else the three suvs parked on either side of the lane the outer gate swung open and a man in a policetype private security guard uniform inside the second gate motioned for the caravan to advance when the van had done so the outer gate closed behind it the security guard came from behind the second gate walked to the caravan and opened the sliding door when he was satisfied that there was no one in the vehicle determined to trespass on whatlike the russian embassy itselfwas legally as much the territory of the russian federation as was the lubyanka square headquarters of the kgb in downtown moscow he signaled for the interior gate to be opened frank lammelle knew a great deal about what was known as the russian dacha on the eastern shore some of what he knew he had known for as long as he had been in the cia back in the bad old days when russia had been the union of soviet socialist republics young frank lammelle of the clandestine service had thought it was ironic that the ambassador of the ussr spent his weekends in a house built by john j raskob almost a caricature of a capitalist raskob had been simultaneously vice president of general motors and e i du pont de nemours and companywhich owned fortythree percent of gmand had ordered the construction of the empire state building in new york city with the mandate to the architect that it be taller than the chrysler building raskobs threefloor brick mansion had not been quite large enough to house him and his thirteen children so he had built another one just about as large for them and his guests who included such people as walter chrysler henry ford and thomas edison the soviet government had bought both houses from raskobs heirs in and later enlarged the estate by swapping land the americans wanted in moscow for land adjacent to the maryland property the russians then further improved the property by importing from finland fourteen small rental houses for the use of embassy employees some of what lammelle knew about the russian dacha on the eastern shore he had learned more recently at fivethirty that morning he had met with j stanley waters the cias deputy director for operations and several of his deputies in the bubble at cia headquarters in langley only the people in the bubbleplus of course dci jack powellknew that lammelle had accepted sergei murovs invitation to go boating in maryland the meeting had been called both to guess the reason murov wanted to talk to lammelleprobably it had something to do with congox but no one was sureand to prepare lammelle for it to that end the latestjust takensatellite photos of the compound were shown photos was probably a misnomer as these were satellite motion pictures the infrared and other sensors showed life in only four of the rental cottages including the two known to house the russians communications center the analysts agreed there was no significant change from the data taken over the past week the nsa at fort meade reported they had been unable to pull anything of interest from the etherthat is any reference to lammelle murov or a meeting between the twoand that the level of traffic between moscow the dacha the embassy in washington and the russian mission to the united nations in new york city was normal nothing had been sent either in a code or by any technical means the russians erroneously believed had not been detected or cracked at fort meade the fbi liaison officer reported that the fbi agents tracking murov had seen nothing out of the ordinary in his behavior and that the fbi agents onsiteone of the two state troopers stationed around the clock at the gate was always an fbi special agenthad similarly seen nothing of special interest lammelle had closed the meeting with a reminder that the visit had to be kept a secret secrecy was important because senator homer johns democrat new hampshire the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who loved to be on tv and despised the cia wouldshould he learn of the meetinglove nothing better than to call dci powell to ask about the meeting then quickly leak the secret to cnn andor c harry whelan jr the syndicated columnist who didnt like the cia either there were three mercedesbenz automobiles lined up in the circular drive before the threestory brick mansion a cls sedanthe pilot carthen an elegant twinturbo v clobviously the ambassadors vehicleand then another cls the chase car the precautions are necessary lammelle thought not to protect the ambassador from the americans but from his fellow russians chechen rebel leader doku umarov would be delighted to sacrifice a halfdozen of his associates if that was the price for taking out the ambassador it looks as if the boss is about to go to work murov said why dont we say hello this is not a coincidence lammelle decided the ambassador probably waited until the gate reported their arrival before he came out of the house obviously he wants me to know that he knows im here and as important to know that he knows murov invited me what a pleasure to see you mr lammelle the ambassador said offering his hand he was a ruddyfaced somewhat chubby fiftyfiveyearold its always a pleasure to see you mr ambassador lammelle said sergei tells me youre going boating the ambassador said thats not exactly true mr ambassador going out on the river in february may be sport for a siberian but for an american its insanity the ambassador laughed what i thought i would do mr ambassador is look through a window in the hunting lodge and watch sergei turn to ice im not a siberian frank i was born and raised in saint petersburg murov said which at the time was called leningrad wasnt it sergei in that case i suggest we both look out the windows of the hunting lodge at the frigid waters the ambassador laughed again and laid his hand on lammelles arm if i have to say this the door here is always open to you thats very gracious of you mr ambassador perhaps if youre still here when i get back we can have a drink the ambassador said and then gestured for his chauffeur to open the door of the mercedes i dont think thats likely but thank you mr ambassador give my best regards to the president and mr powell when you see them please ill be happy to do so mr ambassador and say hi to vladimir vladimirovich putin for me please mr ambassador when you get the chance i thought wed have breakfast in the hunting lodge rather than in the house if thats all right with you frank murov said as they watched the ambassadorial convoy of three luxury cars roll away fine with me sergei lammelle said murov waved him back into the caravan for the short ride to the hunting lodge which was a small outbuilding that had been converted into a party room there was a table that could seat a dozen people a small kitchen was hidden behind a halfwall on which was a mural of two oldtime sailorsone russian and the other americansmiling warmly at each other as they tapped foamtopped beer mugs with one another lammelle thought in the professional judgment of our best counterintelligence people somewhere on that mural and on that ohsocharminglyrustic chandelier with the beer mugs overhead and god only knows where else are skillfully concealed motion picture camera lenses and stateoftherussianart microphones all recording for later analysis every syllable i utter and every movement and facial expression i make and as much as i would love to roll my eyes and grimace for the cameras before giving them the international signal for up yours ivan i cant do that doing so would violate the rules of proper spook deportment and we cant have that unless we play by the rules we would never learn anything from one another murov waved lammelle into one of the two places set at the table and a cooka burly russian manimmediately produced coffee mugs and set a bottle of remy martin and two snifters on the table thats really a little insulting sergei if you thought i was going to oblige you by getting sauced and then run my mouth or it could simply be standard procedure put the booze out the worse that can happen is that the american wont touch it i asked cyril to make eggs benedict murov said that all right with you frank sounds fine lammelle said but looking the gift horse in the teeth can we get on with this i really have to get back to the office just as soon as he lays the eggs benedict before us ill ask cyril to leave us i hardly know where to begin murov said as he finished his breakfast the hell you dont item two on your thoughtfully prepared agendaitem one being put out the remy martinwas to suggest you dont know what youre talking about and simply are going to have to wing it and thus be at my mercy how about this murov went on i think there are certain areas where cooperation between us would be mutually advantageous does that mean sergei that i have something you want and you hope that what youre going to offer me will be enough to convince me i should give it to you murov considered that a moment then shrugged smiled and nodded you can always see right through me frank cant you only when you want me to sergei if you dont want me to i know how to neutralize congox murov said now thats interesting starting with how does he know that were calling it congox i didnt know you had assets in fort detrick now ill have to tell the counterintelligence guy there to slit his wrists i have people all over almost as many as you do frank did your assets tell you that weve already just about figured out how to neutralize congox they told me colonel hamilton has had some preliminary success murov said i dont think theres an svr agent inside detrick what i think we have is some misguided noble soul a treehuggeror a halfdozen of themwho is making hisor theircontribution to world peace and brotherhood among men by feeding anything they think is another proof of our innate evilness to the russians who are no longer godless communists and thus no longer a threat the proof of how good they are now is that when they reburied the tsar and his family in moscow vladimir vladimirovich putin was there on his knees somehow that photograph of that bornagain christian made frontpage news all over the world just for the sake of conversation sergei what have i got that you want colonel dmitri berezovsky and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva since you have assets all over sergei im really surprised you dont know that we dont have either of them and never have had but in a manner of speaking frank if you have someone who has anythinga bottle of remy martin for examplewouldnt it be fair to say you also have that bottle of cognac if youre suggesting i have someone who has your two defectors i dont and i think you know that sergei what about lieutenant colonel carlos castillo doesnt he have berezovsky and alekseeva and since that name has come up he wants colonel castillo too who he sergei who wants colonel castillo too murov smiled but now his eyes were cold frank we never lie to one another murov said true but we obfuscate as well as we know howand were both good at itall the time so far thats been the case sergei lammelle said that being the case youre not going to deny that berezovsky and alekseeva left vienna on castillos airplane are you several people i know have told me that so im prepared to believe it but i dont know it for a fact or that castillo works for you its my turn to ask a question you didnt answer my last question who he that wants castillo murov took a moment to organize his thoughts and then asked how much of the history of the svr do you know frank not nearly as much as i should lammelle said i know that the sluzhba vneshney razvedki used to be the first directorate of the kgb and theres a story going around that the reason its so powerful is because in addition to his other duties to the russian federation vladimir putin runs it you do know how to go for the jugular dont you frank excuse me my question was how much of the history of the svr do you know putin doesnt run it for a moment there i was beginning to think that putin was he who wants castillo too once more frank how much of the history of the svr do you know why dont you tell me sergei what you think i should know about it murov looked at him carefully and pursed his lips as he framed his reply finally he asked would you be surprised to learn that its history goes back beyond the special section of the cheka back beyond the revolution i dont know i never gave that much thought where do you think the cheka came from i know it really became important in when felix dzerzhinsky took it over did you ever hear that dzerzhinsky was an oprichnik i dont know what that is but i have heard that dzerzhinsky had been locked up and nearly starved to death by the bolsheviks until just before he was given the cheka thats what you and i would now call disinformation frank i think it unlikely that he ever spent a day behind bars dzerzhinsky was in fact an oprichnik and i told you i dont know what that means im about to tell you in ivan the terrible moved out of moscow taking with him a thousand households hed selected from the nobility senior military officers merchants and even some serfs then he announced he was abdicating the people left behind were terrified ivan the terrible was really a terrible man but those who would replace him were as bad and before one of them rose to the top there would be chaos where the hell is he going with this history lesson so they begged ivan to reconsider to remain the tsar he told them what that would take the establishment of something a separate state called the oprichnina within russia the oprichnina would be made up of certain districts and cities and the revenue from these places would be used to support ivan and his oprichniki to make the point that it would be unwise to challenge this new idea ivan first had philip the metropolitan of moscowwho had said the oprichnina was unchristianstrangled to death then ivan moved to great novgorod russias secondlargest city where the people had complained about having to support the new statewithinthestate there he killed all the men and male children raped all the women seized all the crops and livestock and leveled every building no one ever questioned the oprichnina again not once in the nextwhatfour hundred fifty giveortake years murov ignored the sarcasm and went on in after tsar nicholas the first put down the decembrist revolution he realized the revolution would have succeeded had it not been for the assistancemore important the intelligenceprovided by trusted elements of the oprichnina so he made them into a separate state within the separate state he called this the third section or sometimes the special section when the bolsheviks mensheviks and finally the communists took over lenin on december formed from the tsars special section what was officially the allrussian extraordinary commission for combating counterrevolution and sabotage but commonly known by its acronym as the cheka he placed an aristocrat named felix dzerzhinsky in charge the tsars secret police became the cheka under an aristocrat named dzerzhinsky lammelle asked incredulously murov nodded dzerzhinskys father had been one of the more important grand dukes under the tsar one of the oprichniki there were no more grand dukes of courseor any nobility but there was the oprichnina and dzerzhinsky was one of them he apparently decided he could best serve russia by serving lenin the family still lives on the estates they had under the tsar thats the point of this history lesson frank to make sure you understand how important the oprichnina remains even today i guess you wouldnt know all these fascinating details if you werent one of them huh sergei lammelle said more than a little sarcastically murov either missed the sarcasm or chose to ignore it my family has been intelligence officers serving the motherland for more than three hundred years murov said with quiet pride we have served in the special section the cheka the ogpu the nkvd the kgb and now the svr and vladimir vladimirovich putin is one of you too i suppose ive answered your question truthfully now answer mine youre not going to deny that colonel castillo works for you are you lieutenant colonel castillo does not now nor has he ever worked for the agency thats the truth sergei but yourehow do i put thisin touch lammelle shook his head no do you know where he is lammelle shook his head again no but if i can find out im going to warn him that putins after him i didnt say that you didnt have to lammelle said are you going to tell me what thats all about why does putin want his head i didnt say president putin is in any way involved in this frank of course you didnt those cameras and microphones also are recording everything you say arent they okay let me rephrase why does he who wants castillo want him and please dont tell me wants isnt shorthand for wants eliminated there are several reasons most of whichprobably all of whichhave occurred to you for one thing colonel castillo has left a great many bodies behind him in his travels around the world do i make my point that accusation would be a good deal more credible sergei if you put names to the bodies lammelle said if you insist murov said i suppose the first was major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia youre not going to deny castillo was involved in that are you as i understand that story that was selfdefense lammelle said whatever the circumstances vincenzo and half a dozen others were shot to death in uruguay by a commando team under colonel castillo there was a confrontation and vincenzo lost sometimes that happens in our line of work sergei the good guys dont always win murov smiled that comment can be interpreted in two ways frank depending on who one thinks are the good guys i suppose it could in any event vincenzos death was an embarrassment to general sirinov who had to explain it to the cubans general who contrary to your beliefs general yakov sirinov is the man in charge of the fsb and the svr you mean he runs them for mr putin president putin has nothing to do with either the fsb or the svr you keep telling me that not because you believe it or expect me to believe it but because the cameras are rolling murov met lammelles eyes for a moment but did not reply directly instead saying podpolkovnik kiril demidov is podpolkovnik demidov somebody else podpolkovnik castillo is supposed to have killed murov smiled and shook his head all right frank lieutenant colonel demidov was a lifelong friend of mine another member of the oprichniki murov nodded more important his family and that of general sirinov were closemore than close distant cousins that sort of thingand even more important than that close to other powerful people like he whose name were not mentioning who wants castillo eliminated murov nodded vienna is not nearly as important a post as it once was but when kiril was named rezident there there were those who said he was too young and did not have the experience he should have but they didnt complain right because that might annoy he whose name we are not mentioning who arranged his appointment murov shrugged in admission well i hate to tell you this sergei but i happen to know that lieutenant colonel castillo was nowhere near vienna when someone strangled your friend and left him in a taxi in front of our embassy were back to my analogy about who controls the brandy bottle murov said and the other bodies had names too lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov for one lammelle said there was a story going around that he was the fsb man for argentina chile and uruguay the story i heard about what happened to him was that he made the mistake of trying to assassinate aleksandr pevsner and then there was lavrenti tarasov and evgeny alekseev whose bodies were found near the airport in buenos aires evgeny was another old friend of mine im sure you know that he was podpolkovnik svetlana alekseevas husband why would you think i would know that because youre the deputy director of the cia murov said coldly do i detect a subtle tone of disapproval in your voice sergei lammelle said how about disappointment i really hoped we could have a serious discussion and resolve our problem as professionals as a professional sergei i find it hard to believe that you thought we could have a serious discussion when what im hearing from you strikes me as nonsense nonsense right now i dont have a clear picture of the longterm implications of congox turning up at fort detrick and on the usmexico border if you wanted to hurt someone with it you would have if you had hurt someone that could have led anywhere right up to a nuclear exchange if you do hurt something that hurts us badly for example killing as many people as the ragheads taking down the world trade center towers killed then the missiles will fly we didnt know whom to nuke after but if something happens involving congox we know just where to go lubyanka square moscow and you damned well know it and what youre suggesting here is that youre willing to risk a nuclear exchange unless we turn over to you three people a colonel and two lieutenant colonels youre right sergei thats not nonsense its not even a clumsy attempt at blackmail what it is is pure bullshit murov looked at him for a moment then reached for the bottle of remy martin cognac he poured two inches of it into one of the snifters and then looked at lammelle why not lammelle said not only are the gloves off but im about to walk out of here murov poured cognac into another snifter then handed it to lammelle they touched glasses mud in your eye murov said up yours sergei lammelle said unpleasantly i used the word disappointed a moment ago frank and i am im disappointed that you dont really understand power and what dont i understand about it in your government your leader your president doesnt really have absolute power there are things he simply cannot do because he wants to in other governmentscuba for example north korea venezuela and one or two othersthe leader can do anything that pleases him anything lammelle felt a chill at the base of his neck russia wouldnt be one of those other countries would it of course not we are a democracy now our president and other officials mustand always dofollow the law and the will of the people lammelle took a healthy swallowhalf of the cognac in the glassand felt the warmth move through his body thats utter bullshit too he said ill tell you whats going to happen now frank murov said youre going to go back to langley and report this conversation to jack powell and he will be as unbelieving as you were this will evolve into anger and then youll go to the president and he will be as unbelieving as you were and jack powell will be and then he will become angry fortunatelyfor all of uspresident clendennen is not nearly as impulsive as his predecessor he will think things over carefully and in the end he will tell you to call me back and say that you will do whatever you can to resolve this problem as you yourself pointed out in the balance the lives of a colonel and two lieutenant colonels arent really worth all that much fuck you sergei ill have the car brought around murov said and reached for a telephone let me call first lammelle said and murov slid the telephone to him lammelle punched in a number from memory its time to pick up the dry cleaning he said a moment later and then hung up he slid the telephone back to murov dont bother to make note of the number he said in ten minutes it will be out of service you didnt have to tell me that frank murov said and then punched in a number and said in russian my guest will be leaving murov walked him to the caravan when lammelle was in the front passenger seat murov motioned for him to roll down the window lammelle found the switch but the window remained up unlock his fucking window murov called nastily in russian lammelle tried the switch again and this time the window went down well lammelle asked frank the problem people like you and me have is that sometimes we have to do things we dont like at all i took no pleasure in what happened between us today there was no feeling of score one for our side lammelle met his eyes but said nothing he found the switch put the window up and then in english said okay lets go two the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february fascinating president joshua ezekiel clendennen said when deputy dci frank lammelle had delivered his report on what had happened that morning in the russian dacha how much are we supposed to believe he turned in his highbacked blue leather judges chair and pointed at secretary of state natalie cohen i think frank can answer that better than i can mr president cohen said he was there ill rephrase madam secretary clendennen said a long way from pleasantly presuming mr lammelle told us the truth and nothing but how much of what this russian told him can we believe make that two questions how much of what the russian told lammelle are we expected to believe and two how much can we believe if she felt insulted it didnt show on her face or in her tone of voice mr president i always like to start with what we do know in this case we know the russians were involved with the biochem laboratory in the congo and since they know we call this substance congox and that some of it was delivered to fort detrick and some left for us to find on the mexican border i suggest that it is safe to presume they have more of it the threat therefore is real natalie we dont know that dci jack powell said for all we know the stuff they sent us may be all they have this whole thing may be a bluff i asked her jack the president said youll get your chance i think mr president cohen said to respond to your questions directly that they expect us to believe everything they told frank and i think we should clendennen grunted then looked at powell okay jack your chance the president said do these bastards have more of this stuff or not off the top of my head mr president i would say they have at least a little more enough of it so they can leave us a couple more samples and thats all they have mr president we leveled and then burned everything in a twentymile radius of the fish farm either we somehow missed this or they had some of it in a laboratory in russia or someplace else my gut tells me theres not much of congox anywhere but we dont know that do we clendennen asked no sir we dont why would putin do something like this clendennen wondered aloud was that a question mr president mark schmidt the director of the fbi asked does that mean you have an answer no sir just that ive been thinking about motive well out with it for one thing we humiliated the russians when we took out the fish farm schmidt said for another castillo and his people my predecessors loose cannon and his merry band of outlaws humiliated the russians the president interrupted sarcastically incredulous yes sir castillo and his people have not only humiliated the russianswhich is to say putinall over europe and south america butaccording to what the russian told frankhas killed a lot of them i think its credible that putin did know some of them personally and wants revenge madam secretary the president asked natalie cohen nodded her agreement with schmidts theory and he could well be reasoning that we really dont want a confrontation when that could be avoided by returning their two defectors we cant give him castillo of course why cant we the president asked jesus christ lammelle exclaimed lets go down that road clendennen said no of course we cant give him colonel castillo or any of his people as much as i might want to but we can go along with that notion let me go on the record here natalie cohen said i will not be part of any agreement which will turn over the two defectors much less colonel castillo or any of his people to the russians duly noted president clendennen said let me finish please i said we can let the russians think were willing to give them all three of them so far as the russians are concerned we werent responsible for their defection castillo flew them out of vienna on his plane mr president powell said and if he hadnt we had a plane waiting at schwechat to do the same thing if they had gotten on a plane sent by the cia mr powell the president said coldly we would have some sort of moral obligation to protect them they didnt castillo was not acting on behalf of the us government when he flew them to south america therefore we have no such moral obligation i dont agree with that at all mr president powell said i dont care mr powell if you agree with it or not im telling you thats the way it is he let that sink in for a moment and then went on madam secretary i want you to call in the argentine ambassador and tell him that it has come to our attention that there are two people in his country illegally what are their names presumably mr president you are referring to dmitri berezovsky and svetlana alekseeva she said for whom interpol has issued warrants alleging the embezzlement of several millions of dollars excuse me mr president mark schmidt said interpol has canceled those warrants at the request of the russian federation three days ago berezovsky and alekseeva are no longer fugitives youre sure the president said yes sir im sure well so much for that idea the president said that would have been easier well have to come up with something else so heres what were going to do lammelle get in touch with your russian and tell him he has a deal am i to tell him the deal includes colonel castillo yes i told you i was not about to turn over an american to those russian bastards but if they think i am so much the better for us yes sir that sonofabitch is lying through his teeth hed happily turn castillo over to the russians or anyone else if it would get him out of this mess the next step is to locate the russians you think theyre in argentina i have no idea where they are mr president dci powell said well i want them found and i want them found quickly do whatever has to be done send as many people down thereor to anywhere else you think they might beand find them run down the people who used to work for castillo see if they know where the russians are and castillo is yes sir this is a nobrainer mr powell if we can get these russian bastards to keep that stuff out of the country and all it costs us is giving them back two traitors thats a price i can live with ive always thought that people who change sides are despicable even if the side they change from is despicable mr president natalie cohen asked im going to pretend i didnt hear you say that madam secretary the president of the united states said three penthouse b the grand cozumel beach amp golf resort cozumel quintana roo mexico february a good deal of conversation and thought had not shot many holes in the scenario of what was probably going on but on the other hand it also hadnt done much to confirm it neither had all the agency intel that casey had furnished the cias analysts also seemed to feel the congox sent to fort detrick and left for the border patrol to find on the mexican border had most probably come from the fish farm in the congo but they had no idea how it had been moved from africa to the united states and apparently had not considered that the tupolev tua might have been involved castillo had called casey and asked him to see if his source could find anything about tupolevs moving anywhere and again asked him to send any intel no matter how unimportant or unrelated it might seem the only thing to do was wait for something to happen everybody was frustrated but everybody also knew that sitting around with your finger in your earor other body orificewaiting for something to happen was what intelligence gathering was really all about so everybody but castillo svetlana pevsner and tom barlow had gone deepsea fishing on a fortytwofoot bertram owned by the grand cozumel beach amp golf resort castillo had seen everybodys departure as an opportunity but tom barlow had come to the penthouse and asked if he wanted to play chess before he could take advantage of the opportunity castillo no more wanted to play chess than he wanted to lunch on raw iguana but the alternative was saying no thanks as im planning to spend the morning increasing my carnal knowledge of your sister when the door chime went off they were playing chess and svetlanain a bikiniwas taking in the sun on a chaise longue by the pool with max lying beside her the latter went to answer the door aleksandr pevsner janos and another man were standing there before pevsner knew what was happening max put his paws on pevsners shoulders and licked his face look at that tom barlow called happily max loves you alek and then he recognized the man with pevsner and exclaimed ill be damned the man with pevsner was plump ruddyfaced and in his early fifties his shortsleeved blue shirt had wings and epaulets with the four stripes of a captain on it well my god look whos all grown up and wearing lipstick and not much else the man said and spread his arms uncle nicolai svetlana cried happily and ran into his arms castillo watched then thought well that explains that another relative but what is uncle nicolai doing here tom barlow was now waiting patiently for his chance to exchange hugs with uncle nicolai when it came the two embraced and enthusiastically pounded each others back aleksandr said you were in johannesburg svetlana said i spend a good deal of time there uncle nicolai said he looked at charley and offered his hand in fluent just slightly accented english he said im nicolai tarasov charley castillo who has captured svetlanas heart alek told me so what brings you to cozumel by the sea uncle nicolai castillo asked tarasov avoided the question alek and i go back to our days with aeroflot tarasov said when i tried without much success to teach him to fly ilyushin ils castillo felt his temper turn on why dont you want to tell me what brings you to cozumel by the sea uncle nicolai he repeated then added somehow i dont think this is a happy coincidence and that youre all going to sit around eating fried chicken and telling stories about grandma why are you going out of your way to be unpleasant charley svetlana asked castillo switched to russian because cousin alekhe pointed at pevsnercant seem to get it through his thick russian skull that since im running this operation its not nice to spring surprises on me like uncle nicolai just happening to drop in from johannesburg to say hi you speak russian very well you sound like youre from saint petersburg tarasov said aleksandr told me you did just after he told me to be very very careful not to underestimate you i still dont have an answer castillo said just for the record charley tom barlow said im as surprised to see nicolai as you are goodbye uncle nicolai castillo said motioning toward the door the next time youre in town make sure you call now wait just a minute charley pevsner flared why do i have to spend all my time making peace between you two svetlana asked maybe because alek the terrible has trouble understanding i dont recognize him as the tsar charley said both barlow and tarasov chuckled pevsner gave them both an icy glare alek the terrible tarasov quoted i like that i got in touch with nicolai to see what he could contribute to our scenario pevsner said after a moment and can he castillo challenged and then looked at tarasov can you im trying to run down something i heard about an incident that took place at the el obeid airport in sudan tarasov said that may take a little time and i think theres at least a good chance that if a tupolev tua was used in this operation i know where they landed in mexico what took place in sudan they found a lot of dead people at the burneddown airport tarasov said from what little i know so far it sounds like something that one of yakov sirinovs vega groups would do no witnesses and the airport in mexico laguna el guaje tarasov said in coahuila state laguna el guaje mean anything to you charley pevsner asked castillo shook his head its sort of the mexican version of groom dry lake test facility nicolai explained far fewer aircraft and different secrets castillo knew that groom lake on the vast nellis air force base near las vegas was rumored to be wherein area thereonthe cia was holding little green men from mars or elsewhere in the universe he hadnt seen any of them when he had been to area but he had seen some very interesting experimental aircraft i have never heard of either what you just said or area castillo said but if i had and talked to you about it id have to kill you nicolai laughed out loud and punched castillos shoulder i like him alek he said dont speak too soon pevsner said why do you think that might be the place castillo said because we use it from time to time tarasov said and what do you use it for from time to time moving cocaine around how do we find out a man who you should know is going to meet us there pevsner said and how do we get there fly tarasov said it should take us about an hour two of the three pilots who can fly our gulfstream are deepsea fishing it may take some time to get them back here and when they get here theyll probably be half in the bag they didnt expect to go flying and i really dont like flying that airplane by myself but you could if you had to right i hear youre quite a pilot he paused then added schwechatezeiza via africa is a long way to go in a gthree unless you really know how to fly a gulfstream flattery will get you nowhere uncle nicolai goodbye uncle nicolai castillo said tarasov seemed unaffected by castillos belligerence actually colonel castillo he said i have an airplane i just picked up a cessna citation mustang at the factory in wichita thats what i was doing when aleksandr called getting checked out in it and now youre going to fly it to johannesburg right castillo said sarcastically i hope you know how to swim the specs i saw on the mustang gave it a range of about eleven hundred nautical miles and the last time i looked the atlantic ocean was a lot wider than that hes not going to fly it to south africa pevsner said the casino here bought the mustang to replace the lear it uses to pick up good casino customers and bring them to cozumel the last i heard cessna was happy not only to deliver a plane like that to the customer but also to have whoever delivered it teach the new owner or his pilot how to fly it and since you own the casino please forgive me for wondering what almost certainly illegal services this new mustang will render to you when its not hauling highrollers around whats behind all this bullshit you know but you dont like to think about it fuck it get it out in the open alek listen to me carefully castillo said whatever we do to solve our current problem we are not going to get involved with the drug trade or anybody in it friend charley you listen carefully to me pevsner said icily furious i am not and never have been involved with the drug trade castillo considered that a moment and then realized ill be a sonofabitch if i dont believe him why because i want to why do i keep waiting for you to say but castillo asked aleksandr i think you should answer charleys question and fully svetlana said pevsner glared at her svet took the words from my mouth alek tom barlow said not only is he entitled to an answer but the last thing we need right now is charley questioning your motives im not used to sharing the details of my business operations with anybody pevsner said i told you i am not and never have been involved with the drug trade that should be enough i keep waiting for the rest of the sentence beginning with but castillo said colonel castillo tarasov said let me try to explain once a monthsometimes three weeks sometimes fivecertain businessmenmost often mexican venezuelan and colombian but sometimes from other placeswant to visit switzerland or liechtenstein or moscow without this coming to anyones attention we pick them up at laguna el guaje its always two of them each has two suitcases one of them full of currency usually american dollars but sometimes euros or other hard currency but only cash no drugs how do you know that because we open them to count the cash which determines the fare which is five percent of the cash we bring them here where they travel to el tepual international airport at puerto montt chile aboard a peruaire aircraft returning from a foodstuff delivery here at el tepual they transfer to an aircraft depending on their final destinationof either cape town air cargo or air bulgaria both of which the tsar here owns castillo asked the tsar or one of the more charming of the tsars grand dukes tarasov said to finish the aircraft is carrying a cargo of that magnificent chilean seafood and often argentinean beef to feed the affluent hungry of europe getting the picture any questions oh yeah castillo said and the first one that comes to mind is are all you russian expatriate businessmen really related arent you worried that youll corrupt the gene pool tarasov laughed im starting to understand you colonel castillo you say things designed to startle or outrage people who are startled or outraged tend to say things they hadnt planned to say alek was right to warn me not to go with my first impression of you whichby your design of courseis intended to make people prone to underestimate you got me all figured out have you uncle nicolai tell me about the gene pool were not really related except very distantly our families have been close however for many years do i see the oprichnina raising its ugly head castillo asked why ugly tarasov said did what you may have heard of the oprichnina make you think that he turned to pevsner how much did you tell the colonel about the separate state alek what i didnt tell him svetlana did pevsner said and what svet didnt tell him nicolai i did tom barlow said and then turned to castillo charley when alek first left russia and bought the first antonov an and went into business the man who flew it out of russia was an exaeroflot pilot and air force polkovnik named nicolai tarasov and we have been in business together since then tarasov said does this satisfy your curiosity colonel castillo or have you other questions this could all be bullshit which i am in my naivete swallowing whole on the other hand my gut tells me its not just one castillo said are you going to check me out in the mustang on our way back and forth to area it would be my pleasure tarasov said can i go like this sweaty asked twirling in her bikini castillo saw in pevsners eyes that he was considering discouraging her notion and wondered why and then that pevsner had decided she couldor even shouldgo and wondered about that too you can go as naked as a jaybird as far as im concerned pevsner said but you probably would be more comfortable in a dress your dog thinks hes going tarasov said pointing at max who was sitting on his haunches by the door and again castillo saw something in pevsners eyes this time that max going was a good idea he wondered about that too max goes just about everywhere with charley nicolai pevsner said there were two yukons with darkened windows waiting for them in the basement garage of the luxury hotel and two men standing by each not making much of an effort to conceal the mini uzis under their loose flowered shirts castillo wondered if all the security was routine and then considered for the first time that if the russians were successful in getting svetlana and tom back to russia they would probablyalmost certainly indeed pevsner had said sobe coming after pevsner and if thats true they will also be coming after tarasov ill have to keep that in mind and continue to wonder when alek will decide that if throwing meand possibly even tom and sweatyunder the bus is the price of protecting his family and his businesses then so be it am i paranoid to consider the possibility that thats what may be happening right now when we get to this mysterious airfield is there going to be a team of general yakov sirinovs spetsnaz special operators waiting for us to load us on the tupolev tua and fly us off to mother russia that would solve everyones problems no thats your imagination running away with you scenario two the crew of the bertram terminates all the fishermen and tosses their suitably weighted bodies overboard to feed the fishes that would get rid of everybody else who knows too much about the affairs of aleksandr pevsner and nobody knowsexcept pevsner and his private army of exspetsnaz special operatorsthat any of us have ever been near sunny cozumel by the sea come to think of it there was no real reason we couldnt have passed through customs under our own names or the names on the new passports we got in argentina you are being paranoid and you know it on the other hand you have had paranoid theories before and on more than several occasions acting on them has saved your ass the yukon convoy drove directly to the airport and then through a gate which opened for them as they approached then onto the tarmac and up beside a cessna citation mustang there were two pickup trucks parked close to the airplane an airconditioning unit was mounted in the back of one with a footwide flexible tube feeding cold air through the door the other held a ground power generator as soon as the doors of the yukons opened the airconditioning hose was pulled out of the door max knew his role in the departure procedure he trotted up to the nose gear sniffed then raised his right rear leg does he do that often tarasov asked religiously castillo said you want to do the walkaround with me tarasov said castillo would have done the walkaround without an invitationno pilot trusts any other pilot to do properly what has to be donebut he intuited tarasovs invitation was more than courtesy and even more that it wasnt something a pilot about to give instruction would do max go with sweaty castillo ordered in hungarian and the dog went to the stair door and politely waited for svetlana to board then leapt aboard himself pushing pevsner aside as he did castillos suspicion deepened when tarasov said why dont you come with us dmitri and was confirmed when they came to the rear end of the port engine which could not be seen from inside the airplane colonel tarasov asked are you armed no castillo admitted should i be dmitri tom barlow shook his head tarasov squatted beside his jeppesen case opened it and came out with two pistols castillo was surprised to see that both were the officers modela cutdown versionof the colt a acp semiautomatic pistol they held five cartridgesrather than seven roundsin the magazines in their shortened grips the slides and barrels had been similarly shortened they had once been made from standard pistols by gunsmiths at the frankford arsenal for issue only to general officers but later became commercially available thats my weapon of choice castillo thought i wonder where uncle nicolai got them and if by coincidence or because hes aware that theyre about the best people shooter around im sure you know how to use one of these tarasov said to charley and handed him one of the pistols then he turned to barlow dmitri barlow took the extended pistol said they work like the regular ones right and proceeded to quickly check the pistol to see if there was a round in the chamber there was he ejected the magazine then worked the action which ejected the round in the chamber he caught it in the air said lester showed me how to do that put it back in the magazine shoved the magazine back in the pistol and worked the action it was now ready to fire am i going to need this nicolai he asked i hope not but alek said to give them to you and he always has his reasons try not to let svetlana know you have them why not castillo challenged i think alek wants the people were going to talk to think shes somebodys girlfriend why castillo pursued if somebody brings his girlfriend to a meeting with people like these it means either that hes not afraid of them or stupid and these people know that whatever he is alek is not stupid neither is sweaty if shes going to play a role she should know whats expected of her you want to tell alek that tarasov asked my immediate reaction to that is an angry hell yes ill tell him but since i tend to get in trouble when i react angrily let me think about it in the meantime why dont we get aboard tarasov asked the small cabin of the jet was crowded castillo and tarasov had to step carefully around max who was sprawled in the aisle to get to the cockpit would you like to follow me through tarasov asked when castillo slipped into the copilots seat you fly ill watch castillo said good youre cautious follow me through startup and have a look at the panel its a very nice little airplane the latest garmin the g he said pointing at the panel when were ready to go you can have it it handles beautifully and will not try to get away from you which cannot be said of the gthree and were going gps castillo asked nodding at the garmins screen very few navigation aids where were going the pilot said smiling and well be flying i hope under the radar tarasov threw the master buss switch and then reached for the engine start control starting number one he announced and then turned to charley get on the radio and tell cancun area control that were going on a fourhour vfr lowlevel sightseeing ride with a fuel stop at santa elena one aboard cessna mustang ns north latitude west longitude february youre not going to find an approach chart in there nicolai tarasov said to castillo who had just gone into tarasovs jeppesen case searching for exactly that i dont even see a runway on these castillo replied how do we know where to land and how do we know there wont be boulders on it presuming theres no water in the lakeand it usually is dryyou can land practically anywhere your instructor pilot will show you physical features used to locate the best place to land and if an ips not handy thats the idea colonel if you dont know where to land you shouldnt try there wont be any boulders but youre liable to find large tree trunks in your way your ip will show where there are no tree trunks meaning there are people here who remove them tarasov nodded then said may i call you charley or carlos i wish you wouldcarlosas i aint a colonel no more once a colonel carlos always a colonel tarasov said put it into a shallow descent on this course go into a lowlevel pass to make sure there really are no dead trees on the runway and then you can land what about the wind when they hear us coming a wind sock will miraculously appear next to the runway i gather there is no laguna el guaje tower thats the idea carlos since there is no tower curious ears cannot overhear it clearing aircraft in and out of here the physical feature tarasov pointed out was a sprawling ranch house and some outlying buildings on the high terrain next to the lake immediately down the hill you should seethere it isthe wind sock tarasov said usually there are negligible crosswinds just land into the wind remembering of course to lower the wheels first i have a tendency to forget that castillo said as he began a onehundredeightydegree turn wheels coming down tarasov said a moment later and down and locked and a moment after that castillo greased the cessna mustang onto the lake bed not too bad a landing for a beginner tarasov said after another say twenty hours of my masterful instruction i might be prepared to sign you off to fly this aircraft castillo gave him the finger tarasov smiled at him what now castillo asked taxi back toward the house youll see sort of a hangar what castillo saw just over a minute later was sort of a hangar dug into the side of the hill lining the dry lake bottom it was invisible from the air and to him as he landed but now an enormous dirtcolored tarpaulin had been raised out of the way revealing a cavelike area in which castillo could see a learjet a burly man in khakis walked out of the opening holding wands and motioning him to taxi inside an uzi hung around his shoulder and when castillo turned the nose he could see three other men similarly dressed and armed they dont look very friendly castillo said theyre not tarasov said castillo turned the mustang nose out and shut down the engines now what he asked now it gets interesting tarasov said as he unfastened his harness charley followed suit and when he stood up saw that max and pevsner were standing by the door maybe you better tell max to stay onboard pevsner said those people are liable to shoot first and ask questions later the best defense is usually a good offense maybe i should get off first castillo said and reached for the opening mechanism when the stair door dropped in place he jumped to the ground the men with the uzis moved toward the airplane good afternoon castillo said in spanish my dog is about to get off the airplane if anyone looks like hes even thinking about pointing a weapon at him ill stick it up his ass before i kill him the men stopped moving toward him he snapped his fingers and max jumped easily to the ground castillo pointed to the nose gear max headed for it he would have anyway but the men with the uzis didnt know that and they were as much impressed with the obedient welltrained dog as they were with his size okay alek castillo called youre next this is your show janos came down the doorstairs followed by pevsner then tom barlow and finally svetlana the mens faces made it clear that she surprised them even more than the dog el senor garciaromero is presumably here pevsner asked more than a little arrogantly there was a faint flash from castillos memory bank i know that name hector garciaromero headed a law firm which maintained offices in mexico city san antonio and new york among its clients was lopez fruit and vegetables mexico a wholly owned subsidiary of castillo agriculture inc of san antonio texas whose honorary chairman of the board was dona alicia castillo whose president and chief executive officer was fernando lopez charleys cousin and whose officers included carlos castillo this cant be my tio hector what the hell would he be doing here at a thugguarded secret airfield that might as well have a sign reading welcome to drug cartel international airport and there are probably two hundred ninetyseven thousand and six mexicans named garciaromero si senor in the house then what are we standing around here for excuse me senor but we must check to see if you are armed thats none of your business pevsner snapped now get on the telephone and tell senor garciaromero that i am here with a pistol in each hand one of the men considered that briefly then turned and walked quickly deeper into the cave the remaining three men eyed everyone except for svetlana warily in svetlanas case the adjective was lustfully in under a minute the man who had walked away came back if you will be good enough to come with me senor in the back of the cave incongruously modern and hightech against the gray stone into which it had been cut was a stainlesssteelframed elevator door carefully staying out of maxs way the men ushered them onto the elevator but did not get on it the door closed and just as pevsner reached for a button with an up arrow on it the elevator began to rise a haydn string quartet came over speakers the door opened four people were waiting for them three of them much better dressed than the guards in the cave but just as obviously guards the fourth was a superbly tailored portly silverhaired man in his sixties i will be goddamned please accept my apologies for the misunderstanding down there hector garciaromero said and then he took a closer look at castillo holy mother of god is that really you carlitos its been a long time tio hector castillo said what did you call him svetlana asked carlitos hector garciaromero said it means little carlos thats sweet svetlana said i have known him since he was this tall garciaromero said holding his hand flat a few inches below the level of his shoulder you were what carlitos eleven twelve castillo said i saw dona alicia ten days ago in san antonio garciaromero said she said you were in hungary with billy kocian i was and now were both in the vip lounge of drug cartel international airport in the middle of the mexican desert what the hell are you doing here tio hector i had no idea you knew senor pevsner garciaromero said likewise castillo said and ive been wondering what sort of business you do together carlitoss grandfather was one of my dearest friends garciaromero said if he had one flaw it was his habit of asking indelicate questions carlitos has apparently inherited that along with his more desirable character traits why dont you answer the indelicate question castillo asked why dont we all go sit in the great room have a little snack and a little something to drink and then we can sort this out garciaromero said and waved them into the house an elaborate buffet had been laid out on an enormous low table silver coolers held wine champagne and beer bottles and there was an array of whisky bottles at the end of the table max went immediately to examine them and with great delicacy helped himself to a wafer topped with salami and cheese and then helped himself to another i thought dona alicia was exaggerating when she told me how big your dog is garciaromero said and what did dona alicia tell you about me svetlana asked that carlitos had brought a girl to the doublebarc ranch she really hoped would be the one with whom he would finally settle down and start a family thats the plan svetlana said and thats about all she told me garciaromero said hector pevsner said svetlana and i are cousins and this gentleman garciaromero asked indicating tom barlow dmitri and svetlana are brother and sister pevsner said and carlitos fits in how we think of him as family pevsner said he is family svetlana corrected him and i have always thought of carlitos and his cousin fernando as my nephews garciaromero said so in a manner of speaking pevsner said were all family above the sound of the violins softly playing ave maria castillo said i keep hearing a soft voice asking charley who the hell do these two think theyre fooling excuse me garciaromero asked you heard me hector castillo said how come i never saw you surrounded by thugs with uzis before theyre necessary security carlos garciaromero said to protect you from whom youre a mexican a mexicanamerican you know theres a criminal element here im a texican and you goddamned well know the difference between a mexicanamerican and a texican garciaromero did not answer i saw surveillance cameras in that cave downstairs castillo said what i want from you now tio hector right now is to see the tapes of the tupolev tua when it was here he could see in garciaromeros eyes that that had struck a chord the what garciaromero asked the russian airplane castillo qualified and please dont tell me you dont know what im talking about ive had about all the bullshit i can take garciaromero looked at castillo and then at pevsner you know about that is that why youre here why dont you show us the tapes hector pevsner replied i was going to show them to you anyway garciaromero said mommy i was only trying to see how many cookies were in the jar thats the only reason i had my hand in it i wasnt going to eat any of them and thats the truth lets go hector castillo said where are they in the security office garciaromero said its on the upper floor he gestured toward the center of the building and then led everybody out of the great room into the foyer and then up a wide tiled stairway to an upper floor the security room was at the end of a corridor to the right garciaromero didnt even try to work the handle instead pulling down the cover of a keypad and then punching in a code and even then he didnt try to open the door i wondered what kind of an airplane that was he said id never seen one before there was the sound of a bolt being drawn and then the door was opened by a man in khakis he had a pistol in a shoulder holster we want to see the tapes of that strange airplane garciaromero said shall i bring them to the great room don hector no castillo said well look at them here the man looked at castillo in surprise and then at garciaromero for guidance garciaromero courteously waved svetlana ahead of him through the door and then motioned for the others to follow inside there was a desk and chairs and a cot and another door that was opened only after another punching of a keypadthis one mounted in sight beside the doorand the sliding of another bolt inside the interior room there was a wall holding more than a dozen monitors a man sat at a table watching them there was room and chairs for two more people at the table castillo looked at the monitors he was not surprised to see that it was a firstclass installation which covered just about everything in and around the house the airfield and the cave and he was pleased to see a battery of recorders that meant that whatever had happened when the tupolev tua had been at drug cartel international had been recorded and would be available we want to see whatever the cameras picked up when that strange airplane was here garciaromero said so i suspect we had better start with the arrival of the cars from the russian embassy the man who had opened the door for them went to a rack quickly found what he was looking for and inserted it into a slot of the desk it will be on monitor fourteen don hector he said what cars from the russian embassy pevsner demanded a split second before castillo had finished opening his mouth to ask the same thing there were three garciaromero said two ford sport he stopped and pointed to monitor fourteen the monitor showed two enormous black ford expeditions and a mercedes sedan being waved past khakiclad guards at a gate across a dirt road aleksandr i was told that the aircraft would be on the ground here just long enough for the people from the russian embassy to take the two crates from it garciaromero said hector anything you have to tell anybody about this you tell me castillo said alek is not the tsar of this operation i am pevsners face whitened but he didnt say anything are you going to tell me what this operation is all about carlos garciaromero asked probably not who told you about the tupolev coming and the involvement of the russian embassy garciaromero hesitated before replying then said valentin borzakovsky whos he garciaromero hesitated again hes a businessman who lives in venezuela what kind of a businessman fsb or drug cartel i dont think i like the question or your tone carlos garciaromero said probably both carlos nicolai tarasov answered castillo hes one of the people we often fly out of here and then back in here with suitcases full of money tarasov nodded smiled and added on the way out he always comes back emptyhanded monitor fourteen now showed the cave the expeditions and the mercedes were driving into it then it showed the sky the camera obviously looking for an aircraft or cameras plural castillo thought as the view which had shown some terrain changed to one showing only the sky how do they know to expect it he looked around the control room and found a radar screen i wouldnt want to make an instrument landing using that but thats not what its intended for thats just to let the authorities of drug cartel international know that an aircraft has entered their area there was a blip on the radar screen i wonder how far away that airplane is how far and how high monitor fourteen showed a dot in the sky that quickly grew into an airplane castillo looked at tarasov to see if he had seen it tarasov nodded castillo went back to the screen the airplane had now grown an enormous vertical stabilizer and engines above the fuselage castillo looked at tarasov again tarasov nodded and mouthed tua thats one weirdlooking airplane if i had ever seen oneeven a picture of onei would have remembered monitor fourteen showed the weirdlooking airplane coming in low for a landing id never seen an airplane like that before garciaromero said well the russians certainly didnt show it off at the paris air show thats a special operations special that it exists cant be kept a secret but the fewer people who know anything else about it the better the landing roll looked normal until all of a sudden it decelerated at an amazing rate until it was almost at a complete stop and then turned he must have spotted the cave proof of that came when monitor fourteen showed the tua coming into the cave and the camouflaged tarpaulin being lowered into place once the plane was inside the rear door of the mercedes opened and a man in a business suit walked toward the tua the monitor pulled in on his face well hello pavel tom barlow said who is he castillo asked pavel koslov svetlana said the mexico city rezident and that means this is important and probably that theres somebody notorious on the plane barlow said monitor fourteen showed the ramp at the rear of the tuas fuselage lowering before it quite touched the ground two men in rather tight hooded black coveralls their faces masked and carrying kalashnikov rifles trotted down it and looked the area over one of them made a come on gesture and two more similarly dressed and armed men came down the ramp we call people who dress up like that ninjas castillo said what do you call them sweaty spetsnaz another man in the black coveralls but not wearing a mask came down the ramp the camera moved in for a closeup and a very good afternoon to you general barlow said i trust the general had a pleasant flight thats general yakov vladimirovich sirinov svetlana said which tells us that vladimir vladimirovich putin is indeed behind all this behind all what garciaromero asked may i ask right now tio hector castillo began and then stopped when another man this one in a business suit came down the ramp and again the camera moved in for a closeup thats valentin borzakovsky garciaromero said why do i think he didnt just come from venezuela castillo asked a fuel stop at friendly jose marti international airport tarasov said id bet ciego de avila castillo said they wouldnt want the tua to be seen at jose marti youre right thats more likely tarasov said where whatsisname borasomething borzakovsky valentin borzakovsky svetlana furnished a touch of impatience or resignation in her voice where he boarded fsb airlines flight onestophere at drug cartel internationalservice to maiquetia international airport in the peoples democratic republic of venezuela tarasov and barlow chuckled barlow then said i dont think hugo chavez would want the tua i rephrase i dont think general sirinov would wantas much as hugo would want it to put it on displaythe tua to be seen at maiquetia maybe the santo domingo air base more likely la orchila svetlana said thats on an island and its a pretty decent air base the runways will take a and chavez has moved all the civilians off the island which would add to the security barlow agreed if you russians have no ambitions in the caribbean how come you know so much about all the military airfields charley my darling alek is right svetlana said you really have a sophomoric sense of humor my precious ill bet you dont even know what a sophomore is the term probably has its roots my precious darling in one of the late sophist dialogues of plato but what it means is tricky and superficially plausible so therefore a sophomore is someone who is tricky and superficial with emphasis on superficial does the shoe fit not at all my precious beloved darling a sophomore is a secondyear student at a college or university you really should try to be sure of your facts before you open your adorable mouth to challenge your intellectual betters svetlana made a gesture to charley involving the use of the index fingers on both hands held in upward position tom barlow laughed out loud you will pay for that charley he said look whats coming down the ramp tarasov said monitor fourteen showed a tracked frontloader rolling off the tuas ramp two blue plastic vessels looking not unlike beer kegs were suspended from its arms it moved to the rear of one of the expeditions and under the watchful eyes of general sirinov and one of the ninjas was carefully loaded into it then it moved to the second expedition where the process was repeated general sirinov held a brief conversation with the man who had helped him supervise the loading of the barrels pavel koslov the mexico city rezident and valentin borzakovsky the venezuelan businessman then they all shook hands except for the ninja who first saluted and then shook hands koslov got back in his mercedes and immediately drove off borzakovsky and the ninja and two others got in one of the expeditions and four of the ninjas in the other the expeditions drove off monitor fourteen showed first the mercedes and then a minute later the expeditions moving up a road in the hill surrounding the dry lake theyre wearing their ninja suits castillo thought out loud theres probably clothing for them to wear over their tactical suits in the trucks barlow said the monitor now switched back and forth between the moving vehicles and what was happening in the cave general sirinov himself drove the frontloader back aboard the tua the ramp was raised the monitor followed sirinov and two men castillo guessed were the pilots to the stainlesssteel elevator and showed them getting in nothing much happened after this garciaromero said those three menyou said you knew one of them how far is thatare wefrom the mexus border castillo asked ignoring the question at the closest point seventyfive eighty miles garciaromero said and mcallenmatamoros that area whats that five hundred miles probably garciaromero said the ninjas came back right and the venezuelan businessman garciaromero nodded they returned about four hours after what you just saw so that means they got the barrels across the border near here castillo said how would they do that tio hector garciaromero hesitated for a moment but finally said there are people who make a profession of getting people across the border people and drugs right yes carlos sometimes drugs they call them coyotes what svetlana asked a coyote is something like a cross between a wolf and a german shepherd sweetheart castillo said with all of the bad and none of the good characteristics of both they attack calves lambs dogs cats rabbits and sometimes children their numbers are increasing and there doesnt seem to be much that can be done to control them in other words theyre sort of a canine drug cartel you really dont like people involved with drugs do you baby she asked softly moving right along hector castillo said would it be reasonable to assume that somewhere near the border some of these coyotes had been prepositioned either by the venezuelan businessman or the guy from the russian embassy to move those two barrels into the united states if they wanted to move those barrels into the united states that would be the way to do it do we know that they wanted to do that whats in those barrels anyway we know they moved those barrels into the states what were trying to figure out is how and where and you dont want to know whats in those barrels tio hector believe me they somehow got one of the barrels to miami sweetheart svetlana suggested and shipped it from miami to colonel hamilton and later left the other where your border guards would find it yeah probably to make us think the first barrel was smuggled into miami from cuba garciaromero began i had no idea anything like this let me see if i have this right castillo interrupted him borzakovsky came to you wait let me back up youre in charge of drug cartel international right tio hector i cant believe im hearing from you what youre suggesting carlos garciaromero said i am not in the drug business this airfield is not a transshipment point for drugs when you accuse hector of that friend charley pevsner said in russian youre accusing me and thats something i cannot accept even from you okay then tell me what goes on here castillo said nicolai has already told you pevsner said there are people who need large amounts of currency shipped from place to place and im supposed to believe those large amounts of money are not connected with the drug business come on alek you are really trying my patience friend charley but since you are being so intentionally dense let me spell it out for you i dont speak russian garciaromero interrupted pevsner ignored him and continued in russian what i do as you well know is move things around like drugs castillo asked sarcastically not knowingly pevsner said not that i think drugs are any more reprehensible a cargo than say the shipments of arms i have moved on many occasions and for years for your central intelligence agency but rather because when inevitably one of my shipments of arms for example is intercepted by the authorities all that happens is that i lose the shipment and pay a fine if the authorities intercept a cargo of drugs my airplanes are confiscated and the authorities try very hard to make sure everyone goes to jail that said and again as you very well know in recent years i have severed my connection with the cia and for that matter with the svr when that involves the shipment of arms just about everything that nicolai and i now transport around the world is perfectly legal moving currency and the bearers of that currency from one place to another may not be perfectly legal but if there is a violation it is of customs and immigration laws people caught by the authorities attempting to illegally enter a country are simply returned to where they came from if customs officers discover they have in their luggage undeclared large amounts of currency the usual punishment is the seizure of half of it in that connection an amateur attempt by hugo chavez several months ago to send about a million dollars to the president of argentina an amateur attempt castillo interrupted sarcastically without it coming to the attention of the authorities failed because the courier used a chartered private jeta gulfstream like yours if memory serves people using chartered jets attract the attention of the authorities the argentine customs people carefully searched the couriers bags as he passed through customs found the money refused his offer of a little gift and confiscated half of the money the courier had dinner that night with the president you getting the picture i really would like to know what you two are saying garciaromero said if moving money around is so easy why do they need you to do it castillo asked discretion carlos nicolai tarasov said the people we move money for are as muchperhaps moreconcerned that no one finds out they are moving money as they are for the money itself they dont want to be embarrassed as the president of argentina and hugo chavez were when their courier was caught if one of their couriers is caught aboard one of our aircraftwhich very rarely happenswe say we didnt know he had the money with him and the courier tells them he was carrying the money for someone not remotely connected with the people hes actually carrying it for half of the moneypresuming the customs officials cannot be bribed and they usually canis confiscated the owners of the currency write the loss off as the cost of doing business and thats the end of it youre telling me the only thing drug cartel international is used for is moving money castillo said thats exactly what im trying to tell you pevsner said and thats why i was so surprised when nicolai said he thought it likely the tua had come here i had trouble believing your uncle hector could be that stupid pevsner turned to garciaromero who of course had recognized his name being said and switched to spanish i just told carlos that i had trouble believing you could be so stupid he said now lets turn to that start at the beginning hector and tell us how this fiasco came to happen garciaromero looked very uncomfortable lets hear it hector pevsner said coldly valentin borzakovsky came to me and said the russian embassy had a problem garciaromero began he said they had reason to believe the cia had infiltrated aeromexpress cargo what wont those evil yankees be up to next pevsner asked which the russians use as their airfreight forwarder borzakovsky said the russian embassy really needed to get something from moscow the americans couldnt know about garciaromero finished do you think those blue beer kegs they unloaded from the tua might have contained nuclear weapons castillo said jokingly but what the hell am i joking about they contained congox which is just about as bad im not as naive as you seem to think carlos garciaromero said there were radiation detectors waiting for that shipment and if the needles on your radiometers had gone off the scale and you had said anything you and everybody who works for you in the cave would be dead and the nukes would be in mexico go on hector pevsner said he said there would be very little risk pavel koslov of the russian embassywho of course has diplomatic immunitywould come here to meet the airplane immediately load this cargo into russian embassy trucks and be gone within minutes how much else do you think your friend valentin borzakovsky this venezuelan businessman good friend of yours told koslov about what goes on here pevsner asked angrily garciaromero didnt respond and instead said he offered me one hundred thousand euros for the service you risked everything we have here for a hundred thousand euros pevsner asked incredulously do you know how much it costs to maintain this facility aleksandr to the penny pevsner snapped and the last time i looked the income made the cost look like a minor operating expense and you risked losing all that income for a hundred thousand euros my god you are a fool i also thought it might be useful to have the russian embassy owe us a favor garciaromero said did it occur to you tio hector castillo asked that once you did this hundredthousandeuro favor for the russians that you had jumped into their pocket and they would be back asking for other favors and this time there would be no euros just the threat to expose you for what you did or that once this happened we couldnt take the risk of ever using this place again nicolai tarasov put in before garciaromero could open his mouth is that all the bad news hector pevsner asked or is there more garciaromero hesitated a long moment before replying there is more he said i dont know whether you think it will be bad news or not lets have it my men have heard gossip that the coyotesthere were seven or eight of themwere found shot to death near the american border dead men tell no tales castillo said you might want to write that down alek pevsners response was not what castilloor for that matter any of the othersexpected have you any further questions for your uncle hector friend charley he asked matteroffactly ive got a couple including one i expected you to ask castillo said which is how much does your friend borzakovsky know about nicolai and aleks operations here nothing garciaromero said immediately i swear your name didnt come up aleksandr i dont believe you uncle hector and i dont think pevsner will either did you commit suicide when you made this deal with the russians anything else you want to know charley pevsner asked how long is it going to take you to put all those surveillance tapes in a box for me youre going to do what with them pevsner asked slide themor copies of themunder the door of that big building in langley virginia pevsner considered that for a long moment but made no comment and after youve done that hector pevsner said what youre going to do is shut this place down i want all the surveillance tapes that charley doesnt take destroyed i want the system removed i want everybody who has worked here to find employment as far from here as possible if this place should suddenly attract the attention of the mexican government i want them to find nothing that will tie meor for that matter youto it in any way you think that maybe we should burn the house down garciaromero said sarcastically pevsner considered that a moment and then said you use bottled gas here right bottled gas explodes can you handle that or should i have janos show you how thats done youre serious yes im serious you have a problem with that careful tio hector the wrong answer will get you in more trouble than you can imagine how much time do i have garciaromero asked i have several men i trust completely i could leave them here to arrange the accident while you go where i was about to say mexico city but i think san antonio would be even better better yet new york pevsner considered that new york would be better he said twentyfour hours from now nicolai will fly over this place when he looks down he will expect to see the burnedpossibly still burningruins of this building thats what he will see garciaromero said congratulations uncle hector you have just said the magic words and your bulletridden corpse will not be found in the burned ruins of your house in the desert two penthouse b the grand cozumel beach amp golf resort cozumel quintana roo mexico february the fishermen had apparently come home from the sea shortly before the hunters had come home from the hills around drug cartel international when castillo and the others walked into the penthouse the tiled area around the swimming pool was being converted by the resort staffunder the direction of uncle remusinto a highinthesky grilled seafood outdoor restaurant a long table had been set up and flames were still rising from the justignited lava coals in two barbecue grills an enormous insulated box seemed to be stuffed with king mackerel and another cooler with bottles of dos equis beer max immediately went to sniff at the fish everybody but colin leverette and lester bradley who stood at the grills was sitting around the pool on chaise longues under umbrellas most of them holding bottles of the dos equis i knew our noble leader would return when he smelled food uncle remus said and hed tell us where hes been right charley ill even show you movies of where ive been castillo replied and looked at lester lester can we send tapes from surveillance cameras to casey or look at them on the tv both bradley thought about that a moment nodded and said yes sir that shouldnt be a problem have at it castillo said ill take over the grill svetlana said somehow i suspect cooking is not among uncle remuss many skills and i dont want that fish ruined im hungry you are in the presence madam of one of new orleanss most skilled piscatorial chefs uncle remus said be humble they have parrillas in mother russia do they sweaty delchamps said as he pushed himself off his chaise lounge we have everything in mother russia edgar svetlana said im surprised you dont know that i think everybody should have a look at these tapes before we send them to casey castillo said logical conclusion let sweaty get the grills going he gave in to the temptation and added innocently aleksandr can help her surprising him pevsner went immediately to the grills and politely asked for and was given lesters chef hat he put it on then tested the heat coming from the nolongerflaming lava briquettes by holding his hand palm down over them another seven minutes i would estimate he said while youre showing the tapes i will ensure the fish have been properly filleted and then he smiled at castillo and added never underestimate people friend charley you might want to write that down twogun get your laptop castillo ordered as lester hooked up cables from caseys radio to the television im going to offer a running commentary as the tapes run identifying the players et cetera well then edit the tape and the commentary to make sure the cia cant identify or locate the airfield or all the players two questions yung replied this is going to the cia and why shouldnt they locate the airport pevsner has a connection with the airport i dont want them to start linking things make that three questions yung said how are you getting it to the cia through casey id rather slip it under the door but i havent figured out how to do that lester edgar delchamps said can you send these tapes to the house in alexandria yes sir no problem and can you get me a number in arlington virginia without it coming to the attention of those nosy people at fort meade according to dr casey all they will hear at fort meade is what sounds like static on the line and i can make it sound as if the call was made from anywhere who do you want to receive the tapes ace delchamps asked either the dci or frank lammelle if i have one of the dinosaurs call on madam darby and pick up the tape and commentary and then he slips that under the door addressed to lammelle and you also send it to casey he will probably send it to the dci hes close to those people right then wed be sure both the dci and lammelle got it then thats what well do castillo agreed lets see the tapes lester delchamps said so our scenario wasnt far off the mark edgar delchamps said when the tapes had been played they did use the tupolev tua to move that stuff the question then is from where did they move it from a warehouse full of the stuff in mother russia or sweaty says they wouldnt have congox in russia castillo said too dangerous that would tie in with what tarasov heard happened at that airportel obeidin sudan delchamps said okay they picked it up in africa and flew it here nonstop they probably stopped in cuba castillo said probably at ciego de avila they wouldnt want the tua to be seen at jose marti and from ciego de avila to this drylake airfield alex darby asked castillo nodded and then where back to cuba darby asked venezuela castillo said tom says the price for getting the cubans to do more than fuel the tua would be too high chavez on the other hand is not half so smart as the brothers castro sweaty thinks its probably at la orchila that island air base what is that another proof you cant judge a book by its cover delchamps asked what the hell does that mean castillo asked you never heard ace that the true test of anothers intelligence is how much hein this case sheagrees with you i think your girlfriends right on the money hidden inside that gorgeous body is an unquestionable genius you may get to eat after all svetlana called from the grill and speaking of that can we start to cook absolutely three the lobby bar the alvear palace hotel avenida alvear buenos aires argentina february ambassador charles m montvale had liked the alvear plaza hotel from the moment he walked in the door he had liked it even better when following a bellman to a very nice suite he had walked past the lobby bar an oasis of polished wood and brass a vast array of liquor bottles whitejacketed barmen and a remarkable number of attractive womenat least three of whom were astonishingly beautiful tell you what truman he said to ellsworth as their elevator rose silently why dont we have a quick shower and then go down to that bar for a little taste god knows its been a tough day say thirty minutes splendid idea truman ellsworth had replied ill see you there in thirty minutes ellsworths eye had also fallen upon the astonishingly beautiful women in the bar neither had intentions of enticing one of the beautiful women to their suites there to break the vow both had taken to keep only to the women who had marched down the aisle with them so many years ago but it never hurt just to look both of them would have agreed if god hadnt wanted men to look at women he would have made the female of the species flatchested and given them green teeth and lizardlike skin but unexpected things did happen from time to time and they were after all human ambassador charles m montvale had just finished saying its been an awful day and i think im entitled to another little taste when i ronald spears appeared at the entrance to the lobby bar montvale was not pleased to see him he had really been looking forward to his second drink the ceremony that went with the delivering of a johnnie walker black on the rocks in the lobby bar of the alvear was something he had immediately decided that the watering holes of the nations capital and his various clubs would do well to emulate first the bartender laid a tray before his customer it held a bottle of johnnie walker black label scotch whisky a largerthantobeexpected squat glass a bowl of ice a silver pitcher of water silver tongs and what at first montvale had thought was a tea strainer but then he had seen that it had no holes it was sort of a shot glass with wings first the bartender lifted an ice cubenot something spit out of an ice maker but a real ice cube about an inch squarewith his tongs and dropped it into the glass then he picked up another and wordlessly asked if his customer wanted a second ice cube montvale had stopped this process at three ice cubes using a gesture he had learned playing blackjack the bartender laid the tea strainershot glass on the whisky glass next he picked up the bottle of whisky and with great elan filled the shot to overflowing and then kept pouring and then he tipped the wings of the shot glass slowly emptying the contents into the glass over the ice cubes finally with a silver gadget he stirred the ice cubes gently around in the glass montvale impatiently waved i ronald spears over to the table mr ambassador there are two telephone calls for you at the embassy why didnt you transfer them here montvale snapped even as he did so he knew what the answer was going to be and was mr ambassador theyre on a secure line montvale looked around first for the bartender to cancel the order for the drink he would now not get to drink and to sign the bill and then for the secret service agents who were drinking coke and tonic water elsewhere in the bar the communications officer told them he had two calls one from supervisory special agent mcguire and the other from john powell the director of the central intelligence agency get mcguire on here first montvale said as he picked up the secure telephone i have ambassador montvale on the line the line is secure good evening sir what did you find out tom none of the people in whom you were interested were in the house in alexandria sir but mrs darby told me she believes mr darby is in ushuaia where i understand its the southernmost city in argentina what is she doing pulling your leg what the hell is he supposed to be doing there i understand from hershe seemed rather angry sirthat hes in the company of a young argentine woman you take my meaning sir you mean hes down there with some floozy montvale asked incredulously thats what mrs darby implied sir and you believe her all i can say sir is thats what she told me she seemed quite upset about it youre keeping that house under surveillance right tom there will be three agents on it twentyfourseven sir well keep that up and keep me informed yes sir thanks tom i have ambassador montvale on the line mr powell the line is secure hey jack whats up a good deal the russians have been heard from sergei murovthe rezidentinvited frank lammelle over to their dacha to go fishing in the middle of the winter and when he got there told them what they want they will give us all the congox they have with an implied promise they wont find any more in exchange they want the two defectors and charley castillo they say why frank had the impression this came right from putin frank said murov told him or implied that not only has putins ego been bruised but some of the people castillo and his merry band have been whacking around the world were friendsmaybe even relativesof his and you believe this frank does more importantly president clendennen does which means what that as soon as we find those two russians castillo snatched from our station chief in vienna we put them on the next aeroflot to moscow did frank tell murov we dont have the two russians he did murov didnt believe him anyway thats moot my orders are to find the russians so that we can turn them over clendennens going to stand still for that blackmail ill say it again charles my orders are to find the russians so that we can turn them over and castillo hes going to turn him over too i didnt hear that because you didnt ask it but a moment ago i should have said that my orders are to find the russians and lieutenant colonel castillo retired and do what with castillo when we find him the president did not share his thoughts on that with me mr ambassador jesus christ yeah so how you doing have you found castillo no but i learned that alex darbys in ushuaiathats at the southern tip of south americawith some young floozy darbys doing what im afraid the source is reliable have you talked to him i found that out about five minutes ago that might be a good place to stash those russians that thought occurred to me about ten seconds ago there will be six officersthe most i could scare up on short notice meeting the criteria of reliable and availableon whatever american airlines flight there is today from dallas to buenos aires one most likely landing in argentina in the wee hours of tomorrow morning what the hell is that all about the president ordered me to send however many men it took to locate and detain the russians shortly theyre on their way there if they should find them and thats a big if what are they going to do kidnap them the argentines wont stand for that no country would this line is terrible i dont think you heard me when i said the president ordered me to send however many men it took to locate and detain the russians jesus christ have you found roscoe j danton more important have you learned a why hes looking for castillo and b whether hes found him im going to see him tomorrow after i see the ambassador i dont know what im going to tell him about these people youre sending down here youll think of something thats why they pay you the big bucks charles fuck you montvale said and then said break it down truman ellsworth mizz sylvia grunblatt i ronald spears one of his secret service agents and a middleaged man he did not recognize were waiting for him in the hall outside the communications cubicle ambassador montvale the man said im robert lowe when montvale didnt immediately reply lowe added from mexico city and you were ordered down here what a week ago you should have been here the next day where the hell have you been in one of those hotels on the white sandy beaches of cancun or cozumel saying a tearful goodbye to your twentyyearold tootsie im really glad to see you lowe montvale said we have a situation here that requires someone of your experience and i might add of your reputation im here to serve sir i just got off the horn with the dci montvale said he tells me there will be six very good officers of the clandestine service on the next american airlines flight from dallas to help deal with the problem which is i cant get into that here he turned to sylvia grunblatt nothing personal mizz grunblatt but im afraid you dont have the needtoknow mr montvale in ambassador silvios absence i am acting for him she lost her diplomatic cool at that moment and added that makes me as im sure you know the senior officer of the united states in argentina jesus now the goddamned press agent is going to give me trouble what you say may well be true mizz grunblatt but i have only your word for it on the other hand i have beenand mr ellsworth has beensent down here by the president of the united states personally and until the president tells me otherwise im not going to breach security do we understand one another i think well let ambassador silvio decide whos right grunblatt said im looking forward to that montvale said what i need from you now mizz grunblatt is a vehicle to pick up these agency people in the morning cant help you she said for one thing i told you there are no free vehicles the ambassador needed everything in the garage and now that i think about it inasmuch as i presume these six spooks are traveling as tourists rather than government employeesmuch less accredited diplomatic personneli couldnt order the use of government vehicles if i wanted to ill look forward to seeing you in the morning when i call on the ambassador miss grunblatt montvale said where are you staying mr lowe sylvia grunblatt answered for him im going to put him in the apartment recently vacated by the darbys you can move in there tomorrow montvale said we need to talk ill put you up in the alvear plaza with us lets go gentlemen the manager on duty at the alvear was the epitome of courtesy and regret but there wasnt an available room of any type in the house he could however remove the kingsize bed in either mr montvales suite or mr ellworths and replace it with two single beds put them in mr ellsworths suite montvale ordered and turned to ellsworth its only for one night truman an otherwise marvelous dinner in the alvear palaces la bourgogne restaurant was tainted midway by the appearance of the manager on duty he was profusely sorry to report that the single beds he had planned to put in mr ellsworths accommodation had already been put into service he had found another kingsize bed but regrettably there was not room for it in mr ellsworths room would mr montvale possibly consider having it placed in his room its only for one night charles truman ellsworth said dripping with compassion after dinner i ronald spears was dismissed with orders to find decent accommodations for the men who would arrive in the morning he was ordered to meet their plane install them in wherever he had found for them to stay and then bring them to the alvear montvale ellsworth and lowe then went to the lobby bar for an afterdinner drink it was crowded with people of good cheer but not one of the patrons of either sex would ever see sixtyor maybe sixtyfiveagain they then all went to montvales suite where after the hotel staff had very carefullyand thus very slowlyinstalled the extra kingsize bed montvale explained the situation to the new cia station chief buenos aires so what i would suggest you do bob is send two of the guys coming in to ushuaia taking spears with them maybe he can learn something from good officers i still have trouble accepting that alex darby is catting around down there with a hooker maybe shes not a hooker bob it could be a midlife crisis and hes in love it could also beunlikely but possiblethat hes sitting on these two russians for castillo down there it sounds like something colonel castillo would think up anyway i want two good men down therewith i ronald spearsas soon as they can get there and i want that town really searched got it yes sir and the other ones i think should nose around the embassy see if they can get anything from the dea people the fbi people the secret service people someone has to know something about where to find castillo and these russians yes sir as soon as they get here tomorrow ill brief them on what we have and what we want them to do montvale and lowe went to bed in their adjoining kingsize beds shortly thereafter lowe almost immediately went to sleep and began to snore one penthouse b the grand cozumel beach amp golf resort cozumel quintana roo mexico february castillo was standing at the railing of the patio taking an occasional pull at the neck of a dos equis bottle and somewhat inhospitably wishing that the fisheaters would get the hell out of the penthousewhich would leave him alone with sweatywhen edgar delchamps joined him got a minute ace delchamps asked always castillo said delchamps pointed to a far corner of the patio surrounding the swimming pool as they started walking toward it castillo saw that alex darby and dick miller were also headed in that direction and he knew that he had fucked up somehow and was about to learn how the moment edgar delchamps began the chat by saying we know that even though you have a lot on your mind you probably have thought about this but castillo interrupted i recognize that tone of voice so ill cut to the chase delchamps said we just got word from one of the dinosaurs that the tapes and the narrative are in that building at langley in a position where frank lammelle cant help but find them when he goes to work in the morning that was quick castillo said genuinely surprised real dinosaurs move much more quickly than the ones you saw in the jurassic park movies ace you might want to write that down if you say so and when lammelle and company finish authenticating the tapes someone is going to say hey you know what ill bet this came from charley castillo what was i supposed to do not send it what you were supposed to dowhat we were all supposed to dowas fall off the face of the earth and never be seen again same question what were we supposed to do once we came up with this keep it to ourselves delchamps didnt respond directly he looked between darby and miller then back at castillo and went on and even if lammelle or one of his guys doesnt attach you to the tapes casey is going to send the tapes to the dci himself and casey is going to say something like you can rely on this i got it from castillo so the president will know you didnt fall off the face of the earth as ordered and you dont think hell be happy i didnt according to casey they dont have a clue about whats going on with the congox all im guilty of is lending a helping hand you really have no idea how much the agencyeverybody in the quote unquote intelligence communityhated the office of organizational analysis and in particular lieutenant colonel c g castillo do you and how overcome with bureaucratic joy they were when the president cut your throat and told you to disappear taking ooa and all its wicked members with you i did have some small inkling that i wouldnt have won any popularity contests castillo said actually edgar i thought about that when i sent the tapes i would have preferred they would have come from an unknown source but there were two things wrong with that starting with i dont think it would have been possible because of caseys connection with somebodyprobably but not certainly the dciat the agency but say i had managed to convincingly send them from mr unknown source i dont trust unknown sources and i dont think lammelle would have either so let him know the tapes came from me i didnt expect a letter from lammelleor jack powelllike the one sweaty and tom got come home all is forgiven we love you let me try this on you if our late presidentwho was a really good guy and for whom you did everything he asked you to including coming up with the fish farmwas willing to cut your throat to cover his ass what do you think joshua ezekiel clendennen who is the master not only of covering his own ass but also of throwing people who have done him a service under the bus so he can take the credit will be willing to do to you for example turning tom and your girlfriendand maybe youover to the russians for one thing where the hell did you get that delchamps and darby exchanged glances then edgar said thats the scenario alex and i have come up with for whats behind this whole congox operation if they wanted to hurt us with that stuff they would have they havent hurt us just let us know they can why they want something what do they want they want tom and sweaty back clendennen gives them to the russians they give clendennen the congox the problem is done if he also gives them you that solves that problem castillo didnt respond for a moment then looked at darby thats the way i see it charley darby said what supports that scenario nothing concrete yet ace except the thing that ive developedthat alex and i have developedin our long service as spooks a feeling in the gut that just wont go away you talk to either tom or sweaty about this castillo asked softly both delchamps and darby shook their heads youve got a solution castillo asked ive got a suggestion that may not be a solution but its all i have all we have charley darby said castillo gestured for delchamps to tell him disperse delchamps said fall off the face of the earth castillo looked thoughtful for a moment then gestured again for delchamps to continue if clendennen isnt already looking for useven though my gut tells me that he ishell really start looking when lammelle shows that tape to him theyll probably start in argentina we know roscoe j danton is down there looking for you darby interjected so they likely do too delchamps went on and when they dont find youusdown there theyll look elsewhere and inevitably find us all gathered here getting sunburned and eating broiled fish in a penthouse im sure theres already a satellite picture of the gulfstream sitting here in somebodys database darby interjected again cut to the chase castillo said darby flies to washington where he immediately goes to a bank and asks for a mortgage to buy the house in alexandria and then starts looking for a job suitable for his talents with one of those hireaspook companies blackwater for example britton returns to philadelphia where sandra goes back to the classroom and jack starts trying to get back in the police department pegleg goes back to vegas where casey has already given him a job he looked at dick miller then went on dick jake and sparkman go to panama city panama where they immediately put the gulfstream up for sale start looking for a better airplane and go into the privatejetsforhire business twogun goes to montevideo and opens a financial managementread moneylaunderingbusiness getting the picture darby added the gulfstream has sixmaybe sevenof caseys latest radios in the baggage compartment wed all be in contact what happens to lester castillo asked he stays hereor around herewith you sweaty tom and uncle remus you own a farm here in old mehheeco right and you i go to budapest where i will find employment with billy kocian darby put in everybody could be back hereor be anywhere elsein twentyfour hours when you decide what we have to do about the congox and how to keep sweaty and tom from being loaded on an aeroflot flight to mother russia and pevsner he disappears once again into the wilds of argentina castillo exhaled audibly apparently you have given this some thought there we were floating around on the ocean catching our supper and giving this a lot of thought delchamps said when castillo didnt immediately reply delchamps added your call ace but i think wed all be more efficient if we didnt have members of the clandestine service breathing down our necks or trying to put handcuffs on us but if you everybodys willing to go along delchamps nodded they would have joined this little chat he said but uncle remus said that you get really antsy when you feel outnumbered when do you plan to leave castillo asked first thing in the morning delchamps said i wonder what pevsners going to think about this castillo said well he probably wont like it when he learns he has just sold his new flythehighrollersaround airplane to the lcbf corporation but the bottom line there ace is you dont ask your russian pal anything you tell him the way it is two the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february good morning mr president and madam secretary john powell the director of the central intelligence agency said as he walked into the oval office this had better be important jack president clendennen replied i am supposed to take off for chicago in fifteen minutes and natalie has a lunch in new york with a gaggle of un morons i believe it is important mr president the dci replied and all i have to do is slip this in the machine with a dvd disc in his hand powell walked toward a large flatscreen television monitor mounted on a wheeled table let him do that clendennen said indicating a secret service agent i know he wont screw up the tv yes sir powell said and handed the disc to the secret service agent before it starts to play mr president id like to say if i may that we believe this disc to be authentic that is the surveillance tapes from which we made this are authentic and that what you will see when it plays is authentic and has not been altered or changed in any way im delighted to hear that jack clendennen said play your movie what kind of an airplane is that thats a tupolev tua mr president i dont think ive ever seen one before natalie cohen said few people have its a russian special operations aircraft magnificent airplane its practically invisible to radar can fly nonstopwith aerial refueling of courseanywhere in the world at mach zero point nine and land on a football field we are offering a hundred twentyfive million for one you better hope senator johns doesnt hear about that the president said a hundred twentyfive million are the russians that far ahead of us in this area yes sir we have nothing like it the air force really wants to take a close look at the tua and in a manner of speaking sir the russians have been ahead of us before they beat us into space of course and before that igor sikorskywho fled the communist revolution to come hereis generally recognized as the man who made rotarywing flight practical and exactly where is this example of russian aeronautical genius landing jack in a dry lake in mexico sir specifically laguna el guaje in coahuila state how do you know that our analysts worked with the angle of sun mr president powell said and with the date and time on the surveillance tapes at the time shown the angle of the sun would be like that on the tapes at only laguna el guaje im impressed frank i really am what im wondering is where you got the tapes powell did not respond directly and instead said the man walking toward the tupolev sir is with a ninetyninepointninepercent certainty pavel koslov the fsb rezident in mexico city we computercompared the image on the surveillance tapes with images in our database ill be damned those men sir coming down the ramp of the tupolev are almost certainly russian spetsnazrussian special forces and that man sir is general yakov vladimirovich sirinov we made that identification ninetyninepointninepercent certain by comparing this image with images of him in our database sirinov runs the fsb for vladimir putin mr president what are those barrels clendennen asked what we believe sir with an eighty to eightyfive degree of certainty is that those barrels are the ones sent to colonel hamilton at fort detrick the scenario is that they were taken across the border near the dry lake that the first was then moved to miami and from there fedexed to colonel hamilton and the second left for the border patrol to find near mcallen natalie cohen said if you can compare pictures of people on a computer jack and say theyre just about a perfect match why cant you do the same thing with a couple of what look like blue beer barrels powell said according to stan waters who the president asked j stanley waters the deputy director for operations mr president he supervised the analysis of these tapes hes an old analysis type and what did he tell you there are more details on a human being that can be compared to another image of that person mr president an object like these blue beer barrels is more difficult they look like every other barrel are these the same barrels yes or no with an eighty to eightyfive percent degree of certainty mr president we believe they are president clendennen snorted where did you get these tapes jack natalie cohen asked and immediately when she saw the look on his face regretted having asked she had guessed the source i think we can safely proceed on the assumption that these are the barrels of congox now at fort detrick mr president powell said answer natalies question jack the president said they were in a manner of speaking slipped under our door mr president addressed to ddci lammelle tell me what that means clendennen said sir parties unknown delivered them to my outer office yesterday in other words you dont know where these came from no sir i dont know where they came from mr president it doesnt matter does it the secretary of state began we have them and they have been determined to be genuine we now can send frank lammelle back to sergei murov maybe god slipped them under your door jack the president cut her off or little green men from mars or maybe as incredible as it might sound lieutenant colonel castillo might even be responsible isnt that true mr president since i dont know where these tapes came from anything is possible you were both here i seem to recall when i made it as plain as i knew how that i didnt want my predecessors loose cannon or anyone associated with colonel castillo retired connected in any way with our congox problem is that right yes sir powell said i was here mr president the secretary of state said where is castillo the president asked i have no idea mr president powell said nor do i cohen said what about ambassador montvale my director of national intelligence has anyone heard from him i spoke with the ambassador last night mr president hes in buenos aires as is truman ellsworth at your orders sir and has he found castillo and delivered my orders to him that he is not to get involved in any way with congox no sir did montvale have anything at all to say he believes he knows where mr darby is sir who is darby until he was recruited for ooa mr president he was the cia station chief in buenos aires he retired when ooa was disbanded and hes in argentina ambassador montvale has information suggesting that mr darby may be in ushuaia where the hell is that its the southernmost city in south america sir whats he doing there the president asked and then before powell could reply went on is usah whatever you said a place where castillo could hide the defectors that has occurred to ambassador montvale and myself sir and what have you done about it either of you i sent six firstclass officers of the clandestine service down there mr president to assist the new station chief and of course ambassador montvale they should be in argentina this morning im sure that as soon as they get there ambassador montvale will send at least two of them to ushuaia clendennen nodded but i must tell you mr president that ambassador montvale told me he has also developed intelligence that suggests that mr darbys presence in ushuaia has nothing to do with castillo or the russians what the hell else would he be doing in some town on the southern tip of south america he may be there with an argentine national a young woman not his wife if you take my meaning mr president where the hell did montvale get that from mrs darby sir shes here in the states ill be a sonofabitch may i speak mr president the secretary of state said the president made an impatient gesture giving her permission to do so mr president i respectfully suggest that this whole business could be put behind us by sending either dci powell orprobably preferablyddci lammelle back to sergei murov with this tape and this time frank delivers the ultimatum turn over whatever congox you have give us a written statement that you neither have control of nor have knowledge of any more of this substance or well call an emergency session of the united nations and play this tape for the world the president didnt respond for a moment then he asked more or less courteously are you through madam secretary yes for the moment the female is really the deadlier of the species isnt it the president asked rhetorically natalie do you know what would happen while were calling the russian bluff wed be right back where we were when my impulsive predecessor sent the bombers to take out the fish farm at the edge of a nuclear exchange with respect mr president i dont think so cohen said what you think doesnt really matter does it natalie im the president with respect mr president i associate myself with the position of the secretary of state powell said the president ignored him now whats going to happen is that nothing will be done with these tapes until i say so the president said what i intend to do is find those russians and put them on a plane to moscow once we have done that well evaluate the russian reaction and go from there and since the way to find the russians is to find colonel castillo that is the priority when i get back from chicago this afternoonsomewhere around three i would guessi want you both back here plus the secretary of defense and the director of the fbi the secretary of defense is in india mr president cohen said i was about to say madam secretary then his deputy but when i think about it when i think about who that is i dont want to do that have general naylor here and if naylor is in timbuktu or someplace get word to him to return immediately when i walk back in this office this afternoon i want to see naylor or you holding the generals estimated time of arrival in your hand madam secretary this meeting is concluded thank you for coming the president said and then he walked out of the oval office without shaking hands with either powell or cohen three aboard cessna mustang ns bahias de huatulco international airport near pochutla mexico february huatulco mustang double zero double nine sugar castillo called in spanish will you close out my vfr flight plan from cancun please we just decided to stop for lunch double zero double nine are you on the ground no im on final to a dirt strip next to a marvelous restaurant on route near bajos de chila i know the place report when on the ground have a nice lunch castillo passed over the coastline and made a slow sweeping descent over the pacific ocean although there was a marvelous restaurant near bajos de chila he had no intention of landing on the dirt strip behind it when he had dropped almost to the surface of the seaand had thus he hoped dropped off the huatulco radarhe touched his throat microphone again huatulco double zero double nine on the ground at one seven past the hour double zero double nine huatulco closing you out as of tenseventeen thank you two minutes later having spotted the pier he was looking for he picked up enough altitude to pass over a small hill on the coastline at the peak of the climb he spotted the landing strip he was looking for dropped the nose made a straightin approach and greased the landing feeling more than a little smug he pressed the cabin speaker button welcome to grapefruit international airport please remain in your seats with your chastity belts fastened until we reach the terminal we hope you have enjoyed your flight and the next time youre running from the cia that you will choose high roller airlines again you are insane his copilot said but she was smiling then she gestured as he turned the mustang around out the windows at rows of grapefruit trees lining the runway as far as the eye could see thats all grapefruit thats all grapefruit he taxied about halfway back down the runway and then turned the nose toward the closed door of a hangar and then shut the engines down carlitos svetlana said her voice tinged with concern when he looked at her she pointed out the window three very large very swarthy men each bearing a shotgun had come around the side of the hangar and were approaching the airplane castillo waved cheerfully at them and after a moment as they recognized him they smiled and waved back i better get off first castillo said otherwise max will probably get shot by people ive known since i was twelve he unstrapped himself quickly rose from his seat stepped into the cabin and began to open the stair door i trust the colonel is aware there are some armed possibly unfriendly indigenous personnel out there uncle remus asked the stair door opened and castillo quickly went down it max leapt from the airplane showed the men his teeth and headed for the nose wheel the larger of the men tossed his shotgun to one of the others spread his arms and wrapped them around castillo dona alicia will be so happy carlos he said shes here i should have considered that possibility but its too late now fernando brought her down yesterday dona alicia said it was freezing in san antonio he said and then added quietly i dont know about the dog but i like your lady friend sweaty say hello to pablo castillo said we grew up together the others are manuel and juan when all the introductions had been made pablo said carlos why dont you take one of the suburbans and go up to the house just as soon as we push the plane inside well bring your luggage theres two cardboard boxes in the back castillo said and then indicated with his hands the size bring one of them please it was a tenminute drive from the airstrip to the house down a gravel road that led between the apparently endless grapefruit trees and over two more ridge lines no one was on the verandah of the sprawling redtileroofed building to greet them which castillo considered surprising castillo got from behind the wheel of the suburban waved for the others to follow him walked across the verandah pushed open the door and bellowed abuela your favorite grandson is here you can send the fat and ugly one back to the village the door to the living room opened and randolph richardson iii walked into the foyer and said good afternoon sir im very glad to see you then he spotted svetlana and you too maam castillos heart jumped into his throat he was literally struck dumb and knew that all that would come out of his mouth if he tried to speak would be a croak svetlana walked quickly to the boy are you kissing old russian women this week randy she went to the boy put her arms around him and kissed his cheek he stiffened and seemed uncomfortable but didnt try to free himself what svetlana asked i kiss you and you dont kiss me after a moment he raised his head and gave her a quick peck on the cheek castillo found his voice what you have to understand randy he said as he walked to the boy is that youre surrounded by strange people who hug and kiss each other svetlana freed the boy who then extended his hand to castillo pay attention castillo said we shake hands with people we dont like we hug and kiss people we like he put his arms around the boy sometimes if were related to them castillo said we even have to hug and kiss ugly fat people like the one in the door fernando manuel lopez was now in the doorway to the foyer and so was maria lopez who did not like carlos guillermo castillo very much in the first place and whose facial expression showed she really disliked his characterization of her husband as fat and ugly castillo kissed randys cheek and hugged him the boy hugged back and then gave him the same sort of peck on the cheek hed given svetlana castillos heart jumped dont blow this by pushing it he let the boy go sorry it didnt work fernando castillo said what didnt work gringo the plastic surgery youre even uglier than before jesus christ gringo fernando said shaking his head then he embraced castillo dont blaspheme fernando dona alicia castillo said as she came through the door and dont call carlos gringo fernando and castillo finished for her in chorus the boy laughed castillo embraced his grandmother you could have let us know you were coming she said and then she spotted svetlana and went quickly to her and kissed her im so glad to see you my dear dona alicia said then she moved to barlow uncle remus and lester and kissed each of them every one seemed delighted to see everyone else except mrs maria lopez and now there was someone else in the foyer how are you general castillo said as he advanced on major general harold f wilson usa retired with his hand extended that didnt work either general wilson wrapped his arms around charley and hugged him pay attention randy castillo said i thought i heard a jet flying a little low over here general wilson said that was you a cessna mustang castillo said great little airplane am i going to get to fly it randy asked i flew the lear here from san antonio i mean really flew it took it off navigated crosscountry and landed it castillo knew the boy was telling the truth when he saw the look on marias face clearly she regarded fourteenyearold boys flying as copilot of anything more complicated than a tandem bicycle as one more proof of the insanity of the family into which she had made the mistake of marrying i think we can arrange that castillo said but only if you promise to forget everything tio fernando has taught you about flying now you stop the both of you dona alicia said speaking of tios castillo began excuse me dear dona alicia asked its very important that tio hector garciaromero does not know that any of us are here or that weve been in touch in any way whats that all about hes our lawyer for gods sake fernando said hes also in bed castillo stopped and looked at randy i know randy said little pitchers have big ears this is where im told to go play with my puppy right you do have a mouth dont you castillo asked i wonder where he got that from el senor boca grande fernando said no randy castillo said im not going to tell you to go play with your puppy where is he anyway his father is teaching him how to steal food in the kitchen fernando said well why not castillo said dogs like boys have to grow up sometime and if you need a teacher go to an expert are you talking about your dog or yourself fernando challenged both castillo said and turned to the boy randy we both know that you have learned to keep important secrets and everybody in this room from lester to general wilson knows what that secret is i dont think i like where this conversation is going fernando interrupted i dont think i do either dona alicia said castillo ignored both of them he went on so i know randy that if i tell you that this is an important secretactually secrets a bunch of themand if they get out people can be hurt or even killed i know that i can trust you to keep your mouth shut okay if you dont want that responsibility ill understand if you want to take max and his puppy for a walk jesus christ gringo hes fourteen years old fernando said he doesnt need to hear about people getting hurt or killed carlos do you know what youre doing dona alicia asked ill stay randy said and then added thank you sir okay the family lawyer randy el senor hector garciaromero is up to his ears in the drug business i dont believe that maria lopez exploded hector is little fernandos godfather i dont care if you believe it or not maria castillo said what im worried about is your mouth will you give me your word to keep it shut are you just going to stand there and listen to him talk to me like that maria demanded of her husband fernando looked at castillo gringo you better be sure you know what youre talking about i do maria honey if you dont want to hear this why dont you castillo cut him off he said maria the best way i know to convince you to keep your mouth shut about tio hector or anything else you will hear if you decide to stay is to convince you that if you run your mouth youll be putting not only tio hectors life at risk but your own and fernandos and your kids lives and probably even abuelas she glared at him and then icily demanded how could you dare to bring this this garbage here fair question first i own half of this place second i didnt know anyone was here if i had known we probably wouldnt be here but the hand has been dealt and we have to play it you are sure about hector carlos dona alicia asked earnestly abuela im sorry but its true we were just at a secret airport he operates in the laguna el guaje he doesnt move drugs out of there just the cash profits from the drug trade suitcases full of hundreddollar bills my god its important that hector doesnt know were here that no one knows were here i told pablo that at the airstrip hell deal with it gringo what the hell is going on fernando asked you believe him maria asked her husband incredulously yeah sweetheart i believe him and you better believe him too i dont want hector to know you know about him castillo said if he calls here and i suspect he will act normally but tell him you dont know where i am and that you havent heard from me dona alicia nodded okay castillo then said what are we doing here randy you were aware that the army the armed forces went to defcontwo a while back just before we bombed some place in africa castillo nodded yeah nobody would talk about it but the gthrees daughter heard about it and snooped around and she has a big mouth what is that carlos defcontwo dona alicia asked defcon stands for defense condition defcontwo is the nexttohighest degree of readiness to go to war let me take the briefing charley uncle remus said you look pretty beat and we dont want to leave anything out castillo gave him the floor with a wave of his hand the reason the defense department went to defcontwo leverette began is because the president had learned that the iranians the russians and some former east germans were making a biological weapon in the congo and he decided that it had to go how did he learn about it randy asked leverette looked at the boy then at castillo youre right charley he does have a mouth he looked again at the boy and said you get one interruption randy and that was it next time raise your hand yes sir your facolonel castillo was instrumental in getting two senior russian intelligence officers to defect they wanted to get out of russia for a number of reasons including that they were unhappy about the biological weapons factory in the congo as soon as colonel castillo got them to argentina they told him about it both leverette and castillo saw randy look at tom barlow and svetlana asking with his eyes if they were the russians and then saw svetlana nod am i allowed to ask questions mr leverette general wilson asked yes sir of course was that attack based on more than what the defectors told charley or the president the reason i ask is because there was some talk the president went off halfcocked sir it was based on more than what the russians told us colonel hamilton from fort detrick went over there himself and brought out samples of the material and even the cadavers of three people who had died from the effects of the poisonous substance thank you im really glad to hear that then he had a thought and said it aloud how the hell did hamilton get into and then out of the congo with three bodies carefully and surreptitiously general leverette said tell the general who took colonel hamilton into and out of the congo mr leverette castillo said leverette clearly uncomfortable said nothing why am i not surprised general wilson said thats why they gave him another distinguished service medal when he was retired castillo said you were at the retirement parade randy general wilson said you saw both mr leverette and colonel castillo being decorated with the dsm then why did my father say he was kicked out of the army that pompous asshole and chairwarmer is not your father i am he must have been given the wrong information castillo said it happened so suddenly that it probably looked like we were being thrown out anyway we thought the whole thing was over leverette went on i was in uruguay about to go into the cattle business when the russian rezident in budapest handed mr kocian a letter it said that a mistake had been made and that the russians should come home all is forgiven youre not going back are you svetlana randy asked nervously no svetlana said now shut up and let uncle remus finish leverette went on the next thing that happened was a barrel of this stuff was delivered to colonel hamilton at fort detrick and and that brought us dona alicia to your door leverette concluded and what happens now we eat a lot of grapefruit and maybe do a little fishing while we wait to see what the powers that be decide to do with the tapes castillo said and the one thing we dont do until that happensfor the next four or five daysis talk about this i think we should have an early lunch dona alicia said ill ask them to set up a table on the verandah four the office of the ambassador of the united states of america avenida colombia buenos aires argentina february ambassador juan manuel silviotall lithe fairskinned well tailoredstood up behind his desk smiled and put his hand out as ambassador charles m montvale and truman ellsworth walked into his office how nice to see you again mr montvale silvio said ambassador montvale said i know you only by reputation mr ellsworth silvio said im juan silvio ive heard about you too mr ambassador ellsworth said with a smile ellsworth knew much more about silvio than the scathing description of the diplomat montvale had given him ellsworth was aware that there was more to his story than the bare commonly known facts that silvios family had escaped from castros cuba on a fishing boat he knew that the fishing boat had been a sixtytwofoot bertram and that the silvio family had brought out with them not only the clothing on their backs but an enormous fish box filled with currency jewelry and stock certificates some of the more valuable antiques from their havana mansion and the extra keys to the cars they kept at their key biscayne house ellsworth knew silvio had graduated from his fathers alma mater spring hill college a jesuit institution in mobile alabama which had been educating south american aristocrats for two hundred years and that silvio had earned a law degree at harvard and then a doctorate in political science at the university of alabama he had joined the state department on graduation he had done so for much the same reason that truman ellsworth had become executive assistant to the director of national intelligence not because they needed the job but because they saw itthe term noblesse oblige fitas their patriotic obligation to serve their country most important ellsworth knew that silvio was not afraid of montvale so far as ellsworth knew silvio had never had to use it but if push came to shove he had behind him the enormous political clout of the cubanamerican community in south florida the silvio family had spent a great deal of their money helping fellow cubans escape from castro and establish themselves in the united states this was remembered and gentlemen always repay their debts may i offer you a cup of coffee ambassador silvio asked waving montvale and ellsworth into chairs facing his desk no thank you montvale said mr ambassador that would be very nice thank you ellsworth said i am here at the personal order of president clendennen montvale finished so ms grunblatt told me silvio said and as soon as we have our coffee ill ask how i may be of service are you sure you wont im sure thank you so how may i be of service to you mr montvale my orders are to locate both of the russian defectors and former lieutenant colonel carlos castillo former i was under the impression castillo had been retired was that wrong did he resign no he retired montvale said do you know where he is mr ambassador or the russians im afraid i dont the last time i saw colonel castillo was when you and he were both in this office do you think if i got secretary of state cohen or the president himself on the telephone to confirm my mission here it would improve your memory mr ambassador silvio did not rise to the bait mr montvale when ms grunblatt told me that you had told her that i telephoned the secretary of state for verification secretary cohen confirmed that you and mr ellsworth are here at the direction of president clendennen and instructed me to do whatever i can to help you accomplish your mission and i have told you what that mission is and i have told you i have no idea where colonel castillo or the russian defectors might be but ill tell you what i can do now that everyones back from the affair in mar del plata and the embassys vehicles are back in the motor pool ill be happy to augment the suburban in which you must have been really crammed with a vehicle more in keeping with your rank and position with a driver of course for as long as youre here thank you very much montvale said mr ambassador would you be surprised to hear that your former commercial counselor and my former buenos aires station chief alexander darby is in ushuaia yes i would i was led to believe that mr darby had returned to the united states i have been led to believe hes in ushuaia with a young argentine woman i find that hard to believe mr montvale how good is your source montvale ignored the question it occurred to me knowing what little i do about ushuaia he said that the southernmost city in south america as remote as it is would be an ideal place to hide the russians what do you think i think thats absurd silvio said you are telling me and i will tell the president that you have told me that you think the possibility that mr darby andor colonel castillo are hiding the russian defectors in ushuaia is absurd yes i do or rather yes mr montvale that is exactly what im telling you i think im wasting my time here montvale said and stood up good afternoon mr ambassador good afternoon mr montvale ambassador silvio said standing up on your way out ask the marine guard for your car if you need to contact me you have my number oh i have your number mr ambassador montvale said and without shaking hands marched out of the office silvio and ellsworth nodded at each other and then ellsworth followed montvale ellsworth thought i would bet two cents against a doughnut that nobodynot this fellow darby nor castillo nor the russiansis in ushuaia and i will also bet the same amount that the minute we get into the car charles is going to say send the other four clandestine service officers down there as quickly as possible thats where everybody is or words to that effect montvale did five marriott plaza hotel florida buenos aires argentina february it is said that the bar in the plaza hasnt changed since general juan domingo peron drank there as a corporal but this is untrue for several reasons including the fact that general peron was never a corporal it can be more accurately said that the bar has changed very little from the time it opened with the hotel a century ago it is a warm and comfortable room with an lshaped bar tucked into a corner there are a halfdozen tables and comfortable leather armchairs it is as accurate to say the bar is on the floor below the lobby as it is to say its on the ground floor avenida florida level for most of its length takes a steep dip as it passes the plaza on its way to avenida libertador and the main railroad station it is thus possible to turn off florida and enter the bar almost directly it is also possible fifty feet away to turn off florida and enter the hotel lobby if one elects the latter choice then one must take the stairs or the elevator and go down one floor to get to the bar the director of national intelligence the honorable charles m montvale and his executive assistant the honorable truman ellsworth entered the bar by coming down the stairs shortly after being told in the lobby that roscoe j danton was sitting at the bar alone second stool from the wall this information had come to them from winston gump one of the clandestine service officers who had arrived in buenos aires that morning montvale had drafted gump to attend himthe phrase he used was work within the belief that one never knew when one might require the skills of a veteran of the clandestine service for his part gump was flattered by having been selected to servehe thought serve not work withthe most senior person in the american intelligence community and his executive assistant gump did wonder about executive assistant ellsworth he didnt look like a male version of a super secretary nor did he look that way but gump knew you couldnt always judge a book by its cover and there were all those stories going around how j edgar hoover and his assistant could hardly wait to get home to put on dresses anything gump had learned in his clandestine service was possible well truman montvale said look whos here ellsworth took the bar stool closest to the wall montvale took the one on the other side roscoe j danton raised his voice hey pedro look whos here oh shit hes drunk on reflection that might not be entirely a bad thing friend of yours roscoe truman ellsworth asked as he looked around the bar until he found a man sitting at one of the tables drinking a coke while trying hard and almost succeeding in pretending he had not heard danton calling or seen danton pointing at montvale and ellsworth not exactly well have what our friend is having montvale said and give him another and maybe one for your notexactlyafriend ellsworth asked im sure hed love one but hes on duty and from what ive observed plainclothes officers of the gendarmeria nacional do not drink while on duty youre suggesting that youre being surveilled by the argentines montvale asked it was more a statement than a suggestion mr ambassador danton said either that guy or one of his cousins has been with me from the moment i tried to buy a used car you what a man named alexander darbyof whom you may have heard no of whom im sure you have heard he was in the clandestine service of the cia like the guy i suspect you sent in here a couple of minutes agowas retiring from government service you saw alex did you roscoe ellsworth asked danton nodded then went on and had put his car up for sale clever journalist that i am i got from the offer of sale his address which the embassy press officer mizz sylvia grunblatt wouldnt give me citing federal rules visavis privacy so you saw him ellsworth asked why did you want to see darby roscoe montvale asked the conversation was interrupted by the bartender who delivered three trays with the proper glasses and other accessories for the whiskypouring and a whisky bottle you may have cause to regret your impulsive generosity mr montvale danton said he pointed to the whisky bottle that is the macallan eighteenyearold highland single malt scotch whisky were i not on the expense accountor for your generosityi would shudder to think of the cost my privilege roscoe montvale said while hes going through that absolutely marvelous pouring routine roscoe you were about to tell us why you wanted to see alex darby ellsworth said so i was danton said so i went to his apartment he and his wife were there and how is julia ellsworth asked well now that you mention it she seemed a little pissed with her husband but i digress he was there with another cia dinosaur a guy named delchamps and and and an irishman named duffy who had with him three guys pedro over there was one of them danton waved at pedro who did not respond no sooner did i begin to mention that i wanted to ask darby about a rumor going around what kind of a rumor why do i think you know what kind of rumor because by your own admission you are a clever journalist montvale said but tell me anyway our late and not too mourned president had a special operations hotshot working for him directly for him an army guy a lieutenant colonel named castillo said special operations hotshot i have this from a source i almost believe is said to have snatched two defecting russians big onesfrom your cia station chief in vienna mr ambassadorjust as she was about to load them on a cia airplane and ship them to the states he and they then disappeared i also have heard a rumor that the russian defectors told this hotshot that the russians the iranians and other people had a biological warfare factory in the congo and that he told the president whereupon we went immediately to defcontwo and shortly thereafter a chunk of the congo was hit by everything in the arsenal of democracy except nukes you told alex and this irish fellow duffy all that ellsworth asked i didnt get two words beyond mentioning costellos castillos name when suddenly i was being asked for my identification and being patted down by pedro over there danton smiled and waved at pedro again he went on duffy then told me there was a question with my papers but since i was a friend of mr darby instead of being hauled off to gendarmeria nacional headquarters until it could be straightened out they would allow me to spend the night here in the river plate marriott and they would be happy to drive me there where do you think alex is now roscoe well hes not in his apartment the next morning duffy showed up here and said that i was free to go he was sure that i understood the situation and was grateful for my understanding he also said that if i thought i would need a remisethats sort of a taxito get around buenos aires he knew one he could recommend so i got in the remise and went back to darbys apartment he was gone i still had one card to play you remember the secret service guy on the presidential protection detail who fell off the bumper of the limousine tony santini montvale said good man yes he is we have shared a drink or two on occasion well when i knew i was coming down here i remembered that when he got fired from the protection detail they sent him down here to look for funny money so i tried to call him i got some other secret service guy on the phone who told me tony had retired but that he thought he was still in argentina in a country clubthats argentine for really tightly gated communityoutside of town i remembered the address the mayerling country club in pilar ive got a cousin named pilar and mayerling was the imperial austrian hunting lodge where emperor franz josefs son shot his sixteenyearold girlfriend and then committed suicide so i got in the remise duffy suggested and told the driver to take me out to this place we go instead to the gendarmeria nacional headquarters out comes duffy now in uniform hes the generalissimo or something of the gendarmeria nacional duffy says i really dont want to go to mayerling too dangerous people started out for mayerling and were never heard from again i got the message so you never got to see tony montvale said pity im sure he would have helped you yeah probably roscoe we may be in a position to help each other montvale said can we go off the record yeah sure but why bother you tell me something i report it and then you say i never said that and ellsworth says thats right i was there and the ambassador never said anything like that let me rephrase what if these rumors you heard were true what if there was a renegade lieutenant colonel named castillo who did in fact snatch two senior russian defectors from the cia station chief in vienna what if hes now trying to sell them to the cia no shit what if the president sent an unnamed but very senior intelligence official who used to be a diplomat mr ambassador down here with orders to find colonel castillo and these two russians and then load them onto an airplane and fly them to the states youre going to pay the ransom or whatever thats the point im trusting your discretion on this roscoe i know youre a patriotic american no the united states of america will not ransom the russians but they will be returned to the states and turned over to the cia kidnap them back you mean the russians will be returned to the united states and turned over to the cia and colonel castillo will be returned to the united states and the united states army for what is euphemistically known as disciplinary action jesus my search for these people has met with more success than yours roscoe montvale said you know where they are im in a position to offer you confirmation of those rumors you heard im further in a position to give exclusive rights towhat shall i saythe repatriation process and to the russians and to colonel castillo if i what how do i put this if splendid journalist that you are you nevertheless failed to notice any unpleasantness that may occur during the repatriation process any minor violations of argentine lawor for that matter of american law do you take my meaning roscoe j danton thought fuck you montvale once im back in the states ill write whatever the hell i feel like writing about anything i see roscoe j danton said deal when does this come down now truman please call that air force colonel and have the plane ready by time we get to the airport truman ellsworth said yes sir truman ellsworth thought if i thought there was any chance at all of castillo the russians or even alex darby actually being in ushuaia i would at this moment be experiencing shortness of breath excruciating pain in my chest and numbness of my left arm and waiting for the ambulance to haul me off to whatever hospital the embassy sends visiting vips suffering a heart attack but since im sure that all hes going to find down thereat bestis alex darby suffering a midlife crisis in the arms of a girl young enough to be his daughter im going to pretend i believe this idiocy for one thing i simply have to see how charles tries to talk himself out of this fiasco once it comes tumbling down around him i would never forgive myself if i didnt one the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february secretary of state natalie cohen director of the central intelligence agency john powell director of the federal bureau of investigation mark schmidt and general allan b naylor the commanding general of the united states central command were all in the reception area of the oval office when the president of the united states having returned from his trip to chicago entered they all rose to their feet when they saw the president he acknowledged none of them instead joshua ezekiel clendennen continued walking into his office sat in the leather chair behind his desk and issued two orders get me some coffee and then let them in three minutes later cohen powell schmidt and naylor filed into the oval office im glad you werent in timbuktu general clendennen said thinking that the president was joking naylor replied in kind thats next thursday mr president youre not going anywhere general until this business is finished the president snapped yes sir general naylor said sit down the president said gesturing to all of them general c harry whelan jr and andy mcclarren were talking about you on wolf news last night are you aware of that yes sir whelan told mcclarren that the chief of staff of the army no longer runs ithes just in charge of administering itand that since central command controls more troops more airplanes more ships and more military assets in more places all around the world than any other headquarters then that makes you as its commanding general the most important general in the army did you see the program by any chance it was brought to my attention mr president general naylor did not think he should get into the details of how the wolf news program had come to his attention he had been reading in his living room and ignoring the television his wife elaine and their son major allan b naylor jr and his family who had come for supper were watching the wolf news program the straight scoop when the whelanmcclarren exchange concluded general naylors wife and son went to him on their knees called him oh great one and mimed kissing his west point ring then backed out of his presence into the kitchen convulsed with laughter and to the applause of his daughterinlaw and grandchildren he actually had had to demand to be told what the hell was going on what was so funny and when he was told he didnt think it was at all funny the chief of staff was going to hear about it naylor had said and he wasnt going to find any humor in it and then hed had an even more disquieting thought he didnt like c harry whelan jr but it was possible that he was right about this too it seemed to be a truism that whoever commanded the most troops was de facto if not de jure the most important general officer the president asked would you agree with that assessment general sir since the chief of staff gives me my orders and writes my efficiency reports well this is one of those rare occasions on which i fully agree with mr whelan the president said and then went on does the name sergei murov mean anything to you general the svr rezident in the russian embassy sir the president nodded and i believe you know frank lammelle the deputy director of the cia pretty well yes sir i do mr powell will you please tell general naylor of the meeting lammelle had with murov in the russian compound on the eastern shore yes sir powell said and did so when powell had finished naylor said very interesting i have never liked traitors the president then announced more than a little piously and so i have decided to give the russians these two what are their names again jack colonel dmitri berezovsky and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva mr president the cia director furnished mr president do we have them naylor asked i was under the impression that that lieutenant colonel c g castillo the president said who snatched them away from our cia station chief in vienna has them yes sir i understand general that you are personally acquainted with lieutenant colonel castillo yes sir i am during the cold war there had been a custom in the regiments of the united states constabulary in occupied west germany called the dining in once a month the officers of the regiments met for dinner in their regimental officers club these were formal affairs ones presided over by the regimental commander with seating at the one large table arranged strictly according to rank dress uniform was prescribed officers ladies were not invited a splendid meal was served with appropriate wines at each course after the food had been consumed and the cigars and cognac distributed one of the officersin a rigidly choreographed ritualrose to his feet and said gentlemen i give you the president of the united states whereupon all the other officers rose to their feet and raised their glasses in toast the toasting then worked its way down the chain of command until it had reached the regimental commander and then the officers got down to some serious informal drinking and socializing the intention of which was to raise the awareness of officersparticularly officers just reporting for dutyof their role in the army the army of occupation the united states constabulary and their regiment it was at his first dining in that newly arrived major allan b naylor armor had first heard about the gossinger family the event had been held at the th armored cavalry regiment officers club in bad hersfeld which was in hesse very close to the border between west germany and east germany the th acrthe blackhorse regimenthad the mission of patrolling the border between east and west germany their patrols ran through the gossinger familys farmlands which had been cut by the barbedwire fence and the minefields erected by east germans at soviet direction to separate the east and west germanys most of the gossinger farmlands had wound up in east germany by the time the story of the princess in castle gossinger came up both alcohol and tradition had eased much of the formality of the dining in it was now time to tell war stories and other kinds of stories the idea being more to entertain those who had not heard them than to present an absolutely truthful version of the facts for example the story went that the barbedwire fence and the minefields had been erected to keep americans and west germans from escaping into the heaven on earth of the communist world as far as the gossinger castle was concerned the good news was that the gossinger familythe full family name identifying them as highly ranked in the almanach de gotha was von und zu gossingerhad lucked out after the fence had gone up their castle was in west germany the bad news was that the gossinger castle didnt look at all like neuschwanstein castle the one builtdamn the expenseby mad king ludwig in bavaria it instead more resembled a tractor factory the good news was that there was a fair princess living in the castle who loved americans the bad news was that her loving of americans was past tense she had loved one american he had ridden up to the castle on his white horseactually flying a bell whd hueydallied awhile left her in the family way and disappeared never to return nor to be heard from again more bad news was that her daddyformerly oberst hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger who had been one of the last seriously wounded evacuated before von paulus had surrendered at stalingraddid not like americans this was possibly because of the american chopper jockeys relationship with the princess he had made it clear that any contact with americans would be rare and brief shortly after the dining in major naylor had been taken to the castleformally known as das haus im waldby the blackhorses commander colonel frederick lustrous and there introduced to former oberst hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger who received them courteously but rather coldly in his office naylor had obeyed lustrouss order allan look closely at the pictures on the shelf behind his desk as lustrous explained to herr von und zu gossinger that as the regiments s naylor would be dealing with the von und zu gossingers for the regiment major naylor was surprised at what he saw on the shelf there was a photo of general george s patton standing with his arm around von und zu gossingers shoulder the third man in the photo naylor recognized after a moment as colonel john waters pattons soninlaw who had been captured in north africa patton and waters were splendidly turned out while von und zuas naylor had quickly come to think of the starchy germanwas in a tattered suit the picture had obviously been taken immediately after the war probably just after waters had been freed and just before patton had died of injuries suffered in a cartruck accident in heidelberg and judging by the way oberst von und zu gossinger was dressed not long at all after he had been released from a pow camp and taken off his uniform for the last time but the photograph clearly made the point that von und zu had some powerful american friends waters was now a general officer naylor got his first look at the princessfrau erika von und zu gossingerthat first visit to the castle but they were not introduced she was a slim young woman in a black dress her blonde hair gathered in a bun at her neck and had been with her son a towheaded ten or elevenyearold at the time naylor decided that while the story of the princess getting herself knocked up by some american chopper jockey made a great dining in story it was probably pure bullshit over the next two years he became more sure of that as he developed a personal relationship with the princess or more accurately as his bride elaine and erika became friends as did the boy and allan junior who was a year younger than karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger the two women became much closer about a year later after von und zu and his son went off a bridge on the autobahn near kassel in their mercedes at a speed estimated by the authorities at one hundred ninety kilometers per hour one hundred eighteen miles per hour which left the princess and her son not only alone in the castle but the sole owners of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh by that time major naylor had learned the gossinger assets went far beyond the farmlands now split by the barbedwire fence and minefields there were seven newspapers all over europe two breweries a shipyard and other businesses at the funeral of erikas father and brother allan had told elaine that he thought erika would now be pushed into marrying otto gorner managing director of the gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh empire who he knew had made his intentions of such known a long time ago and who had enjoyed the blessing of the late oberst von und zu gossinger elaine had told him that erika had told her she would never marryotto or anyone else and she hadnt six months after the funeral elaine whitefaced showed up at naylors officesomething she almost never didand announced she had to talk to him right then the best of the bad news is that scurrilous story about karl being the love child of one of our oversexed goddamn chopper jockeys is true elaine had reported and handed him a slip of paper thats his name on the paper she had written wojg jorge castillo san antonio texas what am i supposed to do with this hed said find him after all this time why the worst of the really bad news sweetheart is that erika has maybe a month maybe six weeks to live shes kept her pancreatic cancer a secret my god very shortly that texmex sonofabitch is going to be karls only living relative find him allan as any wise major destined for high command would do when faced with a problem that he didnt have a clue how to solve naylor turned to the blackhorses sergeant major it took the wise old noncom not even thirty minutes to locate warrant officer junior grade jorge alejandro castillo he had remembered the name from somewhere and then he had remembered where the sergeant major handed major naylor a book entitled vietnam war recipients of the medal of honor wojg jorge castillo was in san antonio in the fort sam houston national cemetery his tombstone bore a finely chiseled representation of the medal of honor and dates that indicated he had been nineteen years old at the time of his death that presented problems for naylor and the army that were difficult to express without sounding like a threestar sonofabitch but they had to be as karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger was about to become a very wealthy twelveyearold and all of that money was now going to come under the control of some mexicanamericans in texas who probably didnt even know he existed the army tries to take care of its own this is especially true when the person needing help is the only son of a killedinaction officer whose incredible courage in the face of death earned him the nations most prestigious medal for valor the problem went up the chain of command senior officers of the judge advocate generals corps were directed to find ways to save the boys inheritance from squander by his new family naylor was flown to san antonio to reconnoiter the situation two days after elaine had walked into his office with the bad news the commanding general v us corps telephoned the commanding general of the fifth united states army at fort sam houston and told him naylor was coming and why that officer quickly informed naylor that the problem was not that the castillo family was going to squander the inheritancethey owned square blocks of downtown san antonio and a great deal else and didnt need anyone elses money naylorsand the armysproblem was going to be to convince them that the boys mother was not some fraulein of loose morality trying to dump someone elses bastard on them to get her hands into the castillo cashbox naylor found dona alicia castillo at her office near the alamo when she telephoned her husband who was in new york city on business to tell him she had just been told that their only son had left behind a son in germany he begged her to take things very slowly and to do nothing until he could return to texas and look into it himself he has jorges eyes dona alicia had said and hung up juan fernando castillo caught the next flight he could get on to texas it took him to dallas not san antonio but that wasnt going to pose a problem he had called lemes aviation and told them to have the lear waiting for him in dallas for the final leg to san antonio when he got to dallas however the lear wasnt there when he called lemes aviation he was told that dona alicia had taken the jet to new york so that she and some army officer could make the fivefifteen pan american flight to frankfurt within twentyfour hours of meeting dona alicia castillo allan and elaine naylor stood in the corridor outside erika von und zu gossingers room in the castle and overheard dona alicia say im jorges mother my dear im here to take care of you and the boy juan fernando castillo arrived in germany ten hours after his wife a week latererika having decided she didnt want the boy to see her in the final stages of her illnessnaylor and elaine and allan junior had shaken hands and hugged the boy who now carried an american passport in the name of carlos guillermo castillo and was preparing to board a pan american airliner bound for new york you dont happen to know where your friend lieutenant colonel castillo is do you general president clendennen asked no sir i do not well ive got a mission for you general i want youas your highest priorityto find lieutenant colonel castillo wherever he might be whereupon you will personally hand him orders recalling him from retirement to active duty you will then personally order him to turn these russian traitors over to the cia and when he has done so then i want you to place castillo under arrest pending investigation of charges that may be laid against him under the uniform code of military justice do you understand these orders allan naylor stood stonefaced and thought goddamn you to hell bruce mcnab he then said may i ask questions sir the president wiggled his fingers granting permission sir what is my authority to detain or arrest the russians that wont pose a problem for you general mr lammelle will deal with that sir i dont understand from right nowor at least from as soon as mr lammelle can get here from langleyuntil this mission has been accomplished you and lammelle will be so to speak joined at the hip i wouldnt think general of asking you or the army to do anything that would constitute a violation of any law nor would i ask that mr lammelle or the cia violate any laws having said that we all know that the agency has a certain latitude in the gray areas and i will personally accept full responsibility for any action that mr lammelle feels he should take to carry out the desires of the commander in chief in this matter does that answer your question general naylor yes sir how soon can you start on this general sir ill have to set up things at macdill so that i can devote my full time to this so as soon as mr lammelle gets here ill go there jack the president said to the dci lammelle has a radio in his car right why dont you get on the horn and tell him to meet the general at andrews theres no reason he actually has to come here yes sir good hunting general the president said i dont think i have to tell you to keep me posted do i no sir two office of the commanding general united states army central command macdill air force base tampa florida february by the time of the first desert war allan naylor was a wellrespected major general obviously destined for greater responsibility and the rank that would come with it he had been selected to be general h norman schwarzkopfs j the joint staffs operations officer it was the js responsibility to know what assetsusually meaning which unitswere available to his general and lists were prepared and updated daily that showed the names of the units and of their commanding officers one day as they prepared to strike at iraqi forces naylor had noticed on that days list under newly arrived in theatre the rd civil government detachment lieutenant colonel bruce j mcnab was listed as the commanding officer naylor felt a little sorry for mcnab for several reasons including that lieutenant colonel was a pretty junior rank for those who had graduated from the point and that command of a civil government detachment was not a highway to promotion but naylor also had decided that the lowly status was almost certainly scotty mcnabs own fault he had always been a troublemaker and naylor had heard somewhere and some time ago that mcnab had gone into special forcesanother dead end usually for those seeking high rankand this meant that mcnab had somehow screwed up that career too the proof being that he now held only the rank of a light bird and was commanding a civil government detachment two days later the list under changes noted change mcnab bruce j ltc inf civgovdet to col no change in duties naylor had thought that mcnab had been lucky the desert war had come along now he would be able to retire as a full bird colonel and then the shooting war began and major general naylor gave no further thought to colonel mcnab two days after that naylor learned from the public relations officer that in the very opening hours of the active war the copilot of one of the apache attack helicopters sent in to destroy iraqi radar and other facilities had performed these duties with extraordinary skill and valor the apache had been struck by iraqi fire which wounded both the pilot and copilot blinding the former a lesser man than the copilot would have landed the apache and waited for help this one in the belief the pilot would die unless he got prompt medical attention flew the battered smoking shuddering apache more than a hundred miles back across the desert to friendly lines ignoring the wounds he had himself received and the enormous risk to his own life the gone general the public relations officer said to naylor has approved the impact award of the distinguished flying cross for this officer can general schwarzkopf find time to make the presentation personally why is that important the public relations aspect of this general naylor is enormous once we release this storyespecially with general schwarzkopf personally making the awardit will be on the front page of every newspaper in america why enormous the copilot is a twentyoneyearold second lieutenant general he just got out of west point and theres more general much more the first thing general naylor thought was then charley castillo probably knows him he also just got out of the point that was immediately followed by what the hell is a twentyoneyearold second lieutenant months out of hudson high doing flying an apache over here what more naylor had asked this kids father won the medal of honor in vietnam general flying a huey helicopter colonel you dont win the medal of honor you receive are a recipient of the medal of honor naylor corrected him in a pavlovian reaction and then said let me see that thing the name of the officer who had performed so heroically was second lieutenant carlos g castillo where is this officer he asked softly in your outer office sir get him in here naylor ordered the hand with which lieutenant castillo saluted general naylor was wrapped in a bloody bandage much of his forehead and right cheek carried smaller bandages good afternoon sir allan said if i had a chance to pass on his regards right about now you were supposed to be starting flight school basic flight school how is it youre here and flying an apache well when i got to rucker it came out that i had a little over three hundred hours in the civilian version of the huey so they sent me right to apache school and here i am naylor had thought and damn lucky to be alive questions of personal valor aside standing before me is a young officer who is blissfully unaware that he has been a pawn in what is obviously a cynical scheme on the part of some senior aviation officers who wanted to garner publicity for army aviationson of vietnam army pilot hero flies in iraqand turned a blind eye to his lack of experience and the very good chance that he would be killed goddamn them they probably wouldve liked it better if he had been killed it would have made a better story for the newspapers son of hero pilot dies like his father in combat at the controls sonsofbitches ten minutes later general h norman schwarzkopf agreed with major general naylors assessment of the situation what do you want to do with him allan send him back to fort rucker that would imply hes done something wrong sir then find some nice safe flying assignment for him schwarzkopf said anything else no sir thank you sir that then posed the problem of where to find a nice safe flying assignment for second lieutenant castillo out of the reach of gloryseeking army aviators mcnab allan naylor scotty how are you very well thank you how may i serve the general tell me scotty are there any hueys on your t o and e somebody told me youre the jthree arent you supposed to know we may be classmates but im a major general and youre a justpromoted colonel a touch more respect on your part would be in order answer the question please scotty mcnab affected an officious tone and said rotarywing aircraft are essential to the mission of the rd civil government detachment sir actually sir we couldnt fulfill the many missions assigned to us in the area of civil government without them yes sir i have a couple of hueys colonel a simple yes sir or no sir would have sufficed naylor snapped yes sir by then naylor had been halfconvinced that mcnabs disrespectful attitude was induced by alcohol he had an urge to simply hang up on him but that would not have solved the problem of finding second lieutenant castillo a nice safe flying assignment im about to send you a huey pilot colonel a huey copilot what did he do wrong excuse me what did this guy do to get banished to civil government as a matter of fact colonel this officer was decorated not more than an hour ago by general schwarzkopf with the distinguished flying cross naylor said sharply he heard his tone got control of himself and went on the thing is scotty this officer is very young has been through a harrowing experience has been wounded and what i was thinking got the picture send him down glad to have him thanks scotty think civil government general thats what were really all about not long after the shooting war had ended schwarzkopfs aidedecamp arrived in naylors office and announced general schwarzkopf asks you to be in his office at when he will decorate colonel mcnab general youre friends right colonel mcnab is to be decorated with what for what with the distinguished service cross general and afterward the presidents going to call to offer his congratulations on his promotion the senate just confirmed his star jack are we talking about colonel mcnab of civil government well sir thats what they called it but thats not what it really was excuse me if it wasnt civil government what was it sir maybe you better ask general schwarzkopf about that at general naylor went into general norman schwarzkopfs office and confessed that he was more than a little confused about colonel mcnabs rd civil government detachment and what he had been told was to happen at you werent on the needtoknow list allan stormin norman said i told mcnab i thought you should be but he said if he ever needed anything from you hed tell you what he was up to and it was his call my orders were to support him but he didnt answer to me he took his orders from the cia sir what was he up to he ran special operations for the campaign and did one hell of a job they grabbed two intact scud missiles and a halfdozen russian officersincluding two generalswho were showing the iraqis how to work them embarrassed the hell out of the russians there was a lot more but you dont have the needtoknow im sure you understand naylor understood but that was not the same as saying he liked being kept in the dark at colonel bruce j mcnab followed by second lieutenant castillo marched into general schwarzkopfs office came to attention and saluted allan naylor could not believe his eyes colonel mcnab was a small muscular ruddyfaced man with a flowing red mustache he wore aviator sunglasses a mostly unbuttoned khaki bush jacket with its sleeves rolled up khaki shorts kneelength brown socks and hunting boots on his head was an arabian headdress circled with two gold cords which naylor had recently learned indicated the wearer was an arabian nobleman an uzi submachine gun hung by a strap from his shoulder castillo was similarly dressed except he had no gold cords on his headdress and he had a colt car submachine gun slung from his shoulder what the hell are you two dressed up for scotty general schwarzkopf asked sir i researched what lawrence of arabia actually wore during his campaigns in the desertand it was not flowing robesand adopted it for me and my aidetobe its a good thing the press isnt here schwarzkopf said theyd have a field day with you two schwarzkopf offered his hand to castillo good to see you again lieutenant he said thank you sir and speaking of lieutenant castillo mcnab said and handed schwarzkopf two oblong blue medal boxes these are for him im sure hed rather get them from you sir what are they the silver star for the business with the russian generals and the purple heart second and third awards i sent him to you scotty naylor heard himself say to get him out of the line of fire didnt work out that way general mcnab said charleys a warrior i have general mcnab for you sir command sergeant major wes suggins the senior noncommissioned officer of the united states central command announced to general naylor from the office door naylor gave him a thumbsup gesture and snatched the secure telephone from his desk good evening sir lieutenant general bruce j mcnab commanding general of the special operations command at fort bragg north carolina said cheerfully and how are things on beautiful tampa bay general i want you in my office at ohseventhirty tomorrow naylor said perhaps if i may make the suggestion sir your quarters would be a better place to meet sir mcnab said i suspect we are going to say unkind things to one another and that sometimes adversely affects the morale of your gnomes ohseventhirty general naylor said coldly furious my office and leave your wiseass mouth at bragg i hear and obey my general mcnab said cheerfully naylor slammed the secure telephone into its cradle the damned call didnt take thirty seconds and he made me lose my temper referring to my staff as my gnomes goddamn him allan b naylor had never liked bruce j mcnab during their four years at the united states military academy at west point he had come to dislike him intensely in later years and now he could not think of an officer he had ever despised more three mortons steakhouse connecticut avenue nw washington dc february sergei murov sat at the bar of the restaurant drinking twelveyearold chivas regal while he watched in the mirror behind the row of bottles the headwaiter stand at the entrance murov was waiting for the syndicated columnist c harry whelan jr to show up murov knew that the headwaiterand other restaurant staffwere aware of who the freely spending cultural attache of the embassy of the russian federation was and he was equally certainwashington being the small town that it really was where everybody knew each others businessthat they had at least heard and probably believed that he was the head russian spy murov wanted the word to get out around town that he had had a private dinner in mortons with whelan the fbi would be helpful in this regard the usual quartet of fbi special agents had been waiting outside the embassy with two cars and had followed him here he knew how they worked the cars were now parked on opposite sides of connecticut avenue so that they could easily follow him no matter which direction he took when he left the restaurant one special agent had followed him into the restaurant and was now sitting at the end of the bar the second agentonfoot was now standing in the alley outside the kitchen against the possibility that the wily russian spy might try to elude surveillance by sneaking out of mortons through the kitchen one of the fbi men had almost certainly already radioed the information to whoever was supervising his surveillance that he was in mortons and just as soon as c harry whelan arrived and joined him that information too would be passed on that information however would not be shared with anyoneat least immediatelyoutside the j edgar hoover building but the information would get around where murov wanted it to go via the headwaiter who would be on the receiving end of at least one flying cnotehe loved that phrasefor making discreet telephone calls to various print and television journalists telling them that c harry whelan jr had just walked into mortons and was breaking bread with sergei murov behind a screen erected at murovs request good evening mr whelan the headwaiter said when the journalist walked through the door nice to see you again your regular table i think ill have a little taste first thank you whelan said gesturing toward the bar oh look whos there sergei murov had gotten off his bar stool and was smiling at whelan whelan walked to him and they shook hands whelan too knew that a substantial percentage of the headwaiters income came to him off the books and thus taxfree in the form of flying cnotes given him as an expression of gratitude by various print journalists and television producers for keeping them up to date on where c harry whelan and others of insidethebeltway prominence were had been or were going to be and who they were talking to whelan was usually delighted with the system and especially so today when he knew the word would spread that he had had dinner with murov murov met with only the more important journalists and actually very few of those whelan had no idea what murov wanted from him and would have been very surprised if he got anything at all useful from the russian but the word would spread among those it would annoy to learn that he was bending elbows with the russian spymaster was andy mcclarren anchor of wolf newss most popular program whelan recently had come to think that straight scoop mcclarren was getting more than a little too big for his kilt this was by no means the first or even the tenth time that hed met murov at mortons he knew what was going to happen there would be some very good whisky at the bar and then when they had moved to a table some really firstclass wine and one of mortons nearly legendary steaks people often quoted whelans evaluation of mortons steakhouse the food is so good in mortons that its almost worth about half what they charge for it and afterward murov would not only insist on paying the check in cash but also would leave the actual bill lying on the table from where he knew harry would discreetlyand thinking murov didnt noticeslip it in his pocket murov had diplomatic privilege which would allow him to turn the bill over to the irs for a refund of the tax he had decided the first time hed seen whelan grab the bill that the russian federation could easily afford forfeiting the returned taxes if that meant a very importantand thus potentially very usefuljournalist would come to the conclusion that he was putting something over not only on the irs but also on the rezident of the russian embassy it is always better if ones adversary thinks he is far more clever than oneself how are you sergei whelan greeted murov what a pleasant surprise murov said have you time for a drink harry i could be talked into that i think whelan said and slipped onto a bar stool he ordered a famous grouse twelveyearold malt scotch whisky with two ice cubes and half as much water as whisky as the bartender was making the drink murov said i saw you on wolf news harry straight scoop something you and four million other people whelan said somewhat smugly i thought your arfarf business was hilarious but i wondered what it did to your relationship with president clendennen it went from justaboutasbadasitcanget to worse what was that all about anyway at fort detrick i dont know sergei i think you know what really goes on out there i havent a clue the hell you dont okay they have a biological weapons laboratory out there thats probably classified top secret but its really about as much of a secret as mcclarrens wig really that red hair isnt his thats why they always shoot him up whelan said demonstrating with his hands a low camera angle pointing upward if they shoot him down or even straight on you can see the cheesecloth or whatever it is under the hair you really are a fountain of information harry murov said whelan thought actually of disinformation as far as i know all that red hair comes out of ol andys scalp but the bartender heard what i just said and before the night is over it will be all over mortons and before the week is out jay leno will have made a joke about old baldy and his red rug whelan said so what happened at fort detrick was that they had an accident somebody dropped a bottle or somebody forgot to close a door theyre prepared for something like that the emergency procedures were put into play since the world didnt come to an end we know that the emergency procedures worked but in the meantime homeland security the defense department every other agency determined to prove its on the job protecting the people rushed up there and the wolf news photographers in the helicopter got those marvelous shots of everybody getting in everybodys way chasing their tails arfarf twenty minutes and two drinks later murov called for the bartender told him he was ready for his table and asked for the bill when it was presented murov laid three twentydollar bills on the bar and told the bartender to keep the change the headwaiter appeared bearing menus and trailed by the sommelier bearing the wine list c harry whelan jr slipped the bar bill into his pocket and followed everybody to a table set against a wall behind a folding screen ten minutes after that a waiter had delivered a dozen oysters on the halfshell and the sommelier had opened and poured from a bottle of egri bikaver which murov told whelan he had learned to appreciate as a young officer stationed in budapest bulls blood they call it murov said the hungarians have been making wine for a thousand years what were you doing in budapest whelan asked as a young officer i was in tanks murov said bullshit you were in the kgb or the ogpu or whatever they called the soviet secret intelligence service in those days you are a charming sonofabitch sergei but you didnt get to be the washington rezident because youre a nice guy youre dangerous what the hell do you want from me they tapped the rims of their glasses together im going to tell you a story harry murov said one that would go over very well if you went on the straight scoop tonight with it well here it comes whelan interrupted sergei my experience has been that if someone tries to feed you a story murov went on but i think when you hear the whole story you will decide to wait a little before coming out with it murov paused then added and if you decide to break the story immediately i will of course deny it and since it touches on the incredible i really think people would believe my denial why are you being so good to me sergei because it is in my interests to do so and because frankly you are the most important journalist to whom i have access whelan thought that makes sense murov reached for and then placed on the table a very elegant dark red leather attache case when whelan saw it he thought of the winebulls blood murov took two sheets of paper from the attache case laid them on the table closed the attache case returned it to the floor and then handed whelan the two sheets of paper what am i looking at its in russian underneath is the translation what youre looking at is a letter from colonel vladlen solomatin whelan read the translation and then looked at murov his eyebrows raised in question when you have your own translation of the russian made harry murov said i think youll find that ones quite accurate i know that because i did it myself i confess i dont understand what this is all about whelan said those warmongers who scurrilously accuse me of being a member of the svr rather than the innocent diplomat that i am would also allege that my superior in the svr is vladlen solomatin the second directorate of the svr is in charge of svr agents around the world exercising that authority through the senior svr officer in each country commonly called the rezident are you hearing all this for the first time harry absolutely this is all news to me im not surprised anyway so im told most of these rezidents know each other we excuse me they went to school together served together et cetera you understand sort of an old boys club right precisely murov said not very often but once in a great while people who are not in the svr form close friendships with people who are in our embassiesas i am sure in yourscultural attaches know who the rezident cia station chief is even if that is supposed to be a secret am i right probably are you going to tell me who the svr rezident in your embassy here is sergei no but i know who he is even though i am not supposed to and im sure that secret is safe with you whelan said as he reached for the bottle of egri bikaver vladimir putin may sleep soundly tonight whelan saw in murovs eyes something that told him murov did not like the sarcasm ormaybe particularlythe reference to putin good colonel dmitri berezovsky and i are friends from childhood murov said and we went to saint petersburg university together and berezovsky is the former commercial attache of our embassy in berlin read rezident whelan had asked the question to annoy murov and was genuinely surprised when murov replied all right the former rezident in berlin and i was therefore genuinely surprised when word came that he and his sister who was the rezident in copenhagen had deserted their posts shortly before they were to be arrested on charges of embezzlement this letter whelan said tapping the document with his fingers says they didnt do it come home all is forgiven they didnt do it svetlanas husband was trying to pay her back for leaving him in the svr husbands are expected to control their wives if they cant it puts their character into question are you pulling my leg sergei not in the slightest svetlana you keep using her first name you know her too huh very well as i was saying svetlana not only moved out of their apartment but had begun divorce proceedings against colonel alekseev having ones wifeparticularly a wife who is a coworker so to speakfind one wanting in the marital situation is very damaging to an officers career evgenys father was a general evgenys the husband murov nodded and said colonel evgeny evgenyvich alekseev and evgeny wanted to be a general too and i would suppose there was a human element in here as well human element aside from everything else his losing svetlana shes a strikingly beautiful woman charming elegant evgeny was crazy about her jealous does the term soap opera mean anything to you sergei i know what a soap opera is of course this sounds like a soap opera a bad one murov sucked in his breath audibly and then he was spared having to reply immediately by the waiter excuse me the waiter interrupted are you ready to order gentlemen he was pushing a cart loaded with steaks chops lobster and other items from which one could select ones steak chop lobster or other item whelan seriously doubted one actually got what one selected for one thing all the cuts were lying on a bed of ice and were therefore presumably below room temperature and you werent supposed to grill steaks unless they were at room temperature for another it was reasonable to assume the diner would pick the best chunk of meat if this then went to the grill another goodlooking steak would have to be added to the cart it would therefore be easier to let the customer think he was selecting his entree and actually serve him with something from the kitchen and he was sure they did just that filet mignon pink in the middle with wine merchants sauce asparagus and a small salad please whelan ordered without looking at the selection on the cart twice except because of the big portions ill have mushrooms instead of asparagus murov said then looked at whelan and said we can rob from one anothers side dish then turned back to the waiter and added and bring another bottle of the egri bikaver the waiter repeated the order and then left you will recall i used the phrase touches on the incredible murov said when we began that was an understatement but go on whelan said what happened well all of this apparently pushed him over the edge he decided to punish her or maybe he did what he did consciously thinking that losing a wife who was a thief would be less damaging to his career than a wife who had kicked him out of the marital bed so he started to set up her and her brother on false embezzlement charges sounds like hes a really nice guy whelan said murov exhaled audibly again one does not get to be the berlin rezident of the svr without a very welldeveloped sense of how to cover ones back murov said i suppose that would also apply to the washington rezident of the svr murov ignored the comment he went on dmitri learned what was going on why didnt he go to his boss and say hey boss my sisters husband is trying to set me up heres the proof because his boss was his cousin colonel v n solomatin im sure vladlen would have believed him but solomatins superior wasisgeneral yakov sirinov who runs the svr for putin and sirinov was unlikely to believe either vladlen or dmitri for several reasons high among them that he believed dmitri was a personal threat to his own career the gossip at the time sirinov was given his position was that it would have gone to dmitri if dmitri and putin had not been at odds and also of course because vladlen and dmitri were cousins the odds are a hundred to one that i am being fed an incredible line of bullshit but my god what a plethora of details murov should have been a novelist either that or hes telling me the truth careful harry not for publication but youre really out of your league when dealing with the washington rezident of the svr so dmitri did what any man in his position would do the svr washington rezident for example murov looked at him shook his head smiled and said no what the washington rezident would have done in similar circumstances would have been to call frank lammelle and say something like frank my friend when i come out of mortons tonight have a car waiting for me this spys coming in from the cold dmitri didnt have that option he was in berlin his sister was in copenhagen and they were being watched by other svr officers they couldnt just get on a plane and come here but what they could do and did was contact the cia station chief in vienna and tell her that they were willing to defect and thought the best time and way to do that was to slip away from the festivities at the kunsthistorisches museum i dont understand whelan confessed what festivities where there was going to be a gathering in vienna of rezidents and other svr officers as a gesture of international friendship the hermitage museum in saint petersburg sent bartolomeo rastrellis wax statue of russian tsar peter the first on a tour of the better european museums first stop was viennas kunsthistorisches museum okay the cia station chief set things up the cia sent a plane to vienna with the plan that as soon as dmitri and svetlana got into it it would take off and eight hours later dmitri and svetlana would be in one of those safe houses the agency maintains not far from our dacha on the eastern shore here so far as general sirinov was concerned the business at the kunsthistorisches museum was going to provide him with two things first an opportunity to get all his people together without attracting too much attention second when everybody was gathered and people asked the whereabouts of colonel dmitri berezovsky and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva sirinov was going to tell them they were under arrest for embezzling funds of the russian federation and then put them on an aeroflot aircraft to moscow sirinov is that his name murov nodded he knew these two were going to defect murov nodded and here is where the plot thickens murov said there were cia agents waiting in viennas westbahnhof for dmitri and his sister and there were representatives of the svr waiting for them and they never showed up what happened to them it took general sirinov several days to find out there were two problems first the officer responsible for meeting them at the railway station the vienna rezident lieutenant colonel kiril demidov was found the next morning sitting in a taxicab outside the american embassy with the calling card of miss eleanor dillworth the cia station chief on his chest poor kiril had been garroted to death jesus christ whelan exclaimed and then the second problem was that general sirinov was naturally distracted by world events you will recall that your president somehow got the idea that the iranians were operating a biological warfare laboratory in the congo and rather than bring his suspicions to the united nations as he was clearly obligated to do instead launched a unilateral attack and brought the world dangerously close to a nuclear exchange do i let him get away with that what good would arguing with him do are you going to tell me what happened to colonel whatsisname and his sister that is the real question murov said eventually general sirinov learned that within hours of their scheduled arrival in vienna they were flown out of schwechat on lieutenant colonel carlos g castillos gulfstream airplane that was the last time anyone has seen them how did castillo get involved murov shrugged general sirinovs intention had been to present the arrest of dmitri and svetlana to putin as a fait accompli now he had to report that not only were they not under arrest but no one had any idea where they might be although of course the cia was presumed to be somehow involved putinwho as i said has known dmitri and svetlana for yearsthought there was something fishy about the embezzlement charges and ordered sirinov to have another look sirinov discovered evgenys little scheme putin was furious both personally and professionally what does that mean whelan asked in addition to his personal feelings about the injustice done to colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva putin knew that svr officers all over the world were thinking that could happen to me including you sergei well since im not an svr officer no but to answer what i think youre asking was the washington rezident thinking that what happened to two fine svr officers like berezovsky and alekseeva could happen to him i happen to know he was and putin knowing this ordered that things be made right if he could get through to berezovsky and alekseeva and get them to come home and they were promoted if the injustice done to them i get the point whelan said why am i starting to believe him so putin went to vladlen solomatin and told him what he wanted to do and that letter was written the problem then became how to get the letter to berezovsky and his sister the decision was madeby putin personallyto go right to the top so the washington rezident invited frank lammelle to our dacha on the eastern shoreyou know where i mean whelan nodded and explained the situation gave him the letter from solomatin and asked that he deliver it and made it clear that his cooperation in the matter would not be forgotten lammelle however said he was sorry but he didnt think he could help as much as he would like to then he related an incredible story castillo had had no authority to take berezovsky and alekseeva from vienna castillo had never been in the cia but had been in charge of a private ciacalled the office of organizational analysis ooathat your late president had been running ooa was disbanded and its members been ordered to disappear the day before you bombed the congo lammelle said he had no idea where castillo or berezovsky and alekseeva could be youre right thats incredible whelan said whats really incredible harry is that the rezident believed lammelle they had over the years developed a relationship in other words they might say no comment to one another but they would not lie to one another over time that has worked to their mutual advantage murov topped off their wineglasses thats why i asked you to dinner harry murov said to propose something i think will be mutually advantageous whelan said and what would that be harry whelan suspicious journalist asked as he put one hand on his wallet and the other on his crotch murov chuckled your wallet maybe harry but i am really not interested in your crotch would you like me to go on or should we just forget we ever had this conversation im all ears putin wants this problem resolved there is great pressure on the rezident to solve it he came to me and said he thought the greatest obstacle to solving it is president clendennen clendennen hes the obstacle hows that the rezident thinks the president just wants the problem to go away and he thinks the president believes the best way to do that is to do nothing his predecessor never told him a thing about the ooa he has no idea what it is or was hes never heard of lieutenant colonel castillo and therefore knows nothing of castillo taking two russian defectors away from the cia and if he did he has no idea why or what castillo has done with the defectors getting the idea yeah whelan said so what am i supposed to do about it start looking for castillo and the ooa at the white house ask clendennen to tell you about his secret private cia and the man who runs it for him when he tells you he knows nothing about it ask him why you cant find castillo tell him you suspect hes hiding castillo and that unless you can talk to castillo and get a denial from him thats the story youre going to write president denies knowledge of secret special operations organization and he says go ahead write it i dont know what youre talking about then what then you tell him that after you write it and he denies it youre going to write another story former cia station chief confirms that rogue special operator stole russian defectors from cia and that the only way youre not going to write the story is if castillo tells you its not true and who is this former cia station chief and why would he tell me this its a she her name is eleanor dillworth the day after kiril demidov was found in the taxicab outside the american embassy with dillworths calling card on his chest she was fired she feels she has been treated unfairly why should i believe her roscoe j danton does she went to him with this story hes now in buenos aires looking for castillo how do you know that the rezident there told me hes actually very good at what he does he wouldnt tell me that if it wasnt true its too easy to check out just for the sake of argument sergei say i believe you say i do all thisid start by talking to this dillworth womanwhats in it for me well harry it would be a hell of a story especially once we get colonel berezovsky and his sister out in the open if they told their story to you and only to you and of course i would be very grateful to you and so would the rezident that might be very useful in the future wouldnt you agree i can see that whelan said but i cant help but wonder why youre being so good to me because you are not only a very nice fellow harry but the most important journalist i know oh bullshit whelan said modestly but i probably am the most important journalist you know murov took his cell phone from the breast pocket of his suit opened it punched buttons and then put it on the table whats this whelan asked its what they call a cell phone harry whelan took a closer look and then picked it up the telephone was ready to call a party identified as dillworth e you said youd want to start by talking to miss dillworth murov said if i push the call button ill probably wind up talking to some female russian spy but what good would that do him he pushed the call button a female voice answered on the third buzz miss eleanor dillworth please may i ask whos calling my name is c harry whelan what can i do for you mr whelan do you know who i am miss dillworth if this is the talking head i see on wolf news yes i do miss dillworth im running down a story that a rogue special operator named castillo stole two russian defectors from you would you care to comment where did you hear that id rather not say just now miss dillworth but if this story is true its true id like to talk to you about it at some length okay when and where i have had too much of the egri bikaver its too late tonight but what about first thing in the morning would it be convenient for you to meet me at the old ebbitt grill do you know it what time half past eight see you there mr whelan how will i recognize you ill recognize you half past eight she hung up whelan closed the cell phone and handed it back to murov murov returned it to his jacket pocket and then put out his hand i presume we have a deal harry he asked whelan took the hand fortyfive minutes later sergei murov laid three onehundreddollar bills on the waiters leather check folder and told him to keep the change mind if i look at that whelan asked and picked up the bill they dont give that egri bikaver away do they he asked they dont give anything at all away murov said whelan slipped the check in his pocket and followed murov out of the restaurant one quarters macdill air force base tampa florida february the driveway of quarters one was empty as the chrysler town amp country minivan that general allan b naylor sr had chosen over a staff car for his official vehicle pulled into it the vehicle had of course come with a driver and naylor was traveling with his senior aidedecamp colonel j d brewer i wonder where the hell she is naylor said making obvious reference to his wife does she know youre here brewer replied who knows naylor said as he opened his door can i interest you in a drink i hate to drink alone allans here colonel brewer said pointing back to the street at a chevrolet suburban offers still good naylor said offer is accepted you can take off tommy naylor said to the driver ill see that colonel brewer gets home dont be late in the morning no sir i wont be good night sir good night colonel the two got out of the van and walked up the driveway and entered the house by the kitchen door major allan b naylor jr in khaki trousers and a flowered hawaiian shirt was sitting at the kitchen table holding a bottle of heineken beer well if it isnt the commanding officer of headquarters and headquarters company brewer said with all possible respect colonel sir go fuck yourself allan junior said when allan junior had been released from the hospital mostly recovered from mortar shell wounds suffered in afghanistan he had been placed on limited duty and assigned temporarily as executive officer of headquarters and headquarters company central command it was a housekeeping job and he hated it armor branch officer assignment had asked him where he would like to be assigned when he was taken off the limited duty roster he had requested hed said any of the following the th armored cavalry at fort irwin california where the blackhorse now served as the enemy in training maneuvers fort knox kentucky the cavalryarmor center or fort hood texas which always had at least one armored division when his orders had come ten days ago they had named him commanding officer of headquarters and headquarters company central command and informed him it was at least a twoyear assignment brewer was not really offended by allan juniors comment for one thing he had known the young officer since he was a kid in germany he thought of him as almost family and he really felt sorry for him if you dont watch your mouth major youre liable to find yourself an aidedecamp trust me thats a much worse assignment well jack you can go to hell too general naylor said and then asked allan wheres your mother she and my wife and my sister and all your grandchildren are in orlando at disney world i am under maternal orders to look after you general allan b naylor sr usa commanding general united states central command had four aidesdecampa colonel two lieutenant colonels and a captain they were his personal staff as opposed to his command staff at central command the latter was headed by general albert mcfadden usaf the deputy commander under general mcfadden were nine general officersfour army three air force and two marine corpsplus four navy flag officersone vice admiral two rear admirals upper half and one rear admiral lower half plus enough full colonels someone had figured out to fully staff a reinforced infantry platoon if the fortunes of war should make that necessary approximately onethird of these generals admirals and colonels was female all of general naylors personal staff were male despite what senator homer johns frequently saidand apparently believedgeneral naylors personal staff did not spend at god only knows what cost to the poor taxpayer their time catering to the generals personal needs polishing his insignia mixing his drinks shining his shoes carrying his luggage peeling his grapes and myriad other acts making him feel like the commander of a praetorian guard enjoying the especial favor of emperor caligula colonel j d brewer whose lapels had carried the crossed sabers of cavalry before he exchanged them for the insignia of an aidedecamp was in overall charge one of the lieutenant colonels dealt with general naylors relationship with central command the other dealt with general naylors relationship with washingtonthe pentagon the chief of staff congress and most importantly the white house the captain was in charge of getting the generalwhich meant not only naylor but those officers he needed to have at his side plus the important paperwork he had to have in his briefcasefrom where he was to where he had to be this involved scheduling the gulfstream arranging ground transportation and quarters and ensuring that naylor never lost communication with either macdill or washington jack brewer and his boss went back together a long time brewer had been a second lieutenant in the blackhorse on the east germanwest german border when naylor had been there as a major later brewer as a major had been the executive officer of a tank battalion in the first desert war he had been a promotable light colonel during the second desert war and now he was waiting more or less patiently to hear that his name had been sent to capitol hill for confirmation by the senate of his promotion to brigadier general it was said with a great deal of accuracy that brewers rapid rise through the ranks had been the result of the efficiency reports that naylor had written on him over the years following your mothers orders general naylor said you can start looking out for your old man by getting that bottle of macallan from the bar and fixing jack and me a drink the macallan allan junior asked what are we celebrating actually what were marking is almost the exact opposite of a celebration naylor said the telephone rang as allan junior was walking out of the kitchen to get the single malt he snatched its handset off the wall quarters one major naylor sir he listened then put his hand over the microphone and turned to his father its charley he said to his father referring to captain charles d seward iii his fathers junior aide he says that mr lammelle is having dinner with mr festerman and will spend the night with him rather than in the vip quarters he wants to know what you want him to do bruce l festerman was the liaison officer of the central intelligence agency to the united states central command naylor walked to his son and took the telephone receiver from him charley he ordered ask mr lammelle if it would be convenient for him to have you pick him up at half past eight in the morning if so drive him slowly to the office i want to be through with general mcnab before he gets there if that doesnt work call me back when naylor had returned the telephone to its cradle allan junior said the deputy director of the cia and scotty mcnab what the hells going on colonel brewer had wanted to ask the same questions first when lammelle had been waiting for him and general naylor at andrews air force base in washington and later at macdill when general naylor had walked into his office and even before he sat down had told sergeant major wes suggins to get general mcnab on the horn but he hadnt asked he knew naylor would tell him what he thought he should know when he thought he needed to know it brewers natural curiosityboth personal and professionalwas not to be satisfied now either i thought you were fetching the bottle of macallan general naylor said yes sir allan junior said coming right up sir the younger naylor returned with two bottles of scotch whiskythe single malt macallan and a bottle of blended johnnie walker red label general naylors father had taught himand he had taught his sonthat one never took two drinks of really superb scotch in a row one drank and savored the superb whisky a second drink of the superb would be a waste however as the alcohol had deadened the tongue to the point where it could not taste the difference between a superb scotch and an ordinary oneor even a bad one general naylor drank his macallan without saying a word when that was gone he poured a double of the johnnie walker added a couple of ice cubes to his glass moved the cubes around with his index finger and then looked up did either of you see that actorthe guy who usually has a big black mustachein the movie where he played eisenhower just before dday tom selleck brewer said countdown to dday something like that naylor said allan yeah i saw it good movie very accurate naylor said down to his chainsmoking those chesterfields my uncle tony who was at shaef said eisenhowers fingers were stained yellow from the cigarettes he took another swallow of his drink and his son and aide waited for him to go on there was a segment where one of his officers a twostar let his mouth run in a restaurant do you remember that his son and his aide nodded that was also quite accurately shown in the movie uncle tony knew all the players the officer was in his cups in a restaurant and came close to divulging when the crosschannel invasion would take place he was overheard and someone reported him eisenhower should have had the sonofabitch shot allan junior said instead they knocked rings and he walked he didnt even get thrown out of the army did you read that line in the bible that says something about judge not lest ye be judged general naylor said he was ikes roommate at the point what are you saying dad that if that general had gotten his commission from rotc andor wasnt ikes classmate that would have been different would you so callously order your roommate at west point shot under similar circumstances allan junior raised his eyebrows then said i thought about that when i saw the movie i dont know whether id have either one of them shot but i damn sure wouldnt let either one of them walk when that twostar put mens lives at risk letting his mouth run away with him he forfeited his right to be an officer he was reduced to colonel and sent home general naylor said and the men whose lives he put at risk were sent to the landing beaches of normandy this long gray line we march in dad isnt perfect and i dont think we should pretend it is allan junior turned to colonel brewer and started to say something stop right there allan brewer cut him off im not going to get in the middle of this i am now facing a somewhat similar personally distasteful situation general naylor said involving an officer who also marches in the long gray line and of whom im personally very fond his senior aidedecamp and his son looked at him waiting for him to continue if i have to say this this is highly classified and to go no further general naylor said classification top secret presidential which explains why mr lammelle is here brewer asked naylor nodded president clendennen this afternoon ordered me to locate lieutenant colonel c g castillo retired wherever he might be and to place him under arrest pending investigation of charges which may be laid against him under the uniform code of military justice what charges allen junior demanded mr lammelle was similarly ordered by the president this afternoon to accompany me wherever this mission might take us if when we find colonel castillo he has two russian defectors with him as he most probably does lammelle is to take them into custody it is president clendennens intention to return them to the russians what are the charges someones laying against charley allen junior demanded his father did not reply directly he instead said jack is thoroughly conversant with all the details of our strike on the congo how much do you know allan not very much beyond the russians and the iranians were operating a biological weapons lab and the previous potus decided that taking it out made more sense than taking the problem to the un if thats correct then i say hooray for him what was being made in that laboratory was a substance now known as congox it is highly dangerous to an almost unimaginable degree our leading expert on that sort of thing a colonel at our biological warfare operation at fort detrick told the previous potusto borrow your nomenclaturethat any accident at the congo laboratory would be infinitely more catastrophic than the nuclear meltdown at chernobyl was it is not hard to extrapolate from that what damage would result should this substance be used as a weapon against us it can be fairly said that the previous potus took action not a minute too soon then thank god he had the balls to do it allan junior said general naylor nodded sipped his scotch then said unfortunately the raidas massive as it wasapparently did not destroy all the congox two quantities of itpacked in what look like blue rubber beer barrelshave turned up one was sent to fort detrick by fedex from a nonexistent laboratory in miami a second was found on our side of the mexicanus border where the border patrol could not miss it colonel hamilton the expert at fort detrick has confirmed both barrels contained congox the next development was when the russian rezident in their washington embassy had lammelle to their compoundthey call it their dachain maryland there he as much admitted that they had sent the congox to fort detrick he then strongly implied that prime minister putin is personally determined to have the two russians returned to russia putin also it was implied holds castillo personally responsible for the deaths of several svr officers in various places around the world he wants colonel castillo too if this is done the russians will turn over to us all stocks of congox in their control and offer assurances that no more of it will ever turn up dad clendennens not actually thinking of caving in is he he cant possibly believe the russiansputin specificallywill live up to their promises the president has decided the most prudent course for him to follow is to turn the defectors over to the russians he said several times hes always held traitors in the utmost contempt and charley is he going to turn charley over too allan junior asked incredulously i cant believe that he would do so general naylor said did you ask him no i didnt ask him hes the president of the united states so what are you going to do follow my orders what are the charges theyre bringing against charley allen junior asked i dont know but youre going to arrest him anyway i dont like the tone of your voice and i dont like what im hearing here thats not really germane is it what im hearing is bullshit allan junior pursued thats quite enough allan starting with that top secret presidential classification allan junior went on information is classified to keep it from our enemies the russians know all about this this is classified to keep it off wolf news so that clendennen can cover his political ass i said enough tell me this dad what has charley done wrong exactly what article of the uniform code of military justice has he violated willful disobedience of a lawful order what order was that when he flew the defectors out of vienna to argentinawithout any authority to do soambassador montvale came to me and suggested the best way to deal with the problem was for me to send an officer from special operations commandcharley was then assigned to special operations command and thus subject to its ordersdown there and order him to turn the russians over to the cia officers montvale would have with him i did so i sent a colonel from special operations with ambassador montvale he ordered charley to turn the russians over to montvale charley refused to do so charley was then working for the president allan junior said he was not subordinate to special operations command your colonel had no authority to order him to do anything okay thats it allan i am not going to debate this with you allan junior stood up and said good evening colonel brewer its always a pleasure to see you sir he walked to the door where do you think youre going general naylor challenged im going to see if i can find charley and if i can im going to warn him about what youre trying to do to him major you have been advised that what you heard here tonight is classified top secret presidential general naylor said coldly angry so courtmartial me lets see how wolf news plays that story he walked out of the kitchen and slammed the door closed after him after a long moment general naylor said i dont think he knows where castillo is any more than we do i hope he doesnt in his frame of mind if he finds him he will tell him suggestions solicited i think you ought to keep him on a short leash until this is over particularly since i know the lieutenant colonel promotion board is sitting has sat and selected allan from below the zone i suspected that was why he was here when we got here he wanted to tell you get him back here jack naylor ordered brewer took a cell phone from his pocket and pushed an autodial button major naylor he said twenty seconds later this is colonel brewer general naylors compliments it is the generals desire that you attend him immediately acknowledge he pushed the off button major naylor is on his way sir dont you mean lieutenant colonel designate jack lieutenant colonel designate allan naylor jr returned to the kitchen of quarters one two minutes later he walked to where his father was sitting came to attention saluted and recited major naylor reporting to the commanding general as ordered general naylor glanced at colonel brewer then met his sons eyes major he said you are attached to my personal staff for an indefinite period you are not to communicate with lieutenant colonel castillo or anyone connected in any way to him in any way under any circumstances neither will you communicate in any way under any circumstances with any sort of media that is a direct order indicate that you understand and intend to comply with that order by saying yes sir yes sir you will proceed to your quarters and will remain there until you receive further orders from either myself or colonel brewer you will pack sufficient uniforms and civilian clothing to last for a period of seven days you will go into no further detail when discussing this with your wife or anyone else than that you will be accompanying me on official business the foregoing has been a direct order indicate that you understand and intend to comply with that order by saying yes sir yes sir you are dismissed yes sir major naylor saluted his father and when it was returned did an aboutface and marched out of the kitchen when general naylor heard the sound of allan juniors suburban starting he held up his glass in a toast and said congratulations on your promotion son youve made me very proud of you two west boulevard drive alexandria virginia february the convoy of four blackenedwindow secret service gmc yukons turned off west boulevard drive and drovenot without difficulty four inches of snow had fallen during the nightup the steep drive to the house four men in business suits quickly got out of the first vehicle in line and moved as swiftly as they could through the fresh snow and the drifts of previous snowfalls to the sides and rear of the house three mensupervisory special agent thomas mcguire special agent joshua foster and mason andrews the assistant secretary of the department of homeland securitygot out of the second yukon and made their wayagain not without difficulty the snowcovered walk was steepto the front door mcguire pushed the button for the doorbell chimes could be heard they waited a full minute nothing happened mcguire pushed the doorbell again and again there was no response from within the house mcguire took a cell phone from his pocket and punched an autodial number with whom am i speaking please he asked a moment later then he said mrs darby this is supervisory special agent mcguire of the united states secret service we are at your front door will you please open it to us he put the telephone back in his pocket and announced she said shell open the door as quickly as she can she damned well better mason andrews said brushing snow from his bald spot the door opened mrs julia darby stood there in her bathrobe another woman also in her bathrobe stood beside her to their side stood a man of obvious asian extraction the unknown woman in the bathrobe held a cell phone to her face and there was a flash mason andrews thought ill be goddamned she just took our picture hello tom mrs darby said im afraid youre wasting your time we gave at the office andrews stared at her what did she say mrs darby mcguire said holding out his credentials for her to see this is secret service agent foster and this is mr mason andrews the assistant secretary of homeland security hello im julia darby may we come in mason andrews asked i dont think so the asian man said the introduction of mr mcguires credentials implies this is somehow official business of the secret service the third circuit court of appeals has held that granting law enforcement officials access to a residence constitutes a waiver by the home owner of his or her rights against unlawful search and seizure we do not wish to waive those rights mason andrews thought who the fuck is this guy he demanded who are you my name is david w yung jr i am mrs darbys attorney and youre refusing to let us in that is correct twogun yung said unless you have a search warrant i am on behalf of my client denying you access to these premises were the secret service special agent foster announced so mr mcguire has said twogun said we are now going to close the door as all the cold is getting in the house well be back with a search warrant assistant secretary andrews announced as the door closed in his face i dont believe that assistant secretary andrews said in the front seat of the yukon he mopped at the melting snow on his bald spot with a handkerchief absolutely incredible we should have just pushed that little jap out of the way and grabbed darby unfortunately mr secretary the lawyer was right without a search warrant we have no right to enter those premises mcguire said well well get a goddamned search warrant where does one get a goddamned search warrant at he looked at his watch quarter after seven in the morning that may be difficult mr secretary mcguire said in order to get a search warrant you have to convince a judge that you have good and sufficient reason to believe that illegal activity is taking place on a certain premises or that a fugitive is evading due process of lawin other words arreston said premises goddamn it we know that darby is in there we know he entered the country in miami and flew here and your own goddamned agents reported they saw him entering that house what else do we need for christs sake sir we have no reason to believe that any activity violating federal law is taking place in the house and mr darby is not a fugitive no warrants have been issued for his arrest on any charge youre telling me theres not a goddamned thing we can do i dont believe this sir what i hoped would happen when we came here was that mrs darby or perhaps mr darby himselfweve been friends for yearswould invite us into the house and we could discuss the location of colonel castillo amicably if you want to i can have another shot at that jesus christ other than that sir i dont know what else to tell you just stand there in the door please mr secretary twogun yung said ten minutes later there were now two photographers inside the house the woman who had used the photographing capability of her cellular telephone earlier and a man now holding what looked like a professionalgrade video camera andrews stood in the door ready harold twogun asked lights action camera harold replied intentionally botching the sequence mr secretary please identify yourself and give us the date and time andrews complied now repeat after me please i make the following statement voluntarily and without mental reservation of any kind andrews did so i acknowledge that i have informed mrs julia darby that by allowing me and mr mcguire of the secret service into her home a compassionate gesture to get us out of the cold and snow she in no way gives up her rights against unlawful search and seizure as provided by the us constitution go slowly andrews interrupted i cant remember all that well try it again i acknowledge that i and further that anything said in conversation by anyone here today will not be used in any court of law for any purpose twogun finally concluded with some obvious effort andrews repeated that is that it counselor mrs darby then asked it will be as soon as harold sends a copy of that digital recording to that great file room in the sky twogun replied consider it done harold replied why dont we all go in the living room and have a cup of coffee while dianne makes breakfast julia darby suggested hello tom alex darby said putting out his hand long time no see how are you alex mcguire replied alex this is my boss assistant secretary of homeland security mason andrews how do you do darby said youre a hard man to find mr darby i guess that would depend on whos looking for me darby said a lot of people are looking for you including ambassador montvale whatever would make ambassador montvale look for me the president of the united states sent him to find you mr darby right now hes in ushuaia whatever for i mean why is he looking for me in ushuaia of all places oh tom julia darby said i was kidding you about that kidding him about what darby asked his wife i told him you were probably down there with your girlfriend julia said i never for a moment thought he would take me seriously especially the girlfriend part darby looked at mcguire yeah im a little long in the tooth for that sort of thing tom mason andrews said there is reason to believe that you know where colonel dmitri berezovsky lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva and lieutenant colonel carlos g castillo are as i think you know mr andrews darby replied colonel castillo was ordered by the presidentthe late president not mr clendennento fall off the face of the earth and never be seen again i believe that colonel castillo is obeying those orders youre telling me you dont know where he iswhere the russians are i didnt say that what i said was that i believe colonel castillo has obeyed the order from the president to disappear then you do know where he is where the russian defectors are i didnt say that either are you aware that its a felony mr darby to lie to or mislead a federal officer mr andrews a point of order twogun said one right now youre not a federal officer but rather simply someone whom mrs darby has compassionately allowed to warm himself in her house two if mr darby were ever to be interviewed by any federal officer he would on advice of counsel refuse to answer any questions put to him that either might tend to incriminate him or cause him to violate any of the several oaths he took as an officer of the clandestine service of the cia to never divulge in his lifetime anything he learned in the performance of those duties mason andrews looked between twogun and the darbys then announced i can see that im wasting my time here lets go mcguire but you havent had any breakfast julia darby said diannes making a spanish omelet and breakfast is the most important meal of the day twogun offered havent you heard that mr secretary andrews glared at him but didnt respond and one more thing mr andrews twogun said those secret service agents of yours who have been watching the house what about them the right of a governmental agency to surveille does not carry with it any right to trespass the next time i see one of them on this property im going to call the alexandria police and charge them with trespass and if they are indeed secret service agents since you and i have had this little chat that would constitute trespass after warning which is a felony andrews his face white marched toward the front door calling over his shoulder goddamn it mcguire i said lets go in the yukon andrews slammed the door shut and turned to mcguire as of this minute mcguire youre placed on administrative leave it is my intention to have you separated from the secret service and i think you know why i havent a clue mr secretary goddamn it whose side are you on anyway you enjoyed watching those bastards humiliate me mr secretary i took an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic i have done so to the best of my ability sending the director of national intelligence on a wildgoose chase to ushuaia is your idea of defending the constitution jesus h christ i told ambassador montvale that mrs darby said mr darby might be there thats all youd better be prepared to tell a grand jury that mrs darby did just that lying to or making a misrepresentation to a federal officer is a felony your pal is going to jail mcguire and if i can figure out some way to get you before a grand jury for lying to ambassador montvale i will oh come on andrews you know montvale almost as well as i do can you really imagine the great charles m getting up in a courtroom and testifying under oath that one of his underlings sent him on a wildgoose chase anywhere much less all the way to the bottom of the world and that doesnt even touch on the question of who he was looking for and why secretary andrews considered that for thirty seconds get out of the car you sonofabitch walk back to washington mcguire got out of the yukon but instead of walking back to washington he went to the door of the house rang the bell and when the lady of the house answered asked if there was any spanish omelet left to feed someone who had just lost his job three office of the commanding general united states army central command macdill air force base tampa florida february general general mcnab is here colonel j d brewer announced at naylors office door ask the general to come in please naylor said mcnab marched into the office stopped six feet from naylors desk raised his right hand to his temple and said good morning general thank you for receiving me mcnab was wearing what was officially the army service uniform but was commonly referred to as dress blues the breast of his tunic was heavy with ribbons and devices showing his military qualifications including a combat infantry badge topped with circled stars indicating that it was the sixth award a master parachutists wings seven other parachute wings from various foreign armies and the navy seal qualification badge commonly called the budweiser the three silver stars of a lieutenant general gleamed on his epaulets naylor was wearing a camouflagepatterned sandycolored baggy uniform called desert battle dress uniform on it was sewn the insignia of central command the legend us army a name tag reading naylor and attached with velcro to the button line of his jacket a strip with four embroidered black called subdued stars the insignia of his rank naylor took his time before returning the salute and after mcnab had dropped his hand took his time again before saying you may stand at ease general please take a seat thank you sir mcnab said as he settled into one of the two leather armchairs before the desk i trust the general is well just so we understand one another general there was an implication you made just now that you were invited here you were ordered here there is a difference i think you should keep in mind yes sir permission to speak general permission granted sir the general errs sir the general does not have the authority to issue orders to me naylor blurted thats what you think mcnab its what the chief of staff thinks general i telephoned him yesterday following your telephone call i thought perhaps my statusor your statushad changed and i hadnt been notified the chief of staff said there was no change in your status or mine we are both commanders of units directly subordinate to headquarters us army the only officer who can give orders to either of us is the chief of staff you called the chief of staff naylor asked incredulously yes sir and the chief suggested that a way out of this little dilemma would be for me to make a courtesy call on you which is what im doing now general naylor thought you sonofabitch mcnab went on i got a look at the lieutenant colonels promotion list on the way down here general and saw that allan has been selected below the zone may i offer my congratulations thank you how may i assist the general now that im here prefacing this by stating i am acting at the direct order of the president you can tell me where i can find lieutenant colonel carlos g castillo the chief of staff didnt mention that you were working for the president general perhaps he had reasons he did not elect to share with me are you questioning my word general no sir if the general tells me the general is working at the direct order of the president i will of course take the generals word where can i find castillo general i have no idea general you have no idea are you questioning my word general no good what can you tell me general about castillo naylor asked you mean about how the president wants to make a human sacrifice of him to the russians what did you say when i came here i held the naive hope that you were going to close the door and then say you may find this hard to believe but the president wants to turn our charley over to putin and what are we going to do about it how foolish of me you dont know that president clendennen intends to do that naylor said do you know he doesnt or didnt he tell you that murov told frank lammelle that putin wants the russians and charley how do you know about that mcnab met naylors eyes and said you dont really expect me to answer that do you allan after a long moment he added yeah now that i think about it i think you do what i do know general havent we played your silly little game long enough allan what silly game is that general you sitting there in that ridiculous desert costumeas if you expect the castros or hugo chavez to start dropping parachutists on tampa bay in the next ten minutespretending to be a soldier when all you are is a uniformed flunky carrying out the orderswhich you damned well know are illegalof a political hack who would turn his mother over to putin if he thought it would get him reelected you are speaking general of the president the commander in chief did you get it all or should i say it again what i should do is place you under arrest how did you get to be a fourstar generalnever mind i knowwithout learning you never should issue an orderor carry one outwithout considering what the secondary effects will be stand up and come to attention general naylor ordered mcnab crossed his legs shook his head and chuckled goddamn you naylor flared i said come to attention for example allan mcnab said calmly as he took a cigar case from an inside pocket one of the thoughts that occurred to me when i heard what the bastard was up to was to take him out i thought that through and realized that would cause more damage to the country than it would do good since we presently dont have a vice president the order of succession would put the speaker of the house in the oval office and from what ive seen hes as much an idiot as clendennen is anyway i took an oath to defend the constitution and unfortunately theres nothing in that that says you can shoot the president even if the bastard deserves it as this one clearly does mcnab youre out of your mind i also considered taking this story to that redheaded guy on wolf news whats his name oh yeah he paused as he bit the end off a long thin black cigar and then carefully lit it you cant smoke in here naylor said you cant smoke in any government building naylor stared at mcnab and thought hes sitting here calmly discussing the pros and cons of assassinating the president of the united states and im scolding him for smoking what the hell is the matter with me what i should do is push the button for the sergeant major and when he and jack brewer come in say i have placed general mcnab under arrest please escort the general to the visiting senior officers quarters and hold him there and then what do i do call the chief of staff and tell him tell him what mcnab has friends somebody who was there in the oval office when the president gave me this mission not only told him exactly what was said but lost no time in telling him is there a plot against the president is that what this is all about thats a credible possibility mcnab is entirely capable of being involved in something like a coup detat so do i go to the chief of staff with that or the president with what all i have is suspicions what i have to do is find out as much as i can from the sonofabitch mcnab blew a smoke ring i always have trouble with names mcnab said okay i got it his name is andy mcclarren and the show is called the straight scoop are you familiar with it naylor thought im not going to let him drag me into a discussion when it became evident that naylor wasnt going to reply mcnab went on you really should watch it allan they say its the most watched show on television you might learn something from it anyway as soon as i thought that through i realized that when the dust had settled all that that would accomplish would be congress considering impeaching the sonofabitch and that would tell the world what an idiot we have in the white house which wouldnt do the country any good and even if the impeachment went through which would take a lot of time all wed be doing is replacing one idiot with another so i decided to put andy mcclarren on the back burner i may have to go that route but id rather not so then what are your intentions general and i will be very surprised if you dont tell me them in sufficient detail to hang yourself you egotistical maniac well the first thing obviously is to find charley and see what he wants to do to see what he wants to do naylor blurted incredulously by now im sure charley knows people are looking for him and his girlfriend his girlfriend her name is svetlana they call her sweaty real beauty dark red hair built like a brick outdoor sanitary facility youve lost me mcnab what does this woman have to do with any of this shes one of the defectors putin wants back she was a light colonel in the svr the other onehe was a full birdis her brother and castillo is emotionally involved with her think romeo and juliet allan has he lost his mind his heart certainly his mind i dont think so if charley doesnt want to be found finding him is going to be difficult and if you think hes going to pop to attention salute and load himself and his girlfriend and her brother on an airplane en route to moscow think again hes a retired officer subject to recall hes also karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger a german national who owns a bunch of newspapers i wonder if our commander in chief had that in mind when he told you to go fetch him what is it the politicians say never get in an argument with somebody who buys ink by the barrel lets say that charley and the russians are in germany in his house in fulda eating knockwurst and drinking beer not a care in the world as charley karl is a german citizen and the russians have been granted political asylum by the german republic in exchange for their cooperation in certain intelligence matters is that what hes done naylor asked i dont know im sure hes considered it but i hope he doesnt have to that would really piss putin off and there would be bodies all over the place as putins svr assassins tried to whack charleys girlfriend and her brother for traitorously spilling the beans about the svr to the krauts and charleys pals took them out several of charleys pals as im sure you heard are very good at taking out officers of the svr and you dont think putin knows these russians told us about the biowarfare laboratory in the congo naylor exploded dont you think putin considers that a traitorous act mcnab took a moment to form his reply then said one president putin stood in the well of the un you will recall and told the whole world the russians knew nothing absolutely nothing about the socalled fish farm two as the cia has never had the russians under their benevolent control the russians have not spilled the beans about the fish farm to us either how could they the russians knew absolutely nothing about it they know the russians told us thats why they want them back thats why they want charley too thats what this whole thing is all about thats why i want to ask charley what he wants to do about all this maybe hes got some ideas hes always been very resourceful allan you know that what makes you think you can find him that will take me a couple of days first i have to find someone who knows and who trusts me i can think of several people who are in that category naylor thought what i should do now mcnab is tell the president that you know how to get in contact with castillo and have the president order you to find him naylor said general since you tell me that you believe you know how to locate colonel castillo and the russian defectors i feel dutybound to inform the president of that fact if you did that allan this whole sordid story would be on the straight scoop withwhats his name againwith andy mcclarren tonight you could be held incommunicado that would last only until andy mcclarren or c harry whelan jr heard about it and they would and ordered not to discuss this with the press or anyone else you are not immune to the provisions of the uniform code of military justice general and it would behoove you to keep that in mind we took an oaththe day we threw our hats in the air so long agoto obey the lawful orders of officers appointed over us i cant understand how you think an order making a human sacrifice of a fellow officer can possibly be considered legal perhaps a general courtmartial would determine that mcnab stood up he said well its been a pleasure talking to you general well have to do this more often i didnt give you permission to leave general mcnab ignored him he said what im going to do is go find charley and see what he wants to do you do what you want allan but if youre smart youll mark time until i get back to you which reminds me im going to leave a gsfifteen civilian with you his name is vic dallessando and before he was a gsfifteen he was a cwofive and before that he was a sergeant major some people think hes associated with gray fox but i cant comment on that asas im sure you knoweverything connected with gray fox is classified vic has a radio which will allow him to stay in touch with me no matter where i am i will keep him posted on how im doing in finding charley and he will tell you vic will also keep me posted on your location and if you leave macdill or lammelle does before i tell you that you can plan athats telling andy mcclarrenwill kick in i dont think you want that to happen you think you can sit in my office and tell me what to do goddamn you mcnab of course not but what i can do is tell you whats going to happen if you elect to do certain things and in that regard if vic dallessando suddenly becomes not available to me or other people on that net plan amcclarrenwill automatically kick in mcnab put on his green beret popped to attention and saluted he did not wait for naylor to return it but immediately did an aboutface movement and marched out of his office naylor knew that franklin lammelle the deputy director of the cia was in his outer office when he heard mcnab say well hello frank whatever brings you to beautiful tampa bay the automatic door closer shut off any reply lammelle might have made the door opened thirty seconds later and colonel jack brewer put his head in general mr lammelle is here ask him to come in please naylor said and major naylor and a man from global communications who says he has an appointment ask them to wait but you come in please colonel naylor got up from behind his desk and met lammelle as he came through the door good morning general lammelle said can i ask what scotty mcnab was doing here is he going to be working with us i hope on this actually mr lammelle ive just about decided i made a terrible mistake visavis general mcnab excuse me what i am now convinced i should have done was place him under arrest excuse me let me tell you what just happened and then you tell me what you think i should have doneshould doabout it five minutes later frank lammelle said general im in no position to comment upon much less judge your differences with general mcnab visavis insubordination that sort of thing butand you may not like hearing thisit looks to me that instead of being a problem mcnab may be the answer to ours i dont see that naylor said our problem is that we have been charged with locating colonel castillo and through him to take control of the two russians and we dont know where any of them are a subparagraph of facts bearing on the problem there it seems to me naylor said would be how to transport the russian defectors andor castillo from where we find them to where they have to go or words to that effect and where do they go to add that factor castillo lammelle replied is going to have to be transported to either washington or perhaps some military base in the united states the russians only have to be transported someplace where they can be turned over to the svr i think that will probably mean that well have to transport them to some place served by aeroflot we turn them over at the airport to officers of the svr who will then repatriate them naylor glanced at colonel jack brewer then looked at lammelle and said and how are we going to do that am i supposed to take soldiers with me soldiers for that sort of thing come from special operations the delta force or gray fox which of course are commanded by general mcnab general since eight oclock this morning a gulfstream v has been sitting at saint petersburgclearwater international it is registered to a cia asseta chickenpacking company in des moines iowa i was amazed to learn how much chicken the united states exports anyway the plane will attract no undue attention the crew are cia the aircraft is equipped with the very latestand i mean the very latestavionics that the afc corporation has for sale all sorts of bells and whistles communication with that airplane and langley is available wherever that airplane ison the ground or in the air anywhere in the world that airplane is going to follow you and me no matter where general mcnab leads us there are four clandestine service officers aboard once we lay eyes on colonel castillo and the russians transporting them wherever they have to go will pose no problems at all what if they resist colonel brewer asked the officers are equipped with the very latest nonlethal weaponryand the other kind as well of course what the nonlethal weaponry provides in a pistol about the size of a glock are six darts with a range of about fifty feet anyone struck with one of these darts will lose consciousness in fifteen seconds or less they will regain consciousness without intervention in about two hours they can be brought back immediately by injection fascinating general naylor said then if i understand you mr lammelle it is your recommendation that we sit tight and do nothing while we wait for general mcnab to find castillo and the russians that is my recommendation general naylor looked at his aidedecamp and said you see anything wrong with that jack colonel jack brewer said no sir it makes a lot of sense to me and what about the man mcnab left here naylor asked hes very good lammelle said ive known vic dallessando for a long time hes been around delta force and gray fox for years which tends to suggest that his greatest loyalty may be to general mcnab general naylor said well i suggest we treat him with respect and as a member of the team lammelle said he stopped and opened his briefcase and if he shows any suggestion of being about to interfere with our mission general he paused and took from the briefcase what looked like a glock semiautomatic pistol with a grossly swollen slide he aimed it at a leather couch and pulled the trigger there was an almost inaudible psssst sound in fifteen seconds or less general your couch will be sound asleep i will be damned naylor said and went to the couch found the dart and pulled it free he held it up for a better look and then held it against his pinkie finger it was about as long and perhaps half as thick amazing general naylor said then looked at brewer can you think of anything else jack yes sir brewer said lieutenant colonel designate naylor what about him lammelle asked naylor told him just to be sure general lammelle then said i suggest you maintain the current close personal supervision im frankly uncomfortable taking into consideration what youve told me with the thought of leaving him here when we go off wherever were going theres no telling i agree where we go allan junior goes general naylor said may i see that dart general colonel brewer asked naylor handed it to him one the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february assistant secretary of homeland security mason andrews was more than a little nervous when he entered the presidents study with frederick p palmer the united states attorney general he was fully aware that he was the assistant secretary of homeland security and that the secretary should be dealing with the president on this matter andrews had the previous evening telephoned the secretary who was in chicago brought her up to speed and asked her for direction she had agreed with him that it was a very delicate area and that proceeding carefully was obviously necessary she said shed like to sleep on the problem and that he should call her back in the morning say at about nine before his ninethirty appointment with the president when he had done so he had been informed that the secretary was not available at the moment somethingnot specified but importanthad come up and the secretary simply was not available mr andrews then had had an unkind thought that bitch is covering her fat ass by staying out of the line of fire again but fully aware that one does not make an appointment on an urgent matter with the president of the united states and then break it he was in the outer office at ninetwenty with the veryreluctanttobethere attorney general it had been necessary to tell the attorney general that if the ag couldnt find time in his schedule for the meeting he would tell the president just that all right andrews president clendennen greeted them make it quick mr darby has been located mr president andrews announced ambassador montvale was told to keep me posted why am i hearing this from you sir i dont believe ambassador montvale knows about this im confused i dont like to be confused why dont you start at the goddamn beginning andrews maybe that way yes mr president sir at half past four yesterday immigration in response to the ldnd order notified the secret service that mr darby had entered the united states in response to the what the president interrupted the ldnd order that means locate do not detain and that means when the subject of an ldnd order is located by any agency that agency notifies the agency that issued the orderin this case the secret servicewhere and under what circumstances the subject was located in this case as i said immigration yesterday afternoon notified the secret service that alexander darby had arrived in miami on a flight from panama cut to the chase andrews and what did darby have to say about castillo and the russians nothing sir he was arrested right hes in custody no sir youre telling me the immigration people had this guy and then he got away my god sir there never has been a warrant out on mr darbyjust the ldnd order whats the point in locating somebody and then not arresting him sir even if there is an arrest warrant the attorney general explained and in this case no warrant has been issued its sometimes useful to see where the subject goes and to whom he talks well where did darby go and who did he talk to he flew here sir into reagan national andrews said by that time the secret service was on him and they followed him to a residence at west boulevard drive in alexandria that site sir was already under secret service surveillance it has been since the ldnd order was issued it is owned by colonel castillo dont tell me castillo has been there right under the nose of the secret service all the time no sir we dont believe that he is so when you finally found out where this darby character is and who he was talking to what did he say when you asked him where castillo and the russians are what happened at that point andrews began was that supervisory special agent mcguire i know tom the president interrupted good man if its the same guy used to be on the presidential protection detail right yes sir thats the man sir mcguire notified me about darbys location and first thing this morning a minute or two after seven i was at the door he notified you last night why didnt you go over there last night the president demanded it was after midnight mr president so what perhaps youre right mr president i deferred to mr mcguires judgment now i realize that was probably a mistake too okay so there you werewas mcguire with you yes sir at the door of this house at seven in the morning then what happened at first mr president they wouldnt even let us in they had a lawyer a japanese gentleman who said his name was yung sir the attorney general interjected i think there is a very good chance that this lawyer is a former fbi special agent named david w yung jr who is also under a ldnd order and hes of chinese not japanese ancestry why are we looking for this exfbi agentslashlawyer of some kind of oriental ancestry the president interrupted and whats that got to do with anything he was one of castillos men in ooa mr president the attorney general said so what happened at the door the president asked we identified ourselves and asked if we could come in yung said not without a search warrant he also said that if they did let us in it would constitute a waiver of the owners rights against unlawful search and they werent going to do that it has to be yung the attorney general thought aloud an fbi agent lawyer or not would know about that decision of the third circuit court of appeals so you didnt get in then what the president said we got in sir andrews said after i promised that i understood we were being admitted only as a compassionate gesture on the part of mrs darby to get us out of the snow and the cold and that she had not waived any of her rights visavis unlawful search and seizure and they filmed us acknowledging that sir they filmed you the president asked incredulously yes sir there was another man there with what looked to me like a professional movie camera and then jesus christ cut to the goddamned chase mr darby was in the kitchen sir andrews said and did you ask him if he knew where colonel castillo and the two russians are and if you did what did he say he was evasive sir and the lawyer said that if mr darby found himself being interrogated by a federal officer he would advise him as his lawyer not to answer any questions the answers to which might tend to either incriminate him or cause him to violate the cia secrecy laws which forbid him to ever disclose anything he learned while he was an officer of the clandestine service mr president im afraid were not going to learn much from mr darby the attorney general said i was beginning to suspect that the president said thickly sarcastic there is one thing we can do mr president andrews said whats that we can squeeze mrs darby when she told mcguire her husband was in ushuaia with his girlfriend information on which ambassador montvale based his decision to go to ushuaia she had invited mcguire into her home she had waived her rights when she did so giving false information to a federal officer is a felony the president considered that a long moment then he picked up his telephone and said come in here a secretary and a secret service agent appeared almost immediately are we in touch with ambassador montvale yes sir the secret service agent said hes in ushuaia argentina theres a communications radio in his gulfstream iii send the ambassador a message please the president said mr darby is in alexandria virginia you can come home now repeat now yes sir the secretary said is that all of it mr president thats all of it get that right out please yes mr president the secret service agent said when they had left closing the door behind them the president turned to mason andrews you heard that andrews yes sir if you think when the ambassador gets back here that wolf news is going to take a picture of him in a courtroom with his hand on a bible swearing before god and the world that hemy director of national intelligencewent halfway around the world on my orders as commander in chief on the word of a housewife having her little joke at our expense youre even more incredibly stupid than you showed you were this morning andrews now get the fuck out of the goddamned oval office and never come back two february word had quickly spread among the inner circle of white house functionaries that president clendennens current rage was one that would go down in history so it was with a certain trepidation that white house press secretary john david jack parker stood at the door of the presidents study and waited for permission to enter it was almost a minute in coming but finally president clendennen signaled with his fingers for parker to enter and what bad news are you bringing porky clendennen asked im afraid its not good news mr president why doesnt that surprise me clendennen asked rhetorically are you aware of what happened in here this morning no sir i understand the attorney general and assistant secretary andrews asked for an appointment but you know where ambassador montvale is in argentina the stupid sonofabitch director of national intelligence my ass his title should be director of national stupidity hed damned well better be on his way back here im afraid mr president that i dont understand the president related what had transpired earlier in his office ending his narration with a question how would you describe porky ambassador stupid standing up in court with wolf news filming him and swearing on a bible that he went to some goddamn place i cant pronounce in argentina on my orders looking for a man who was just across the potomac in alexandria parker took a deep breath before replying sir i would describe that as a public relations disaster youre goddamn right it would be but what could be worse than that excuse me sir how about some press sonofabitchc harry whelan jr for exampleasking ambassador stupid why he was looking for this darby guy in the first place that would be worse porky and ambassador stupid would be stupid enough to tell him speaking of mr whelan sir dare i hope hes been run over by a truck mr whelan came to see me just now sir close your mouth and put your hand on your wallet porky im afraid to ask why sir mr whelan said he was about to publish this and wanted to give us a chance to correct any errors he might have made before he did parker handed the president a sheet of paper clendennen snatched it and read by c harry whelan jr copyright worldwide rights reserved slug white house launched strike on iranian biological warfare factory in congo based on information from russian defectors in hands of secret possibly illegal private cia controlled by president washingtoninsert date this reporter has learned that the strike on the alleged iranian biological warfare laboratory in the congo was based solely on information gathered by a supersecret intelligence agency reporting directly to the president the organization hidden inside the department of homeland security and called the office of organizational analysis was headed by a legendary army special forces officer lieutenant colonel c g castillo and staffed with personnel some described by intelligence insiders as unsavory from the cia the fbi and the armed forces the organization apparently operated without congressional oversight did not answer to the director of national intelligence nor maintain liaison with other intelligence agencies and was apparently funded by the presidents confidential funds when it appeared to the ooa that the cia was about to bungle their attempt to cause the defection of two very senior russian svr officers in austria the ooa snatched the russians from the cia in vienna and took them to an undisclosed location outside the united states president clendennen break more to follow sonofabitch the president said hed said it twice while reading the story and a third time now that hed finished jack parker announced he says mr president that he will give us seventytwo hours to respond sonofabitch the president said again porky the way this goddamn thing is written it sounds as if im responsible it doesnt even mention my predecessor goddamn him to hell parker who wondered if the president was calling the wrath of the almighty upon the head of his predecessor or on that of mr whelan did not reply the president said nothing for sixty seconds during which time the contortions of his face and the somewhat angry tapping of his fingers on his desk suggested he was deep in thought deny it porky he said finally tell the sonofabitch to publish anything he wants well just deny everything i didnt know a goddamn thing about the ooa or castillo until ambassador stupid walked into the oval office the day after my predecessor that sonofabitch dropped dead just deny any knowledge whats he going to do ask castillo for christs sake mr president i dont think that will work parker said why not parker handed him another sheet of paper mr whelan said he thought you might what he said sir was that our trying to stonewall wouldnt bother him at all that it was always a better story when you can prove the white house lied he said it was only because of his admiration for you that he was giving you the chance to see what hes going to write so it wouldnt come as a sucker punch and so far as asking colonel castillo is concerned mr whelan says the only way to keep him from publishing would be for colonel castillo personally to convince him he had his facts wrong i had the impression sir that he thinks we have colonel castillo and are hiding him someplace where the press cant get to him as clendennen looked at the sheet parker added then he gave me that which he says he will publish if we deny any of the facts in the first story sonofabitch clendennen said again as he read by c harry whelan jr copyright worldwide rights reserved slug former cia station chief in vienna confirms presidential cia stole two vip russian defectors from her says it cost her her job washingtoninsert date eleanor dillworth a twentynineyear veteran of the cias clandestine service has told this reporter that the office of organizational analysisthe supersecret possibly illegal intelligence organization operating out of the white house and answering only to the presidentdid in fact make off with two very senior russian intelligence officers and took them to an unknown destination hours before they were to board a cia aircraft sent to vienna austria to fly them to the united states dillworth told this reporterbreak more to follow cant we shut this dillworth broad up the president asked why is she determined to embarrass my administration sir i believe she thinks she was unfairly treated after castillo stole the russians from under her nose she was relieved of her duties in vienna and brought back to langley jesus christ didnt it occur to her that if she allowed castillo to steal the russians from her that thats proof she wasnt doing her fucking job the president reached for the red telephone on his desk get me jack powell he ordered then slammed the handset back in the cradle the protocol dealing with telephone calls between the president and those on the priority listof whom john powell the director of the central intelligence agency was onerequired the person called to be availablein other words be on the linewithin sixty seconds thirtytwo seconds after the president had slammed the handset into its cradle a blue lightemitting diode on the cradle began to flash the president grabbed the handset and began the conversation by asking why the hell did you fire this dillworth woman then he pushed the loudspeaker button on the cradle so that parker could hear the conversation youre speaking of eleanor dillworth mr president the dci asked the one with twentynine years in the clandestine service used to be our head spy in vienna that one she wasnt fired mr president thats not what she told c harry whelan jr she also told him that our friend castillo stole the russians from under her nose unless i can somehow talk him out of it whelans going to publish that in i dont know how goddamn many hundred newspapers and chat about it on wolf news thats going to make her and the cia look pretty foolish wouldnt you say mr president miss dillworth has not been fired what happened was that it was decidedafter they found the dead russian in a taxicab outside our embassy and when the cia looks pretty foolish this administration looks pretty foolish wouldnt you say the decision was made to get miss dillworth out of vienna to avoid undue press attention there the last i heard austrians cant vote in our elections who the hell cares about viennese newspapers perhaps that decision was illadvised mr president who made it ambassador stupid youve heard about that ambassador stupid is in that town with the funny name at the bottom of argentina looking for this guy darby who is in alexandria yes mr president that has been brought to my attention i asked you who made the decision to fire this female i did mr president at the time at the time it was a stupid decision well how are we going to shut this woman up mr president i just dont see how thats possible so what do we do mr president there is some good news actually i was just about to call you when you called me lets have the good news god knows we need some i just got off the phone with frank lammelle sir he said that general naylor has sent general mcnab to find castillo where did he send him nome alaska i dont think weve looked there yet or in timbuktu i believe general mcnab went to south america sir havent we already looked there sir colonel castillo spent most of his career working for general mcnab they have a close personal relationship its possible that castillo would turn over the russians to mcnab that raises a presumption and a question were presuming that mcnab can find castillo and if he does what if castillo tells him to go fuck himself he already told ambassador stupid and the colonel naylor sent down there with him to do that as far as presuming that general mcnab can find castillo sir i think we can safely do that people with knowledge of castillos location who would not tell anyone else would tell general mcnab because of their close relationship i wonder and after general mcnab locates castillo there is a plan b in case castillo remains intractable which is lammelle and i feel mr president that once castillo knows he has been found he would agree to a facetoface meeting with mcnab and lammelle to see if some accommodation could be reached he knows he cant remain on the run forever what do you think he wants that were prepared to give him that doesnt matter sir what were trying to do is arrange the meeting general naylor general mcnab meeting at a place of castillos choice a place he will feel is safe and what will that accomplish the place will not be as safe as castillo thinks how are you going to arrange that at this moment there is an agency airplanea gulfstream vsitting at saint petersburgclearwater international on it are four officers of the clandestine service when the meeting is set up and lammelle and naylor go to meet him the airplane will follow them anywhere in the world that sounds too simple clendennen said after a moment it presumes that castillo wont suspect the cia would try something like that and from what ive seen of the sonofabitch whenever he gets in a battle of wits with the cia you lose what we think will happen is this mr president we believe castillo will announce that he will be at a certain location probably in argentina he will not be there his people will be they will search general naylor and mr lammelle in mr lammelles briefcase skillfully concealed they will find the very latest version of an afc corporation gps transmitter it permits the tracking of a target within six feet anywhere in the world they will naturally confiscate it before lammelle and the general are permitted to get back on the airplane to go to where castillo will actually meet them leaving the four spooks on your airplane where prepared to follow lammelle and naylor to wherever the chase leads them there is a second gps transmitter concealed in the heel of lammelles shoe and when he actually sees castillo and hopefully the russians he will stamp his foot three times in rapid succession which will cause the transmitter to send a signal that will mean weve found him come and get him that sounds like something you saw in a bad spy movie the president said and what happens then castillo says okay you got us and he and the russians get on the airplane bullshit the clandestine service officers are armed with a weapon that fires a dart that causes the target within fifteen seconds to fall into a harmless sleep lasting between two and three hours and then they are taken where to the nearest airport served by aeroflot mr president all that has to be done is for us to tell mr sergei murov where they are he will arrange for the repatriation of the russians and the expatriation of castillo the president said does that bother you jack ive given that some thought mr president frankly i dont like it but if colonel castillo is the price the russians want for their congox i dont see where you have much of a choice i have even come to think that castillo would understand why you were forced to that conclusion well jack you know what harry truman said the buck stops here i have to do what i think is best for the country yes sir i have serious doubts about this plan of yours jack but right now i dont see we have much choice but to go forward with it when does lammelle say well hear something from general mcnab he didnt sir i would guess within seventytwo hours one way or the other ambassador stupid will be back from argentina a lot sooner than seventytwo hours maybe hell have some ideas as unlikely as that sounds yes sir not to go any further jack but as soon as i can figure out how to get rid of him quietly montvales going to have to go that job will be open you get castillo and the russians on that aeroflot airplane and its yours im sure that was another very difficult decision for you to make mr president and i would be honored to take over if you decide thats what should be done let me know of any developments jack any and then the president hung up three level four biolab two us army medical research institute fort detrick maryland february the senior scientific officer of the us army medical research institutecolonel j porter hamilton bs usma md harvard medical school phd molecular physics mit phd biological chemistry oxford and his principal assistantmaster sergeant kevin dennis usa certificate of high school equivalency for veterans our lady of mount carmel high school baltimore maryland were both attired in the very latest level four chemical biological hazardous material protective gear it was constructed of a multilayer silvercolored fabric completely enclosing their bodies the helmet of the garment had a large glass plate so they could see pretty well and was equipped with a communications system that when activated provided automatic video and audio recording of whatever they said and whatever they were looking at it also provided access to both the biolab two and fort detrick switchboards anda modification personally installed by colonel hamilton assisted by master sergeant dennisencrypted communication with an underground laboratory at the afc corporation in las vegas nevada finally there was provision for colonel hamilton and master sergeant dennis to communicate with each other privately no one could hear what they were saying and it was not recorded each suit was connected by two twelveinchdiameter telescoping hoses on their backs to equipment which provided purified air under pressure to the suits and also purified the used air when it flowed out of the suits colonel hamilton had more than once commented that when he looked at kevin dennis suited up he thought he looked as if they were in a science fiction movie and would not have been at all surprised if bruce willis joined them to help in the slaying of an extraterrestrial monster there was all sorts of equipment in the laboratory including an electron microscope which displayed what it was examining on as many as five fiftyfourinch monitors colonel hamilton placed the communication function of the helmet on inter only and then asked visavis what was on the left of the five monitors opinion kevin colonel that shits as dead as a doornail let us not leap kevin to any conclusions that if erroneous might quite literally prove disastrous okay but that shits as dead as a doornail what are we looking at master sergeant dennis consulted a clipboard that was attached through the suit to the sixinch stump that was all that remained of his right arm batch two one seven decimal five and what have we done to this colonel hamilton inquired the same thing weve done to two one seven decimals one through four which is fifteen minutes of the helium at minus twoseventy celsius minus two hundred seventy degrees celsius is minus four hundred fiftytwo degrees fahrenheit to find a lower temperature it is necessary to go into deep space present temperature of substance plus twentyone decimal one one one one celsius or plus seventy fahrenheit and it has been at this temperature for how long a period of time twentyfour hours sixteen minutes what was the length of thawing time exposed to plus twentyone decimal one one one one celsius it was brought up from minus two hundred seventy celsius in eight hours and twelve minutes with what indications of chemical or biological activity during any part of the thawing process none nada zip sergeant dennis i am forced to concur that shit is as dead as a doornail and sos all of batch two one seven you give congox fifteen minutes of the helium at minus two hundred seventy celsius and its dead it would appear so who are you going to tell colonel i have been considering that question as a matter of fact why are you asking i dont like what aloysius told us theyre trying to do to colonel castillo frankly neither do i but we are soldiers kevin sworn to obey the orders of officers appointed over us but what ive been wondering colonel is what happens if we tell the cia and somehow it gets out either we tell the russians fuck you we learned how to kill this shit or they find out on their own frankly kevin i dont understand the question two things we dont know one how much congox the russians have true and two we dont know if they know how to kill it but lets say they do know that helium at near absolute zero kills it you know how much we had to pay for the last helium we bought i entrust the details of logistics to my trusted principal assistant hamilton said a little over fifteen bucks a liter you know how many liters it took to kill batch twoseventeen i dont think kevin that cost is of much consequence in the current situation eleven liters to freeze about a half a kilo call it a hundred and sixty bucks and that was freezing decimal two kilos at a time i havent a clue how much helium it would take to freeze just one beer keg full of congox but a bunch i am not following your line of thought kevin i had to go to four different lab supply places to get the last shipment not one of them could ship us one hundred liters which is what i was trying to buy theres not much of a demand for it out there so theres not a lot of it around and we dont have the capability of making large amounts of it or of transporting it once its been liquefied the russians know this if they hear we know how to kill congox theyre liable to use it on uswhether or not the president gives them castillo and the russiansbefore we can make enough helium to protect ourselves we dont know how much congox they have hamilton said we have to find out colonel and id rather have castillo try to find out than the cia but is that decision ours to make kevin well its not mine colonel and im glad im not in your shoes colonel hamilton tapped his silvergloved fingertips together for perhaps thirty seconds kevin there is a military axiom that the worst action to take is none at all if you dont try to control a situation your enemy certainly will thats a little over my head colonel switch your commo to the casey network colonel hamilton ordered four so whats new by you jack aloysius francis casey phd mit asked ten seconds later of colonel j porter hamilton phd mit addressing him by his very rarely used intimate nickname the massachusetts institute of technology had brought together casey and hamilton although they had not known each other at the school or even been there at the same time they had met at a seminar for geopolitical interdependence conducted by that institution for distinguished alumni by invitation only both had accepted the invitation because it had sounded interesting and both had fled after the second hour and met in a harvard square bar by chance selecting adjacent bar stools dr casey had begun the conversationand their friendshipby asking two questions you were in there right and then after dr hamilton in mufti nodded you think that moron actually believed that bullshit he was spouting dr hamilton had been wondering the same thing and said so i have been wondering just that aloysius casey casey had said putting out his hand my name is hamilton dr hamilton replied and then having made the splitsecond decision that if casey were one of the distinguished alumni he would have said im dr casey and not wanting to hurt the feelings of the maintenance workerticket takersecurity officer or whatever he was by referring to himself with that honorific finished jack hamilton he hadnt used jack in many years he still had many painful memories of his plebe year at west point during which he had been dubbed jack hammer by upperclassmen if he was a bona fide jack hammer the upperclassmen had told him he would do fifty pushups in half the time this fifty had taken him this was usually followed by try it again jack hammer hey casey had said grabbing the bartenders arm give my pal jack another of what hes having and ill have another boilermaker when the drinks were served casey touched glasses and offered a toast may the winds of fortune sail you may you sail a gentle sea may it always be the other guy who says this drinks on me in that case i insist hamilton had said you can get the next one jack casey had replied three drinks later jack asked aloysius what his role in the seminar for geopolitical interdependence had been well i went there of course and every once in a while i slip them a few bucksyou know payback for what i gotand that gets me on the invitation list and every once in a while im dumb enough to accept what about you jack what do you do im a soldier no shit me too or i was i was a commo sergeant on a special forces ateam what branch originally infantry now medical corps no shit im impressed what do you do im involved in biological research what about you i try to move data around i make stuff that does at that point colonel hamilton experienced an epiphany the afc corporation youre that aloysius francis casey guilty my lab is full of your equipment hows it doing i couldnt function without it colonel hamilton said i cant tell you how pleased i am weve met a week later colonel hamilton had visited the afc laboratories in las vegas in the course of explaining how he used afc data equipment in his fort detrick laboratory and what kind of capabilities in that area he would like to have if that was possible he of course had to get into some of the specifics of the work of his laboratory three weeks after that while in las vegas to view the prototypes of the equipment casey was developing for him hamilton was introduced to some of caseys las vegas friends he quickly came to think of them as those people in las vegas and then gradually he came to understand that he had become one of them aloysius i dont want those people to hear this conversation ouch you know the rules jack what one knows everybody knows thats the way it works then i cant talk to you goodbye aloysius and tell those people goodbye too hamilton out colonel hamilton then signaled to sergeant dennis that they were leaving the sealed laboratory the process took ten minutes and included both chemical and purified water showers and then fresh clothing when they came through the final airtight door four people were waiting for themtwo women and two men all cleared for top secret biolab hamilton knew that at least one of them possibly two were reporting to the cia and he strongly suspected that one of them was reporting to the russians either through an intermediary or directly to the russian rezident and he thought it entirely likely that one or more of them was on the payroll of those people in las vegas he was greatly frustrated that neither he nor kevin dennisalthough they had set many trapshad been able to positively identify even one of them so they lived with the problem following the adage that a devil one knows is better than a devil one does not there have been some indications that we are making some progress colonel hamilton announced to them and some disturbing signs that we are yet again on a path leading nowhere we wont know more until tomorrow morning make sure everything is secure and then you may leave please be on time in the morning we have a busy schedule tomorrow when they had gone kevin dennis asked what is aloysius going to do colonel i really dont know kevin but i cant take the risk that what i want to say to him will go any further than him you think he will call back hamilton shrugged i dont know hamilton said im taking some small solace from the motto of those two brilliant young men who started yahoo you always have other options but between you and me i have no idea what other options there might be thirty seconds later both hamiltons and denniss caseyberrys vibrated it was casey i see that youre both on his voice announced as it returned from a twentyfourthousandmile trip into space well aloysius hamilton said how nice to hear from you say hello to aloysius kevin hello aloysius dennis said jack casey said do i have to say i wouldnt do this for anybody but you how about castillo would you cut some of those people out of the loop if it would keep him from being thrown to the russians i called back didnt i and not only are those people not going to hear this conversation but i have your word that you wont tell them anything about it you have my word jack but im damned uncomfortable with this i dont like lying to those people he paused then added and in my book not telling somebody something is the same thing as lying what im afraid of is that oneor moreof them has either concluded or will conclude that if castillo and the russians are the price for the russian stock of congox the president was right to agree to pay it in other words you dont trust them jesus christ jack you know who they are their most endearing quality to me is their ruthlessness hamilton said i daresay they wouldnt be as rich as they are without that characteristic but i have noticed a tendency on the part of wealthy ruthless people to regard people on their payroll as expendable what the hell is that supposed to mean i think colonel castillo made a mistake in taking that money from those people when he began this project what was it two hundred thousand dollars thats all he asked for theyd have given him whatever he asked for a couple of million if thats what he wanted if he took only two dollars people like those people would still have felt he took the money hes ours we can do with him what we decide is in the best interests of the country after a moments hesitation casey said im one of those people jack and so are you you and i are functionaries aloysius useful but not so to speak anointed as they are by the almighty have those people asked you what you think of the presidents willingness to sell castillo and the russian spookswithout whom that laboratory in the congo would still be manufacturing this obscene substanceto the russians they didnt have to ask me they know how i would feel about that they havent asked me either aloysius what i think about it nor have they solicited my suggestions visavis what should be done about it by we people which is what triggered my line of thought in this area have you considered the possibility that those people simply dont care what we think aloysius there was a thirtysecond silence which seemed much longer jesus christ jack casey said finally youre right im ashamed to admit that i never questioned anything those people did or asked me to do well fuck them its not blackandwhite aloysius those people do more good than harm but when the harm theyre capable of might be directed at people like castillo and the russians i cant go along didnt you hear me say fuck them dont say that to those people let them think they are still on mount olympus graciously protecting people like you and meand of course the united statesfrom our ignorance okay do those people know where castillo is yeah of course they have his position indicator on their laptops so do you hes at his grandmothers place in mexico casey paused then added shit you think maybe somebody already told the cia i have to think thats possible can you devise a spurious position indicator for him where do you want him to start moving to in twenty seconds jack doesnt he have family in germany do you know where yeah outside frankfurt but what about budapest whats in budapest a guy on charleys net hes sort of like an uncle to him billy kocian i dont know the name good guy trust me budapest sounds fine i can call billy and tell him whats happening and what i could do jack is put charleys position indicator on one of those boats that sails up and down the danube between vienna and budapest that would drive those people bonkers wondering what the hell hes up to a splendid idea anything else i can do for you aloysius do youor your peopleever work with extremely low temperatures using gases in the minus twohundreddegrees celsius area all the time the colder you get something the faster everything electrical moves twice a week i say eureka this will work and then everything that cold turns brittle and shatters when somebody in los angeles or chicago burps and were back to step fucking one helium of course its a little pricey but you can go down to about minus twoseventy celsius with helium youve got a pretty good source of supply for helium yeah several of them where are you going with this jack you could order say a thousand liters two thousand even more of helium without attracting much attention why would i want to do that because we may need at least that much to kill congox helium kills congox fifteen minutes in a helium bath at minus twoseventy celsius kills it so it can be killed i was really getting worried about that you were not alone hamilton said we dont know how much the russians have i suspect that if the president doesnt give them castillo and the russians very soon they will deliver more of it to encourage him to do so my concern is that there will be an accident when they do so i i get the picture casey interrupted ill load what helium i have here maybe three hundred liters maybe a little more on my gulfstream as soon as we know where the russians have sent the new congox the helium will be there in no more than three hours and ill lay my hands on as much more as i can get as soon as i can aloysius we cant let those people learn any of this im not as dumb as i look and sometimes act jack i already figured that out good man as soon as we hang up here ill get through to charley and tell him both whats going on and to get the hell off grandmas place as soon as he can splendid five apartment the watergate apartments i street nw washington dc february when roscoe j danton finally found the ringing house telephone in the living room and picked it up he was not in a very gracious mood mr danton had returned to washington four hours before after a fifteenhour flight from ushuaia patagonia argentina whence he had traveledon what he had concluded was a wildgoose chase that belonged in the guinness book of world recordswith ambassador charles m montvale and montvales executive assistantthe honorable truman ellsworthand four cia spooks to locate alexander darby who allegedly could point him to lieutenant colonel c g castillo the gulfstream iii twinengine jet aircraft had been noisy and crowded what food there had been was damned near inedible the toilet had stopped up and because there had been no functioning socket into which to plug his laptop once its battery had gone dead he couldnt do any work mentally he had composed a blistering piece that would subject montvale and ellsworth to the scorn of the world but even as hed done that he knew he would never write it he not only felt sorry for them but had come to like them he also had spent a good deal of time trying to come up with a version of what had happened to tell christopher j waldron the managing editor of the timespost something that would not result in waldron concluding that roscoe j danton had either been drunk or was a moron or both he had gotten to bed a few minutes before four and now the fucking house phone goes off in the five years ive lived in the watergate i havent talked on the goddamn thing five times what he snarled into the instrument mr danton this is gerry in the garage and how may i be of assistance gerry theres something wrong with your car mr danton the alarm keeps going off that happens gerryas you should know you fucking cretin you work in the garagewhen someone bumps into it itll stop blowing the horn and flashing the headlights in three minutes yeah i know but yours keeps going off this is the fifth time its gone off youre going to have to do something what would you suggest well you could disconnect the battery thatd shut the alarm system off gerry if you could do that for me id be happy to make it worth your while how does ten dollars sound sounds fine to me mr danton but your car is locked and i have to get under the hood to disconnect the battery you cant open the hood from outside in the background danton could then hear the sound of a horn going bleepbleepbleep there it goes again gerry said unnecessarily roscoe danton sighed audibly ill be right down he said which means ill have to get dressed i cant go down there in my underwear there were three men watching the blinking headlights on roscoes car one of them had sort of a uniform on and was presumably gerry the other two were wearing suits which means they probably live here which means i will shortly get one of those fucking letters from the tenants association demanding to know how i dare disturb the peace and tranquillity of the watergate apartments blowing my horn in this outrageous way as he approached his car the lights stopped blinking and the horn stopped bleating why hello roscoe one of the men in suits said nice to see you again but we are going to have to stop meeting this way people will talk i am actually losing my mind im hallucinating how could alexander darby possibly be standing next to my car in the watergate garage my name is yung mr danton the other man in a suit said putting out his hand im glad to meet you alex has told me a good deal about you alex darby said gerry we can take it from here thanks very much for your help anytime gerry said and took the extended twentydollar bill and walked toward his booth near the entrance got your passport with you roscoe darby asked in a pavlovian reflex danton patted his suit jacket pocket and immediately regretted it good yung said if you want to talk to colonel castillo youre going to need it who are you my name is david w yung im colonel castillos attorney did you find ushuaia interesting roscoe darby asked how do you know about that well as the saying goes you can take the man out of the agency but you cant take the agency out of the man yung put in what were going to do roscoeyou dont mind if i call you roscoe do you yeah i think i do if youre going to be difficult roscoe not a problem yung said well just leave and go find c harry whelan jr we know he also wants to meet colonel castillo wed rather have you but only if you want to go along were not going to drug you or anything like that and take you against your will take me where ill tell you what we have in mind if you let me call you roscoe if you do in turn you may call me twogun im smiling i have every right to be royally pissed and maybe i should even be frightenedwas there an implied threat in that were not going to drug you but what im doing is smiling twogun they call him twogun you may call me roscoe twogun thank you now roscoe presuming you are willing you are going to drive you and me to bwi you have a firstclass ticket on the aeromexico tenfortyfive flight to mexico city once i see your plane take off i will drive your car back here and turn it over to gerrys capable hands you will be met at the airport in mexico city and taken to meet colonel castillo and the russians actually one of the russians has expressed an interest in meeting you roscoe where is castillo twogun you will learn that later and if i say no then we shall regretfully have to stuff you in the trunk of your car and by the time gerry hears your piteous cries for helpand finally figures out where theyre coming fromalex and i will have folded our tent and disappeared goddamn it im smiling again okay give me ten minutes to throw some things in a bag and grab my laptop no if were going it has to be right now why theres about one chance in ten that alex and i were not as successful as we believe we were in eluding the secret service guys surveilling our house which raises the possibility that there may be some of them outside what makes you think they wont see follow stop whatever us when you and i leave because just before we leave alex is going to leave the garage as if satan himself is in hot pursuit if there are no secret service agents waiting for him outside fine if there are alex will lead them on a tour of the scenic spots of our nations capital while you and i make our leisurely way to baltimorewashington international and harry whelan wont be involved right i was afraid you would ask that meaning he will be meaning he will be offered the same opportunity can i cut his throat when you come back you can do anything you want to i havent a clue why im going along with this roscoe j danton said as he put the key in the car door one office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia february j stanley waters the cias deputy director for operations stood looking over the shoulder of dci john powell at the screen of a laptop computer the screen showed an arrow positioned over a map of budapest hungary a box beside the arrow held the legend hotel gellert szent gellert ter and the local date and time there is our friend castillo right now the dci said whats he doing in the hotel gellert in budapest waters asked does it matter just as long as the case officers know where to find him when they get there it would have been easier and maybe quicker to send the plane from tampa we know the guys on the plane are good know the score and if we had sent it over there the moment we saw he was headed for europe they would be there or almost there now so youve been saying five or six times the dci said i stand chastised and well you should the dci said only halfjokingly when enough time for that to have sunk in had passed the dci went on and what you can do with this software stanthat casey is really a fucking geniusis program a time lapse into it like this he tapped a few keys the map changed and now showed a map covering the world from near acapulco to budapest this arrow is when castillo started to move from grandmas house the dci said that was at sixteenthirty acapulco time yesterday ill set this thing to show us where he was by the hour he tapped keys there it is a series of arrows appeared on a line from acapulco to budapest unfortunately there was a cloud cover so we couldnt get a very good picture of whats moving but enough to categorize it as a small jet one hour later he used his finger as a pointer it was almost halfway to cancun and two hours later it was almost in cancun telling us it was making about three hundred thirty knots which suggests that hes flying the family lear which makes sense as we know the gulfstream iii is in panama city panama an hour after that having taken on fuel in cancun he was about two hundred miles on his way to panama city watch the arrow jump stan another hour another three hundred forty nautical miles and then another et cetera until he reaches panama city panama and there castillo sat for almost three hours until he boarded varig flight for madrid jack for christs sake youre like a kid with your goddamn computer indulge me the dci said and there he is in madrid goddamn it jack and finally courtesy of lufthansa there he is in budapest what do you think he did with his airplane in panama city no telling we should know by the morning when we get the satellite imagery it could be sitting on the tarmac there or that air force guy torine could have flown it somewhere i never understood how that worked torine was a pretty senior full colonel and our boy a very junior lieutenant colonel so how come torine works for castillo i have no idea what are you going to do with lammelle what do you mean do with him you are going to tell him that castillo is in budapest i could tell frank but he would have to tell general naylor and general naylor would naturally want to know how lammelle or the cia knows where castillo is the truthful answer to that would be that courtesy of aloysius francis casey those people in las vegas are tracking colonel castillo through a gps transmitter in his laptop and we dont want to reveal that do we so frank just sits at macdill unless mcnab thinks he has found castillo and they all rush off to the wrong place to put them in the bag you wouldnt believe stan how low our director of national intelligence has sunk in the presidents esteem as a result of his wildgoose chase in argentina it would be unfortunate if lammelle came to be known as a wildgoose chaser in the mold of ambassador montvale but thats the way the ball just might bounce if that should happen of course it would tend to eliminate frank as a replacement for me when clendennen gives montvale the boot and i become the dni i would recommend you to replace me if it were not for your unfortunate tendency to mock my interest in caseys electronic toys i can reform jack you had fucking well better stan two office of the commanding general united states army central command macdill air force base tampa florida february vic needs a minute general command sergeant major wes suggins said from mcnabs door naylor did not like the rapport that had developed almost immediately between his sergeant major and dallessando but he both understood itsergeants major are in fact the backbone of the army and thats especially true with men like these two who function at the highest levels of the serviceand he knew that he couldnt warn suggins against dallessando who was in fact at this moment not a trusted member of the team but the enemy he motioned for suggins to admit dallessando and called come on in vic afternoon general dallessando said call for you he handed naylor what looked like a blackberry but was in fact a caseyberry naylor took it general naylor general mcnab general and how are things on beautiful tampa bay this afternoon the sonofabitch has this thing on loudspeaker and i will be damned if i will give him the satisfaction of knowing i dont know how to turn it off ive been wondering when we were going to hear from you general naylor said i can understand that general im a little surprised you didnt call on a secure line this is about as secure a line as you can get actually have you found what youre looking for im always looking for peace love and affluence but i suspect youre asking did you find charley dallessando chuckled dont let either of these bastards make you lose your temper and did you i managed to have a chat with him and where is he he didnt say but hes agreeable to talk with you if you like as an old friend right now general were not old friends but a general officer and a lieutenant colonel oh i guess i misspoke or at least should have made this clear i spoke with a german national by the name of karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger during the course of our conversation he said he was surprised that i didnt know that lieutenant colonel castillo retired having been ordered by the president of the united states to disappear and never be heard from again was in compliance with his orders general the president of the united states has ordered me to order colonel castillo general how can you order someone to do anything who has disappeared and will never be heard from again dallessando chuckled again and smiled at naylor something amuses you dallessando naylor snapped looks like you have a problem general dallessando said get the hell out of my office yes sir dallessando said and put out his hand may i have my caseyberry please you sonofabitch thats going to cost you what herr von und zu gossinger said he is willing to do general mcnab went on is meet you in cancun tomorrow morning cancun mexico naylor asked incredulously thats the one and he wants you to fly there commercially theres an aeromexico flight out of lauderdale tonight at seventeenthirty itll put you in there a little after ohonethirty they call it the drug dealers redeye he says it probably would attract less attention if you didnt wear your uniform sonofabitch and he hopes you and your party will be his guests at el dorado royale in cancun people from el dorado royaleits a fivestar hotelwill meet your flight how many will there be in your party general that would presume im going along with this wouldnt it excuse me general myself mr lammelle major brewer and i presume mr dallessando and my son oh allans coming good im sure herr von und zu gossinger will be glad to see him and itll be educational for him wont it is that about it general i think i should tell you that i dont think char herr von und zu gossinger is going to be in cancun i dont think he entirely trusts frank lammelle but its the first step and we are playing by his rules arent we for the moment naylor said your tickets will be waiting for you at the airport first class of course theres nothing cheap about our herr von und zu gossinger is there nice to talk to you general there was a muted click and general naylor realized that general mcnab was no longer on the line three office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia february what are you going to do frank send the gulfstream down to cancun ahead of you jack powell asked no i think what ill do is move it to the lauderdale airport now and then have it follow the aeromexico flight once theyre sure were actually on it castillo may be up to something clever like actually being in disney world or someplace and this whole mexican thing may be a diversion well wherever you go the people in the gulfstream will know keep me posted frank the director of the central intelligence agency hung up have a nice wildgoose chase frank he said aloud although there was no one to hear him then he said slowly savoring each syllable john j powell the director of national intelligence he thought it had a certain ring to it a certain je ne sais quoi four room b el dorado royale spa resort kilometer fortyfive carretera cancuntulum riviera maya quintana roo mexico february vic dallessando had almost wished as he crawled across the floor of frank lammelles room toward the bed that the sonofabitch would wake up he would have loved an excuse to pop the bastard with one of the darts in the glocklike air pistol he held in his hand but luckat least that kind of luckhad not been with him frank lammelle hadnt stirred as dallessando first pried the heels off lammelles shoes removed the gps transmitter from the right heel and then replaced both not even when dallessando had grunted with the effort neither had he stirred when dallessando went into lammelles briefcase found lammelles glocklike dart gun removed the gas cylinder from the stock and replaced it with a gas cylinder he had exhausted earlier shooting darts at the pineapple atop the tray of fruit that the el dorado management had sent to his room as a welcoming gift once he was back in his room one floor up and directly above bit might have been necessary had lammelle fastened the mechanical door lock to gain entrance to his room by climbing down from the balconyvic checked his watch the entire operation had taken twelve minutes thirty seconds here dallessando said in russian handing the gps transmitter to a tall blond man in a nautical uniform tell me captain on the queen of the caribbean are there lifeboats on an upper deck exposed to the sky lifeboats no the blond man said life rafts yes then please put it someplace on one of the life rafts where it will not be seen not get wet and is in the best position to send a clear signal i know just the place and what time do you sail at half past eight marvelous bon voyage and when we get to malaga what do i do with the gps transmitter i expect the battery will go dead before youre halfway across the atlantic just put that gadget in a life raft check it a couple of times a day and after a week toss it over the side five en route to cancun international airport cancun quintana roo mexico february they were traveling in the same kind of minibus sent the night before to bring them from cancun international airport to el dorado royale resort it was manufactured in mexico on a mercedesbenz chassis and could hold fourteen passengers and their luggage in airconditioned comfort this morning it held general naylor colonel brewer lieutenant colonel designate naylor mr lammelle mr dallessando and two rather massive whitejacketed members of the el dorado royales staff one driving the bus and the other sitting in a jump seat beside him to handle the luggage and an enormous insulated container that held their lunches where are we going frank lammelle suddenly demanded to know he was sitting alone on the row of seats at the back of the bus were off to see the wizard frank vic dallessando said i told you where were going where charley told me to take you not good enough dallessando i want to know where pull to the side of the road please vic called in russian the bus pulled off to the side and stopped that was russian lammelle challenged god you could tell what the hell is going on here lammelle demanded i want you to tell me where were going or what youll stamp your foot lammelles face showed that he understood but he said nothing wouldnt do you any good anyway frank dallessando said charleys not anywhere close i know that castillos in budapest your computer tell you that frank you know fucking well it did so whats going on here allanallan juniordid you ever see ol franks computer he thinkshes wrong but thats what he thinksit shows where charley is why dont you let allan junior see your computer frank fuck you dallessando lammelle said thats not nice get out of the aisle you sonofabitch im getting off the bus sorry not permitted when you go off to see the wizard youve got to go all the way lammelle came out with his glocklike air pistol aimed it at dallessando and squeezed the trigger nothing happened he squeezed the trigger again funny thing about air pistols frank dallessando said they dont work without air and then he took his glocklike air pistol from under his pillowing mexican resort shirt aimed at lammelle and squeezed the trigger there was a psssst sound shit lammelle said looking down at the dart in his chest allan junior dallessando said why dont you help ol frank sit down before he falls down and on your way back bring his computer what the hell is that you shot him with allan junior asked as he moved down the aisle i guess im not the only one your father didnt tell about lammelles cia wonder gun dallessando said which raises the question what do i do with general naylor and his faithful sidekick colonel brewer everyone watched as lammelle went limp and as allan junior lowered him onto the row of seats then allan junior came down the aisle carrying a laptop dallessando called out in russian the minibus began to move general dallessando said charley said i was to treat you with as much respect as possible under the circumstances are you going to try anything brave and noble or are you willing to give me your parole sir thats a seldomused term isnt it general naylor said the last time i think an officer gave his parole was when colonel watersgeneral pattons soninlawgave his to his german captors who then took him to the katyn forest and showed him the graves of the thousands of polish officers the russians had murdered with all respect general thanks for the history lesson but that doesnt answer my question it seemed germane here one of the german officers to whom colonel waters gave his parole was oberst hermann von und zu gossinger colonel castillos grandfather yes mr dallessando if you give me your word that we are en route to see colonel castillo i will offer my parole and if memory serves the code of honor says that my parole includes that of my immediate subordinates which would mean you also have the parole of colonel brewer and my son major naylor isnt that lieutenant colonel designate naylor general dallessando asked yes it is thank you sir dallessando said okay were headed for the business side of cancun international an airplane will be waiting for us what i would like to suggest to anyone watching is that one of our number has been at the sauce and needs help to board the airplane now will your parole permit you to help me do that ill carry the sonofabitch aboard myself allan junior said six laguna el guaje coahuila mexico february looking with frank fascination out the window of the cessna mustang as it was towed under what looked like an enormous tarpaulin general allan naylor saw a number of very interesting things there were four aircraft already in the cavehangarwhatever it was one of them he recognized as what he thought of as dona alicias lear there were two gulfstreams a iii and a v he presumed the iii was castillos airplane the one in which he and dick miller and the others had flown away from their retirement parade at fort rucker he had no idea who the gulfstream v belonged to and there was a black hawk helicopter with its insignia and a legend painted on the fuselage identifying it as belonging to the mexican policia federal preventiva naylor knew the us government had sold a dozen of them to mexico to assist in the war against drugs he had smarted at the timeand smarted again nowat the price the mexicans had paid for them which came to about a tenth of what the army had paid for them and he naturally wondered what a policia federal helicopter was doing here but what he found most fascinating was lieutenant colonel c g castillo who was standing with another man a woman and castillos dog max watching the aircraft come into the cave the humans were dressed identically in yellow polo shirts and khaki trousers now that i think about it just about everybody in the cave is wearing yellow polo shirts and khaki trousers is there something significant in that the womanwho was wearing an enormous gaudily decorated sombrero that looked like it belonged on the head of a trumpet player in a mariachi bandwas leaning her shoulder against castillos and holding his hand and the other guyhe looks like her and theyre brother and sisterhas to be berezovsky what i am looking at is former colonel dmitri berezovsky of the svr the russian service for the protection of the constitutional system and former lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva also of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki mcnab was rightshe is built like a brick outdoor sanitary facility hey dick lieutenant colonel designate naylor called to the mustang pilot major h richard miller jr us army retired whom he had known since his plebe year at the us military academy is that charleys russian spy holding his hand thats her we call her sweaty she calls him my carlos nice lieutenant colonel designate naylor said very nice maybe thirteen on a scale of one to ten shes okay allan miller said but dont let her looks dazzle you sweatyss one tough little cookie here comes general mcnab colonel brewer said general mcnab when he climbed aboard the mustang was also wearing a yellow polo shirt and khaki trousers general naylor welcome to drug cartel international airfield mcnab said and then raising his voice asked everything under control vic i had tohold that with great pleasure i darted lammelle hes about to come out of it got a place to put him on ice just the place ill put him in with roscoe j danton then when frank wakes up hell have someone to talk to naylor thought roscoe j danton is he talking about the reporter from the timespost i will be damned if ill give him the satisfaction of asking mcnab backed down the stair doors and said something in russian a moment later two burly blond men came onto the airplane over there dallessando said in russian be careful hes dangerous fortyfive seconds later the deputy director of the central intelligence agency was off the airplane and slung in a firemans carry over the shoulder of one of the burly men was being carried toward a stainlesssteel elevator door set in the rock wall mcnab appeared again at the stair door opening general dallessando said general naylor has given me his parole which also covers colonel brewer and lieutenant colonel designate naylor wonderful if we had to chain him it would have been hard to get him down the stairs anytime its convenient general you may disembark castillo and the russians were at the foot of the stair door when naylor came down it he noticed that charley and the woman were stillor againholding hands castillo waited until colonel brewer allan junior and vic dallessando had come down the stairs at the risk of being rude and with great respect general naylor if you have something to say to me lets get it out of the way castillo said colonel i have been ordered by the president of the united states to place you under arrest mr lammelle was ordered by the president to take possession of the two russian defectors you are believed to hold you will therefore consider yourself under arrest and when mr lammelle is capable of receiving them you will turn them over to him sir again with great respect thats just not going to happen will you explain to me please what your understanding of the parole you have given mr dallessando is colonel as i understand the code of honor i have waived my right to attempt to escape or take any hostile action against my captors until after i inform you that i am withdrawing my parole my parole covers both colonel brewer whom i dont believe you know and lieutenant colonel designate naylor thank you sir gentlemen may i present dmitri berezovsky formerly colonel of the svr and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva also formerly of the svr they are here of their own volition not as my prisoners having said that i am responsible for their being here and consider them to be under my protection i see the way youre hanging onto her charley allan junior said i wondered what that was all about general mcnab laughed general naylor glared at him this is very difficult for my carlos sweaty flared you will not mock him colonel sweaty i wouldnt think of it allan junior said only my friends can call me sweaty she replied evenly right now colonel sweaty getting to be your friend is right at the top of my list of things to do let me begin by saying i love your sombrero and that adorable puppy berezovsky having wordlessly shaken hands with general naylor and colonel brewer now offered his hand to allan junior be careful colonel berezovsky said her bite is twice as bad as her bark im not a lieutenant colonel yet just picked to be one im glad to meet you if our official business is over for the moment general naylor castillo said i have nothing further to say to you officially colonel in that case uncle allan im damned glad to see you even in these circumstances me too charley naylor said and after an awkward fifteen seconds they embraced lunch is being prepared sweaty said the beef compared to argentina is unbelievably bad do we have to do anything for lammelle vic castillo asked castration with a dull knife might be a good idea but if youre asking because of the dart no he looked at his watch he should be coming out of it in the next ten minutes or so id love to be there when he wakes up and finds those two russians sitting on him hell think hes been shipped off to moscow what are they charley spetsnaz ex whered you get them we borrowed them from sweatys and dmitris cousin he flew a dozen up yesterday from argentina after sweaty had another good idea which was ill tell you when were upstairs castillo said and gestured toward the elevator then he added thank god you cant trust lawyersmaybe especially mexican lawyers isnt there a politically incorrect joke about that meaning what cutting a long story short this place was supposed to have been burned to the ground after they exploded all the butane but the mexican lawyer who was supposed to do thatwas trusted to do thatdidnt aleksandr will kill him sweaty said pay attention allan castillo said that was not a figure of speech general naylor thought and that comment was not charley being cute seven castillo led the group into a dining room and waved them into chairs around an enormous table naylor saw there was already one man sitting at the tablei wonder who that guy isand two burly fairskinned men armed with uzi submachine guns one sitting by each of the rooms two doors and i dont think charleys pulling our leg about the spetsnaz either they look like russians and they look like special operators proof of that came immediately when sweaty said something to them in russian to which one of them responded as an enlisted man does to an officer castillo added somethinggave an orderin russian and the other russian popped to attention and said something that was obviously yes sir both of them left the dining room sweaty ordered one of them to get us some coffee castillo explained and i told the other one to fetch mr danton may i ask questions general naylor said yes sir of course castillo replied danton is the reporter yes sir that was sweatys idea ill get into that in a minute and general mcnab has he also given you his parole charley never asked me for it general mcnab answered for him thirty seconds later one of the russians led roscoe j danton into the room please have a seat mr danton castillo said i presume you know everybody i dont know who these gentlemen are danton said indicating colonel brewer allan junior vic dallessando and aloysius francis casey my name is casey aloysius said colonel brewer is my senior aidedecamp general naylor said and thats my son lieutenant colonel designate allan naylor junior i try very hard to keep my name out of the newspapers mr danton dallessando said think of me as a friend of charleys you can call me vic and was that frank lammelle they just carried into my cell yes it was castillo said and im crushed that you think of that lovely room with an en suite bath and such a lovely view as a cell if theres a guy with a submachine gun at the door keeping you inside danton said thats a cell point taken castillo said i think i should begin this by telling you mr danton that general naylor colonel brewer and lieutenant colonel designate naylor are not here voluntarily they have given me their parole what the hell does that mean it means that under the code of honor they will what code of honor danton interrupted i dont really know i think of it as the code of honor castillo said and looked at general naylor is there a more formal name sir i dont really know naylor said what it means mr danton is that ipersonally and on behalf of my staffhave given colonel castillo our parole which means that we will neither attempt escape nor undertake any hostile action without first notifying him that we have withdrawn our parole youre serious arent you danton asked and when naylor nodded said you take that code of honor business seriously incredible i dont think thats the only thing youre going to hear or see in the next couple of days that you may find incredible castillo said two russians appeared with a huge thermos of coffee and a tray with cups cream and sugar castillo waited until the fuss caused by that dissipated and then rapped his spoon against the thermos everybody looked at him here we go he said while i am a graduate of the us army command and general staff schoolwhere one learns how to write a staff studyi have to confess that when it was time for me to actually go to fort leavenworth either they really couldnt find room for me or an unnamed senior officer decided i could make a greater contribution to the army by running his errands so he pulled some strings the result of which was that i took the course by correspondencein addition to my other dutiesrather than in the academic setting of leavenworth general naylor realized he was smiling and when he looked he saw general mcnabthe unnamed senior officerwas too the result of that was i cannot come up with as good a staff study as most people can but as general mcnab has told me so many times over the years you gotta go with what you got statement of the problem the russians and the iranians probably with a lot of help from former east germans and maybe the czechs and even the japanese none of whom find anything wrong with using biological weapons on soldiers and civilians came up with a substance we now call congox because it was manufactured in a laboratory in the congo our own expert in this area colonel j porter hamilton cutting to the chase describes congox as an abomination before god surprising me not a hell of a lot congox slipped through the cracks at langley it was the stated opinion of the cia that what was going on in the congo was a fish farm we learned what was really going on there through dumb luck colonel roscoe j danton interrupted if i take notes will i be wasting my time i think taking notes is a good idea ill need my laptop castillo said something in russian and then your laptops on the way now where was i something about dumb luck danton said oh yeah what i should have said was stupidity and incompetence ive got to go off at a tangent here im sure that everybody here will be surprised when i tell you that there are some russians who have moral qualms about biological warfare because of their deep religious convictions and even more surprised that some of these good russians get to rise high in the ranks of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki which in english is the service for the protection of the constitutional system and im sure that you will be shocked to hear that the svr is just as bad as our beloved cia when it comes to bureaucratic infighting and empirebuilding the head villain here is vladimir putin whodespite what title hes running underactually runs the svr which among other things ran the fish farm in the congo in an attempt to restore the svr to the sort of glory their predecessor secret police organization had before the soviet union imploded putin decided that a number of peoplerussians germans austrians argentines and americans the latter including your lecturer here todayhad to be whacked or eliminated he succeeded in whacking the german a journalist who was asking too many questions about german involvement in supplying the fish farm and the austrians who had been deepcover cia assets successfully engaged over the years in getting russians and other eastern bloc people to switch sides the attempted assassination of the argentine failed but putin still had high hopes of taking me out when i went to the germans funeral the murdered german worked for the tages zeitung newspaper chain which as most of you know i own you own the tages zeitung chain danton asked incredulously castillo nodded incredible right stick around it gets better anyway they knew i would go to the funeral so putin sent a team of assassinsformer members of the hungarian allamvedelmi hatosagto germany with orders to report to colonel berezovsky the svr rezident in berlin berezovsky would tell them when and where to whack me when i showed up at the funeral danton pointed to berezovsky and asked with his eyebrows him castillo nodded it was to be colonel berezovskys final assignment when he was finished whacking me and wentwith his sister lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva the svr rezident in copenhagento an svr meeting in vienna they were going to be charged with embezzlement and flown off to moscow berezovsky was a threat to putins control of the svr and had to go and so did his sister the mistake putin madethe stupidity he demonstratedwas to underestimate colonel berezovsky berezovsky knew all about putins plans for him and sweaty danton pointed at svetlana and asked sweaty only to her friends castillo said anyway berezovsky had gotten in touch with the cia station chief in vienna miss eleanor dillworth and told her he and his sister were willing to defect miss dillworth lost no time in telling jack powell and jack powell lost no time in telling our late president of the genius of his vienna station chief implying that miss dillworth had brilliantly entrapped dmitri and sweaty when in fact they had walked in her door colonel berezovsky was not very impressed with miss dillworth he was in fact very nervous about what was going to happen in vienna he thought she was entirely capable of throwing him and sweaty under the bus if anythingany little thingwent wrong and then dmitri saw in the frankfurter rundschau a picture of me getting off my gulfstream on the way to the funeral he knew that karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger was also a lieutenant colonel in the us army with alleged intelligence and special operations connections and who had his own airplane brilliant fellow that my future brotherinlaw is he reasoned did you say future brotherinlaw danton asked incredulously general naylor thought thats exactly what he said my god i thought everybody knew castillo said love is where you find it mr danton jesus christ my fiancee is offended when someone takes the lords name in vain mr danton sorry as i was saying dmitri clever fellow that he is reasoned that if he called off the allamvedelmi hatosag and i was not whacked maybe i would show my gratitude to him by flying him and sweaty out of europe which is what happened is it general naylor asked is that what actually happened charley yes sir i never understood why you would steal the defectors from the cia naylor admitted i didnt know about miss dillworth until later general what dmitri told me at the time was that the svr was going to be waiting for him and svetlana in the sudbahnhof in vienna so you flew them to argentina why argentina they have family there sir castillo said well why didnt you turn them over to the cia in argentina naylor asked well just about as soon as we got to vienna sir dmitri as an expression of his gratitude told me about the fish farm in the congo when ambassador montvale came down there i tried to tell him about the fish farm but he gave me the cia answer it was nothing but a fish farm you still should have turned these people over to the cia two reasons i didnt sir the first being that i believed dmitri about the fish farm and knew that if i turned them over to the cia they would not believe him and that would be the end of it i knew i had to follow that path and the second reason castillo exhaled audibly maybe i no certainly i should have given this as my first reason sir by the time montvale showed up in buenos aires certain things had happened between svetlana and me i knew there was no way i was ever going to turn her or her brother over to the cia the argentine side the rotary club of east orange new jersey or anyone else naylor shook his head but said nothing in the end castillo went on that turned out for several reasons to be the right decision i decided that my duty required i take action on my own and that turned out to be the right decision too and is why i decided to take action on my own in that situation what action was that colonel danton asked the question obviously was whats really going on in the congo there was only one way to find out i arranged to send people in there to find out on your own authority general naylor said you had no right to do that and you knew it i saw it as my duty to do just that castillo said what exactly did you do danton asked i sent colonel j porter hamilton the man who runs our biowarfare laboratory at fort detrick to the congo with a team of special operators he found out it was even worse than we suspected toldmore importantly convincedour late president of this and the president ordered it destroyed and what happened to you for doing what you did without authorization well for a couple of minutes the president wanted to make me director of national intelligence im kidding what the president did was tell me to take everybody in ooa to the end of the earth fall off and never be seen again and ive triedweve all triedto do just that and danton pursued the curtain went up on act two two barrels of congox appeared one fedexed from miami to colonel hamilton at fort detrick the second left for the border patrol to find on the texasmexico border where did it come from almost certainly from the congo we know that a russian special operations airplanea tupolev tualanded at el obeid airport in north kurdufan sudanwhich is within driving range of the fish farmand took off shortly afterward leaving seventeen bodies behind we suspect it flew first to cuba for refueling and then it flew here where two barrels of congox were given to the mexico city rezident of the svr who then drove off with them presumably to get them across the border into the united states how do you know that general naylor challenged we have it all on surveillance tape sir ill show the tapes to you if youd like theres a very clear picture of general yakov sirinov who is apparently in charge of the operation the tupolev tua then left here and is presently on the ground at la orchila airfield thats on an island off the coast of venezuela how could you possibly know that general naylor demanded id show you the satellite imagery sir but if i did youd know where i got them i dont think id have to look very far would i general mcnab naylor asked unpleasantly castillo said you have my word that i did not get them from general mcnab and sir with respect your parole does not give you the right to question me or anyone else please keep that in mind he let that sink in and then went on now for facts bearing on the problem scene two the russian rezident in washington sergei murov had frank lammellespeaking of whom vic should we have someone take a look at him he has two of your spetsnaz watching him charley i think theyll be able to tell if the sob croaks castillo nodded then went on the russians had lammelle over to their dacha on marylands eastern shore where murov the rezident admitted they sent the congox to colonel hamilton and then offered to turn over all congox in their control and give us their assurance that no more will ever turn up all they want in return is dmitri sweaty and me the president thinks the price is fair he sent general naylor to arrest me and frank lammelle to arrest sweaty and dmitri is that true general naylor danton asked any conversations i may or may not have had with the president mr danton naylor said are both privileged and classified its true general mcnab said how do you know danton asked because thats what general naylor told me mcnab said under the code of honor peopleespecially general officersdont tell fibs to each other they may try to make human sacrifices of fellow officers but telling fibs is a nono telling a fib will get you kicked right off that long gray line colonel brewer please be prepared to report that exchange in detail naylor said jesus christ allan mcnab said then sorry sweaty that just slipped out the question is moot castillo said colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva are not going to be involuntarily repatriated and i aint goin nowhere i dont want to go neither so what are you going to do charley allan junior asked it took me a lot longer than it should have for me to figure this out allan but what im going to do is something they told me on that fabled plain overlooking the hudson when i was eighteen when if i made it through hudson high and became an officer my first duty would be to take care of my people i forgot that over the years the truth of the matter was that falling off the face of the earth didnt bother me much there i was with sweaty on the finest troutfishing river in the world the president of the united states had relieved me of my responsibilities then dmitri and sweatys cousin colonel v n solomatin who runs the second directorate of the svr with putin looking over his shoulder wrote a letter to dmitri and sweaty telling them to come home all is forgiven since he didnt know where they were he had the rezident in budapest give the letter to a friend of mine there who he thought knew how to get in touch with me he was right several hours later sweaty and i were reading it in patagonia what was significant about the letter was not that putin thought anybody would believe that all was forgiven but that he wasnt going to stop until sweaty and dmitri paid for their sins that letter was intended to give clendennen an out he wasnt forcing sweaty and dmitri to go back to russia knowing that all was forgivenheres the letter to prove thatthey went back willingly then the congox appeared in fort detrick just about as soon as that happened some people who knew the ooa the what roscoe danton interrupted the office of organizational analysis the presidents okay now im with you danton said okay some people what people danton interrupted again im not going to tell you that now i may never tell you i havent figured out what to do about them yet let me deal with the bastards charley aloysius said id love to aloysius but i want to be invisible when this is all over and that would be hard to do if all those people suddenly committed suicide by jumping off the roller coaster on top of that tower in las vegas people would wonder why they did that casey chuckled thats not exactly what i had in mind but close he said you realize colonel danton said that all youre doing is whetting my appetite presuming that i come out of this alive im going to find out who these people are so why dont you tell me now castillo considered that tell him carlos sweaty said you think thats smart i think you have to tell mr danton everything she said or eliminate him he either trusts youuscompletely or hes too dangerous to us to stay alive was that a threat danton challenged and thought no it was a statement of fact and the frightening thing about that is i think hes going to listen to her sweaty ignored him she went on and now is when you have to make that decision danton thought i realize this is overdramatic but the cold truth is that if these people think im a danger to them theyre entirely capable of taking me out in the desert shooting me and leaving me for the buzzards why the fuck did i ever agree to come here dmitri castillo asked i think shes right again berezovsky said after a moments consideration of the question my consiglieri having spoken mr danton castillo said and paused roscoe danton wondered consiglieri where the hell did he get that from the godfather castillo met dantons eyes then went on there is a group of men in las vegas who have both enormous wealth and influence the latter reaching all over and in at least two cases im sure of into the oval office not to the president but to several members of his cabinet theyre all patriots and they use their wealth and influence from time to time to fund intelligence activities for which funds are not available when those people learned that ooa had been disbanded they thought they could hire it as sort of a mercenary special operations organization those people have names danton asked giving them to you would be a breach of trust castillo said we never agreed to this proposal when it was made but neither apparently did we say hell no with sufficient emphasis it was from those people that we first learned of the congox at fort detrick they got in touch and wanted us to look into it i was going to do that anyway as it obviously was likely to have something to do with dmitri and sweaty as well as the threat it posed to the country i made the mistake of taking two hundred thousand dollars in expense money following my rule of whenever possible you should spend other peoples money rather than your own and this i am afraid allowed them to think the mercenaries were on their payroll what was wrong with that danton asked well for one thing were not for hire but what happened i have come to believe is that when they learned that president clendennen had decided to swap dmitri sweaty and me in exchange for the congox that the russians have they decided that made sense and that since i was a mercenary i was expendable they told you this danton asked no but im not taking any of their calls castillo said or letting them know where i am they think charleys on a riverboat between budapest and vienna aloysius said and that im in tokyo i dont understand that danton said youre not supposed to sweaty said go on carlitos what are you going to do danton said well there is some good news weve learned how to kill congox castillo said right now nobody knows that but us you know something that important and youre not going to tell the president general naylor blurted if we told him sir there are several probabilities im not willing to accept one would be that he would want to know how we came to know this before he did that would place colonel hamilton in an awkward position goddamn it charley naylor exploded hamilton is a serving officer he is dutybound sir with respect you are violating your parole i have told you that you are not permitted to question me but ill answer that inasmuch as colonel hamilton marches beside us in the long gray line im sure he considered the code of honor before deciding that to keep this information to ourselves for the time being was necessary he realized that if president clendennen knew that we can now neutralize congox the russians would learn that in short order right now we dont want to give them that there was silence for a moment then danton asked so what are you going to do colonel depending on how much congox the russians have that reduces the threat to the united states just about completely or doesnt reduce it much at all castillo went on the odds are that the congox that general sirinov flew out of africa is all of it dmitri says that the russians knew how awful this stuff is burned once no pun intended by chernobyl they didnt want to run the risk of having any of this stuff inside russia if hes wrong and the russians have warehouses full of congox or have the means inside russia or in iran or someplace else to make more of it then the united states is in deep trouble so what we have to do is find out how much congox they have i dont think putin would answer that truthfully so we have to ask the only other man who might general yakov sirinov how the hell are you going to do that and what makes you think hell tell you the truth danton asked were going to raid the venezuelan airfield la orchila grab the general load him on his tupolev tua fly him here and ask him youre going to invade venezuela were going to launch a raid on a venezuelan airfield not invade when you invade you try to stay with a little luck we should be in and out in no more than fifteen minutes twenty tops danton repeated load him on his tupolev castillo nodded the cia has a standing offer of one hundred twentyfive million dollars for a tua were going to get them one we need the money to answer your other question mr danton sweaty said once we get general sirinov here ill be asking the questions he will tell us the truth and now youll have to excuse me for a few minutes castillo said i have to go buy another black hawk while im gone well show you the surveillance tapes buy another black hawk danton parroted thats right castillo said you dont know how that works do you uhuh well the us army buys them from sikorsky they run right around six million dollars then the state department sells them to the mexican governmentto be used in their unrelenting war against the drug cartelsfor about onetenth of that say six hundred thousand the next thing that happens is thatin the aforementioned unrelenting war run by the policia federal preventiva against the drug cartelsthe helicopter is reported to have been shot down or that it crashed in flames next a policia federal preventiva palm is crossed with a little moneysay a million or soand the black hawk rises phoenixlike from the ashes the drug cartels find them very useful to move drugs around that tends to raise the price the one downstairs cost us one point two million and i have been warned that the bidding today will start at a million three incredible danton said enjoy the movies mr danton castillo said ill be back as soon as i can eight the office of the director of national intelligence eisenhower executive office building th street and pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february mr mcguire is here to see you mr ambassador montvales secretary announced ask him to come in please montvale said and as truman ellsworth watched from a leather armchair then rose from behind his desk and walked toward the door meeting mcguire as he entered the office hello tom montvale said what can i do for you mcguire hesitated and then said i suppose youve heard i dont work here no more montvale nodded mason andrews lost very little time in telling me he was here two minutes after truman and i got here this morning how are you tom ellsworth said he got out of his armchair went to mcguire and gave him his hand mcguire hesitated again i decided i couldnt just fold my tent mr ambassador without facing you and telling you i was sorry youre not going to be prosecuted tom if thats whats worrying you to do that andrews would need me to testify and i made sure he understands thats just not going to happen mcguire finished but when i walked in here just now i realized i couldnt do that when mrs darby told me alex darby was down there in ushuaia ellsworth furnished with some floozy i knew that wasnt so and when i told you i told myself that you were too smart to swallow that whole but what i came to tell you mr ambassador is that i hoped you would i appreciate your honesty tom are you going to tell me why i just had enough of the whole scenario mr ambassador i think what the presidents trying to do to charley castillo is rotten i didnt want to be part of it i hope they never find him prefacing this by saying that im about to join you in the army of the unemployed excuse me youve been around the white house for a long time tom what inferences would you draw if i told you that that red telephone no longer directly connects the director of national intelligence to the president he gave mcguire time to consider that then went on and when the director of national intelligenceto whom the president is now referring to as the director of national stupidityattempts to telephone the president using the white house switchboard the presidents secretary answers and tells me the president is busy and will get back to me or words to that effect hes going to throw you under the bus too mcguire asked that is the inference i have drawn does that sound reasonable to you then i am sorry mr ambassador i didnt think what i did would cost you your job what you did tom probably contributed to that but i dont think it was the only thing that made president clendennen decide he could do without my services he really isnt quite as stupid as he appears i think it is entirely likely that he has known for some time what i think of him he would like nothing better than to have roscoe j danton write a column detailing how his director of national stupidity went on a wildgoose chase to ushuaia but he cant do that because roscoe would be sure to ask him why he sent truman and me to argentina in the first place and he cant be sure how far he can push my reluctance to embarrass the office of the presidentfor that matter clendennen himselfbefore it is overwhelmed by my contempt inasmuch as he knows that i wont oblige him by resigning what hes doing is looking for a way to fire me in conditions that wont reflect adversely on him is danton going to write about you going to ushuaia i dont know im having trouble getting in touch with him just before you came in truman and i decided that we will take our lunch at the old ebbitt grill not only are we fairly sure that the executive dining room will no longer welcome us but we suspect we can find mr danton at one of his favorite watering holes the old ebbitt well have to walk truman and i no longer have access to the white house fleet of yukons my god if you dont mind the walk truman and i would be delighted if you were to join us you dont have to do that mr ambassador i want to do it montvale said please join us one laguna el guaje coahuila mexico february sorry to have taken so long castillo said when he walked into the dining room trailed by max unexpected problems at the used helicopter lot but you got another black hawk sweaty asked i got another one but the price went up to one point four million and i suspect its not going to be as nice as the one downstairs colonel can i ask where youre getting all that money roscoe danton said the lcbf corporation actually purchased the black hawks and is loaning them to us castillo answered thats those people in las vegas danton asked oh no castillo said the lcbf corporation has absolutely nothing to do with those people in las vegas then what the hell is it id really like to tell you roscoe castillo said solemnly i really would but if i did id have to kill you that earned a chuckle from not only the special operations people around the tablethere was one more of them now cwo colin leverette retired having come in while they were watching the surveillance camera tapesbut also from lieutenant colonel designate allan naylor jr general naylor however who had heard the comment often was not amused he thought these special operations types from charleys teenaged exmarine bodyguard lester bradley up to lieutenant general bruce mcnab have an almost perverse sense of humor theyre different they have no respect for anything or anyone but each other and then he thought why do i suspect that things did not go well when charley was off buying another black hawk and i think he was telling the truth about that too we give the mexicans multimilliondollar helicopters which then promptly wind up in the hands of the drug cartels castillo said well now that youve seen the movie starring general yakov sirinov and his dancing svr ninjas there he goes again why does he feel compelled to make a joke even of that i think we should move to the war room where i will attempt to explain our plan am i permitted to make a comment the elder naylor asked yes sir of course that tape should be in the hands of the president he could have the secretary of state demand an emergency session of the un security council not until we know how much congox the russians have castillo said very seriously and then his voice became mocking and now lady max and gentlemen if youll be good enough to follow me to the war room he bowed deeply holding one arm across his middle and pointing the other toward the door naylor thought id like to throw something at him he glanced at mcnab who was smiling whats he smiling at charley playing the clown or me the war room had been a recreationexercise room there was a pingpong table a pocket billiards table and half a dozen exercise machines of assorted functioning the exercise machines had been moved into a corner of the room the billiards and pingpong tables were covered with maps lester bradley was at a table on which sat a casey communicator and several printers there were armchairs most of them in a semicircle facing large maps taped to a wall another armchair was alone against the side of the wall and again there were two burly fairskinned uziarmed men sitting by the doors to the room colonel castillo i think we should discuss my understanding of my parole with respect sir will you hold that until i ask the deputy director of the central intelligence agency if its convenient for him to join us castillo replied and then issued an order in russian thirty seconds later frank lammelle was ushered into the room by two burly russians he was wearing a shirt and trousers he was barefoot his wrists were encircled with plastic handcuffs the handcuffs were held against his waist by another plastic handcuff attached to his belt good afternoon frank castillo said youre going to jail for this castillo castillo issued another order in russian one of the exspetsnaz operators left the room and returned a moment later with a folding metal chair castillo showed him where he wanted it and then not gently guided lammelle into it lester go sit in the armchair take mr lammelles air pistol with you bradley complied frank castillo then said you pose a problem for me general mcnab general naylor and general naylors staff are also here involuntarily but they have given me their parole under the code of honor im fairly sure youve heard of it im also absolutely sureyou being the ddcithat you wouldnt consider yourself bound by it so i will not accept your parole which means you will sit there in handcuffs if you even look like youre thinking of getting out of the chair without my express permission lester will dart you i should tell you that hes not only a former marine gunnery sergeant but also a crack shot he was a designated marksman on the march to baghdad he will also dart you if you speak without my permission you understand you heard what i said about you going to jail for this you sonofabitch you are entitled to one emotional outburst before lester darts you you just used it lester put a dart in the back of his neck the next time he says anything aye aye sir and frank the next time you use language that offends my fiancee i will let max bite you show the man your teeth max castillo said then spoke a few words in hungarian while pointing at lammelle max growling deep in his throat walked to lammelle and showed him his teeth lammelle squirmed on the folding chair all the special operators in the room plus lieutenant colonel designate naylor chuckled general naylor thought theres that perverted sense of humor again and allan thinks that threatening to sic that enormous dog on lammelle is perfectly acceptable conduct oh thats right castillo said you havent met my fiancee have you frank sweetheart say hello to frank lammelle he used to be a friend of mine frank the lady is former lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva of the svr and sitting next to her is her brother former colonel dmitri berezovsky of the svr i know youve been anxious to meet them there was a moments silence lester if frank doesnt say pleased to meet you or how do you do in the next three seconds dart him lammelle very hastily said pleased to meet you the special operators and allan junior now laughed colonel regarding the code of honor general naylor said goddamn it im smiling what the hell is happening to me yes sir i dont know what your intentions are here but i think i should tell you that when i am no longer constrained by my parole i will feel free to relate to the proper authorities anything i see or hear here yes sir thats understood its not a problem sir as you remain herein other words not in a position to tell anyone anythinguntil this operation concludes castillo looked around the room i think i should make it clear before i start thatas much as i know i could have used his wise counseli did not ask general mcnab for any assistance in coming up with this plan the code of honor would have precluded him giving me any assistance youre wrong about that charley mcnab said naylor glared at him on the other hand castillo ignoring the comment went on i have been privileged over the years to watch general mcnab plan and execute maybe two dozen operations such as this one what im doing now is praying that enough of his expertise has rubbed off on me so that this one will work he looked at svetlana and i meant that sweaty about praying that wasnt a figure of speech i know my carlitos svetlana said okay here we go castillo said statement of the problem we have to interrogate general yakov sirinov to determine how much congox the russians have to do this we have to bring the general plus whatever congox he has in his possession here we know from satellite imagery that general sirinov went from here to the airfield on la orchila the island off the coast of venezuela the latest satellite imagery we have as of ohsixhundred today no longer shows the tua aircraft but does show half a dozen of the spetsnaz operators near what appears to be one of those canvasandpoles throwitupovernight hangars it is therefore reasonable to presume the tua is in the hangar it is unlikely that sirinov would leave the spetsnaz in venezuela colonel roscoe danton said you never said where are you getting the satellite imagery castillo nodded thats another of those questions roscoe that id like to answer but i know danton said youd have to kill me if you did right castillo said now as far as personnel go were going to use as few americans as possible colonel berezovsky said that we stand a good chance if we have the element of surprise on our side and use our exspetsnaz people to confuse sirinovs spetsnaz to the point where their efficiency will be substantially reduced explain that to me charley general mcnab said softly dmitri and our spetsnaz get off the plane the chopper whatever we wind up using dmitri points to the nearest of sirinovs spetsnaz and says i am colonel berezovsky take me to general sirinov dmitri thinks and sweaty thinks and i agree theres a good chance we can get away with that if we do we stick a pistol up sirinovs nose and if you dont mcnab asked then we can probably disarm sirinovs spetsnaz or if necessary take them out you dont want to start by taking them out mcnab said were trying to avoid taking anybody out castillo said berezovsky put in i think going in there with guns blazing would be counterproductive general and possibly disastrous we dont know what would happen if one of those rubber barrels was subjected to machinegun fire we dont want little pieces of congox scattered all over that airfield good point mcnab said what did you say charley about whatever we wind up using that sounds like youre not planning to use the black hawks we may not be able to use them castillo said the closest staging point we can use is cozumel and that island is thirteen hundred nautical miles give or take from la orchila the ferry range of a black hawk is in the book at twelve hundred we might be able to stretch that to thirteen hundredwe probably could dick and i have a lot of time in black hawks watching the fuel exhaustion warning light blinking at usbut that would put us in la orchila with dry tanks auxiliary fuel cells general naylor asked i dont know where i can get any sir castillo said and even with fuel cells wed have to top off the black hawks and the fuel cells at la orchila that would take twenty minutes at least i dont want to be on the ground more than fifteen minutes and thats presuming we would be able to refuel at la orchila so what is your alternate plan mcnab said overload the gulfstream iiii can get a lot of people in there maybe fifteento go in under the radar at first light and hope dmitris take me to general sirinov order dazzles sirinovs spetsnaz then we load him and what congox he has on his tua and come back here what would happen to your gulfstream naylor asked sir maybe there would be fuel there and time to refuel unlikely but possible if not sparkman leaves with what fuel remains and heads for barranquilla colombia and we get on the tua and come here charley mcnab asked softly what would your wish list be for this operation general weve given that very subject a lot of thought castillo said if i had my druthers id commandeer four uhms from the onesixtieth special operations fleet two to use and two for redundancy all with stub wings and external tanks they would be armed with gau fiftycaliber gatling guns and agm hellfire laserguided missiles to take out the commo building he paused and then went on and since i have been a very good boy i would like santa to also bring me a red ryder bb gun and an anatomically correct barbie doll mcnab dallessando and allan junior laughed well you asked me castillo said and oh i forgot an aircraft carrierpreferably the uss ronald reagansitting somewhere out there on the blue caribbean so that i and my stalwart band could have a last meal on the navy before we sallied forth to battle the forces of evil this got the expected laughter but since i dont believe in santa claus i guess well have to go with my tired old gulfstream iii among other things i suspect were running out of time how much time do you think you have general naylor asked seventytwo hours tops sir if i had to bet id wager that in fortyeight hours the tua will be on its way somewhere somewhere sir i have no idea where it will go maybe cuba i just dont know general naylor then suddenly said colonel castillo i herewith inform you i am withdrawing my parole oh for christs sake allan general mcnab said disgustedly now what yes sir general naylor castillo said evenly i regret to tell you sir that i am placing you under arrest colonel castillo are you still determined to proceed on an operation that not only is unauthorized but in my professional opinion is suicidal sir i see going ahead with this as my duty i beg you sir please dont get in my way general naylor nodded then said colonel brewer make note of the time yes sir its fourteen twentyeight sir general naylor went on make note of this please colonel brewer write it down quote having at fourteen twentyseven withdrawn my parole at fourteen twentyeight in the realization that i was not going to be able to deter lieutenant colonel castillo from proceeding on an unauthorized operation involving congox in venezuela i came to the conclusion that my duty lay in increasing his chances of success as the failure of his operation would cause more damage to the united states than its success sir i dont understand castillo said get me on a secure line to my headquarters at macdill and it will be made clear to you colonel the two looked into each others eyes for a long minute do what he says carlos svetlana said softly castillo turned to lester bradley and ordered give the air pistol to uncle remus lester and get a secure line to macdill aye aye sir where will the general be calling from mexico city naylor said i wish to speak with my deputy general albert mcfadden usaf lester looked at castillo for permission and when castillo nodded said aye aye sir and put it on the loudspeaker naylor said office of the deputy commander central command sergeant major ashley speaking sir this line is secure lester announced general naylor calling for general mcfadden one moment please hello boss where the hell are you mexico city albert and you know why im here yes sir i do naylor moved to the map on the wall whats the navy got capable of refueling four uhms in the area of eighteen degrees north latitude eightyfive degrees west longitude i need it there no later than tomorrow what the hell is going on allan dont ask questions please answer mine but dont ask any and this conversation goes no further than your ears understand yes sir just a moment general i can have the uss bataan at that point by sixteenhundred hours sir tell me about the bataan its a waspclass amphibious assault ship general mcfadden said i know the class thatll do fine make sure its on station as of oheighthundred tomorrow alert them top secret to be prepared to receive and fuel four uhms yes sir sir im guessing this is a black operation about as black as it can get hold one albert general naylor said and turned to mcnab general mcnab i presume the four uhms will be coming from fort campbell yes sir mcnab said and joined naylor at the map wheres the best jumpingoff place for them to fly out to the bataan would you say sir can we use the navy base at key west mcnab asked general im the commander in chief of central command of course we can use nas key west albert yes sir tell boca chica airfield to be prepared to receive the black hawks and order them to keep their mouths shut about it yes sir ill get back to you albert general mcnab needs the phone sir how do i get in touch with you you dont ill check in with you periodically naylor out lester mcnab then said get me the onesixtieth special operations aviation regiment at fort campbell kentucky make it look like im calling from washington yes sir general naylor looked around the room why do i feel im basking in the approval of a number of people who five minutes ago thought i was a chickenshit sonofabitch dad lieutenant colonel designate allan naylor jr said why dont we all try to forget what you were five minutes ago two the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february good morning mr president john powell the director of the central intelligence agency said as he walked into the room youre here to tell me that the russians and castillo are now en route to moscow right no sir i regret that i am not but there have been some interesting developments mr president that suggest were a good deal closer to that solution of the problem than we were at this time yesterday lets hear them before a national park service policeman finds another beer barrel of that stuff at nine hundred ohio drive southwest mr president nine hundred ohio drive the lincoln memorial jack you dont know where it is the president looked very pleased with himself jack he went on we promised that russian sonofabitch whats his name the rezident murov sir sergei murov we promised murov his two traitors and castillo several days ago if i were this guy i would be wondering why that hasnt happened and if i were this guy i think i would be tempted to leave another barrel of this stuff somewheresay at nine hundred ohio drive southwestas a little reminder you heard what that fort detrick scientist whats his name the black guy colonel hamilton sir colonel j porter hamilton had to say about how dangerous this stuff is yes sir i did i dont want any more barrels of congox popping up anywhere you understand yes sir of course now with that in mind tell me about the interesting developments sir general naylor has been heard from where is he sir according to bruce festerman who the hell is he festerman is the cia liaison officer with central command at macdill mr president weve been on the phone a halfdozen times since yesterday afternoon and general naylor called general mcfadden his deputy from mexico city and ordered that a ship the uss bataan which is a waspclass amphibious assault ship be moved to a location in the caribbean and be prepared to receive and refuel four black hawk helicopters he also ordered the navy base at key west to do the same thing in other words be prepared to receive and refuel four uhs it seems clear sir that the helicopters will be flown from key west to the bataan why i dont know sir what i suspect is that general naylor has learned where castillo andor the russians are somewhere in mexico and is going to go get them and what does lammelle think sir thats a development i dont quite understand what development dont you understand sir the gps transmitter in lammelles shoe places him aboard the queen of the caribbean a cruise ship which is now in the caribbean bound for malaga there has been nothing from him and the gps transmitter in castillos laptop places him aboard a river steamer on the danube between budapest and vienna right yes sir and now youre telling me general naylor thinks hes found castillo in mexico i am making that inference sir i cant imagine why else general naylor has well the president interrupted one possibility is that lammelle has suddenly decided he needs a vacation and taking a cruise is the way to do that but sitting around here jack with nothing to occupy my mind i have been thinking of all the bad spy movies ive seen over the years to see if anything in them might be useful sir for example do you think its possible that somebody shot lammelle with that whizbang dart gun of his and then loaded him onto the cruise ship why would anyone want to do that sir youre suggesting that castillo im suggesting general naylor might have done it or more likely now that i think about it general mcnab why would they want to do that sir to keep him from fucking up what theyre doing to put castillo and the traitors in the bag i dont think thats likely mr president tell me about castillo on the river steamer you sent people over there right yes sir and what have they found out the ship is called stadt wien powell said it plies the danube back and forth between budapest and vienna i already know that the question is is castilloand maybe the russianson it or not weve learned that castillo never made a reservation on it that wasnt the question we dont know mr president did it occur to your people to go aboard the damned ship and look for him they couldnt get a ticket mr president and without a ticket you cant get on the stadt wien apparently sir you have to make reservations at least two weeks in advance powell hesitated and then went on what the stadt wien is mr president is somewhere the viennese and the budapesters take their romantic interests for an overnight trip not always their wives if you take my meaning its very popular jesus christ jack castillo hasnt been over there two weeks how the hell could he have made a reservation on this hungarian love boat mr president all i can tell you is thats where caseys gps locator shows he is presumably fucking the woman traitor as they cruise up and down the danube jack listen closely i dont think castillo is anywhere near europe i think naylor and mcnab have found him in mexico and presuming neither the cia nor ambassador stupid get involved and fuck things up for themthe more i think about it naylor or mcnab did shoot lammelle with that dart gun and load him on that cruise ship to get rid of him president clendennen interrupted himself took a deep breath and then went on jack what i want you to do is get in touch with all your clandestine service officers who are running around chasing their tails looking for castillo and the russians and get them back to langley and then lock them in naylor is going to bag castillo if you dont get in the way you understand me yes mr president the next time you walk in that door jack i want you to tell me that youve just learned from general naylor that hes dealt with the problem and i dont want to see you until you can do that three cozumel international airport isla cozumel quintana roo mexico february dick miller and dick sparkman had flown the policia federal preventiva uh from drug cartel international to cozumel they had carried with them all but two of the exspetsnaz special operators and all the weapons and other equipment that would be needed both pilots had been more than a little pissedand vocally sowith their assigned tasks in the operation miller had wanted to fly with castillo in the uh in the assault and sparkman had simply presumed until the last minute that he would be jake torines copilot when the tua was flown out of la orchila uncle remus leverette had similarly taken for granted that he would be in on the assault and was more than displeased with his assigned role he was now to hold the fort at laguna el guaje it was more than a figure of speech there was a small but real chance that some members of the drug carteleither not having heard or not caring that drug cartel international was closedwould drop in if this should happen uncle remus would politely suggest to them that they come back another daysay in a weekand if that didnt work he would take the appropriate measures the drug runners would if possible be disarmed placed in plastic handcuffs and confined if the disarmament option didnt work they would be eliminated to assist him in this task in addition to the two exspetsnaz operators uncle remus had mr vic dallessando former gunnery sergeant lester bradley and lieutenant pegleg lorimer retired former special forces sergeant aloysius f casey and generals naylor and mcnab were to be the reserve force general mcnab had voiced no objection to this but everyone knew if there was shooting mcnab would be in the middle of it lieutenant colonel designate naylorhaving been told that he would be useless on the actual assault due to the fact that he a was a tank driver b had no special operations training and c spoke no russianfirst pleaded to be taken along then when his pleas fell on deaf ears he said very unkind things to colonel castillo colonel castillo forgave the outburst kissed him on the forehead and charged him with sittingliterally if that became necessaryon the deputy director of the cia mr lammelle all of those remaining at drug cartel international had come to seeif very reluctantlythat there was no valid argument against castillos logic in making the assignments the more the operation was polished the more it became apparent how much success would depend upon dmitri berezovskys ability to dazzleor at least substantially confusegeneral sirinovs spetsnaz until they had a pistol up the generals nose castillo didnt plan to open his mouth but if he had to his russian was so fluent that people thought he came from saint petersburg none of those being left to hold the fort spoke the language so well and although uncle remuss russian was nearly as good as castillos there were very few russians as black as god had made uncle remus colonel jake torines russian was very limited but he could read the lettering they would find on the instrument panel of the tua navigation of the airplane would be by the casey gps system installed on their laptops max as he was wont to do suspected his master intended to leave him behind so when castillo sweaty dmitri and roscoe j danton got into the cessna mustang for the flight to cozumel they found max already lying in the aisle looking at castillo with melancholy eyes that melted his masters heart what the hell when we leave cozumel ill chain him to the seat sparkman will be flying this back he and sweaty can deal with him he likes them that did not come to pass when the policia federal preventiva uh had been refueled at cozumel and after castillo had spent an hour explaining the cockpit specifically and the aircraft generally to colonel torine he had climbed out to see how the loading of the spetsnaz was going he found that everybody had changed into their combat uniforms which were in fact commercially available summerweight camouflagepattern hunting jackets and trousers they and the khaki trousersyellow polo shirts everyone wore at laguna el guaje had been purchased at three walmarts in mexico city distrito federal by pegleg lorimer who had charged them to his lcbf corporation american express card pegleg reported on his return from his shopping trip that his purchases had just about wiped out the stocks in all three walmart stores when that information is sent by the walmart computers to walmart headquarters in bentonville arkansas pegleg said the company will rush to replace the deleted stocks this in turn will result in a gross overstock of khaki trousers yellow polo shirts and summerweight camouflagepattern hunting clothes in mexico city walmart executives will be baffled but i strongly suspect that ol jack walton pegleg concluded will be smiling down at us from that great watering hole in the sky pleased that we outfitted this operation from his daddys store john waltonson of the founder of walmart and at his death the eleventhrichest man in the worldhad earlier in his life been awarded the nations third highest award for valor the silver star while a special forces sergeant in vietnam among those donning their walmart combat uniforms was former lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva of the svr who was rolling up the sleeves of hers when castillo came around the nose of the black hawk max was lying on the floor of the black hawks cabin watching with his head between his legs what the hell do you think youre doing castillo demanded carlos i dont like it when you use that tone to me you and max are going back to the lake on the mustang she pointed at the runway castillo looked the mustang was beginning its takeoff roll well svet you got that past me but now you can wait here youre not going of course im going wherever did you get this idea i wasnt honey for christs sake we dont know whats going to happen at la orchila people are likely to get hurt did you ever think generalissimo carlitos she snapped you poor mans von clausewitz what would happen if one of sirinovs spetsnaz takes dmitri out the moment we land when you speak russian you sound like a saint petersburg poet she wet her finger and ran it over her eyebrow the gestures meaning unmistakable youd make the spetsnaz giggle i was a podpolkovnik of the svr and i sound like one i know how to deal with spetsnaz and im going after a moments reflection castillo asked and max you want to take him too i suppose podpolkovnik alekseeva absolutely you get max to show his teeth to yakov sirinov the way you did to lammelle and hell wet his pants i may not even have to hurt him castillo considered that a moment and then asked have you got a weapon of course ive got a weapon she snapped still angry ive always got a weapon you should know that youve been looking up my dress from the day we met castillo had an immediate very clear mental image of that day svetlanas skirt had risen high as she nimbly jumped from the tracks of viennas sudbahnhof onto the platform revealing that she was wearing red lace underpants with a small pistolhe later learned it was a colt pocket model acpholstered on her inner thigh just under them roscoe j danton walked up not to worry charley he said i understand colonel alekseeva was speaking off the record roscoe sometimes he makes me very very angry sweaty said jake torine walked up i didnt hear that either torine said and then went on its about time for us to get going charley four the uss bataan lhd north latitude west longitude the caribbean sea february almost as soon as he spotted the bataan castillo saw that four black th soar uhm helicopters were already sitting on her deck their rotors folded i think i should tell you first officer that the bataan has a very impressive array of weaponryincluding four fortymillimeter gatling gunswith which to discourage strange and possibly hostile aircraft from approaching torine gave him the finger and activated his microphone bataan this is keystone kop keystone kop bataan be advised we have you in sight go ahead castillo said what he meant to say first officer was gunsights well bataan torine spoke into the microphone if you have us in sight then i guess i dont have to tell you i estimate we are at one thousand feet about two klicks off your stern request permission to land keystone kop are you carrierqualified torine looked at castillo lie jake we dont have enough fuel to go back to cozumel affirmative we are carrierqualified keystone kop be advised that bataan is headed into the wind the wind down the deck is at twenty knots acknowledge bataan keystone kop understands wind down the deck is at twenty and bataan is headed into the wind keystone kop you are cleared to land be advised a rescue helicopter is to port i think he knows we were lying torine said you really have never done this before only as a passenger castillo said and what i think the pilot told me that day was that if the wind across the deck is at say twenty knots and youre indicating twenty knots that means youre in a hover over the deck which relatively speaking has an air speed of zero as castillo very carefully lowered the black hawk onto the decki am really in a ground effect hover even if im indicating that im making twenty knots how can that behe found it easier to look at the ground which was to say the deck of the uss bataan out the left window of the cockpit rather than the deck forward of the helo that way he could tell relatively speaking if the bataan s island was movingin which case he was in troubleor not and when he did he saw that he knew several of the ths night stalker pilots they were standing arms folded waiting for him to crash on the deck next to the superstructure that was the island one of thema tall graying hawkfeatured man wearing like the others the black flight suits favored by the thhe knew well and he knew that hanging from the zipper of arthur kingsolvings black flight suit was the subdued insignia of his rank castillo couldnt see it but knew it was the black eagle of a full colonel the black hawk touched down you can exhale now jake castillo said as he reached for the rotor brake control were on the ground more or less art kingsolvings here i noticed i hope you are going to tell me you outrank him no i dont but your question is moot active duty officers always outrank retired old farts i dont know about you but i think of myself as a prematurely retired young fart castillo said and there is a welcoming delegation torine said why dont you go deal with them while i finish shutting this thing down the navy delegation consisted of the officer of the deck a chief petty officer and two petty officers one of them the masteratarms and the other a medic they quite naturally had decided that the senior person aboard the helicopter with mexican police markings would be riding with his staff in the passenger compartment and lined up accordingly the first personmore accurately the first living thingto exit the helicopter was an enormous black dog closely followed by a redheaded woman in battle dress who was screaming angrily at the dog in what sounded like russian close on her heels came a man holding a camera who began to snap pictures of the navy delegation the helicopters on the deck and the dog who was now wetting down the front right wheel of the helicopter the copilots door opened and for a moment decorum returned as colonel jake torine usaf retired came out popped to rigid attention faced aft and crisply saluted the national ensign then he did a crisp leftface movement raised his hand to his temple and holding the salute politely announced i request permission to come aboard sir in compliance with orders very well the officer of the deck said returning the salute then he said sir the captains compliments the captain requests the senior officer and such members of his staff as he may wish attend him at that point protocol broke down the army pilots who had been standing next to the island came trotting across the deck including the one that the officer of the deck knew to be a full colonel ill be a sonofabitch if charley didnt steal another one one of the night stalkers shouted this time from the mexican cops another of them clarified zip your lips colonel kingsolving snapped he then turned to the officer of the deck mister i need a word with colonel castillo before he attends the captain on the bridge colonel when the captain requests this time hes just going to have to wait kingsolving said and then turned to castillo who having exited the helicopter was now exchanging hugs pats on the back and vulgar comments with the pilots colonel castillo colonel kingsolving called sternly i need a word with you right now castillo freed himself marched up to kingsolving came to attention and saluted follow me colonel kingsolving ordered and marched down the deck until they were alone face away from the island kingsolving ordered castillo turned his back to the ships superstructure all mcnab told me kingsolving said was to send the black hawks out here via key west the op commander will meet your senior pilot on the bataan your name wasnt mentioned you didnt hear i was retired yeah and when we have time i want to ask you about that senior pilot castillo asked im not supposed to be here charley the first time i talked to him mcnab told me i was not to go and then he called me back and said if i was thinking of having a case of selective deafness the brigadiers selection board is sitting right now and if this op gets outeven if it goes as plannedi can forget a star youre here castillo said you dont want to be a general two reasons charley im one of those oldtime soldiers who doesnt send his people anywhere he wont go himself mcnab was right even if i can carry this off i think theres going to be serious political implications because you stole that helicopter from the mexicans because for example the last time i saw frank lammelle earlier today he was wearing plastic handcuffs and vic dallessando was sitting on him ouch charley how long is this operation of yours going to take with a little bit of luck we should be back on the bataan by oheightthirty tomorrow back from where where youre going to do what just the highlights castillo told him now im really glad i came kingsolving said i told you there were two reasons i suffered temporary deafness the captain of the bataan tom lowe is a really good guy ive done a couple of operations with him obviously the more he knows about this one the better all around the problem with that is i dont want him standing at attention before a whitesuit board of inquiry trying to explain why he knowingly participated in an obviously illegal operation how do you want me to handle that there is a way but i suspect that as a fellow marcher in that long gray line it will really bother you the code of honor dont you know try me i lie cheat and steal all the time and spend a lot of time hanging out with others that do would you be willing to swear on a stack of bibles that the only thing you told lowe was where you wanted him to have the bataan and when and aside from assuring him that it was a duly authorized wholly legal operation didnt tell him anything else absolutely thank you charley for what youre the guy who just watched his star disappear down the toilet one more question who the hell is the redhead would you believe my fiancee no how about shes an svr lieutenant colonel i thought female svr lieutenant colonels weighed two hundred pounds and had stainlesssteel front teeth come on weve got to see the captain can i bring my dog request permission to come onto the bridge with a party of officers kingsolving said from the door to the bridge you and your party of officers have the freedom of the bridge colonel kingsolving captain thomas j lowe usn said he was a man in his late thirties tall and deeply tanned castillo marched up to him stood tall and announced his voice raised captain i am lieutenant colonel c g castillo i regret that the nature of the mission i have been ordered to carry out by the united states central command is such that i can tell you very little except where we wish you to place your vessel and when welcome aboard the bataan colonel captain may i introduce my officers certainly but may i suggest that we deal with first things first where do you want the bataan and when if you have a chart sir right this way colonel captain lowe said and led castillo into the chart room colonel this is my navigator mr dinston mr dinston was a lieutenant junior grade who looked like he was nineteen the two shook hands show mr dinston where you want us to go colonel captain lowe said castillo bent over the chart table found la orchila island and then put his finger on the map fifty miles east of that island he said i want to be there at ohthreethirty tomorrow whats on that island mr dinston asked im sorry but you dont have the need to know castillo said yes sir sorry sir dont feel bad jerry captain lowe said neither do i he met castillos eyes as he spoke plot the course jerry captain lowe ordered and bring it to the wardroom aye aye sir before we get started castillo said when everyone was in the wardroom and the door had been closed captain lowe was never in this room nor anywhere else when any aspect of this operation except where were asking him to place his ship was discussed everybody got that there came a murmur of yes sir would you like to say anything captain before we get started housekeeping captain lowe said could i get my chief in here and get the cabin assignments out of the way captain you dont have to ask me permission to do anything castillo said this is your ship i know captain lowe said im being nice colonel kingsolving told me he thinks that most of you will shortly be in jail the chief looked as if he had been in the navy for longer than anybody in the room was old and he got right to the point how many ohsixes we got raise your hands please kingsolving and torine raised their hands dmitri castillo said raise your hand then he explained colonel berezovsky is a russian chief they dont do ranks by numbers not a problem the chief said there are three staterooms for visiting ohsixes youll find the keys in the doors we also got three staterooms two officers per for ohfives and ohfours how many ohfives castillo raised his hand two chief he said and pointed at svetlana youre an ohfive the chief dubious asked her svetlana looked at castillo for guidance he nodded and captain lowe seeing this said colonel anything you can tell me you can tell the chief i am a former podpolkovnik of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki chief petty officer sweaty said just a little arrogantly yes maam the chief said okay so we put you maam in one of the ohfive staterooms and colonel castillo in the other leaving one how many ohfours we got excuse me chief petty officer former podpolkovnik alekseeva of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki said put lieutenant colonel castillo in one of those ohfive staterooms with me excuse me you seem surprised sweaty said dont officers of the us navy sleep with women sometimes colonel some of us do captain lowe said grinning broadly you heard the colonel chief get on with it the chief recovered quickly and the remaining accommodations were parceled out among the other officers there was one captain the rest of the ths pilots were warrant officers the chief left closing the wardroom door behind him castillo laid his laptop computer on the table and opened it overview he said the target is on the airfield on the venezuelan island of la orchila the targettargets pluralare a russian general named yakov sirinov whom we are going to snatch the tua aircraft which he flew onto la orchila and the cargo that that bird carried he looked down at the computer saw that it was on and tapped several keys these are the latest satellite images of the target he went on then leaned over for a closer look and added as of fortyfive minutes ago you have imagery like that on your laptop captain lowe asked yes sir lowe bent over the laptop how could a poor sailor get a laptop like that lowe asked well i could give you this one castillo said affecting a serious tone but then i would have to kill you with one exception the others in the room laughed it was an old joke but it was theirs the exception was former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki captain she flared you will have to excuse colonel castillo he never grew emotionally after he entered puberty whenever there is serious business at hand he makes sophomoric jokes what is this dissension in the ranks castillo asked or the beginning of a lovers quarrel sweaty let loose a thirtysecond torrent of angry words in russian dmitri berezovsky laughed then said captain gentlemen permit me to offer an explanation in our family my mother used to say that what my sister needed more than anything was a strong man who would take her down a peg or two on a regular basis she has finally found such a man and doesnt like it this produced from sweaty another torrent of vulgar and obscene russian language if our mother ever heard her speak like that berezovsky went on which on occasion she did our mother would wash her mouth out with laundry soap this was too much for the men in the room who had been studiously ignoring the exchange most of them chuckled and several laughed sweaty redfaced opened her mouth to deliver another comment colonel castillo said very softly zip your lip one more word and youre out of here and off the operation carlito and sweaty locked eyes for a very long moment and then wordlessly she sat down castillo turned to the laptop if youll gather around here please he said youll see that while the tua is not visible there are spetsnaz guarding this canvas temporary hangar which makes it fairly certain that the tua is inside now this is what were going to do please hold comments until ive finished i want to arrive at first light some five minutes later when castillo had finished he said okay comments please but im not going to start with the juniors the way a good commander is supposed to were starting at the top captain lowe your thoughts please lowe took a full thirty seconds to consider his response theres a maybe tenminute period during which we will be recovering the uhs that worries me well be headed slowly into the wind if venezuelan air force or navy aircraft find us with our hand still in the cookie jar so to speak but theres nothing we can do about that and insofar as being attacked after we recover the choppers that would be an unprovoked attack on a us navy vessel in international waters which is an act of war i dont think they would do that and of course were able to defend ourselves pretty well thank you sir colonel kingsolving charley the only question in my mind concerns the uh you stole from the mexican cops what are you going to do about that torch it well sir first i didnt steal it i bought it you bought it you going to tell me about that castillo told him unbelievable kingsolving said but back to my question what are you going to do with it torch it ill tell you what id like to do with it castillo said id like to fly it back out to the bataan and then the first time the bataan goes to its homeport where is that captain lowe norfolk and as soon as we finish this operationthis is day fiftysix of a sixtyday deploymentwell be headed there at fastest speed consistent with available fuel then the first thing captain lowe does when he docks the bataan at norfolk will be to lower the mexican uh onto the wharf while the mexican ambassador and the state department idiots who sold it for a tenth of its value to the mexicans watch they thendid i mention that our own roscoe j danton will be there as will the evervigilant cameras of wolf newsthey will attempt to explain how that particular uh after having died a heros death in mexicos unrelenting war against the drug cartels was resurrected thatd work charley danton said and im so personally pissed as a taxpayer about that bullshit that i will even arrange for c harry whelan that sonofabitch to be there with me then why not do it kingsolving asked one small problem sir who would fly it out to the bataan jake and ill be flying the tua back to the land of the free and home of the brave with only a fuel stop at drug cartel international ill fly it kingsolving said sir i have painful memories of standing tall before you while you lectured at length on the inadvisability of flying uh aircraft without a copilot i seem to remember you telling me with some emphasis that anyone who did so was an idiot charley if i went in with you on the mexican uh and then flew it back out here that means we would have to land only one of the th choppers in there to take your spetsnaz back to the bataan that would reduce the danger that one of my guys would dump one of ours at la orchila causing god only knows what consequential collateral political damage you dont see any risk like when your guys take out the commo building as i understand your plan colonel the idea is for my guys to hit the commo building in the dark so they will never learn what happened to them or who did it castillo was silent for a moment next came dissension in the ranks of the th special operations aviation regiment pilots four of the night stalkers just about simultaneously spoke without permission they all said about the same thing colonel let me fly that fucking mexican chopper to which colonel kingsolving replied zip your lips or nobody gets to go there was another period of silence visavis my counseling you on the inadvisability of flying uh aircraft without a copilot colonel kingsolving said i meant every word of it but there is an old military axiom that im really surprised you did not learn at our beloved alma mater to wit when you are the senior officer you are in certain circumstances permitted to say do as i say not as i do im going to fly that mexican uh back and forth to the island of la orchila charley period there goes your star you realize that thought did run through my mind frankly but what the hell if they made me a general theyd say i was too valuable to fly myself anywhere with or without a copilot and i dont want to fly a desk in the pentagon then he looked at captain lowe i think were through here captain is the navy planning on feeding us lunch five the uss bataan lhd the caribbean sea february former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva was not in sight when lieutenant colonel c g castillo entered the stateroom he was not really surprised she had not spoken a word to him at lunch then had spent the entire afternoon with the spetsnaz somewhere below deck presumably checking their equipment and seeing to it they understood their roles in the operation they had had a conversation of sorts at dinner may i please have the butter she had asked him of course he had said my pleasure thank you she had said ending their conversation now alone in the stateroom castillo decided that she had run down the old chief and told him she had changed her mind about sharing his quarters earlier captain lowe had shown him the bataans sick bayactually a small fully equipped hospitaland while doing so castillo had noticed there were sleeping quarters for nurses shes probably in one of those he took off his walmart battle dress and lay down on the lower of the two bunks the room offered ill take a shower at he decided not now taking one then will wake me up he closed his eyes if you think were going to make love without you taking a shower think again former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva announced not sixty seconds later he opened his eyes she was standing beside the bunk bed wearing a thin cotton bathrobe am i permitted to say im a little surprised charley asked after having regained his breath perhaps ten minutes later in eight hours the venezuelans may have the both of us stretched out on a wooden table the way your green berets stretched out che guevara svetlana said i did not want to spend all eternity knowing that i had had the chance to spend my last hours making love with you and threw it away good thinking he said right now i dont like you very muchhow dare you talk to me the way you didbut i love you he had a wildly tangential thought wheres max she pointed max was lying with his head between his paws on the staterooms small desk nearly covering it and looking at them how longs he been there charley asked he was sleeping under the bunk but you were making so much noise i guess you woke him up one the uss bataan lhd north latitude west longitude the caribbean sea february i have a confession to make sir castillo said as a man wearing a soft leather helmet and goggles and holding illuminated wands crossed on his chest approached the uh with policia federal preventiva markings the black hawk helicopter was sitting with rotors turning at the extreme aft portion of the bataans flight deck this is not the place my son but make sure you see me before you take communion colonel kingsolving said playing along i think you better follow me through sir castillo went on his tone serious something wrong charley kingsolving asked now with concern in his voice i think you better follow me through sir castillo repeated or take it too late to take it kingsolving said theres the go signal if you dont want to abort ill follow you through here we go castillo said he lifted off hovered for a moment and then reduced forward speed from twenty knots to ten the deck moved out from under the aircraft at a speed of ten knots and a moment later he was looking at the stern of the bataan the uh dipped its nose toward the sea picked up speed and then began a steep climbing turn to the right into the dark sky you all right you want me to take it charley ive got it im all right now castillo said out his window he could see one of the ths black hawks being quickly pushed to the aft of the flight deck interesting departure kingsolving said whered you learn how to do that at pensacola what i was going to confess sir was that i dont have very much experience in nightlaunching a uh from a carrier oh shit kingsolving said after considering that for a moment please dont tell me that was your first yes sir i wont tell you that i had a look at your flight records charley while they were trying to make up their minds whether to give you the medal or courtmartial you the last time you manifested suicidal behavior involving a uh you remember that when you went after dick miller if i thought that going after dick was suicidal i wouldnt have done it you were the only aviator in afghanistan who didnt i was astonished to see that as long as youve been flying youve never dinged a birdgetting shot down not counting never not any kind of a bird do you have an explanation for that clean living and a pure heart you dont think what you did just now was suicidal straight answer please no i didnt you following me through on the controls took care of the safety factor and now i know how to launch at night in a uh from a carrier you never know when that might come in handy kingsolving didnt reply kidnapper one and two keystone kop castillo said to his microphone im going to circle the ship at two thousand feet join up on me five hundred feet behind two la orchila island bolivarian republic of venezuela february it was just getting light as the three uhs approached the island castillo estimated he would be on the ground in three minutes give or take one of the ths black hawks following him would lasertarget the commo building and report when it had done so but would not fire until castillo gave the order the other would hover over the airfield to the left of the hangar it would be prepared to clear the tarmac in front of the hangar with its gau caliber gatling guns if the spetsnaz guarding them offered significant resistance castillo had spent a good thirty minutes trying to impress on its pilots that a disaster beyond comprehension would occur if the fire from their weapons struckwhich would virtually atomizethe blue barrels they had come to seize he thought he had succeededthe chief warrant officers flying the gunship were both veteran special operators not excitable young men and both wore the wings of master army aviators i wonder what general buckneror his fatherwould think of this colonel kingsolving said of what castillo asked our assault on the bolivarian republic of venezuela bolivarian makes reference of course to general simon bolivar the great liberator what the hell are you talking about general simon bolivar buckner senior west point class of class of was a confederate general he was forced to surrender fort donelson kentucky to his classmate general ulysses grant buckner gave grant his parole and was later exchanged i thought about that when you told me about general naylor giving you his parole thanks for sharing that with me colonel his son kingsolving went on general simon bolivar buckner junior hudson high class of was the most senior officer killed in combat in the pacific during world war two he was commanding the tenth army on okinawa when struck by japanese artillery over their headsets suddenly came keystone kop kidnapper one i have my laser on the target acknowledge kidnapper one keystone kop acknowledges you have target acquisition castillo answered they are both i believe buried at west point kingsolving went on well maybe theyll bury us there keystone kop kidnapper two has a visual on armed and moving possible belligerents kidnapper two keystone kop acknowledges you have visual on possible belligerents hold fire until i clear acknowledge kidnapper two acknowledges hold fire kingsolving said id rather thought youd prefer interment beside your father in the national cemetery in san antonio if those spetsnaz waving those kalashnikovs at us start shooting them were both probably going to be buried right here castillo said and then remembering what sweaty had said the night before added after were displayed on a table like hugo chavezs hero che guevara he waited another two seconds then said kidnapper one engage engage he then switched to the intercom to alert berezovsky and his four exspetsnaz waiting in the back of the uh with mexican federal police markings dmitri well be on the ground in three seconds ve con dios he heard what he had said and thought ill be goddamnedi meant that go with god dmitri jesus h christ are sweaty and her brother turning me into a believer he saw the exhaust flare from the first hellfire missile race through the air and then from another and then from a third theres not going to be much left of that communications building castillo then touched down and immediately unfastened his seatshoulder harness try not to get shot moving over here to the pilot seat he said and then he was out the black hawks door he reached back in and grabbed his uzi then went quickly around the nose of the helicopter passing kingsolving as he did castillo found that there was a sort of a standoff on the tarmac dmitri berezovskywith his four exspetsnaz standing behind him more or less holding their weapons at port armswas facing a halfdozen men wearing the striped shirts of the spetsnaz armed with a variety of weapons i asked whos in charge berezovsky said more than a little arrogantly and then there was a female voice lower that expletive deleted muzzle you expletive deleted moron former svr podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva shouted what the expletive deleted is wrong with you raising a weapon to polkovnik berezovsky are you as expletive deleted stupid as you look the muzzle was lowered one of the spetsnaz stepped forward saluted and said major koussevitzky sir stefan berezovsky said i didnt recognize you good to see you again polkovnik may i ask what we are here to arrest general sirinov berezovsky said where is he in the hangar sir i regret that the circumstances require that i take your arms berezovsky said lower them to the ground you are here to arrest the general polkovnik koussevitzky asked softly i regret that is necessary but im sure you know why koussevitzky considered that a full twenty seconds before he unstrapped his pistol belt and let it fall to the ground then put his kalashnikov automatic rifle on the tarmac you heard polkovnik berezovsky he said to his men lower your weapons to the ground berezovsky waited until the order had been complied with and then spoke to one of the exspetsnaz standing behind him have those weapons put aboard the helicopter he ordered and then turned to koussevitzky take me to the general stefan berezovsky ordered then he pointed to sweaty to one of his exspetsnaz and to lieutenant colonel c g castillo usa retired and said you come with me castillo said yes sir in russian hoping he didnt sound like a saint petersburg poet of indeterminate sexual orientation the tua was inside the canvaswalled and roofed temporary hangar so were four very small travel trailers being used as makeshift barracks as they walked toward the trailers general sirinov came out of one of them he was dressed but he needed a shave i guess we woke the sonofabitch up general consider yourself under arrest berezovsky announced i dont know what you think youre doing berezovsky sirinov said he seemed to be unfazed by what was happening please turn around and put your hands behind you berezovsky said as he took a plastic handcuff from a pocket i will not sweaty holding max on his leash beside her walked up to him while doing so she took her colt acp model from her pocket and the beautiful svetlana sirinov said wherever did you get that absurd uniform and that dog turn around yakov and put your hands behind you sweaty ordered or what youll shoot me with your toy pistol sweaty aimed her toy pistol quickly and shot general sirinov in the right foot he looked at his bleeding foot then screamed with the pain and fell to the ground looking up at her in enraged disbelief roll onto your stomach yakov or ill put the next round into your other foot sweaty said max growled general sirinov rolled onto his stomach berezovsky knelt beside him and applied the plastic handcuffs sirinov was moaning in pain if you dont give me any more trouble when were on the plane ill give you some morphine sweaty said where are the pilots of the airplane berezovsky asked koussevitzky koussevitzky pointed to one of the trailers get them out here berezovsky ordered then he pointed at castillo and ordered get our pilot in here castillo said yes sir in russian and hoped his conscious attempt to sound like a basso profundo had been at least partially successful he went onto the tarmac saw jake torine and waved him over he saw that sirinovs spetsnaz were now all sitting on the tarmac they had plastic handcuffs around both their wrists and their ankles they dont look worried they look terrified and so did the tua pilots when they walked up to berezovsky castillo went to them and ordered show the colonel and me around the airplane if you do anything suspicious podpolkovnik alekseeva will shoot you in the foot youre going to fly the tua one of them blurted thats the idea castillo said start by opening the ramp door when the ramp came down castillo could see there were three blue barrels firmly strapped to the floor plus a tracked forklift inside up the ramp he ordered when they were in the cockpit castillo asked where are the rest of the blue rubber barrels he believed the pilots when they assured him with almighty god as their witness that there were no more blue rubber barrels anywhere it was a very brief cockpit tour just long enough for the tua pilots to show torine and castillo the engine start procedures and to tell them the best rotation speed during takeoff general sirinov still moaning with pain was carried aboard and attached with plastic handcuffs to the strapping holding the blue plastic barrels in place torine stayed in the cockpit while castillo led the pilots and sweaty off the airplane he saw that berezovsky and koussevitzky were in a far corner of the hangar he and sweaty walked to them i have offered to take stefan with us berezovsky said understandably he is concerned with what putin would do to the family of a traitor there are six unmarried spetsnaz who should come with us stefan suggests we make it appear they are coming involuntarily major castillo asked what makes you think putin wont it would help if podpolkovnik alekseeva found it necessary to shoot me koussevitzky said well i suppose castillo said there was the pop of her toy pistol and koussevitzky fell to the ground bleeding from a wound to his right upper leg well try to get you and your family out stefan sweaty said really try may god protect you and yours svetlana koussevitzky said and yours sweaty said berezovsky knelt beside him and put him in plastic handcuffs how do we get the hangar doors open castillo asked you have to push koussevitzky furnished theyre like curtains what happens if we start engines in here youd burn the hangar down good idea get everybody out of here berezovsky ordered and then get the spetsnaz were taking with us firmly tied up and ready to get on the uh get aboard sweaty castillo ordered ill get aboard when you do she replied there was no time to argue with her castillo went outside the hangar and made hand signals toward the sky to order the night stalker black hawk codenamed kidnapper two to land push the hangar doors open podpolkovnik alekseeva ordered in a russian command voice that would have passed muster at fort bragg and then help polkovnik berezovsky clear the hangar as soon as the doors had been pushed aside castillo heard the whine of a tua engine being started and he saw kidnapper two cargo doors slid open coming down the runway almost on the ground it touched down two of berezovskys exspetsnaz carried major koussevitzky out of the hangar and lowered him to the ground twenty meters from it then they ran back into the hangar as he heard the whine of the second tua engine being started the exspetsnaz came back out of the hangar leading the tuas pilots their hands in plastic handcuffs they deposited them next to major koussevitzky one of them then ran back into the hangar the other ran across the tarmac to where a halfdozen spetsnaz in handcuffs were sitting roscoe j danton appeared furiously capturing everything for posterityafter of course it was published in the washington timesposton his camera two of the exspetsnaz pulled one of the handcuffed spetsnaz to his feet and loaded himnot very gently threw him aboard would be a more accurate descriptiononto the policia federal preventiva uh and then threw two more of the spetsnaz aboard roscoe j danton captured this too with his camera one of the exspetsnaz looked at castillo and svetlana he wants to know if he should load the others aboard sweaty said castillo pointed across the tarmac and ordered put those three on the helo coming in and then get on yourself castillo then ran twenty yardswith max bounding happily after himso that colonel kingsolving could see him clearly from the cockpit of the policia federal preventiva uh then he made hand signals telling kingsolving to take off the helicopter immediately broke ground lowered its nose and moved away gaining speed kidnapper two stopped still not touching the ground where an exspetsnaz stood waiting with the remaining spetsnaz men bound with plastic handcuffs roscoe j dantons camera was at the ready to capture what happened next as soon as the first of the handcuffed spetsnaz had been assisted aboard a blacksuited special operator jumped out of the black hawk and helped the spetsnaz throw the other two aboard the exspetsnaz looked again at castillo for guidance get aboard castillo shouted and then signaled to the pilot to take off as it did roscoe j danton made a photographic record there was a change in the pitch of the tua engines and castillo turned to see that it was moving slowly out of the hangar castillo took one last look around ran to roscoe j danton and tried to lead him to the ramp of the tua mr danton was not sure he wished to go at this time he resisted castillo grabbed the strap of roscoes camera jerked hard on it breaking it and then when roscoe started to protest grabbed the camera itself ran to the open ramp of the tua and threw the camera aboard roscoe then jumped onto the airplane to retrieve his camera while he was so engaged castillo grabbed sweatys arm and led her to the ramp of the tua she leapt nimbly onto it so did max after considering for ten seconds the wisdom of doing so in that time the airplane moved away rolling faster for a very terrifying moment castillo was afraid he wouldnt be so nimble as the love of his life and his dog he ran after the plane and made a running dive onto the ramp landing on his stomach max got to him first and licked his face as he was trying to get up mr danton recorded for posterity max licking his masters face as he lay on the ramp then sweaty pulled castillo to his feet and he moved as fast as he could toward the cockpit max chased after him when castillo got to the cockpit he saw that torine had lined up the airplane on the runway he dropped into the right seat and quickly clamped on a headset closing the ramp torines voice came matteroffactly over the earphones throttles to takeoff power the tua began to move call out airspeed for me first officer if youd be so kind torine said castillo found the airspeed indicator in the split second when the needle jumped off the peg and pointed to forty the landing gear began rumbling thats kilometers the pilots told us rotation speed was onefifty thats not quite a hundred knots you can rotate this great big sonofabitch at a hundred knots is that what you call misinformation was that russian pilot lying to us seventy castillo called out thats klicks jake ninety oneten onethirty onefifty rotating torine said calmly a moment later the rumble of the landing gear died oneninety twoten get the gear up first officer its that lever with the wheel on top castillo found the lever and moved it gear coming up gear up jesus twoeighty now lets see how it climbs torine said as if to himself castillo felt himself being pressed hard against the cushions of his seat torine said no wonder the agency is willing to pay all that moneywhat was it one hundred twentyfive millionfor one of these this is one hell of an airplane first officer castillo had a very clear mental image of sweatyand maybe everybody else in the fuselageall in a pile of broken bones against the closed ramp the pressure on his back against his seat suddenly stopped jake had leveled off put your goddamn harness on torine ordered as soon as he saw that castillo had done so jake dove for the surface of the water castillo now had a very clear image of everybody sliding forward in the fuselage to end in a pile of broken bones against the cockpit door torine read his mind now take the harness off first officer he ordered and go back and see how our passengers are enjoying the flight castillo found all the passengers except two were in their seats dmitri berezovsky was standing beside one of the blue plastic beer barrels examining it thoughtfully sweaty was on her knees beside general yakov sirinov in the process of administering to him what castillo presumed was the morphine she had promised castillo went back to the cockpit and strapped himself in the airspeed and altimeter dials indicated that they were flying at eight hundred and forty kilometers per houror about five hundred knotsat a hundred metersor five hundred feetabove the caribbean sea fuel consumption at that speed and altitude would be horrendous and there was of course the danger that they would go into the drink but on the other hand they didnt have that far to go and at five hundred feet they wouldnt be a blip on anybodys radar screen you want to take it charley while i get my laptop ill get your laptop you drive castillo replied three laguna el guaje coahuila mexico february jake torine carefully nosed the tua into the cave and turned to charley castillo i would tell you to shut it down first officer but im afraid youd break something after that hard landing i expect a lot of it would break easily castillo replied that was a greaser and you know it and did you notice the thrust reversers castillo had had another vision of everybody in the fuselage slamming into the cockpit wall when hed activated the thrust reverser controls the tua had slowed as if it had caught the cable on the deck of an aircraft carrier i noticed he said the agency will be getting a hell of a bargain when the lcbf corporation sells this to them for a hundred and twentyfive million torine said have you considered asking for more dont be greedy jake castillo said wheres the ramp lever general allan naylor lieutenant general bruce j mcnab lieutenant colonel designate allan naylor jr uncle remus leverette vic dallessando lester bradley frank lammelle now wearing shoes and socks and no plastic handcuffs aloysius f casey and a burly man in a business suit were all standing at the foot of the ramp max raced down the ramp barked hello and headed for the landing gear salutes were exchanged as a pavlovian reaction even the burly man in the business suit saluted with his left hand what the hell is that whos that guy castillo wondered he asked so whats happened there had been radio silence during the flight from the island that had been castillos decision once everybody was airborne they were on their own they could neither helpnor be helped byanyone else that being the case there was nothing to talk about what else has happened about what general mcnab asked innocently and then took pity on him all aircraft having been recoveredincluding one mexican uh flown by an officer whose ass i will have just as soon as i can get my hands on himthe uss bataan is proceeding at best speed consistent with available fuel to norfolk castillo smiled then it looks like we got away with it god answered our prayers sweaty said you have the congox general naylor asked yes sir and general sirinov you got away with phase one colonel general naylor said the military part phase two the political part now begins i suspect that will be more difficult and our chances of success less in phase two castillo looked at lammelle hey frank i see they turned you loose more or less how the hell are you and what do you think of this airplane the agency is about to buy leave him alone charley mcnab said congratulations charley lammelle said that was what did you do frank change sides castillo said the last i heard you were going to shoot me with your air pistol and load me on an aeroflot flight to moscow i told you to leave him alone charley mcnab said firmly yes sir dennis general naylor said the man in the business suit took a step forward came to attention and barked sir colonel this is master sergeant dennis he is colonel hamiltons principal assistant he will tell you what he wants done with the congox castillo took a closer look at master sergeant dennis no wonder he salutes with his left handhe doesnt have a right arm what do you need sergeant castillo asked sir colonel hamilton sends his best regards thank you sir where is the congox castillo gestured up the ramp in there behind that frontloader or forklift whatever it is there are three barrels of it is there any more of it colonel general naylor asked were you able to determine that according to general sirinov sir thats all of it i believe him hes telling the truth sweaty said general naylor looked at her how do you know that because he knows that if i find out hes lying sweaty said he will die a very slow and painful death this time with no morphine this time general naylor asked colonel alekseeva shot general sirinov in the foot castillo said and later took pity on him and gave him a shot of morphine she was aiming for his foot right mcnab asked i mean that wasnt a near miss or anything like that no sir she was aiming for his foot i knew she was my kind of girl mcnab said naylor glared at him where is general sirinov naylor asked plasticcuffed to the first barrel behind the cockpit castillo said allan get in there free the general and see what attention he needs naylor said you can go get him sweaty said but do not take off his cuffs and take someone no i will go with you he is a very dangerous man you want me to go get him charley uncle remus asked no castillo said go see if you can operate that forklift or whatever it is sweaty take lester with you tell general sirinov that lesters the fellow who took out lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov and he would like nothing more than putting a bullet in his eye two minutes later general sirinov obviously in pain limped down the ramp supported by allan junior and trailed by lester bradley who held a a colt pistol at his side and by sweaty okay frank general mcnab said lammelle walked to sirinov general he said in russian my name is lammelle does that mean anything to you i know who you are mr lammelle sirinov said in english are you going to answer my questions general or should ifor the time beingsimply have you confined castillo wondered how did lammelle get in the act what the hells going on with him under the circumstances mr lammelle answering whatever questions you have for me seems to be the obvious best option of those pointed out to me by our mutual friend svetlana can you make it to the elevator lammelle asked pointing to it sirinov nodded do you want to go with them colonel castillo asked sweaty of course she said stick with them lester castillo ordered yes sir there came the sound of a diesel engine starting and a moment later uncle remus drove the forklift down the ramp with your permission colonel master sergeant dennis said and when castillo nodded walked up the ramp into the tua four with great skilland very carefullyuncle remus lowered one of the blue beer barrels onto a layer of insulated blankets in the bottom of a pit dug in the floor of the cave when master sergeant dennis unfastened the web straps around the barrel and gave uncle remus the up signal uncle remus raised the arms of the forklift and then backed away from the pit then he stood up and took a bow what would we do without you castillo asked i shudder at the thought uncle remus said and then turned to master sergeant dennis what do you want me to do sergeant get another barrel or help you load the helium on top of this one dennis thought it over before replying it would be better if we got all the barrels in the ground first he said and then put the helium packages the bags on top if one of the bags got ripped and the helium contacted the arms of the forklift they would shatter helium makes a witchs teat look like the sun you got it sarge uncle remus said and steered the forklift back to the ramp of the tua five what we did in the lab colonel master sergeant dennis explained in the dining room of the house after taking a swallow from a bottle of dos equis beer that killed that shit was to expose it to the heliumat minus twoseventy celsius for fifteen minutes and that killed it castillo asked dead as a fucking doornail colonel dennis confirmed then drained his bottle do you suppose i could have another one of these give the nice man another beer uncle remus castillo ordered and then we let it thaw dennis went on it took eight hours and twelve minutes at seventy degrees fahrenheit and it was then really dead castillo said dead fucking dead dennis confirmed but what we dont know colonel is how cold the helium we used just now was it was way the fuck down there but it may not have been all the way down to minus twoseventy celsius so what colonel hamilton told me to do was give it a thirtyminute bath we did that and more the helium is still on the barrels makes sense what are you going to do about thawing it we also dont know about the thawing if we took the helium off now its seventyfour fahrenheit in the caveprobably seventysix or seven by nowso it would thaw faster but it might not be all the way dead if you take my meaning when its thawed faster castillo had a sinking feeling in his stomach so then what do we do its ninetytwo fahrenheit in the sun outside dennis said or was just before you landed its probably a little hotter now what are you suggestingthat we thaw it in the sun castillo asked confused wouldnt that increase the risk that it wouldnt be all the way dead it may be dead now and were just wasting time thawing it what are you suggesting sergeant dennis castillo demanded dennis looked very uncomfortable castillo had an epiphany and softly asked what does colonel hamilton think will happen if congox is thawed rapidly dennis didnt immediately reply goddamn it sergeant what did colonel hamilton say he said that when magicians freeze goldfish with dry ice and then bring them back to life they can do that because they were never completely dead he said that he thinks when you get something down to minus twoseventy celsius its completely dead and you couldnt bring it back even by thawing it in a microwave did he tell you not to tell me this dennis nodded did he say why he said if you heard he said it you would treat it like he was talking in a cathedrali dont know what the hell he meant by thatand base your decisions on that speaking ex cathedra sergeant right if we put one of those kegs in the sun for as long as it takes to thaw it could you determine if the congox was dead here ive got stuff with me thatll let me test it so ill know with ninetypercent certainty whether or not that shit is still alive or not to be absolutely sure wed have to test it in the lab at fort detrick how did you get here sergeant mr casey picked me up in his airplane at baltimorewashington nice airplane and colonel hamilton didnt come why we dont trust the people in the lab they would tell somebodyprobably those fuckers in las vegasthat he was gone so i went to the px called the lab and asked for the day off then i got on the bus and went out to baltimore washington if we put one of those beer kegs in the sun how long would it take to thaw castillo asked let me put that another way how long would we have to leave one of those kegs in the sun before loading it on mr caseys gfive to fly it to fort detrick so that it would be thawed or damned near thawed when it got there i been thinking about that colonel its about seventy fahrenheit in the airplane i suppose you could up that some if you wanted to probably to eighty maybe a little higher castillo said wed have to leave the keg in the sun for two hours fifteen better yet two hours thirty i think it would be pretty well thawed by the time we got it into the lab castillo looked at leverette and said uncle remus will you please help sergeant dennis move one of those beer barrels into the sunsomewhere no one will see it and then you two sit on it he heard what he had said and added correction you dont have to actually sit on it but i want eyes on it all the time you know what youre doing charley hoping that im right that colonel hamilton is right and that master sergeant dennis is right is that enough for you i always like you better when you admit you dont really know what the fuck youre doing uncle remus said lets go dennis six the freezing process i gather is over or nearly so general naylor asked when castillo walked into the war room sir with respect i have no intention of discussing anything about this operation in the presence of mr lammelle general mcnabs bushy eyebrows went up you never learned in sunday school what saint luke said charley there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents et cetera i dont believe this castillo said the sonofabitch wanted to load sweaty dmitri and me on an aeroflot dmitri berezovsky laughed castillo looked at him in disbelief actually general roscoe j dantonwhose smile showed he was enjoying the situationsaid i believe what saint luke actually said was there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents i think i like that better mcnab said i never thought of it before but i could get used to thinking of myself as an angel of god berezovsky laughed again how dare any of you think of yourselves as angels of god sweaty flared but ill concede its a stretch mcnab said i used to wonder where carlitos learned his blasphemous irreverence and childish sense of humor now its perfectly clear i hope god will forgive you general mcnab i wont right now castillo said if sweaty tries to turn the both of you heathens into sopranos id be inclined to help her now who turned frank loose and why and what the hell is he doing in here frank is now on our side mcnab said get used to it let me try to explain this in heathen terms allan naylor jr said one heathen to another like another acquaintance of ours whose name satan himself could not tear from my lips brother frank saw the error of his ways fessed up and is now allied with the forces of goodness and purity and you believe him castillo asked incredulously all of you believe it and you expect me to believe it its true charley lammelle said charley frank obeyed an order without thinking it through general naylor said thats easy to do youre supposed to follow orders whats hard is admitting that you know the order is wrong and then doing something to make it right in franks case that was doubly difficult for him not only did it constitute disobeying the president but he knew he could have just kept his mouth shut and done nothing he knew us all well enough to know we werent going to harm him harming him did run through my mind vic dallessando said we should castrate him with a dull knife he looked at dallessando im with mcnab charley dallessando said sorry castillo said nothing but instead he is putting his career on the line general naylor finished castillo thought that shoe fits your foot too doesnt it is that what happened to you uncle allan he asked softly naylor met his eyes but said nothing colonel jack brewer broke the silence the generals question colonel castillo he said was whether the freezing process has been satisfactorily completed castillo hesitated well has it sweaty demanded castillo looked at her for a long moment then at lammelle and then back at sweaty what choice do i have the answer to that is we dont really know he said what master sergeant dennis told me so what do you want to do general naylor asked when castillo had related what had happened just before hed come to the war room in two hours i want to put sergeant dennis and the beer keg thats thawing in the sun in aloysiuss gfive and fly it to fort detrick we have to know if the helium has really killed it and the only way to do that is in colonel hamiltons lab fly it to baltimorewashington right lammelle asked eyes jumped to castillo to see how he was going to react to lammelle having asked a question castillo nodded in for a penny in for a pound charley lammelle said if i went with it i could have an agency vehicle itll fit in a yukon right castillo nodded again but didnt speak meet the airplane and personally make sure it gets to fort detrick the only one who could interfere with that or ask me questions i dont want to answer would be jack powell and i dont think jack would actually go out to the airport even if he heard i was coming worst scenario there i think would be powell sending stan waters who j stanley waters deputy director for operations who wants my job and therefore does everything jack tells him to i trust him a little less than you trust me okay we get the stuff to the lab at detrick sergeant dennis tells me hamilton can find out in half an hour whether the congox is really dead and what would you do after you dropped off the congox wait for hamilton to run his tests that would be information id like to have and with which you could head straight for the white house right yeah charley if i were so inclined i could head straight for the white house but what i plan to do is head straight for langley to see what i can learn there and if jack powell does go out to the airport or sends your buddy waters can i have my dart gun back after a perceptible pause during which he wondered again what choice do i have castillo said you know what they say frank in for a penny in for a pound lester give mr lammelle his dart gun there will be room for me on that plane right roscoe j danton said and then he quickly added colonel ive got pictures of that stuff on the tua on the island and what you and uncle remus and the sergeant did to it here id like to follow it all the way to the lab at fort detrick castillo didnt immediately reply and before i go id like to get pictures of you and jake getting on that airplane roscoe went on which raises the question charley mcnab said of flying that airplane across the border and to washington without getting it shot down what general mcnab and i talked about colonel naylor said and what we recommend is that he and i go on the russian aircraft to washington i can call macdill inform them that were coming and get us an air force escort which means the white house will know castillo thought aloud but not the circumstances mcnab said and ill have time to get from baltimorewashington so that i can get pictures of the tua landing at andrews roscoe j danton said and that raises the question of roscoe j danton castillo said what captions will he put under all those pictures hes been taking frankly colonel i dont know danton replied but im sort of like frank ive learned to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys i see were back to a choice between trusting roscoe and killing him castillo said you may think thats funny sweaty snapped but i dont and that unsolicited and unwelcome opinion raises yet another question castillo said what do i do with big mouth here and her big brother sweaty said unkind things to him in russian castillo went on i think the best thing to do is have miller and sparkman take themand the spetsnaz that cousin aleksandr was so kind to loan us plus whichever of sirinovs spetsnaz want to go to argentinato cozumel to meet the peruaire freighter youre out of your mind sweaty said in english i think not charley dmitri berezovsky said you mean you dont think im out of my mind or you dont want to go to argentina i cant wait to get back to argentina you remember that my wife and daughter are there but before this is over we will certainly be talking with the washington rezident sergei murov and perhaps even dealing with vladimir vladimirovich putin himself svetlana and i know them both well i think you need our counsel what kind of passports do you have lammelle asked you mean besides our russian federation diplomatic passports right argentine and uruguayan are they in your names berezovsky shook his head how much inspection will they stand my cousin assures me they were issued by the respective foreign ministries berezovsky said and would your cousin know i think he would who is your cousin if he tells you frank id have to kill you castillo said his name is aleksandr pevsner sweaty said and if your knowing that in any way ever endangers him or his family i will kill you on a threat credibility scale of one to ten i think id rate that as a ten lammelle said and then added well knowing that name explains a lot of things i didnt really understand pevsner is really your cousin our mothers are sisters berezovsky said charley if theyre determined to go lammelle began we are berezovsky said and i agree they could be very useful lammelle went on hide them in plain sight where castillo asked the monica lewinsky motel lammelle said the what sweaty asked if a president of the united states can hide his girlfriend there it should be good enough for mine castillo said how do you plan to get them there i wouldnt want senator johns to hear about this but i have a limo armored with radios et cetera and driven by agency officers lammelle said you want to fly them to baltimorewashington on caseys airplane castillo asked lammelle nodded and general sirinov on the tua if roscoe can get wolf news out there to cover its arrival he would be on tv and murov would see that castillo interrupted but what do we do with him afterward i think general sirinov would be comfortable in the monica lewinsky motel lammelle said and hed be available if we need him and we probably will have you got enough peoplepeople you can trustto handle all this yes i do lammelle said your call charley what other options do i have not manynonethat i can think of lammelle said castillo counted something on his fingers then announced theres room for lester on the tua so he goes too to sit on general sirinov miller and sparkman take the spetsnaz to cozumel as soon as they canin the next thirty minutesin our gthree then come back here and pick up uncle remus and peglegand anybody ive forgotten by then uncle remus and pegleg will have drug cartel international all cleaned up and then they go to baltimorewashington he paused for a good thirty seconds and then asked any comments i want to know about this motel sweaty said youll like it sweetheart castillo said inside plumbing and all the other conveniences one would expect in a motel any other comments there were none okay then thats it thats what well do seven office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia february keep me advised bruce dci john powell said we absolutely cant afford to have this get away from us he took the telephone handset from his ear very slowly replaced it in the base then met the eyes of j stanley waters the ddci for operations festerman says that naylor called central command and ordered that a flight of fs meet him over the gulf of mexico prepared to escort his plane into us airspace and then to andrews where in the gulf of mexico when right in the goddamn middle of it and right now where did he call from mexico city powell said but im not sure i believe that what im beginning to suspect is that caseys communications is not quite as miraculous as advertised or that casey is fucking with us why would he do that maybe because he likes mcnab more than he likes me do we know what kind of an airplane naylor has no and that bothers me too all naylor told macdill is the call sign he told macdill big boy will be at thirty thousand feet moving at five hundred knots that doesnt sound as if thats naylors gulfstream no it doesnt which may be because naylors gulfstream is on the tarmac at macdill i forgot that waters said yeah powell said you think he has castillo or the russians or both well he could be smuggling drugs but id say its likely that he has either or both wouldnt you looks that way what are you going to do powell picked up his telephone this is dci powell get onto whoever would know and get me a track on all aircraft operating over the middle of the gulf of mexico or headed toward the middle at thirty thousand feet and five hundred knots the one im looking for will probably notrepeat nothave a transponder got it he hung up are you going to tell the president john no i thought this would be our little secret he picked up a red telephone and punched one of the buttons on it jack powell mr president i have just learned that general naylor has ordered that a flight of fs mr president i assure you that im doing all thats humanly possible to add to what i know what i just told you yes sir mr president ill leave here immediately yes sir mr president i fully understand that i am to take no action of any kind in this matter without your prior permission eight the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc february the manager on duty who wore a frock coat with a tiny rose pinned to the lapel intercepted the party before they were more than one hundred yards into the lobby mr barlow i am thomas barlow berezovsky said my name is winfield broom mr barlow i am the manager on duty welcome to the mayflower thank you berezovsky said from time to time little mistakes are made but sometimesas nowthey have a pleasant result i dont think i understand well when mr darby called to make your reservations we were of course happy to accommodate him and you but then mr darby called back a few minutes later and asked if mr von und zu gossinger still kept an apartment here i told him he did although we havent seen him for some time and then thirty minutes after that mr von und zu gossinger himself called he said he was skiing in gstaad but that he would be very pleased if you would stay in his apartment while youre here thats very kind of mr von und zu gossinger barlow said right this way please mr broom said gesturing toward the elevator bank this is really very nice svetlana said five minutes later not at all what comes to mind when you hear motel im glad you think so mr broom said now the sauna is separate why does mr von und zu gossinger call this hotel the monica lewinsky motel svetlana asked im sure i have no idea madam mr broom said just a little huffily now if youll please come this way nine old ebbitt grill th street nw washington dc february truman i told you that if we just waited roscoe would inevitably show up ambassador charles m montvale said to mr truman ellsworth looking over his shoulder to the end of the massive bar hello roscoe your office said i could find you here danton said taking a seat next to them at the bar waiting for my masters call roscoe the odds are strongly against it ever coming ill have one of those danton said to the bartender and if these two are not already over their limit give them another what happened to you after we came back ellsworth asked i thought you would never ask danton said and told them and castillos on the airplane with naylor ellsworth said when he finished naylor mcnab and general yakov sirinov that i am having a hard time believing montvale said what if i told you the airplane is a tua even harder to believe charles i think roscoe is serious ellsworth said montvale looked at danton who nodded the plane should land at andrews about nine oclock he said and the russians maybe ill tell you later what i need right now is a way to get onto andrews i think we could arrange that ellsworth said and i submit charles that we are indebted to roscoe id like to see this myself montvale said and i would like somehow to get in touch with c harry whelan that sonofabitch and get him and wolf news out there danton said that also i can handle ellsworth said hes been driving us crazy wanting to talk to us the ambassador has qualmswhich i frankly dont shareabout embarrassing the president the office of the president montvale corrected him i would happily embarrass clendennen but i cant figure out how to separate in the mind of the people the asshole from the office he holds the obscenity and a general slurring of speech confirmed to danton that the ambassador and ellsworth had been at the bar for some time danton looked at ellsworth with a raised eyebrow the ambassador is no longer on the red phone circuit ellsworth said the president wont even return the ambassadors calls and we no longer have access to the white house yukon fleet that sonofabitch danton said he has also taken to referring to me as ambassador stupid montvale said the director of national stupidity ellsworth said you wouldnt look stupid charles if you were at andrews when castillo and company arrive true ive got some caveats danton said i dont want to get into the congox business until lammelle has a chance to deal with murov the rezident my people have been baring their hearts to you havent they roscoe montvale asked what id really like to do is have sirinov on wolf news being carried off the tua carried off he has been injured sweaty shot him in the foot danton said sweaty former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva of the svr danton said and where did this altercation occur i cant tell you that not now i dont want to be responsible in any way for any congox being released anywhere montvale said thats not a problem we know how to kill it weve killed all the russians have hamiltons got some in his lab but the russians are out of ammo how do you know that montvale asked softly his speech danton noticed was no longer slurred frank lammelle told me thirtyfive minutes ago he was then at fort detrick montvale considered that a moment and then said truman be so good as to call mr whelan tell him i will agree to be interviewed tonight providing that it is on my terms and that he and a camera crew are outside in thirty minutes my pleasure ellsworth said if he agrees i will spend that thirty minutes getting those terms from roscoe and drinking black coffee i understand that the only thing that black coffee does to a drunk is make him a brighteyed drunk but perhaps c harry whelan who is not too bright will not notice if whelan agrees to come call the limousine service and have a car outside in thirty minutes yes mr ambassador truman ellsworth said as he took his cell phone from his pocket ten the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february dci jack powell put his hand over the telephone microphone mr president that airplane is on final approach to andrews have they got cameras out there i want to see it the president said wolf news does mr president presidential spokesman jack parker said and when the president turned pointed to one of the televisions mounted on the wall the monitor showed a flashing bannerwolf news breaking news andrews air force base washington dcand an image of the tua making its approach turn the fucking sound up porky im not psychic the stirring strands of the william tell overture filled the presidents study shit the president said then asked what kind of an airplane is that i believe thats a tupolev tua mr president powell said where the hell did naylor get that the president asked rhetorically wolf news cameras followed the airplane as it touched down and until its landing roll took it far down the runway then c harry whelan and roscoe j danton appeared on the screen good evening this is c harry whelan what we all have just seen is the landing of a supersecret russian airplane the tupolev tua and standing with me is my good friend the distinguished prizewinning journalist roscoe j danton of the washington timespost who knows the details of this incredible intelligence accomplishment what the hell is he talking about the president asked thank you harry danton said patting whelans back almost affectionately the cia has had a longstanding offer of one hundred and twentyfive million dollars to anyone who could bring them one of these airplanes that prizei see the deputy director of the cia franklin lammelle standing over there beside our director of national intelligence ambassador charles m montvale both of them wearing big smiles they were the brains behind this incredible operation what the hell is lammelle doing out there with ambassador stupid the president asked i thought he was with naylor getting castillo and those russian traitors i dont know mr president dci powell said has apparently just been claimed by two recently retired american officers colonel jacob torine us air force and lieutenant colonel carlos castillo us army oh for christs sake the president said where did they get it roscoe whelan asked from an island off an unnamed south american country how do you know that roscoe im proud to say i was with them harry but you wont identify that country i dont think id better at this time harry but you are telling the millions of wolf news watchers that these two former officers retired officers harry all right roscoe old buddy retired officers these two retired officers invaded an unnamed south american country invaded harry implies boots on the ground we were on the ground twelve minutes and twentytwo seconds you really cant call that an invasion can you and stole this supersecret russian airplane i think that they like to think they took possession of it harry and now the cia is going to pay them one hundred and twentyfive million dollars thats what franklin lammelle told me earlier today weve heard that general allan naylor is aboard that airplane true as soon as they reached american soil they turned it over to the military i dont really know what happened after that but i can guess please guess roscoe for the millions of wolf news viewers around the globe watching this exclusively on wolf news i would guess that general naylor decided the tua belonged in washington and that since colonel torine and colonel castillo were the only ones who knew how to fly it well that makes sense whelan said oh look here it comes get a shot of that the monitor showed the tua taxiing to where whelan and danton were standing then the aircraft turned around the engines died and the ramp started to slowly open a siren was heard and then an ambulance appeared on the screen an ambulance c harry whelan said looks like someone on the towhatever you said tua harry yes i would say that the appearance of an ambulance would suggest theres someone in need of medical attention two men in white coats got out of the ambulance and ran up the ramp moments later they came out carrying an unconscious man on a stretcher lester bradley walked beside them whos that roscoe whelan asked i have no idea danton said i dont speak russian and he doesnt speak english who the fuck was that on the stretcher the president of the united states inquired the guy on the stretcher mr president was general yakov sirinov dci powell said what happened to him roscoe another russian shot him i dont think hes seriously wounded the stretcher was loaded into the ambulance colonel torine and lieutenant colonel castillo appeared in the door acknowledged the applause of the air force personnel and then trotted down the ramp with max beside them they got into the ambulance which immediately drove off generals naylor and mcnab appeared in the ramp door walked down it and got into a staff car i want those two bastards here in thirty minutes the president ordered i want mr president porky parker said may i respectfully suggest that we have to carefully consider the ramifications of this president clendennen glared at him the next time those two sonsofbitches go to fort leavenworth theyll be in handcuffs on their way to the army prison porkys right mr president dci powell said if weve invaded some south american country if if you just heard roscoe j danton tell the whole goddamned world we did putin was probably watching us carry that general we kidnapped off that fucking airplane we stole or is watching it being replayed for him as we speak parker said im told the ministry of information tapes wolf news and then distributes the significant stories around the kremlin thats true mr president dci powell said i really think we should get the secretary of states input on this so we can decide how to react well get her here in thirty minutes secretary cohen is in new york at the un mr president porky parker said at a reception for president chavez of venezuela and if you plan to arrest general naylor mr president dci powell said i think we ought to hear what the attorney general has to say andor the secretary of defense maybe we should all give this some thought mr president overnight porky parker said collect all the facts and then say at ten tomorrow morning we really dont want to act precipitously in the heat of the moment dci powell said the president looked between them for a good thirty seconds before saying okay ten tomorrow morning just make sure theyre all here he then walked out of the presidential study slamming the door behind him a moment later there was the sound of a vase falling to the floor or perhaps of one being thrown against a wall eleven the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc february there is another more elegant name for it in keeping with the elegance of the mayflower itself but most people think of it simply as the lobby bar its on the left of the hotel and has windows opening on the desales street sidewalk it offers morning coffee and a simple but of course elegant breakfast menu there were perhaps twenty people in it when sergei murov walked in over here sergei frank lammelle called he was standing beside one of the tables near the window there were three men and a woman sitting at the table thank you for coming sergei lammelle said as murov approached the table i know it was more than a little inconvenient for you anything for you frank murov said i dont think you know this fellow but i understand youve been anxious to meet him charley say hello to sergei how do you do colonel castillo murov said in english as he sat down franks been telling me a lot about you sergei castillo said in russian but not that you look like cousins my carlitos sounds as if hes a saint petersburger wouldnt you agree sergei sweaty asked she put her hand out murov rose bowed took her hand kissed it and then sat down svetlana you are even more lovely than i remembered murov said and of course you and dmitri are old friends right lammelle said we have known each other for a very long time murov said but perhaps acquaintances would be the more accurate term charleys right berezovsky said you and frank do look like cousins a waiter appeared with a silver coffee service on a tray and poured a cup for murov lovely place the lobby bar isnt it sergei lammelle asked i come here often murov said so i expect youll miss it excuse me as soon as he gets to his office your ambassador will be getting a call from secretary of state cohen she will suggest to him that it would be best if you voluntarily gave up your post here and returned to moscow today if that is not acceptable you will be declared persona non grata in that case you would have seventytwo hours to leave the country but you will be leaving sergei is that why you asked me to come here frank to tell me that no actually it was to ask a favor of you i want you to take something to moscow for me when you go and see personally that it gets into the hands of mr putin what would that be it looks like a blue rubber beer keg castillo said i happened to come across it on a little island off the coast of venezuela not to worry sergei sweaty said its quite dead it would be nice if you dropped it on yakov vladimirovichs foot but i dont want to kill you or him or anyone else that way murov lost his diplomatic composure its dead as a doornail castillo said and thats why id like you to take it to mr putin so he can see that for himself and the sooner the better of course lammelle said today rather than insisting on the seventytwo hours to which you are entitled before being expelled if you look out the window sergei you will see that the beer barrel is being loaded into your mercedes suv right now castillo said murov looked theres just a little more sergei im sure you have by now seen the wolf news report you cant miss it its been on since last night then you probably noticed that nothing was said about congox murov nodded not a word about general sirinov jumping spetsnaz into the congo to see if wed missed any congox when we took out the fish farm lammelle said not a word about him personally flying into el obeid airport in north kurdufan sudan on a tua when they did find some that we missed not a word about the seventeen bodies he left at the airfield when he took off for what we now call drug cartel international airport in mexico not a word about him watching as pavel koslov the mexico city rezident loaded the two beer kegs you sent to fort detrick into a mexican embassy suburban for later movement across the border not a word about his then flying to la orchila island in venezuela with what was left of the congox we have movies of most of this sergei castillo said and general sirinov has decided its safer for him to be here talking to frank than it would be for him in moscow trying to explain his failure to vladimir vladimirovich berezovsky said and are you also talking to frank dmitri murov asked i could tell you no but you wouldnt believe me we can keep it that way sergei lammelle said if vladimir vladimirovich agrees that getting into the question of congox would not be good for either russia or the united states keep it that way well your ministry of information could deny the whole thing they could say it wasnt a brilliant intelligence operation that they had sold the tua to whats the name of that corporation charley lcbf the lcbf corporation castillo furnished who then turned a quick profit by selling it to the cia no one would believe that murov said there are always some people who will believe anything sweaty said including that vladimir vladimirovich is a fool i dont quite understand my dear svetlana sorry frank svetlana said i know how much you and sergei love to show each other how brilliant and civilized you are but ive had enough of it which means murov asked you tell vladimir vladimirovich that i said that if so much as a thimbleful of congox turns up anywhere or if i even suspect hes trying to hurt any member of my familyand that includes my carlitos of coursei will make sure that every member of the svr learns in detail how reckless and incompetent he is and if he thinks this is an idle bluff tell him to watch what happens if koussevitzkys wife olgahes a spetsnaz major i shot him in the leg and left him on that islandand the entire koussevitzky family are not in budapest within seventytwo hours of your arrival in moscow ill have two out of three svr officers giggling behind vladimir vladimirovichs back whispering that what he did when he was head of the kgb in saint petersburg was close his door and write poetry she wet her index finger with her tongue and ran it over her eyebrow dmitri lammelle said youre right her bite is worse than her bark in other words what youre proposing is an armistice murov said on one hand castillo said i dont believe in the tooth fairy putins going to have a hard time swallowing what weve done to him he may not be able to on the other hand theres been an armistice in korea for fifty years during which fewer people on both sides have been killed than would have died if the war was still on ill take my chances with that you tell putin what svetlana said murov looked at castillo and then at svetlana he stood its been very interesting seeing you again he said he offered his hand to lammelle and berezovsky and to meet you colonel he said offering his hand to castillo he then waited for svetlana to put out her hand which took a good fifteen seconds he bowed and kissed it and it has been a joy to spend a few minuteshowever stressfulin the company of the most beautiful daughter of the motherland i have ever known but now i must leave i have a plane to catch he walked out of the lobby bar castillo lammelle berezovsky and svetlana looked out the window and in a moment murov appeared he walked to the mercedes suvthe driver of which had taken advantage of the diplomatic privilege of parking wherever the hell the impulse strikes and it was now blocking the curbside lane of desales streetjerked open the rear window to the cargo area looked inside and then slammed the window closed he got in the passenger seat slammed the door and then the mercedes drove off castillo looked at svetlana she said you heard what he said about the most beautiful daughter of the motherland what i want to know is what all you russians have against saint petersburg poets lammelle stood and said and now youll have to excuse me i have an appointment at the white house twelve the situation room the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc february im so glad you could join us mr lammelle the president said sarcastically sir its a longer walk here from the monica lewinsky motel than i remembered my apologies for being late no problem if you remembered to bring your resignation with you ill give it verbally and leave right now if that is your desire mr president lammelle looked around the room it was nowhere near close to capacity the secretaries of state and defense were seated at the large table as were the director of central intelligence the attorney general the director of the fbi the director of national intelligence and his executive assistant and generals naylor and mcnab plus of course the presidential spokesman mr jack parker youll leave when i tell you that you can take a seat lammelle lammelle sat down secretary of state natalie cohen stood up leaned across the desk and laid an envelope before him whats this the president demanded my resignation mr president she said i havent asked for it yes i know she said and sat down general naylor stood up leaned across the table and laid an envelope on the table thats my resignation sir he said the president looked at general mcnab well well what mr president arent you going to offer your resignation no sir you didnt think i was going to let you get away with what you did did you i dont know what you mean mr president you know goddamn well what i mean clendennen flared youve been in this up to that goddamned mustache of yours placing the entire country in danger sir i dont understand maybe after the goddamn russians open barrels of congox all over the country you will sir thats just not going to happen the russians dont have barrels of congox excuse me general frank lammelle said the russians do have one barrel of congox its dead but i suppose you could still call it congox or maybe i should have said the russians have one barrel of dead congox i gave it to mr murov who is going to take it to moscow later today to show it to mr putin youre telling me there is no longer a congox threat clendennen asked incredulous with the exception of a couple of quarts of live congox in colonel hamiltons laboratory at fort detrick general naylor said there is no congox anywhere in the world colonel castillo seized all that the russians had when he staged the raid on la orchila island in venezuela colonel hamilton will continue to experiment with it to see if he can find a better way to kill it why wasnt i told of this clendennen demanded angrily because no one who knew you trusted you mr president you had proven you were susceptible to russian blackmail natalie cohen said i saw it as my sworn duty under the constitution to thwart your announced intentions and did so and now madam secretary you have resigned the president said what are your intentions now are you going to write a book go on wolf news frankly sir i havent made up my mind but i must tell you sir that i do not share ambassador montvales qualms about embarrassing you personally or the office of the president madam secretary presidential spokesman jack parker said have you butt out porky the president snapped youre supposed to be a goddamned fly on the wall and thats all no sir thats not true i took the same oath secretary cohen did may i continue sir or would you like my resignation right now after a moment the president said go on goddamn it madam secretary have you considered the public relations aspects of what will happen when word gets out that you have resigned that general naylor has resigned and as i strongly suspect he will ambassador montvale has also resigned yes i have she said what are you suggesting that i not resign sorry jack i just dont have the desire to deal anymore with the president ambassador montvale are you going to resign parker asked yes and im aware of the collateral damage all of this might cause the country but i can no longer in good faith serve a man who tried to do what the president would have done had not colonel castilloand othersstood up to him im going to put my two cents in here the attorney general said im a lawyer were trained to compromise you want it all at once or in pieces go slowly please montvale said dryly im known as ambassador stupid you know my take on this whole thing is that its an intelligence failure mr ambassador the attorney general said i think that jack powellthe cianever really met its responsibilities if they hadnt insisted that laboratory in the congo was a fish farm and if that womanthe vienna station chiefhadnt scared those two russians off with her incompetence we would have learned about it from them instead we had this keystone kop businessand it would be funny if the circumstances were not so terrifyingof everybody chasing colonel castillounsuccessfully chasing himall over the world while he did the venezuelan operationin essence the cias workfor them he stopped in midsentence and caught his breath and since i know you well enough mr ambassador to refuse to believe that had you known about thishad jack powell promptly told you what you were entitled to knowyou would have taken the appropriate action and none of us would be sitting at this table this morning now wait a minute powell protested so powell has to go the attorney general went on to be replaced by lammelle who instead of assisting in the presidents plan to arrest castillo and swap him to the russiansand the illegality of that boggles the mindworked with general naylor and castillo and solved the problem of congox i cant take credit for that lammelle began shut up frank im not finished if i had to search the world for the two people who most detest joshua ezekiel clendennen and at the same time have an unparalleled knowledge of what he should be doing id come back with natalie cohen and charles m montvale so natalie withdraws her resignation and the president announces he has chosen charles m montvale as his vice president thats insane the president of the united states said mr president if it goes the other way if secretary cohen and general naylor resign porky parker said and i do and mr lammelle does and it comes outand it willthat you were willing to cave in to the russians the congress will be drawing up articles of impeachment within seventytwo hours and we all remember the last time that happened the attorney general said it was a disaster for the country yes it was president clendennen said and with that in mind for the good of the country for the good of the office of the president i am inclined to accept ambassador montvales offer you miserable goddamned shameless hypocritical sonofabitch natalie cohen exploded it was the first time anyone in the room had ever heard her use anything stronger than darn her face flushed excuse me she said and then looked at montvale mr ambassador this may be one of those situations where if we dont stand up to what we know are our obligations and leave those who take our offices may be worse for the country you think i should take it natalie montvale asked she nodded i think you should take it and if you do ill stay do it charles please truman ellsworth said ill take your offer of the vice presidency mr president on the following conditions first that you decline secretary cohens resignation agreed of course for the reasons second that you decline general naylors resignation i never asked for it in the first place third that you send truman ellsworths name to the senate for confirmation to replace me as director of national intelligence of course i have always held mr ellsworth in the highest poss fourth that mr parker make the announcement that i am your choice to be vice president of the united states within the next three or four minutes before you can change your mind or otherwise squirm out of doing so squirm out ofmr montvale now i think youre just insulting me and and finally montvale went on visavis lieutenant colonel retired castillo and his merry band of outlaw what about castillo it was clear that even saying his name left a bad taste in clendennens mouth montvale said i think the cias distinguished intelligence cross would be appropriate for him i know hes never actually been in the cia but as the attorney general has pointed out he has been doing their work for them so i think its appropriate president clendennen whitefaced and tightlipped glared at him but said nothing and for colonel torine colonel hamilton and mr leverette the cia distinguished intelligence medal seems fitting montvale went on and for everyone else in castillos merry band of outlaws who played a role in this the cia intelligence star wouldnt you agree mr president for the rest of his life neither the future vice president of the united states nor any of the other people in the room would ever forget the kaleidoscope of emotions that passed over clendennens face before he finally opened his mouth and said the one word yes
