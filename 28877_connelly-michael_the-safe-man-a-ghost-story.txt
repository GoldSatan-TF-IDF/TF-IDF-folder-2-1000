the safe man a ghost story michael connelly little brown and company new york boston london the safe man the house on shell island was as its owner had described it over the telephone large and white with black shutters and wide porches running the length of both the first and second floors the house had two dormer windows that creased the roofline like eyebrows raised in surprise or maybe anger the columns that sustained the double layer of porches looked like teeth below those eyes brian holloway parked his van on the left side of the turnaround and got out without any of the tools he would need it was his routine to meet the client first survey the job and provide an estimate then come back to the van for the appropriate equipment if he secured the job it took two rings of the bell and a hard rap from the brass lionshead knocker before anyone answered the door it was a man in blue jeans and a sweatshirt he was barefoot he was cleanshaven and brian guessed they were of similar age late thirties maybe a little older the man had a scowl on his face didnt you see the sign he asked the sign the man pointed to a small brass plaque posted beneath the mailbox to the left of the door it said all service at side door there was an arrow pointing to the right uh no sorry i didnt i will see you over there and could you move your van to the driveway on the side as well it was a question but it wasnt spoken as a question sure the man abruptly closed the door brian walked back to his van trying to hold back his anger he reminded himself it was a job and yes he was after all in the service industry he moved the van to the driveway that went down the side of the house and widened in front of a threecar garage he found the service door and headed toward it as he walked he looked across the expansive backyard to the view of the open bay the same man from the front door opened the service door before he got there are you mr robinette brian asked though he recognized him from photos on the back of his books yes that is right you are the safe man i assume yes sir brian could see robinette eyeing his van he realized he had forgotten to attach the magnetic signs to the side panels he worked out of his househis garage actuallyand neighbors complained about having a commercial van parked there all the time so he painted the van a pleasing pale blue and went with magnetic signage the problem was he often forgot to put the signs on when he went out on a call dont you have any tools robinette asked i like to look at the job first then figure out what i need brian replied follow me then robinette led him down a back hallway that went through a kitchen that looked as though it had been designed to serve a restaurant or maybe noahs ark he counted two of everything ovens stoves sinks even dishwashers they moved through a vast living room with three separate seating areas and a massive fireplace finally they came to a library a room smaller than the living room but not by much three of its walls were lined floor to ceiling with shelves the books were bound in leather and the room smelled musty there were none of the bright colors brian saw on book jackets whenever he went into a bookstore he didnt see any of robinettes books on the shelves in the center of one end of the room was a large mahogany desk with a computer screen on it a bust of sherlock holmes sat on a stack of white paper as a paperweight in front of the desk was a persian rug of primarily maroon and ocher without a word robinette used his foot to flip up the corner of the rug he then kicked the fold back until the rug had been moved aside to reveal a small rectangular door set in the wood flooring brian estimated that it was two feet by one and a half feet the door was old plywood and there was a finger hole for pulling it up and open there were no hinges that brian could see robinette reached down and pulled the door up he then used both hands to lift the plywood inset out the opening revealed another door a few inches belowthe black steel facing of a safe with dusty gold filigree at the edges a brass combination dial and a hammeredsteel handle robinette crouched next to the opening and reached down and gave the steel handle a solid tug as if to show brian it was locked this is it he said can you open it brian crouched down across the opening from robinette and looked at the box he could see writing in gold script beneath the combo dial he braced his hands on the floor and leaned down closer to read it it looked like it said le seuil but he wasnt sure what he was sure of was that he didnt recognize the safe or its manufacturer let alone know how to pronounce its name he gave the dial a turn just to see whether it was frozen and it turned smoothly that wouldnt be a problem he straightened up until he was kneeling on the floor next to the opening i dont recognize the make offhand brian said in a perfect world id have a design schematic it always helps to know what youre getting into but dont worry i can open it i can open anything how much will it cost unless i find it in one of my books its probably going to be a double drill i charge onefifty for the first and a hundred for the second jesus youre killing me i might get lucky with the first drill you never know just do it i want that thing open too many people have seen it brian wasnt sure what he meant by that do you have any idea how old this thing is he asked the house was built in twentynine i assume that it came with it brian nodded you said on the phone you just bought this place thats right the former owner didnt give you the combo do you think youd be here if he did brian didnt answer he was embarrassed by his stupid question robinette continued as if he had not asked a question it was an estate sale the old man who lived here died and he took the combination with him nobody even knew there was a safe until i had the floors redone before moving in now all the painters the electricianseverybody who was working on this place to get it readyknows i have a safe in here you ever read in cold blood i think i saw the movie thats the one with robert blake playing a killer before he supposedly became a real killer right thats right its the one where they kill a whole family to get to the fortune in the safe only there isnt any fortune every one of those workers who was in here went out and told who knows who about the safe ive got in here i started having dreams me with a gun to my head being told to open up a safe i dont know how to open i know these guys i write about them i know what theyre capable of ive got a daughter i want that safe open i dont even want a safe i dont have anything to put in it brian had never read one of paul robinettes novels but he knew before he ever saw the house that he was successful hed seen stories about him in the local papers and national magazines hed seen a couple of the bad movies based on the books robinette wrote crime novels that were bestsellers though brian didnt think there had been a new book in the stores in a long while brian was willing to accept him as an amateur expert on the criminal mind but he didnt think that qualified robinette as an expert on the character of painters and electricians and floor refinishers well mr robinette whatever the reason i will get it open for you good then after you get it open can you get it out of here the whole safe thats what were talking about isnt it brian looked down at the edges of the safe the steel framing went under the flooring he was pretty sure the houses out on the island were built on fillthe coral and shells dredged up to dig the barge channel leading to the phosphate plant youve got no basement here right he said no way under the house no no way then it looks like id have to tear up the floor it goes over the lip of the box this wood is so old youd never match it but i guess you could keep it covered with the rug no i dont want to tear up the floor ive spent enough on the floor what about the door can you just take it off i could leave it with just the plywood on top cover it back up with the rug once i get it open i can take it off if you want but why you might as well just leave it unlocked three words in cold blood things could go wrong i want the door taken off go get your tools yes sir brian started out of the room excuse me are you being sarcastic robinette asked brain stopped and looked at him uh no sir im just going to get my tools by the way its going to get really loud in here when i start drilling and hammering it might last a while toodepending on the thickness of the front plate beautiful ill work in the upstairs study in the van brian looked through all his manuals and catalogs for a listing on le seuil or anything close to it he found nothing he called barney feldstein who worked in san francisco and was the most knowledgeable box man he knew and even barney had never heard of the maker he put brian on hold and checked the archives of the box man website when he came back on he had nada what brian wished was that he could talk to his old man about it if anybody knew the safe maker it would be him but that was impossible it took a request from a lawyer to set up a phone call and a letter was useless he needed advice right now resigned to the idea that he would go in blind he gathered his tools and went back into the house robinette was still in the study he was gathering some files from the desk to take with him upstairs i couldnt find anything in the manuals and i called a guy whos been doing this longer than anybody i know in the business brian said he never heard of this safe company either so ill do my best but its looking like a double drill explain to me why you have to drill it twice robinette said impatiently ive got to pop out what they call the free wheel its the locking gear to do that i have to drill through the front plate so i can hit it with a spike with most safes i know where the free wheel is i have design manuals i can look it up i then come through with the drill pop the gear and open the safe with this one im going in blind ill take an educated guess but most likely ill miss ill then snake it with a camera find the right spot and drill it again youre sure youre not just taking advantage of me here what how do i know this isnt some kind of scam designed to get the double dip or the double drill as the case may be brian was thinking that he ought to pick up his tools and just walk out leaving the arrogant writer with his unopened safe you open it asshole but he needed the moneylaura was planning to take the option of extending her maternity leave by four unpaid weeks besides he was curious about the safe hed have something to post on the website after he got it open look he said to robinette if you want to go out to the van and look in the manuals and try to find this be my guest robinette waved off the suggestion no never mind just get it done come to the bottom of the stairs and call for me when you are about to open it i want to be here to see what that old fool blankenship put in there arthur blankenship this was his house yes thats right did you do work for him no i just knew of him he owned the plant his father dug the channel yes thats right the blankenships made this city what it is today ill be upstairs he left the room carrying his files with him brian shook his head he hated working for assholes but it was part of the job he turned and looked down at the safe every job was a little mystery he wondered when the black steel door was last opened he wondered what arthur blankenship had put in there the first thing brian did was strap on his kneepads he then got down on the floor and contemplated the spacing between the combo dial and the handle he took a piece of white chalk out of his toolbox and marked an x on the door about three inches to the right of the dial on a direct line to the handle he knew hed at least be close he set the tripod up over the x and hooked the lockdown chain to the safes handle he fitted a halfinch bit into the drill mounted it on the tripod and plugged it into a nearby wall socket he was ready to go from the toolbox he took out the gloves safety glasses and breathing mask and put them on last he pressed foam plugs into his ears the first drill bit lasted twentyfive minutes before shattering he guessed he had gone in only a quarter inch at that point he let the drill cool for a few minutes while he drank a bottle of water he got out of the toolbox he then locked a new bit into place the second bit completed the penetration brian pulled the drill out and checked the hole it appeared that the front plate was threequarters of an inch thick he unlocked the tripod and moved it out of the way the drill hole was still smoking and hot brian leaned down and blew away the steel shavings that had accumulated around it he got the camera scope out of the toolbox plugged it in and turned it on he manipulated the snakelike camera extension bending it into a curving l shape he then fed it into the drill hole keeping his eyes on the small blackandwhite video display screen almost immediately brian saw movement inside the safe a whitish gray blur moved across the threeinchwide screen he froze for a moment what was that he moved the camera in an exaggerated sweep but saw nothing else was it smoke had he really seen something he wondered if the camera movement had simply blurred a reflection of the cameras light off one of the gears or the underside of the faceplate the video display had no playback function it did not record brian could not go back to check the movement again he felt a small tremble go up his spine and neck he stared at the display for a few more moments and then started moving the scope again he knew there couldnt have been movement it had to have been a reflection or a concentration of smoke left over from the drillthrough he saw no further movement in the display but he did see that the safes door had no back plate this he guessed had been removed to make the door lighter since it opened up rather than out it probably saved fifteen or twenty pounds in the lifting since the back plate was missing brian knew he could use the scope to see into the cavity of the safe and check its contents ahead of robinette he pulled the tool out of the drill hole straightened it and then snaked it back in the cameras light reached all corners of the safe brian saw that it was empty save for the layer of dust that had gathered over time at the bottom no treasure today brian said to himself he once more removed the scope reconfigured it and then fed it back into the hole by moving the scope he was able to view the internal workings of the safes locking mechanism he was surprised he counted nine gears most safes had three or four at the most never nine he knew that when he posted a report on this job on the site other box men would not believe him he decided he would go out to the van and get his digital camera after he got the safe open his plan would be to post a report on the site and then once the doubters posted their negatives he would upload a few photoscount em nine gearsand put them all in their place he refocused on the work and quickly identified the free wheelthe gear that would release the locking mechanism when popped loose he measured its location on the front plate once more he marked the surface with chalk and pulled the tripod into place the second drillthrough cost him three bits and by the end his drill smelled like it was burning up inside this door wasin box mans parlancea dutch treat meaning the costs of broken or damaged equipment made the job a barely breakeven proposition brian knew there was no way hed be able to ding robinette for the burnedout drill and the bits hed be lucky if the writer even paid him the extra hundred for the second drillthrough he got the spike and the mallet out of the toolbox he slid the spike into the second drill hole and felt it click against the free wheel he raised the mallet to strike it but then stopped he remembered that robinette wanted to witness the opening of the safe brian stood up his shirt was sticking to his back and perspiration had popped across his forehead he took off the safety glasses and the mask and blew out his breath he walked out of the study and found the main hallway and the stairs it was a grand staircase that swept upward in a curve mr robinette he called out what came the reply im ready to open the safe now brian headed back to the study he heard robinette coming down the steps behind him he got back into position next to the safe and picked up the mallet robinette came into the room is it open not yet i thought you wanted to be here do you want a set of earplugs this metal on metal gets pretty loud cant be louder than that drill i dont want earplugs suit yourself brian started hammering the spike with the mallet taking short strokes at first and then lengthening his arc when the gear refused to give each strike on the spike sent a sharp jolt through his body finally after three full swings he felt the gear start to give he went back to the shorter more controlled swing and hit the spike five more times before the gear broke loose and he heard it clatter to the bottom of the safe sounds like its empty he said to robinette just open it brian reached down and gripped the handle and sharply pulled it down it came easily the safe was unlocked he pulled it up and open struggling with the weight of the steel door and was immediately hit with the dead air that had been trapped inside for who knows how long it was cold and heavy it smelled like someones chilled breath robinette stepped forward and looked down he saw that the safe was empty brian wasnt looking at the contents or lack thereof he was looking at the workmanship of the gears and the slide bolts on the inside of the door it was a beautiful job and brian found himself admiring the craftsmanship behind it empty robinette said figures brian reached down into the safe to retrieve the freewheel gear from the bottom he withdrew it quickly it had felt strange it had felt like he was reaching into a refrigerator for a can of beer that thing must be insulated it actually feels cold down there feel this he held up the gear it was icecold but robinette waved away the idea of touching it so much for the treasure of sierra madre he said all right get the door off it and if you dont mind and it wont cost me too much more do you have something you can clean that out with i have a shopvac in my van its part of the service good do it that dust is already affecting my sinuses i cant breathe ill be upstairs when youre finished after robinette was gone brian went to work on the doors single hinge in five minutes he lifted the heavy door out of its spot and carefully leaned it against one of the bookcases he thought that it weighed more than forty pounds even without a back plate for a moment he studied the workmanship of the locking mechanism again the ninenow eightgears were clustered in an interlocking pattern that had to have been of original design he thought it was beautiful like a painting that should be on display almost like a living organism he was hoping that robinette would let him take the door since he no longer wanted it he gathered his tools and took them out to the van he came back in with his camera and the vacuum and as he reentered the study his eyes met those of a young girl who was standing by the opening in the floor brian had not replaced the plywood door yet careful honey you dont want to fall down in there you might get hurt okay she said she was darkhaired and had a sweet face her eyes were dark and serious for such a young girl she was wearing a dress that looked like it might be a little warm for the summer weather something about her was familiar to himthe eyes maybe he couldnt place it he knew there was no reason he would have ever seen her before whats your name sweetheart lucy brians eyes lit in surprise really thats my favorite name for a girl my wife and i are about to have a baby and if its a girl were going to call her lucy just like you do you believe that how old are you sweetheart she smiled revealing that she was missing a front tooth six wow i would have guessed at least seven youre a big girl thank you well listen i have to do some cleaning up in here and it might get dusty you should run along now okay okay see you lucy byebye box man he watched her leave the room wondering how she knew to call him that had her father used the term he couldnt remember but assumed robinette had told her who he was and what he was doing in the house he listened to her footsteps padding away and then he went back to work vacuuming out the safe and then taking photos of the safes door front and back after loading his equipment into the van he sat in the drivers seat while writing out a billing statement on his clipboard he didnt charge robinette anything other than the twofifty already agreed to he took the bill inside with him and called up the stairs to robinette robinette studied the bill as they walked back to the library i ought to retire and learn how to legally break into safes whats this come out to like eighty bucks an hour for using a drill hardly im lucky if i get one job a day there arent that many safes that need opening most of my work is just plain old locksmithing well id say you did pretty damn good today robinette dropped the bill onto the desk in the library as if he were dismissing it brian said i usually get paid upon completion of the job robinette said well you didnt say that before it is custom in the service industry usually i dont have to say it brian could tell that robinette didnt like that service thing thrown back at him all right he said curtly ill go up and get you a check thank you just before robinette left the study brian spoke up again what do you want me to do with the door its heavy i could take it and get rid of it if you want no no robinette answered quickly i want you to carry it out to the curb and prop it up so it can be seen brian was confused sure but why three words in cold blood trash pickup doesnt come until thursday that means it will be out there a couple days and maybe the word will get out that there is no longer a safe in here brian nodded though he didnt really follow the logic whats that old song say paranoia will destroy ya robinette turned fully around to confront him look i dont expect you to understand me or my life do you have children got one on the way im not trying to i dont care what you are trying or not trying to say just do your job and dont worry about my paranoia my paranoia got me this place and this life i think in some ways its like drilling through steel plates for a living but i like it better its not as noisy now if you dont mind i will go up and get you a check while you take that damn thing out to the curb okay you got it at dinner brian told laura all about his encounter with the arrogant writer and she told him that robinette hadnt had a book out in at least three years she suggested that maybe that had something to do with his paranoia and arrogance i was reading in one of the baby books about how when babies get constipated they can be really miserable she said maybe robinette is creatively constipated brian laughed but said some people are just mean plain and simple he thought about the girl he had briefly met in the house growing up in that place with that father how would she turn out how would she make it through he wondered where the mother was when he got up to clear the plates brian first touched his wifes swollen belly they were less than a month away he was excited and scared scared about the money mostly hey robinettes daughters name is lucy he called from the sink does that change your mind about it not if its a girl i still like it and that house it was the blankenship place really what was it like inside ive seen it from the outside it was big in the kitchen i saw two of everything even dishwashers i guess arthur blankenships old man was the guy who put the safe in when he built that place with money from the plant after dinner brian spent time in the workshop in the garage and posted a report on the le seuil safe on the box man website on the chat list he posted a note asking if anyone else out there had ever encountered such a safe and then signed off to go to bed brian dreamed of darkness with swirling motion movements like wisps of smoke that then for just a moment came together to form a face he did not recognize as man or woman adult or child then it was gone and he woke up what is it his wife whispered a dream just a bad dream what was it about laura always asked about dreams she thought they were important i dont know it was more like a feeling a bad feeling he got up and walked the house checking every lock this was his routine but it wasnt comforting he had the best locks money could buy but he knew how to pick and break every one of them he knew there were other people with the same skills he could never feel totally secure he sat in the kitchen in the dark and drank a beer he wondered if he was paranoid like robinette he wondered if he would become like the writer once his own child was born he started humming the kinks song paranoia will destroy ya he took the beer into the nursery and looked around in the dark the room was completely outfitted and ready save for the things that laura wanted to be gender specific theyd had a disagreement laura wanted to know early on whether a boy or girl was coming brian wanted to be surprised so she knew and he didnt she had done a good job of keeping the secret brians secret was that he wanted a girl he didnt want to find out beforehand because he feared if he learned he was the father of a boy he would lose his edge of excitement that he might actually become depressed before the baby was even born the reason he wanted a girl was that he considered his own life and thought that it was too easy for boys to get messed up to go down the wrong path with girls there seemed to be more twoway streets they could turn around and come back if they wanted to with boys it was all oneway streets no turning back brian picked up a completechangeofhardware job the next day the house was an old victorian in the heights eight doors including the garage all medeco locks and baldwin brass it was a sixhour job that and the markup on the materials made it a good day he came home relaxed a big check in his wallet he and laura went out to eat at the bonefish grill they figured that once the baby came they wouldnt be going anywhere for a while might as well do it while they could but that night wasnt perfect the dream came back he saw the face form in the darkness again a face made of cigarette smoke in the dream it smelled like his burning drill he awoke and sat on the side of the bed he felt lauras hand caress his back being pregnant had made her a light sleeper was it the same dream she asked yeah do you remember any more of it not really its just this bad feeling its dread its like i let something loose in the world like it was all my fault what was what did you do i dont know you think its about the baby brian laughed no its not that he checked the house again making sure it was secure even though he did not feel secure when he went back to the bedroom he started getting dressed what are you doing laura asked its the middle of the night i dont know im going to take a drive are you all right im fine i just want to take a drive put the windows down be careful i will be the phone didnt ring the next day no jobs came in brian called a foundry in michigan and ordered drill bits to replace those hed broken on the robinette job he then spent the rest of the morning in the garage workshop trying to research the le seuil safe he wrote a letter to his father about it he went on the computer and googled the name le seuil but only came up with a book publisher in france using the name he checked the box man website but no one had responded to his earlier post other than to say they had never encountered a safe of that brand when it was lunchtime he opened the side door to go into the house two men were standing there they wore suits and dour expressions it had been twenty years since hed had to deal with cops but he still knew the type officers what can i do for you actually im detective stephens with the police department and this is agent rowan with the fbi are you brian holloway yes is it laura the baby what happened who is laura stephens asked my wife shes at work she this is not about her can we come in brian stepped back despite the relief of knowing this was not about laura he felt the same sense of dread that he had awoken from the dream with building in his chest then what is it have a seat rowan said brian sat on the stool next to the workbench the two lawmen remained standing their eyes moving around the shop as they spoke the detective looked like he was deferring to the agent in this matter whatever it was this is how i would like to work this agent rowan said were going to ask you some questions here and the first time you lie to us we pack it in and put you in a cell to think about it fair enough this is a joke right no joke then questions about what am i a suspect in something not yet we think you are just a witness but like i said the first time you lie to us you become a suspect and we treat you like one witness to what what happened i said we are going to ask the questions but lets start this thing off right by getting everything right you are brian holloway thirtynine years old and you reside in the home that this garage is attached to do i have all of that correct yes and your father has spent the last twentytwo years in an illinois state correctional facility serving a life sentence without parole for the crime of murder brian shook his head the sins of the father always visited the son this is about my father i was nineteen when he went away whats that got to he was a box man too wasnt he only he opened boxes for the outfit in chicago he taught you everything you know right wrong he killed a man who came home and caught him in the act didnt he he didnt do it the man he was doing the job for did it he panicked oh i guess that makes it okay look what do you want i havent talked to my father in three years do your clients know that youre the son of harry houdini holloway look i run a clean legal business why would i tell someone who my father is why would i have to this isnt chicago and im not my father where were you last night stephens asked suddenly joining in changing the direction of things brian started to think maybe the whole thing was choreographed maybe it wasnt about the old man maybe it was all misdirection and sudden change last night i was here i was home from when till when um i got home around three yesterday and i did some work in here and then my wife and i went out for dinner and we got home about eightthirty and that was it we stayed home after that okay eightythirty until when when was the next time you left brian hesitated he looked at their faces wondering what had happened and how much they knew cops always had the advantage he knew this his father had always said that when it came to cops to lie was to die he shook his head until now i havent left yet each of the men in front of him visibly stiffened and their faces took on a stony resolve turn around stephens said assume the position your dad probably taught it to you too instead brian raised his hands as if to stop their advance on him okay look i took a drive last night i was gone less than a hour when last night i never looked at the clock i woke up couldnt sleep and took a drive it was the middle of the night and you never looked at the clock in the car huh no i took my van the clock in it doesnt work and i forgot to put on my watch where did you go on your drive i just drove around all over the place i even went over the bridge and cruised around the island brian knew he had to give them that he knew they had something it must be the electronic toll pass on the vans windshield there would be a record of him crossing the bridge why the island what did you do while you were there brian let out a deep breath they were cornering him he didnt understand this the fbi doesnt come around for stealing trash there was something else going on all right listen ill tell you everything the other day i had a job out on the island i opened an old safe for a guy and the client had me take the door off the box and carry it out to the curb for trash pickup he said the pickup wasnt for a few days so last night i went back by his place and i took the door it wouldve been picked up this morning anyway its not stealing he put it out for trash pickup to him it was trash and why did you take it because until i was there i had never seen or heard of that safe or its maker and i wanted to study it maybe practice on it a bit besides its a museum piece i didnt want it thrown away where is it brian pointed to an object beneath an old movers blanket that was leaning against the opposite wall rowan walked over and lifted up the blanket for a look he then dropped the cloth back down and looked at brian it was not a crime to take it brian said it was trash so you say look what is going on why are you here did robinette say i stole his door is that what this is about i know the guys famous but do they really send the fbi out on a call like that no they dont then what is this there was a pause and the lawmen looked at each other for a moment before stephens spoke were not worried about you stealing robinettes trash were wondering if you stole his daughter what his daughter mr holloway shes disappeared brian thought of the little girl with dark familiar eyes and the winter dress in the middle of the summer he said i took his daughter it doesnt matter what he said we have to check everybody out you were the last person other than the family to be in that house we understand that you and mr robinette didnt get along so well so were starting with you brians chest felt as though his lungs were filling with wax they were becoming heavy and hard again he thought of the little girl standing precariously at the edge of the safe it was like she had been waiting there for him did you check the safe he suddenly asked what do you mean rowan asked the safe in the library when i was there she came in and was standing by the safe maybe shei dont know maybe after i left she went back to it theres no door but there was a piece of the flooring that covered it and that i put back in place rowan glanced at the shape of the safes door beneath the blanket he then glanced at stephens and another silent communication passed stephens turned and walked out of the garage rowan looked back at brian the safe would be kind of small wouldnt it the box was pretty deep it went down at least a foot and a half you said she came into the library i went out to my van to get the vacuum and when i came back in she was just standing there what did she say to you brian thought for a moment he tried to remember all the details he was filling with fear for the little girl she just told me her name and i asked how old she was i told her she looked older she said her name was why would you do that do what ask the girl how old she was brian shrugged i dont know i guess because were about to have a kidmy wife is eight months alongand i dont know i never really thought about the ages of children before now i do rowan took a few moments to grind over the answer brian shifted his weight on the stool and started pumping his knee mr holloway you seem agitated is something wrong of course theres something wrong that girl is missing and i just have a bad feeling about it look i had nothing to do with it youre wasting your time so do what you have to do with me and get it over with ill take a lie detector if you want you can go search my van too just get past me and go find her before its too late rowan seemed to be taken aback what do you mean before its too late isnt that how these things always end up before rowan answered stephens came in he looked at his partner and then at brian safes empty mr holloway has volunteered to take a poly rowan said we can also take a look in the van stephens nodded what about your home rowan said can we look around inside brian flashed on the bag of stale dope in the bedroom dresser laura quit smoking when they decided to get pregnant out of fairness he had stopped as well and the bag had sat in the drawer with his socks for a year if youre just going to look around for the girlclosets and stuffthats fine but i dont want you going through drawers and stuff just make it quick and dont mess things up or my wife will know you know what i still dont understand rowan said youre in there doing a job for mr robinette and you go and ask his daughter how old she is why is that i dont know i told you i wondered how old she was what else do you ask she was a cute girl and i wondered how old she was im sort of hoping that we have a girl and sothats all you said was stephens said what you said she was a cute girl whyd you use the past tense is there something you want to tell us brian shook his head look youve got this wrong and youre wasting time dont do this you should be out there looking for mr holloway rowan said i think we are going to take you up on your kind offer to allow us to look around here and maybe bring you down to the station to set up a polygraph your offer is still good right they kept him in a small windowless andit seemed to himairless room there was no clock on the wall and he lost track of time he was thinking about the girl he had seen by the safe lucy they came in from time to time to talk to him to ask him the same questions over and over but unsatisfied with his answers they would leave again he could tell it was dark outside he could sense it it had been at least that long finally the door came open again and stephens looked in you have ten minutes he said what stephens backed away from the opening and then laura appeared hesitantly she stepped into the room and the door was closed behind her brian what is going on i came home and they were in our house they had a search warrant what did you do he shook his head i didnt do anything robinettes daughter is missing and they think i took her all i did was talk to her you talked to her when that day i told you at dinner no you told me she had the same name we picked you didnt say you talked to her she came in where i was working i asked her what her name was and how old she was and that was it i told her i had to get to work she left and i never saw her again thats it she slid into the seat across the table from him she never took her eyes off him did you tell them this yes i told them a hundred times theyre wasting their time with me when they should be out looking for her if you ask me they ought to be talking to robinette instead of me laura put her hand on her abdomen as if calming the baby inside she started rocking in her chair oh my god i cant believe this she said neither can i brian said he reached a hand across the table and she put her other hand on top of it have you asked for a lawyer no i dont need a lawyer i didnt do anything brian just tell me did you take that girl anywhere he pulled his hand back from her his mouth came open and it was a moment before he found his voice laura where did you go when you got up last night youve been acting weird all week what is going on with you they sent you in here didnt they they convinced you out there and sent you in here to no brian youre wrong youre being paranoid i just want to know what is going the door to the small room suddenly came open and rowan stepped in mr and mrs holloway you can go on home now what do you mean laura asked brian started to push back his chair we found her the agent said in a matteroffact tone we want to thank you for your cooperation but you are no longer needed have a nice evening brian stood up a weird mixture of relief and anger overtaking him is she all right he asked shes fine patrol just brought her into the station turns out she didnt like moving into the new house he forced a laugh she thinks its haunted so she split she walked all the way back to her old neighborhood and hid in her best friends guesthouse rowan stepped back from the doorway so they could leave brian walked slowly he was having a hard time understanding what rowan had just told them he was having a hard time dealing with what his wife had just asked him as well that girl found her way back to her old house he asked thats right rowan said step this way and ill get you back your property then youll be out of here brian was led down the hallway and into a large squad room there were several detectives working at desks and moving about across the room was another room separated by a glass wall he could see a boardroom table in there sitting at the table were detective stephens and a girl she was maybe thirteen years old she looked like she was crying rowan went to his desk and got a manila envelope out of a drawer he handed it to brian it had his wallet and keys in it his loose change he didnt bother tearing it open he just held it as he stared at the girl in the glass room rowan noticed his gaze and looked across the room as well shes okay she spent the night eating potato chips and drinking soda pop i guess she had such a good time she still doesnt want to go back home does robinette have another daughter no just the one just teresa who doesnt want to go home brian thought of the dream of the dread he felt when he woke up from it the feeling that he had let something loose teresa rowan looked at him thats right i thought you said you asked can i talk to her to the girl no i dont think that would be proper mr holloway your involvement with this thing is over as far as im concerned i really need to speak to her well thats not going to happen now its time for you and your wife to head on home what did she say about the house being haunted ill walk you out he gripped brians upper arm and ushered him toward the squad rooms exit they went into another hallway and headed toward the door at the end rowan kept his hand on brians arm laura trailed behind them you know who owned that house before robinette brian asked rowan didnt answer arthur blankenship so so maybe shes got a point to why shes scared he built the plant they say the runoff from the phosphate is responsible for all the fish kills its like theres a big cloud of black water in the bay hell he built this city he knew where all the bodies were buried maybe it doesnt matter what matters is that shes going home safe brian jerked his arm free and stopped he pointed back down the hallway in the direction they had come from shes not the one i saw in the house she isnt the girl i spoke to rowan held up his palms in a handsoff manner he smiled mr holloway ive got a caseload like you wouldnt believe this is one of the cases that ends happy that ends good lets just let this go and what if i cant then you are on your own sir lets go he grabbed brians arm again and led him to the door they were quiet at first on the ride home laura drove brian thought about what he had seen in the robinette house they were almost home before laura spoke for the first time brian whats going on what were you talking about back there i dont know i dont want to talk about it why because i dont really feel like talking to you right now brian im sorry they told me you did something to her they said they had evidence and that you had admitted asking her inappropriate questions they said it had something to do with our baby the pressure you are under and how we havent had sex they said they had seen it before brian shook his head you told them about our sex they asked a lot of questions i felt i had to and you believed everything they said that i admitted asking inappropriate questions that i did something to her i didnt want to i was talking to a sixyearold not a thirteenyearold i didnt ask anything wrong i didnt do anything wrong i know baby im sorry but you were acting strange all week and then when you went out last nighti just thoughti dont know what i thought all i can say is that im sorry brian looked over at his wife in the darkness he could see that she was crying doing nothing about the tears rolling down her cheeks he didnt do anything about it either in the workshop brian had a message waiting for him on his computer the next morning it was from a box man in montreal named robert pepin rather than publicly post the message on the website pepin answered brians posted inquiry with a direct and private email though pepin was obviously french and had some difficulties with english his message was clear take cautions i have heard story of the threshold safe one box man saw his young brother who was killed i have not seen for myself was it in the floor this is past on stories the box man he make mistake to open it brian stared at the message a long time trying to decipher its meanings he felt a coldness begin in his center he knew it was the beginning of fear and the confirmation of something he had felt deep inside the message had pepins business number and address at the bottom brian picked up the workshop phone and punched in the longdistance number after three rings it was answered by a machine the outgoing message was in french and brian didnt understand a word of it but then the speaker switched to english with a heavy french accent he identified the line as belonging to fochet lock and safe and asked the caller to leave a message but then he gave another number in case of an emergency brian wrote it down hung up and then called the emergency number the second call was answered after four rings and brian heard a drill wind down before a man spoke rapidly in french it was obviously a cell phone and brian had interrupted a job he wondered how the phone had even been heard over the sound of the drill im sorry brian said do you speak english is robert pepin there this is robert who is this please brian identified himself and told pepin he had received his message he needed to ask him questions pepin tried to beg off saying that he was in the middle of drilling a safe and that people were waiting for him to complete the job brian insisted and promised to be quick pepin relented and lowered his voice to a whisper when he spoke further what did you mean by a threshold safe in your message brian asked first it is the safe you showed uh it is threshold the name le seuil he pronounced it like le soy brian tried to say it that way le seuil means threshold the threshold yes like the doorway you have i understand and the story you heardwho told you uh the man who i bought from him my business fochet he told me he told me if i get the job no do not open and so i tell you he told you he opened one a very long time ago yes he said big mistake opening that one yes why well he is not saying everything he is just warning against it you know he is saying bad things come out like a dream i didnt ask he sound you know a little crazy is he still around is he retired pepin chuckled he is retired to the cemetery mr fochet was very old when i bought his business frustration was welling up in brian everything was like the smoke in his dreams it formed the whispery outlines of a picture but there was not enough there to identify it in your message you said the man who opened the safe saw his brother who was killed what do you mean fochet he had a brother who was killed in the train an accident you see but before that fochet open the threshold safe on a job he is saying to me that he saw a man it was his brother butafterward like he was an old man now he tell fochet to watch out on the train he give the warning but fochet dont know this he didnt tell nobody about this then a year later his brother he got killed on the train you understand it was a crazy story i didnt pay too much attention because i never heard of these safes and fochet he was you know a little crazy his wife make him sell me the business but then i see you on the website and think aha i better give a warning for this just in case you know pepins english made it difficult for brian to fully grasp the story do you remember anything else about the story no that is what i know i tell you what i know did he say who made these safes anything about the manufacturer i did ask him this and he say he could not find out he said it was a big mystery yes he tried to learn the safe came on a boat from francethis is long time agoand there are no records anymore in the war the germans came and destroyed these records he found nothing because he was like you with questions pepin made a spitting noise in the phone as if to signal the finality and the fruitlessness of searching for the origin of the le seuil safe i have my work now he said yeah okay brian said thank you for your help you show a picture of the door of the safe on the website pepin suddenly said yes thats right you took the door off and leave it off yes brian slowly hung up even as he could hear pepins voice on the line exhorting him to be cautious he thought about the girl he had seen in the house on the island he thought he now recognized her eyes he picked up the phone again and called his wife at work as soon as she heard his voice she whispered that she was really busy she wanted to talk to him but the phone was ringing off the wall her job was to take reservations for the most popular restaurant in town real quick then he said i have to know its a girl right were having a girl why are you asking now because i need to know right now im not going to tell you you told me not to tell you i need to know laura its important just tell me is it a girl there was a long pause before she answered yes it is a girl brian you are the father of a daughter named lucy okay thanks he knew it was a significant moment and laura was expecting more from him but it was all he could think to say he put the phone down he turned away from the workbench and looked at the old blue blanket that covered the door of the le seuil safe he knew what he had to do robinette answered the door this time brian did not go to the service entrance look robinette said before brian could speak i am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you the police asked me for a list of names yours was on it end of story brian noticed that there were deep lines under robinettes eyes now he looked weary and defeated even though he had gotten his daughter back im not here about that brian said i dont care about that then what do you want you cant just show up here and i want to talk to your daughter what no youre not going near her shes been through enough were moving i have to talk to her im going to call the police if you do not leave my property i want to talk to her about the ghost about the little girl robinette closed his mouth and just stared brian saw recognition in his eyes it was recognition of something that maybe robinette wasnt sure he believed himself then he changed when he saw the ploy the police told you he said no the police wouldnt talk to me i know because i saw her too when i was here i saw her i dont care what you think you saw i want you out of here he started to close the door but brian put his foot over the threshold and stopped it her name is lucy i saw her too and i need to talk to your daughter why shes been through enough first she lost her mother now this what can you possibly say to her i can tell her who lucy is brian pushed on the door and robinette moved back without resistance brian walked by him and headed to the stairs where is she in her room brian went up the stairs and found all the doors in the upper hallway closed robinette called from below the second room on the left brian went to the door knocked and then opened it when he heard someone call come in the girl he had seen in the police station was sitting on a bed her legs folded beneath her her back against the wall teresa right who are you did my father send for you no i just came im the one who opened the safe i saw the girl that day she talked to me she said her name was lucy teresas eyes widened then you believe me brian nodded i believe you have you talked to her teresa nodded what did she tell you she um doesnt know what is happening she said she came through the door thats all she says about that what about what happened to her does she know she said there was a pool and she didnt know how to swim brian closed his eyes for a moment shes confused teresa continued i said when did it happen and she said it didnt happen yet she didnt make sense brian nodded it did make sense to him when does she come he asked when do you see her i dont know anytime its not like there is a schedule sometimes i close my eyes and when i open them shes there do you know where she goes when she isnt here i think she must go back through the door she talks about would that be where she is now i dont know i guess i dont see her thank you teresa brian turned toward the door who is she teresa asked brian looked back at her shes my daughter shes coming in a few weeks you mean shes not born not yet i think she came through the door to warn me now i have to go close the door robinette was standing in the upper hallway when brian came out it was as if he couldnt venture into his daughters room we have to put the door back on the safe brian said this all started with the safe we cant the trash was taken yesterday you put i have the door its in my van brian headed to the stairs and started down as he went he looked up at robinette do you want me to bring it in through the service door robinette looked at him as if not comprehending the question then he spoke in a quiet voice no that wont be necessary they were on the back porch of the house it was a warm nightsummer was coming on strong and laura with the extra weight and the extra heart beating inside her had to get out of the unairconditioned house they sat side by side in lawn chairs holding hands brian had forgiven her there were more important things to concentrate on besides he knew the cops could convince anybody of anything years back they had done it to him with his old man practically had him believing that his father had shot the mark in cold blood he had not told her the whole story of his return to the house on shell island he didnt want to upset her especially now that it was almost time for the baby he only told her that he had gone back to see robinette to set things right so there might be some money in it he said now on the porch it could really help us with you taking the extra time off and all what money for what he said all of this with his daughter and the safe and stuff made him think about writing again he said he has an idea for a story and since hell want to know about safes and being a box man hell pay me for it like to be an expert for his story laura sat up straight in her chair she was excited by the proposition how much will he pay we didnt get to that yet im supposed to go back over there tomorrow ill find out then those writers make a lot of money she didnt say anything else she was leaving it to him but making it clear she expected him to get a good chunk out of robinette well see what he says brian said not wanting to promise anything or push anything they were quiet for a moment and then she let go of his hand and leaned forward you know what i want to do she asked with the money i mean i dont know keep paying the bills no we should get more than just that i want airconditioning brian we deserve that and then we should put in a pool i want to go swimming at night to cool off brian stared straight ahead and off the porch into the distance he realized that the backyard was just big enough for a pool without a word he stood up and went back
