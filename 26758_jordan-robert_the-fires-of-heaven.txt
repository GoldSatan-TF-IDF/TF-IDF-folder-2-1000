robert jordan the fires of heaven with his coming are the dread fires born again the hills burn and the land turns sere the tides of men run out and the hours dwindle the wall is pierced and the veil of parting raised storms rumble beyond the horizon and the fires of heaven purge the earth there is no salvation without destruction no hope this side of death fragment from the prophecies of the dragon believed translated by ndelia basolaine first maid and swordfast to raidhen of hol cuchone circa ab prologue serpent and wheel the first sparks fall elaida do avriny aroihan absently fingered the long sevenstriped stole about her shoulders the stole of the amyrlin seat as she sat behind her wide writing table many would have accounted her beautiful at first glance but a second look made it clear that the severity of her ageless aes sedai face was not a momentary matter today there was something more a light of anger in her dark eyes if anyone had noticed she barely listened to the women arrayed on stools before her their dresses were every color from white to the darkest red in silk or wool as each womans taste dictated yet all but one wore their formal shawls embroidered white flame of tar valon centered on their backs colored fringe proclaiming their ajahs as though this were a meeting of the hall of the tower they discussed reports and rumors of events in the world trying to sift fact from fancy trying to decide the towers course of action but they seldom even glanced at the woman behind the table the woman they had sworn to obey elaida could not keep her full attention on them they did not know what was really important or rather they knew and feared to speak of it there is apparently something happening in shienar that was danelle slight and often seemingly lost in a dream the only brown sister present green and yellow also had only one sister apiece and none of the three ajahs was pleased about that there were no blues now danelles big blue eyes looked thoughtfully inward an unnoticed ink stain smudge stained her cheek and her dark gray wool dress was rumpled there are rumors of skirmishes not with trollocs and not aiel though raids through the niamh passes appear to have increased between shienarans unusual for the borderlands they rarely fight each other if they intend to have a civil war they have chosen the proper time for it alviarin said coolly tall and slim and all in white silk she was the only one without a shawl the stole of the keeper around her shoulders was white also to show she had been raised from the white ajah not red elaidas former ajah as tradition held whites were always cool the trollocs might as well have vanished the entire blight seems quiet enough for two farmers and a novice to guard teslyns bony fingers shuffled papers on her lap though she did not look at them one of four red sisters there more than any other ajah she ran elaida a close second for severity though no one had ever thought her beautiful better perhaps if it did not be so quiet teslyn said her illianer accent strong i did receive a message this morning that the marshalgeneral of saldaea does have an army on the move no toward the blight but in the opposite direction south and east he would no ever have done that if the blight did no seem to be asleep then word of mazrim taim is seeping out alviarin could have been discussing the weather or the price of carpets instead of a potential disaster much effort had gone into capturing taim and as much into hiding his escape no good to the tower if the world learned they could not hold on to a false dragon once he was taken and it seems that queen tenobia or davram bashere or both thinks we cannot be trusted to deal with him again dead quiet fell at the mention of taim the man could channel he had been on his way to tar valon to be stilled cut off from the one power forever when he was broken free yet that was not what curbed tongues once the existence of a man able to channel the one power had been the deepest anathema hunting such men down was the main reason of existence for the red and every ajah helped as it could but now most of the women beyond the table shifted on their stools refusing to meet each others eyes because speaking of taim brought them too close to another subject they did not want to speak aloud even elaida felt bile rise in her stomach apparently alviarin experienced no such reluctance one corner of her mouth quirked momentarily in what might have been smile or grimace i will redouble our efforts to retake taim and i suggest that a sister be dispatched to counsel tenobia someone used to overcoming the sort of resistance that young woman will put up others rushed to help fill the silence joline shifted her greenfringed shawl on slender shoulders and smiled though it seemed a bit forced yes she needs an aes sedai at her shoulder someone able to handle bashere he has excessive influence with tenobia he must move his army back where it can be used if the blight wakes up too much bosom showed in the gap of her shawl and her pale green silk was too snug too clinging and she smiled too much for elaidas liking especially at men greens always did the last thing we need now is another army on the march shemerin the yellow sister said quickly a slightly plump woman she had somehow never really managed the outward calm of aes sedai there was often a strain of anxiety around her eyes and more so of late and someone to shienar added javindrha another red despite smooth cheeks her angular face was hard enough to hammer nails her voice was harsh i dont like trouble of this sort in the borderlands the last thing we need is shienar weakening itself to the point where a trolloc army could break through perhaps alviarin nodded considering but there are agents in shienar red i am sure and perhaps others the four red sisters nodded tightly reluctantly no one else did who can warn us if these small clashes become anything to worry us it was an open secret that every ajah except the white devoted to logic and philosophy as it was had watchers and listeners scattered through the nations to varying degrees though the yellow network was believed to be a pitiful thing there was nothing of sickness or healing they could learn from those who could not channel some individual sisters had their own eyesandears though perhaps even more closely guarded than agents of the ajahs the blues had had the most extensive both ajah and personal as for tenobia and davram bashere alviarin went on are we agreed that they must be dealt with by sisters she hardly waited for heads to nod good it is done memara will do nicely she will take no nonsense from tenobia while never letting her see the leash now does anyone have fresh word out of arad doman or tarabon if we do not do something there soon we may find that pedron niall and the whitecloaks have sway from bandar eban to the shadow coast evanellein you have something arad doman and tarabon were racked by civil wars and worse there was no order anywhere elaida was surprised they would bring it up only a rumor the gray sister replied her silk dress matching the fringe on her shawl was finely cut and scooped low at the neck often elaida thought the woman should have been green so concerned was she with her looks and clothes almost everyone in those poor lands is a refugee including those who might send news the panarch amathera has apparently vanished and it seems an aes sedai may have been involved elaidas hand tightened on her stole nothing touched her face but her eyes smoldered the matter of the saldaean army was done at least memara was red that was a surprise but they had not even asked her opinion it was done the startling possibility that an aes sedai was involved in the disappearance of the panarch if this was not another of the thousand improbable tales that drifted from the western coast could not take elaidas mind from that there were aes sedai scattered from the aryth ocean to the spine of the world and the blues at least might do anything less than two months since they had all knelt to swear fealty to her as the embodiment of the white tower and now the decision was made without so much as a glance in her direction the amyrlins study sat only a few levels up in the white tower yet this room was the heart of the tower as surely as the tower itself the color of bleached bone was the heart of the great island city of tar valon cradled in the river erinin and tar valon was or should be the heart of the world the room spoke of the power wielded by the long line of women who had occupied it floor of polished redstone from the mountains of mist tall fireplace of golden kandori marble walls paneled in pale oddly striped wood marvelously carved with unknown birds and beasts more than a thousand years ago stone like glittering pearls framed the tall arched windows that let onto the balcony overlooking the amyrlins private garden the only stone like it known salvaged from a nameless city swallowed by the sea of storms during the breaking of the world a room of power a reflection of amyrlins who had made thrones dance to their calling for nearly three thousand years and they did not even ask her opinion it happened too often this slighting worst most bitter of all perhaps they usurped her authority without even thinking of it they knew how she had come to the stole knew their aid had put it on her shoulders she herself had been too much aware of that but they presumed too far it would soon be time to do something about that but not quite yet she had put her own stamp on the room as much as possible with a writing table ornately carved in triplelinked rings and a heavy chair that raised an inlaid ivory flame of tar valon above her dark hair like a large snowy teardrop three boxes of altaran lacquerwork were arranged on the table precisely equidistant from each other one held the finest of her collection of carved miniatures a white vase on a simple plinth against one wall held red roses that filled the room with sweet fragrance there had been no rain since she was raised but fine blossoms were always available with the power she had always liked flowers they could be so easily pruned and trained to produce beauty two paintings hung where seated she could see them merely by lifting her head the others avoided looking at them among all the aes sedai who came to elaidas study only alviarin ever so much as glanced at them is there any news of elayne andaya asked diffidently a thin birdlike little woman outwardly timid despite aes sedai features the second gray looked an unlikely mediator but was in fact one of the best there were still faint traces of tarabon in her voice or galad if morgase discovers that we have lost her stepson she may begin to ask more questions concerning the whereabouts of her daughter yes and if she learns we have lost the daughterheir andor may become as closed to us as amadicia a few women shook their heads there was no news and javindhra said a red sister is in place in the royal palace newly raised so she can easily pass for other than aes sedai she meant that the woman had not yet taken on the agelessness that came with long use of the power someone trying to guess the age of any woman in the study would have fumbled over a range of twenty years and in some cases would be off by twice that she is well trained though quite strong and a good observer morgase is absorbed in putting forward her claim to the cairhienin throne several women shifted on their stools and as if realizing she had stepped close to dangerous ground javindhra hurried on and her new lover lord gaebril seems to be keeping her occupied otherwise her thin mouth narrowed even further she is completely besotted with the man he keeps her concentrated on cairhien alviarin said the situation there is nearly as bad as in tarabon and arad doman with every house contending for the sun throne and famine everywhere morgase will reestablish order but it will take time for her to have the throne secure until that is done she will have little energy left to worry about other matters even the daughterheir and i set a clerk the task of sending occasional letters the woman does a good imitation of elaynes hand morgase will keep until we can secure proper control of her again at least we still have her son in hand joline smiled gawyn do hardly be in hand teslyn said sharply those younglings of his do skirmish with whitecloaks on both sides of the river he does act on his own as much as at our direction he will be brought under control alviarin said elaida was beginning to find that constant cool composure hateful speaking of the whitecloaks danelle put in it appears that pedron niall is conducting secret negotiations trying to convince altara and murandy to cede land to illian and thus keep the council of nine from invading one or both safely back from the precipice the women on the other side of the table nattered on deciding whether the lord captain commanders negotiations might gain too much influence for the children of the light perhaps they should be disrupted so the tower could step in and replace him elaidas mouth twisted the tower had often in its history been cautious of necessity too many feared them too many distrusted them but it had never feared anything or anyone now it feared she raised her eyes to the paintings one consisted of three wooden panels depicting bonwhin the last red to have been raised to the amyrlin seat a thousand years before and the reason no red had worn the stole since until elaida bonwhin tall and proud ordering aes sedai in their manipulations of artur hawkwing bonwhin defiant on the white walls of tar valon under siege by hawkwings forces and bonwhin kneeling and humbled before the hall of the tower as they stripped her of stole and staff for nearly destroying the tower many wondered why elaida had had the triptych retrieved from the storerooms where it had lain covered in dust if none spoke openly she had still heard the whispers they did not understand that constant reminder of the price of failure was necessary the second painting was in the new fashion on stretched canvas a copy of a street artists sketch from the distant west that one caused even more unease among the aes sedai who saw it two men fought among clouds seemingly in the sky wielding lightning for weapons one had a face of fire the other was tall and young with reddish hair it was the youth who caused the fear who made even elaidas teeth clench she was not sure if it was in anger or to keep them from chattering but fear could and must be controlled control was all we are done then alviarin said rising smoothly from her stool the others copied her adjusting skirts and shawls in preparation for leaving in three days i will expect have i given you leave to go daughters those were the first words elaida had spoken since telling them to be seated they looked at her in surprise surprise some moved back toward the stools but not with any haste and not a word of apology she had let this go on much too long since you are standing you will remain so until i am done a moment of confusion caught those halfseated and she continued as they straightened again uncertainly i have heard no mention of the search for that woman and her companions no need to name that woman elaidas predecessor they knew who she meant and elaida found it harder every day even to think the former amyrlins name all of her current problems all could be laid at that womans feet it is difficult alviarin said evenly since we have bolstered the rumors that she was executed the woman had ice for blood elaida met her eyes firmly until she added a belated mother but it too was placid even casual elaida swung her gaze to the others made her voice steel joline you have charge of that search and of the investigation of her escape in both cases i hear of nothing but difficulties perhaps a daily penance will help you increase your diligence daughter write out what you think suitable and submit it to me should i find it less than suitable i will triple it jolines everpresent smile faded in satisfactory fashion she opened her mouth then closed it again under elaidas steady stare finally she curtsied deeply as you command mother the words were tight the meekness forced but it would do for now and what of trying to bring back those who fled if anything elaidas tone was even harder the return of the aes sedai who had run away when that woman was deposed meant the return of blues to the tower she was not sure she could ever trust any blue but then she was not sure she could ever bring herself to trust any who had fled instead of hailing her ascension yet the tower must be whole again javindhra was overseeing that task again there are difficulties her features remained as severe as ever but she licked her lips quickly at the storm that swept silently across elaidas face mother elaida shook her head i will not hear of difficulties daughter tomorrow you will place before me a list of everything you have done including all measures taken to see the world does not learn of any dissension in the tower that was deadly important there was a new amyrlin but the world must see the tower as united and strong as ever if you do not have enough time for the work i give you perhaps you should give up your place as sitter for the red in the hall i must consider it that will not be necessary mother the hardfaced woman said hurriedly you will have the report you require tomorrow i am sure many will start returning soon elaida was not so certain however much she wanted it the tower must be strong it must but her point was made troubled thoughtfulness marked every eye but alviarins if elaida was ready to come down on one of her own former ajah and even harder on a green who had been with her from the first day perhaps they had made a mistake in treating her as a ceremonial effigy perhaps they had put her on the amyrlin seat but now she was the amyrlin a few more examples in the coming days should drive it home if necessary she would have every woman here doing penance till they begged mercy there are tairen soldiers in cairhien as well as andoran she went on ignoring averted eyes tairen soldiers sent by the man who took the stone of tear shemerin clasped her plump hands tight and teslyn flinched only alviarin remained unruffled as a frozen pond elaida flung out her hand and pointed to the painting of two men fighting with lightning look at it look or i will have every last one of you on hands and knees scrubbing floors if you have not the backbone even to look at a painting what courage can you have for what is to come cowards are no use to the tower slowly they raised their eyes shuffling feet like nervous girls instead of aes sedai only alviarin merely looked and only she appeared untouched shemerin wrung her hands and tears actually welled in her eyes something would have to be done about shemerin rand althor a man who can channel the words left elaidas mouth like a whip they made her own stomach knot up till she feared she might vomit somehow she kept her face smooth and pressed on pushed the words out stones from a sling a man fated to go mad and wreak horror with the power before he dies but more than that arad doman and tarabon and everything between is a ruin of rebellion because of him if the war and famine in cairhien cannot be tied to him of a certainty he surely precipitates a greater war there between tear and andor when the tower needs peace in ghealdan some mad shienaran preaches of him to crowds too great for alliandres army to contain the greatest danger the tower has ever faced the greatest threat the world has ever faced and you cannot make yourselves speak of him you cannot gaze at his image silence answered her all save alviarin looked as though their tongues were frozen most stared at the young man in the painting birds hypnotized by a snake rand althor the name tasted bitter on elaidas lips once she had had that young man so innocent in appearance within arms reach and she had not seen what he was her predecessor had known had known for the light alone knew how long and had left him to run wild that woman had told her a great deal before escaping had said things when put hard to the question that elaida would not let herself believe if the forsaken were truly free all might be lost but somehow she had managed to refuse some answers and then escaped before she could be put to the question again that woman and moiraine that woman and the blue had known all along elaida intended to have them both back in the tower they would tell every last scrap of what they knew they would plead on their knees for death before she was done she forced herself to go on though the words curdled in her mouth rand althor is the dragon reborn daughters shemerins knees gave way and she sat down hard on the floor some of the others appeared to have weak knees as well elaidas eyes flogged them with scorn there can be no doubt of it he is the one spoken of in the prophecies the dark one is breaking free of his prison the last battle is coming and the dragon reborn must be there to face him or the world is doomed to fire and destruction so long as the wheel of time turns and he runs free daughters we do not know where he is we know a dozen places he is not he is no longer in tear he is not here in the tower safely shielded as he should be he brings the whirlwind down on the world and we must stop it if there is to be any hope of surviving tarmon gaidon we must have him in hand to see he fights in the last battle or do any of you believe he will go willingly to his prophesied death to save the world a man who must be going mad already we must have him in control mother alviarin began with that irritating lack of emotion but elaida stopped her with a glare putting our hands on rand althor is more important by far than skirmishes in shienar or whether the blight is quiet more important than finding elayne or galad more important even than mazrim taim you will find him you will when next i see you each of you will be ready to tell me in detail what you have done to make it so now you may leave me daughters a ripple of unsteady curtsies breathy murmurs of as you command mother and they came close to running joline helping shemerin wobbling to her feet the yellow sister would do nicely for the next example some would be necessary to make sure none of them slid back and she was too weak to be allowed in this council of course this council would not be allowed to continue much longer in any case the hall would hear her words and leap all save alviarin went for a long moment after the door had closed behind the others the two women met each others eyes alviarin had been the first the very first to hear and agree with the charges against elaidas predecessor and alviarin knew full well why she wore the keepers stole instead of someone from the red the red ajah had favored elaida unanimously but the white had not done so and without wholehearted support from the white many others might not have come round in which case elaida would have been in a cell instead of sitting on the amyrlin seat that is if the remains of her head were not decorating a spike for the ravens to play with alviarin would not be so easily intimidated as the others if she could be intimidated at all there was a disturbing feel of equaltoequal in alviarins unwavering gaze a tap at the door sounded loud in the quiet come elaida snapped one of the accepted a pale slender girl stepped hesitantly into the room and immediately dropped a curtsy so low her white skirt with its seven bands of color at the hem made a wide pool around her on the floor from the wideness of her blue eyes and the way she kept them on the floor she had caught the mood of the women leaving where aes sedai left shaking an accepted went at great peril mmother master ffain is here he said you wwould see him at ththis hour the girl swayed in her crouch on the point of falling over from stark fear then send him in girl instead of keeping him waiting elaida growled but she would have had the girls hide if she had not kept the man outside the anger she held back from alviarin she would not let herself think that she did not dare show it that anger welled up and if you cannot learn to speak properly perhaps the kitchens are a better place for you than the amyrlins anteroom well are you going to do as you were told move girl and tell the mistress of novices you need to be taught to obey with alacrity the girl squeaked something that might have been a correct response and darted out with an effort elaida got hold of herself it did not concern her whether silviana the new mistress of novices beat the girl to incoherence or let her off with a lecture she barely saw novices or accepted unless they intruded on her and cared less it was alviarin she wanted humbled and on her knees but fain now she tapped one finger against her lips a bony little man with a big nose who had appeared at the tower only days earlier in dirty oncefine clothes too big for him arrogant and cringing by turns seeking audience with the amyrlin except for those who served the tower men came there only under duress or in great need and none asked to speak to the amyrlin a fool in some ways or conceivably a halfwit he claimed to be from lugard in murandy but spoke in various accents sometimes slipping from one to another in midsentence yet it seemed he might be useful alviarin was still looking at her so icily complacent just a hint in her eyes of the questions she must have about fain elaidas face hardened almost she reached for saidar the female half of the true source to teach the woman her place with the power but that was not the way alviarin might even resist and fighting like a farmgirl in a stableyard was no method for the amyrlin to make her authority plain yet alviarin would learn to yield to her as surely as the others would the first step would be leaving alviarin in the dark concerning master fain or whatever his real name was padan fain put the frantic young accepted out of his mind as he stepped into the amyrlins study she was a toothsome bit and he liked them fluttering like birds in the hand but there were more important matters to concentrate on now drywashing his hands he ducked his head suitably low suitably humbly but the two awaiting him seemed unaware of his presence at first locked eyetoeye as they were it was all he could do not to stretch out a hand to caress the tension between them tension and division wove everywhere through the white tower all to the good tension could be tweaked division exploited as need be he had been surprised to find elaida on the amyrlin seat better than what he had expected though in many ways she was not so tough he had heard as the woman who had worn the stole before her harder yes and more cruel but more brittle too more difficult to bend likely but easier to break if either became necessary still one aes sedai one amyrlin even was much like another to him fools dangerous fools true but useful dupes at times finally they realized he was there the amyrlin frowning slightly at being taken by surprise the keeper of the chronicles unchanging you may go now daughter elaida said firmly a slight but definite emphasis on now oh yes the tensions the cracks in power cracks where seeds could be planted fain caught himself on the point of giggling alviarin hesitated before giving the briefest of curtsies as she swept out of the room her eyes brushed across him expressionless yet disconcerting unconsciously he huddled bunching his shoulders protectively his upper lip fluttered in a halfsnarl at her slim back on occasion he had the feeling just for an instant that she knew too much about him but he could not have said why her cool face cool eyes they never changed at those times he wanted to make them change fear agony pleading he nearly laughed at the thought no point of course she could know nothing patience and he could be done with her and her neverchanging eyes the tower held things worth a little patience in its strong rooms the horn of valere was there the fabled horn made to call dead heroes back from the grave for the last battle even most of the aes sedai were ignorant of that but he knew how to sniff out things the dagger was there he felt its pull where he stood he could have pointed to it it was his a part of him stolen and mired away here by these aes sedai having the dagger would make up for so much lost he was not sure how but he was sure it would for aridhol lost too dangerous to return to aridhol perchance to be trapped there again he shivered so long trapped not again of course no one called it aridhol any longer but shadar logoth where the shadow waits an apt name so much had changed even himself padan fain mordeth ordeith sometimes he was uncertain which name was really his who he really was one thing was sure he was not what anyone thought those who believed they knew him were badly mistaken he was transfigured now a force unto himself and beyond any other power they would all learn eventually suddenly he realized with a start that the amyrlin had said something casting about in his mind he found it yes mother the coat suits me very well he ran a hand down the black velvet to show how fine he found it as if garments mattered tis a very good coat i am thanking you kindly mother he was prepared to suffer more of her trying to make him feel at ease ready to kneel and kiss her ring but this time she went straight to the heart tell me more of what you know of rand althor master fain fains eyes went to the painting of the two men and as he gazed at it his back straightened althors portrait tugged at him almost as much as the man would sent rage and hate roiling along his veins because of that young man he had suffered pain beyond remembering pain he did not let himself remember suffered far worse than pain he had been broken and remade because of althor of course that remaking gave him the means of revenge but that was beside the point beside his desire for althors destruction everything else dimmed from sight when he turned back to the amyrlin he did not realize his manner was as commanding as hers meeting her stare for stare rand althor is devious and sly uncaring of anyone or anything but his own power fool woman hes never a one to do what you expect but if she could put althor in his hands he is difficult to lead very difficult but i believe it can be done first you must tie a string to one of the few he trusts if she gave him althor he might leave her alive when he finally went even if she was aes sedai lounging in a gilded chair in his shirtsleeves one booted leg over the padded arm rahvin smiled as the woman standing before the fireplace repeated what he had told her there was a slight glaze in her large brown eyes a young pretty woman even in the plain gray woolens she had adopted for disguise but that was not what interested him about her no breath of air stirred through the rooms tall windows sweat rolled down the womans face as she spoke and beaded on the narrow face of the other man present for all of that mans fine red silk coat with its golden embroidery he stood as stiffly as a servant which he was in a way if of his own free will unlike the woman of course he was deaf and blind for the moment rahvin handled the flows of spirit he had woven around the pair delicately there was no need to damage valuable servants he did not sweat of course he did not let the summers lingering heat touch him he was a tall man large dark and handsome despite the white streaking his temples compulsion had presented no difficulties with this woman a scowl twisted his face it did with some a few a very few had a strength of self so firm that their minds searched even if unaware for crevices through which to slide away it was his bad luck that he still had some small need for one such she could be handled but she kept trying to find escape without knowing she was trapped eventually that one would no longer be needed of course he would have to decide whether to send her on her way or be rid of her more permanently dangers lay either way nothing that could threaten him of course but he was a careful man meticulous small dangers had a way of growing if ignored and he always chose his risks with a measure of prudence to kill her or keep her the cessation of the womans speech pulled him from his reverie when you leave here he told her you will remember nothing of this visit you will remember only taking your usual morning walk she nodded eager to please him and he tied off the strands of spirit lightly so they would evaporate from her mind shortly after she reached the street repeated use of compulsion made obedience easier even when it was not in use but while it was there was always a danger it might be detected that done he released elegars mind as well lord elegar a minor noble but faithful to his vows he licked his thin lips nervously and glanced at the woman then went immediately to one knee before rahvin friends of the dark darkfriends they were called now had begun learning just how strictly they would be kept to their vows now that rahvin and the others were freed take her to the street by back ways rahvin said and leave her there she is not to be seen it will be as you say great master elegar said bowing where he knelt rising he backed from rahvins presence bowing and pulling the woman along by one arm she went docilely of course her eyes still fogged elegar would ask her no questions he knew enough to be well aware that there were things he did not want to know one of your play pretties a womans voice said behind him as the carved door closed have you taken to dressing them like that snatching at saidin he filled himself with the power the taint on the male half of the true source rolling off the protection of his bonds and oaths the ties to what he knew as a greater power than the light or even the creator in the middle of the chamber a gateway stood above the redandgold carpet an opening to somewhere else he had a brief view of a chamber lined with snowy silken hangings before it vanished leaving a woman clad in white and belted in woven silver the slight tingle in his skin like a faint chill was all that told him she had channeled tall and slender she was as beautiful as he was handsome her dark eyes bottomless pools her hair decorated with silver stars and crescents falling in perfect black waves to her shoulders most men would have felt their mouths go dry with desire what do you mean to come sneaking up on me lanfear he demanded roughly he did not let go of the power but rather prepared several nasty surprises in case he had need if you want to speak with me send an emissary and i will decide when and where and if lanfear smiled that sweet treacherous smile you were always a pig rahvin but seldom a fool that woman is aes sedai what if they miss her do you also send out heralds to announce where you are channel he sneered she is not strong enough to be allowed outdoors without a keeper they call untutored children aes sedai when half what they know is selftaught tricks and the other half barely scratches the surface would you still be so complacent if those untutored children put a circle of thirteen around you the cool mockery in her voice stabbed him but he did not let it show i take my precautions lanfear rather than one of my play pretties as you call them she is the towers spy here now she reports exactly what i want her to and she is eager to do so those who serve the chosen in the tower told me right where to find her the day would come soon when the world gave up the name forsaken and knelt to the chosen it had been promised so very long ago why have you come lanfear surely not in aid of defenseless women she merely shrugged you can play with your toys as much as you wish so far as i am concerned you offer little in the way of hospitality rahvin so you will forgive me if a silver pitcher rose from a small table by rahvins bed and tilted to pour dark wine into a goldchased goblet as the pitcher settled the goblet floated to lanfears hand he felt nothing beyond a slight tingle of course saw no flows being woven he had never liked that that she would be able to see as little of his weaving was only a slight redressing of the balance why he demanded again she sipped calmly before speaking since you avoid the rest of us a few of the chosen will be coming here i came first so you would know it was not an attack others some plan of yours what need have i of someone elses designs suddenly he laughed a deep rich sound so it is no attack is it you were never one for attacking openly were you not as bad as moghedien perhaps but you did always favor the flanks and the rear i will trust you this time enough to hear you out as long as you are under my eye who trusted lanfear behind him deserved the knife he might well find in his back not that she was so very trustworthy even when watched her temper was uncertain at best who else is supposed to be part of this he had clearer warning this time it was male work as another gateway opened showing marble arches open onto wide stone balconies and gulls wheeling and crying in a cloudless blue sky finally a man appeared and stepped through the way closing behind him sammael was compact solid and largerseeming than he truly was his stride quick and active his manner abrupt blueeyed and goldenhaired with a neat squaretrimmed beard he would perhaps have been above the ordinary in looks except for a slanting scar as if a redhot poker had been dragged across his face from hairline to jaw he could have had it removed as soon as it was made all those long years ago but he had elected not to linked to saidin as tightly as rahvin this close rahvin could feel it dimly sammael eyed him warily i expected serving maids and dancing girls rahvin have you finally wearied of your sport after all these years lanfear laughed softly into her wine did someone mention sport rahvin had not even noticed the opening of a third gateway showing a large room full of pools and fluted columns nearly nude acrobats and attendants wearing less oddly a lean old man in a wrinkled coat sat disconsolately among the performers two servants in filmy bits of nothing much a wellmuscled man bearing a wroughtgold tray and a beautiful voluptuous woman anxiously pouring wine from a cutcrystal flagon into a matching goblet on the tray followed the true arrival before the opening winked out in any other company but lanfears graendal would have been accounted a stunningly beautiful woman lush and ripe her gown was green silk cut low a ruby the size of a hens egg nestled between her breasts and a coronet encrusted with more rested on her long suncolored hair beside lanfear she was merely plumply pretty if the inevitable comparison bothered her her amused smile gave no sign of it golden bracelets clattered as she waved a heavily beringed hand generally behind her the female servant quickly slipped the goblet into her grasp with a fawning smile mirrored by the man graendal took no notice so she said gaily nearly half the surviving chosen in one place and no one trying to kill anyone who would have expected it before the great lord of the dark returns ishamael did manage to keep us from one anothers throats for a time but this do you always speak so freely in front of your servants sammael said with a grimace graendal blinked glanced back at the pair as if she had forgotten them they wont speak out of turn they worship me dont you the two fell to their knees practically babbling their fervent love of her it was real they actually did love her now after a moment she frowned slightly and the servants froze mouths open in midword they do go on still they wont bother you now will they rahvin shook his head wondering who they were or had been physical beauty was not enough for graendals servants they had to have power or position as well a former lord for a footman a lady to draw her bath that was graendals taste indulging herself was one thing but she was wasteful this pair might have been of use properly manipulated but the level of compulsion graendal employed surely left them good for little more than decoration the woman had no true finesse should i expect more lanfear he growled have you convinced demandred to stop thinking he is all but the great lords heir i doubt he is arrogant enough for that lanfear replied smoothly he can see where it took ishamael and that is the point a point graendal raised once we were thirteen immortal now four are dead and one has betrayed us we four are all who meet here today and enough are you certain asmodean went over sammael demanded he never had the courage to take a chance before where did he find the heart to join a lost cause lanfears brief smile was amused he had the courage for an ambush he thought would set him above the rest of us and when his choice became death or a doomed cause it took little courage for him to choose and little time ill wager the scar made sammaels sneer even more biting if you were close enough to him to know all of this why did you leave him alive you could have killed him before he knew you were there i am not as quick to kill as you it is final with no going back and there are usually other more profitable ways besides to put it in terms you would understand i did not want to launch a frontal assault against superior forces is he really so strong rahvin asked quietly this rand althor could he have overwhelmed you facetoface not that he himself could not if it came to it or sammael though graendal would likely link with lanfear if either of the men tried for that matter both women were probably filled to bursting with the power right that moment ready to strike at the slightest suspicion of either man or of each other but this farmboy an untrained shepherd untrained unless asmodean was trying he is lews therin telamon reborn lanfear said just as softly and lews therin was as strong as any sammael absently rubbed the scar across his face it had been lews therin who gave it to him three thousand years ago and more well before the breaking of the world before the great lord was imprisoned before so much but sammael never forgot well graendal put in have we come around at last to what we are here to discuss rahvin gave a displeased start the two servants were frozen still or again rather sammael muttered in his beard if this rand althor really is lews therin telamon reborn graendal went on settling herself on the mans back where he crouched on all fours i am surprised you havent tried to snuggle him into your bed lanfear or would it be so easy i seem to remember lews therin led you by the nose not the other way around squelched your little tantrums sent you running to fetch his wine in a manner of speaking she set her own wine on the tray held out rigidly by the sightlessly kneeling woman you were so obsessed with him youd have stretched out at his feet if he said rug lanfears dark eyes glittered for a moment before she regained control of herself he may be lews therin reborn but he is not lews therin himself how do you know graendal asked smiling as if it were all a joke it may well be that as many believe all are born and reborn as the wheel turns but nothing like this has ever happened that i have read a specific man reborn according to prophecy who knows what he is lanfear gave a disparaging smirk i have observed him closely he is no more than the shepherd he seems still more naive than not scorn faded to seriousness but now he has asmodean weak ally as he is and even before asmodean four of the chosen have died confronting him let him whittle away the dead wood sammael said gruffly he wove flows of air to drag a chair across the carpet and sprawled with his boots crossed at the ankle and one arm over the low carved back anyone who believed he was at ease was a fool sammael had always liked to dupe his enemies into thinking they could take him by surprise more for the rest of us on the day of return or do you think he might win tarmon gaidon lanfear even if he stiffens asmodeans backbone he has no hundred companions this time with asmodean or alone the great lord will extinguish him like a broken sarlight the look lanfear gave him bristled with contempt how many of us will be alive when the great lord is freed at last four gone already will he come after you next sammael you might like that you could finally get rid of that scar if you defeated him but i forget how many times did you face him in the war of power did you ever win i cannot seem to remember without pause she rounded on graendal or it might be you he is reluctant to hurt women for some reason but you wont even be able to make asmodeans choice you cannot teach him any more than a stone could unless he decides to keep you as a pet that would be a change for you would it not instead of deciding which of your pretties pleases you best you could learn to please graendals face contorted and rahvin prepared to shield himself against whatever the two women might hurl at one another prepared to travel at even a whiff of balefire then he sensed sammael gathering the power sensed a difference in it sammael would call it seizing a tactical advantage and bent to grab the other mans arm sammael shook him off angrily but the moment had passed the two women were looking at them now not each other neither could know what had almost happened but clearly something had passed between rahvin and sammael and suspicion lit their eyes i want to hear what lanfear has to say he did not look at sammael but meant it for him there must be more to this than a foolish attempt to frighten us sammael jerked his head in what might have been a nod or merely disgruntlement it would have to do oh there is though a little fright could not hurt lanfears dark eyes still held distrust but her voice was as clear as still water ishamael tried to control him and failed tried to kill him in the end and failed but ishamael tried bullying and fear and bullying does not work with rand althor ishamael was more than halfmad sammael muttered and less than halfhuman is that what we are graendal arched an eyebrow merely human surely we are something more this is human she stroked a finger down the cheek of the woman kneeling beside her a new word will have to be created to describe us whatever we are lanfear said we can succeed where ishamael failed she was leaning slightly forward as if to force the words on them lanfear seldom showed tension why now why only we four rahvin asked the other why would have to wait why more was lanfears reply if we can present the dragon reborn kneeling to the great lord on the day of return why share the honor and the rewards further than need be and perhaps he can even be used to how did you put it sammael whittle away the dead wood it was the sort of answer rahvin could understand not that he trusted her of course or any of the others but he understood ambition the chosen had plotted among themselves for position up to the day lews therin had imprisoned them in sealing up the great lords prison and they had begun again the day they were freed he just had to be sure lanfears plot did not disrupt his own plans speak on he told her first someone else is trying to control him perhaps to kill i suspect moghedien or demandred moghedien has always tried to work from the shadows and demandred always did hate lews therin sammael smiled or perhaps grimaced but his hatred was a pale thing beside demandreds though for better cause how do you know it is not one of us here graendal asked glibly lanfears smile showed as many teeth as the other womans and as little warmth because you three choose to carve out niches for yourselves and secure your power while the rest slash at each other and other reasons i told you i keep a close watch on rand althor it was true what she said of them rahvin himself preferred diplomacy and manipulation to open conflict though he would not shy from it if needed sammaels way had always been armies and conquest he would not go near lews therin even reborn as a shepherd until he was sure of victory graendal too followed conquest though her methods did not involve soldiers for all her concern with her toys she took one solid step at a time openly to be sure as the chosen reckoned such things but never stretching too far at any step you know i can keep an eye on him unseen lanfear continued but the rest of you must stay clear or run the risk of detection we must draw him back graendal leaned forward interested and sammael began to nod as she went on rahvin reserved judgment it might well work and if not if not he saw several ways to shape events to his advantage this might work out very well indeed chapter lion rampant fanning the sparks the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose in the great forest called braem wood the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning south and west it blew dry beneath a sun of molten gold there had been no rain for long weeks in the land below and the latesummer heat grew day by day brown leaves come early dotted some trees and naked stones baked where small streams had run in an open place where grass had vanished and only thin withered brush held the soil with its roots the wind began uncovering longburied stones they were weathered and worn and no human eye would have recognized them for the remains of a city remembered in story yet otherwise forgotten scattered villages appeared before the wind crossed the border of andor and fields where worried farmers trudged arid furrows the forest had long since thinned to thickets by the time the wind swept dust down the lone street of a village called kore springs the springs were beginning to run low this summer a few dogs lay panting in the swelter and two shirtless boys ran beating a stuffed bladder along the ground with sticks nothing else stirred save the wind and the dust and the creaking sign above the door of the inn red brick and thatchroofed like every other building along the street at two stories it was the tallest and largest structure in kore springs a neat and orderly little town the saddled horses hitched in front of the inn barely twitched their tails the inns carved sign proclaimed the good queens justice blinking against the dust min kept an eye pressed to the crack in the sheds rough wall she could just make out one shoulder of the guard on the shed door but her attention was all for the inn further on she wished the name were less ominously apt their judge the local lord had apparently arrived some time ago but she had missed seeing him no doubt he was hearing the farmers charges admer nem along with his brothers and cousins and all their wives had seemed in favor of an immediate hanging before one of the lords retainers happened by she wondered what the penalty was here for burning up a mans barn and his milkcows with it by accident of course but she did not think that would count for much when it all began with trespass logain had gotten away in the confusion abandoning them he would burn him and she did not know whether to be happy about that or not it was he who had knocked nem down when they were discovered just before dawn sending the mans lantern flying into the straw the blame was his if anyones only sometimes he had trouble watching what he said perhaps as well he was gone twisting to lean back against the wall she wiped sweat from her brow though it only sprang out again the inside of the shed was stifling but her two companions did not appear to notice siuan lay stretched out on her back in a dark woolen riding dress much like mins staring at the shed roof idly tapping her chin with a straw copperyskinned leane willowy and as tall as most men sat crosslegged in her pale shift working on her dress with needle and thread they had been allowed to keep their saddlebags after they were searched for swords or axes or anything else that might help them escape whats the penalty for burning down a barn in andor min asked if we are lucky siuan replied without moving a strapping in the village square not so lucky and it will be a flogging light min breathed how can you call that luck siuan rolled onto her side and propped herself up on an elbow she was a sturdy woman short of beautiful though beyond handsome and looked no more than a few years older than min but those sharp blue eyes had a commanding presence that did not belong on a young woman awaiting trial in a backcountry shed sometimes siuan was as bad as logain about forgetting herself maybe worse when a strapping is done she said in a brooknononsense donotbefoolish tone it is done and we can be on our way it wastes less of our time than any other penalty i can think of considerably less than hanging say though i dont think it will come to that from what i remember of andoran law wheezing laughter shook min for a moment it was that or cry time the way we are going weve nothing but time i swear we have been through every village between here and tar valon and found nothing not a glimmer not a whisper i dont think there is any gathering and we are on foot now from what i overheard logain took the horses with him afoot and locked in a shed awaiting the light knows what watch names siuan whispered sharply shooting a meaning glance at the rough door with the guard on the other side a flapping tongue can put you in the net instead of the fish min grimaced partly because she was growing tired of siuans tairen fishermans sayings and partly because the other woman was right so far they had outrun awkward news deadly was a better word than awkward but some news had a way of leaping a hundred miles in a day siuan had been traveling as mara leane as amaena and logain had taken the name dalyn after siuan convinced him guaire was a fools choice min still did not think anyone would recognize her own name but siuan insisted on calling her serenla even logain did not know their true names the real trouble was that siuan was not going to give up weeks of utter failure and now this yet any mention of heading for tear which was sensible set off a tempest that quailed even logain the longer they had searched without finding what siuan sought the more temper she had developed not that she couldnt crack rocks with it before min was wise enough to keep that particular thought to herself leane finally finished with her dress and tugged it on over her head doubling her arms behind her to do up the buttons min could not see why she had gone to the trouble she herself hated needlework of any sort the neckline was a little lower now showing a bit of leanes bosom and it fit in a snugger way there and perhaps around the hips but what was the point here no one was going to ask her to dance in this roasting shed digging into mins saddlebags leane pulled out the wooden box of paints and powders and whatnots that laras had forced on min before they set out min had kept meaning to throw it away but somehow she had never gotten around to it there was a small mirror inside the hinged lid of the box and in moments leane was at work on her face with small rabbitfur brushes she had never shown any particular interest in the things before now she appeared vexed that there was only a blackwood hairbrush and a small ivory comb to use on her hair she even muttered about the lack of a way to heat the curling iron her dark hair had grown since they began siuans search but it still came well short of her shoulders after watching a bit min asked what are you up to leamaena she avoided looking at siuan she could guard her tongue it was just being cooped up and baked alive that on top of the coming trial a hanging or a public strapping what a choice have you decided to take up flirting it was meant for a joke leane was all business and efficiency something to lighten the moment but the other woman surprised her yes leane said briskly peering wideeyed into the mirror while she carefully did something to her eyelashes and if i flirt with the right man perhaps we will not need to worry about strappings or anything else at the least i might get us lighter sentences hand halfraised to wipe her face again min gasped it was like an owl announcing it meant to become a hummingbird but siuan merely sat up facing leane with a level what brought this on had siuan directed that gaze at her min suspected she would have confessed to things she had forgotten when siuan concentrated on you like that you found yourself curtsying and leaping to do as you were told before you realized it even logain did most of the time except for the curtsy leane calmly stroked a tiny brush along her cheekbones and examined the result in the small mirror she did glance at siuan but whatever she saw she answered in the same crisp tones she always used my mother was a merchant you know in furs and timber mainly i once saw her fog a saldaean lords mind till he consigned his entire years timber harvest to her for half the amount he wanted and i doubt he realized what had happened until he was nearly back home if then he sent her a moonstone bracelet later domani women dont deserve the whole reputation they have stiffnecked prigs going by hearsay built most of it but we have earned some my mother and my aunts taught me along with my sisters and cousins of course looking down at herself she shook her head then returned to her ministrations with a sigh but i fear i was as tall as i am today on my fourteenth naming day all knees and elbows like a colt that grew too fast and not long after i could walk across a room without tripping twice i learned she drew a deep breath learned my life would take me another way than being a merchant and now that is gone too about time i put to use what i was taught all those years ago under the circumstances i cant think of a better time or place siuan studied her shrewdly a moment more that isnt the reason not the whole reason out with it hurling a small brush into the box leane blazed up in a fury the whole reason i do not know the whole reason i only know i need something in my life to replace what is gone you yourself told me that is the only hope of surviving revenge falls short for me i know your cause is necessary and perhaps even right but the light help me that is not enough either i cant make myself be as involved as you maybe i came too late to it i will stay with you but it isnt enough anger faded as she began resealing pots and vials and replacing them though she used more force than was strictly necessary there was the merest hint of rose scent about her i know flirting isnt something to fill up the emptiness but it is enough to fill an idle moment maybe being who i was born to be will suffice i just do not know this isnt a new idea i always wanted to be like my mother and my aunts daydreamed of it sometimes after i was grown leanes face became pensive and the last things went into the box more gently i think perhaps ive always felt i was masquerading as someone else building up a mask until it became second nature there was serious work to be done more serious than merchanting and by the time i realized there was another way i could have gone even so i had the mask on too firmly to take off well that is done with now and the mask is coming off i even considered beginning with logain a week ago for practice but i am out of practice and i think he is the kind of man who might hear more promises than you meant to offer and expect to have them fulfilled a small smile suddenly appeared on her lips my mother always said if that happened you had miscalculated badly if there was no back way out you had to either abandon dignity and run or pay the price and consider it a lesson the smile took on a roguish cast my aunt resara said you paid the price and enjoyed it min could only shake her head it was as if leane had become a different woman talking that way about even hearing it she could hardly believe come to that leane actually looked different for all of the work with brushes there was not a hint of paint or powder on her face that min could see yet her lips seemed fuller her cheekbones higher her eyes larger she was a more than pretty woman at any time but now her beauty was magnified fivefold siuan was not quite finished though and if this country lord is one like logain she said softly what will you do then leane drew herself up stiffbacked on her knees and swallowed hard before answering but her voice was perfectly level given the alternatives what choice would you make neither blinked and the silence stretched before siuan could answer if she meant to min would have given a pretty to hear it the chain and lock rattled on the other side of the door the other two women got slowly to their feet gathering their saddlebags in calm preparation but min leaped up wishing she had her belt knife fool thing to wish for she thought just get me in worse trouble im no bloody hero in a story even if i jumped the guard the door opened and a man with a long leather jerkin over his shirt filled the doorway not a fellow to be attacked by a young woman even with a knife maybe not even with an axe wide was the word for him and thick the few hairs remaining on his head were more white than not but he looked hard as an old oak stump time for you girls to stand before the lord he said gruffly will you walk or must we haul you like grain sacks you go either way but id as soon not have to carry you in this heat peeking past him min saw two more men waiting grayhaired but just as hard if not quite so big we will walk siuan told him dryly good come then step along lord gareth wont like being kept waiting promise to walk or no each man took one of them firmly by the arm as they started up the dusty dirt street the balding mans hand encircled mins arm like a manacle so much for running for it she thought bitterly she considered kicking his booted ankle to see if that would loosen his grip but he looked so solid she suspected all it would earn her was a sore toe and being dragged the rest of the way leane appeared lost in thought she halfmade small gestures with her free hand and her lips moved silently as though reviewing what she meant to say but she kept shaking her head and starting over again introspection wrapped siuan too but she wore an openly worried frown even chewing her underlip siuan never showed that much unease all in all the pair of them did nothing for mins confidence the beamceilinged common room of the good queens justice did less lankhaired admer nem a yellowed bruise around his swollen eye stood to one side with half a dozen equally stout brothers and cousins and their wives all in their best coats or aprons the farmers eyed the three prisoners with a mixture of anger and satisfaction that made mins stomach sink if anything the farmwives glares were worse pure hate the rest of the walls were lined six deep with villagers all garbed for the work they had interrupted for this the blacksmith still wore his leather apron and a number of women had sleeves rolled up arms dusted with flour the room buzzed with their murmuring among themselves the elders as much as the few children and their eyes latched onto the three women as avidly as the nems did min thought this must be as much excitement as kore springs had ever witnessed she had seen a crowd with this mood once at an execution the tables had been removed except for one placed in front of the long brick fireplace a blufffaced stocky man his hair thick with gray sat facing them in a wellcut coat of dark green silk hands folded in front of him on the tabletop a slim woman who showed as much age stood beside the table in a fine gray wool dress embroidered with white flowers around the neck the local lord min supposed and his lady country nobility little better informed of the world than their tenants and crofters the guards situated them in front of the lords table and melted into the watchers the woman in gray stepped forward and the murmurs died all here attend and give ear the woman announced for justice will be meted today by lord gareth bryne prisoners you are called before the judgment of lord bryne not the lords lady then an official of some sort gareth bryne the last min remembered he was captaingeneral of the queens guards in caemlyn if it was the same man she glanced at siuan but siuan had her eyes locked on the wide floorboards in front of her feet whoever he was this bryne looked weary you are charged the woman in gray went on with trespass by night arson and destruction of a building and its contents the killing of valuable livestock assault on the person of admer nem and the theft of a purse said to contain gold and silver it is understood that the assault and theft were the work of your companion who escaped but you three are equally culpable under the law she paused to let it sink in and min exchanged rueful glances with leane logain would have to add theft to the stew he was probably halfway to murandy by now if not more distant yet after a moment the woman began again your accusers are here to face you she gestured to the cluster of nems admer nem you will give your testimony the stout man eased forward in a blend of selfimportance and selfconsciousness tugging at his coat where the wooden buttons strained over his middle running his hands through thinning hair that kept dropping into his face like i said lord gareth it was like this he gave a fairly straightforward account of discovering them in the hayloft and ordering them out though he made logain near a foot taller and turned the mans single blow into a fight where nem gave as good as he got the lantern fell the hay went up and the rest of the family came spilling out of the farmhouse into the predawn the prisoners were seized and the barn burned to the ground and then the loss of the purse from the house was discovered he did slight the part where lord brynes retainer rode by as some of the family were bringing out ropes and eyeing tree limbs when he started on the fight again this time he seemed to be winning bryne cut him off that will be enough master nem you may step back instead a roundfaced one of the nem women of an age to be admers wife joined him roundfaced but not soft round like a frying pan or a river rock and flushed with something more than anger you whip these hussies good lord gareth hear whip them good and ride them to jornhill on a rail no one called on you to speak maigan the slim woman in gray said sharply this is a trial not a petition meeting you and admer step back now they obeyed admer with a shade more alacrity than maigan the grayclad woman turned to min and her companions if you wish to offer testimony in defense or mitigation you may now give it there was no sympathy in her voice nor anything else for that matter min expected siuan to speak she always took the lead did the talking but siuan never stirred or raised her eyes instead it was leane who moved toward the table her eyes on the man behind it she stood as straight as ever but her usual walk a graceful stride but a stride had become a sort of glide with just a hint of willowy sway to it somehow her hips and bosom seemed more obvious not that she flaunted anything the way she moved just made you aware my lord we are three helpless women refugees from the storms that sweep the world her usually brisk tones were gone changed to a velvety soft caress there was a light in her dark eyes a sort of smoldering challenge penniless and lost we took shelter in master nems barn it was wrong i know but we were afraid of the night a small gesture hands halfraised the insides of her wrists to bryne made her seem for a moment utterly helpless only for that moment though the man dalyn was a stranger to us really a man who offered us his protection in these days women alone must have a protector my lord yet i fear we made a poor choice a widening of the eyes an entreating look said he could make a better for them it was indeed he who attacked master nem my lord we would have fled or worked to repay our nights lodging stepping around the side of the table she knelt gracefully beside brynes chair and gently rested the fingers of one hand on his wrist as she gazed up into his eyes a tremble touched her voice but her slight smile was enough to set any mans heart racing it suggested my lord we are guilty of some small crime yet not so much as we are charged with we throw ourselves on your mercy i beg you my lord have pity on us and protect us for a long moment bryne stared back into her eyes then clearing his throat roughly he scraped back his chair rose and walked around the opposite end of the table from her there was a stir among the villagers and farmers men clearing their throats as their lord had done women muttering under their breath bryne stopped in front of min what is your name girl min my lord she caught a muffled grunt from siuan and hastily added serenla min everyone calls me serenla my lord your mother must have had a premonition he murmured with a smile he was not the first to react to the name in a like way do you have any statement to make serenla only that i am very sorry my lord and it really wasnt our fault dalyn did it all i ask for mercy my lord that did not seem much alongside leanes plea anything at all would seem insignificant beside leanes performance but it was the best she could find her mouth was as dry as the street outside what if he did decide to hang them nodding he moved over to siuan who was still studying the floor cupping a hand under her chin he raised her eyes to his and what is your name girl with a jerk of her head siuan pulled her chin free and took a step back mara my lord she whispered mara tomanes min groaned softly siuan was plainly frightened yet at the same time she stared at the man defiantly min more than halfexpected her to demand bryne let them walk away on the instant he asked her if she wished to make a statement and she denied it in another unsteady whisper but all the while looking at him as though she were the one in charge she might be controlling her tongue but certainly not her eyes after a time bryne turned away take your place with your friends girl he told leane as he returned to his chair she joined them with a look of open frustration and what in anyone else min would have called a touch of petulance i have reached my decision bryne said to the room at large the crimes are serious and nothing i have heard alters the facts if three men sneak into anothers house to steal his candlesticks and one of them attacks the owner all three are equally guilty there must be recompense master nem i will give you the cost of rebuilding your barn plus the price of six milkcows the stout farmers eyes brightened until bryne added caralin will disburse the coin to you when she is content as to costs and prices some of your cows were going dry i hear the slim woman in gray nodded in satisfaction for the bump on your head i award you one silver mark dont complain he said firmly as nem opened his mouth maigan has given you worse for drinking too much a ripple of laughter among the onlookers greeted that not diminished at all by nems halfabashed glares and perhaps spurred by the tightlipped look maigan gave her husband i will also replace the amount of the stolen purse once caralin has satisfied herself as to how much was in it nem and his wife appeared equally disgruntled but they held their tongues it was plain he had given them what he would min began to feel hope leaning his elbows on the table bryne turned his attention to her and the other two his slow words tied her stomach into a knot you three will work for me at the normal wages for whatever tasks you are given until the coin ive paid out is repaid to me do not think i am being lenient if you swear an oath that satisfies me you dont have to be guarded you can work in my manor if not it means the fields where you can be under someones eyes every minute wages are lower in the fields but it is your decision frantically she racked her brain for the weakest oath that might satisfy she did not like breaking her word in any circumstances but she meant to be gone as soon as a chance presented and she did not want too heavy an oathbreaking on her conscience leane seemed to be searching too but siuan barely hesitated before kneeling and folding her hands over her heart her eyes seemed fastened to brynes and the challenge had not faded one bit by the light and my hope of salvation and rebirth i swear to serve you in whatever way you require for as long as you require or may the creators face turn from me forever and darkness consume my soul she delivered the words in a breathy whisper but they created a dead silence there was no oath stronger unless it was the one a woman took on being made aes sedai and the oath rod bound her to that as surely as to a part of her flesh leane stared at siuan then she was on her knees too by the light and my hope of salvation and rebirth min floundered desperately searching for some way out swearing a lesser oath than they did meant the fields for certain and someone watching her every instant but this oath by what she had been taught breaking it would be not much less than murder maybe no less only there was no way out the oath or who knew how many years laboring in a field all day and probably locked up at night sinking down beside the other two women she muttered the words but inside she was howling siuan you utter fool what have you gotten me into now i cant stay here i have to go to rand oh light help me well bryne breathed when the last word was spoken i did not expect that but it does suffice caralin would you take master nem somewhere and find out what he thinks his losses amount to and clear everyone else but these three out of here too and make arrangements to transport them to the manor under the circumstances i dont think guards will be necessary the slim woman gave him a harassed look but in short order she had everyone moving out in a milling throng admer nem and his male kin stuck close to her his face especially painted with avarice the nem women looked scarcely less greedy but they still spared a few hard glowers for min and the other two who remained kneeling as the room emptied out for herself min did not believe her legs could hold her up the same phrases repeated over and over in her mind oh siuan why i cant stay here i cant we have had a few refugees through here bryne said when the last of the villagers had gone he leaned back in his chair studying them but never as odd a threesome as you a domani a tairen siuan nodded curtly she and leane stood up the slender copperyskinned woman delicately brushing her knees siuan simply standing min managed to join them on wobbly legs and you serenla once more he gave the ghost of a smile at the name somewhere in the west of andor unless i mistake your accent baerlon she muttered then bit her tongue too late someone might know min was from baerlon ive heard of nothing in the west to make refugees he said in a questioning tone when she remained silent he did not press it after you have worked off your debt you will be welcome to remain in my service life can be hard for those whove lost their homes and even a maids cot is better than sleeping under a bush thank you my lord leane said caressingly making a curtsy so graceful that even in her rough riding dress it looked part of a dance mins echo was leaden and she did not trust her knees for a curtsy siuan simply stood there staring at him and said nothing at all a pity your companion took your horses four horses would reduce your debt by some he was a stranger and a rogue leane told him in a voice suitable for something far more intimate i for one am more than happy to exchange his protection for yours my lord bryne eyed her appreciatively min thought but all he said was at least you will be safely away from the nems at the manor there was no reply for that min supposed scrubbing floors in brynes manor would not be much different from scrubbing floors in the nem farmhouse how do i get out of this light how the silence went on except for bryne drumming his fingers on the table min would have thought he was at a loss for what to say next but she did not think this man was ever off balance more likely he was irritated that only leane appeared to be showing any gratitude she supposed their sentence could have been much worse from his point of view perhaps leanes heated glances and stroking tones had worked after a fashion but min found herself wishing the woman had remained the way she was being hung up by the wrists in the village square would be better than this finally caralin returned muttering to herself she sounded prickly reporting to bryne it will take days to get straight answers from those nems lord gareth admer would have five new barns and fifty cows if i let him at least i believe there really was a purse but as to how much was in it she shook her head and sighed i will find out eventually joni is ready to take these girls to the manor if you are done with them take them away caralin bryne said rising when youve sent them off join me at the brickyard he sounded weary again thad haren says he needs more water if hes to keep making bricks and the light alone knows where i will find it for him he strode out of the common room as if he had forgotten all about the three women who had just sworn to serve him joni turned out to be the wide balding man who had come for them in the shed waiting now in front of the inn beside a highwheeled cart enclosed by a round canvas cover with a lean brown horse in the shafts a few of the villagers stood about to watch their departure but most seemed to have gone back to their homes and out of the heat gareth bryne was already far down the dirt street joni will see you safely to the manor caralin said do as you are told and you will not find the life hard for a moment she considered them dark eyes nearly as sharp as siuans then she nodded to herself as if satisfied and hurried off after bryne joni held the curtains open for them at the back of the cart but let them clamber up unaided and find places to sit on the cart bed there was not so much as a handful of straw for padding and the heavy covering trapped the heat he said not a word the cart rocked as he climbed up on the drivers seat hidden by the canvas min heard him cluck to the horse and the cart lurched off wheels creaking slightly bumping over occasional potholes there was just enough of a crack in the covering at the back for min to watch the village dwindle behind them and vanish replaced alternately by long thickets and railfenced fields she felt too stunned to speak siuans grand cause was to end scrubbing pots and floors she should never have helped the woman never stayed with her she should have ridden for tear at the first opportunity well leane said suddenly that worked out not badly at all she was back to her usual brisk voice again but there was a flush of excitement excitement in it and a high color in her cheeks it could have been better but practice will take care of that her low laugh was almost a giggle i never realized how much fun it would be when i actually felt his pulse racing for a moment she held out her hand the way she had placed it on brynes wrist i dont think i ever felt so alive so aware aunt resara used to say men were better sport than hawks but i never really understood until today holding herself against the sway of the cart min goggled at her you have gone mad she said finally how many years have we sworn away two five i suppose you hope gareth bryne will spend them dandling you on his knee well i hope he turns you over it every day the startled look on leanes face did nothing for mins temper did she expect min to take it as calmly as she appeared to but it was not leane that min was really angry with she twisted around to glare at siuan and you when you decide to give up you dont do it small you just surrender like a lamb at slaughter why did you choose that oath light why because siuan replied it was the one oath i could be sure would keep him from setting people to watch us night and day manor house or not lying half stretched out on the rough planks of the cart she made it sound the most obvious thing in the world and leane appeared to agree with her you mean to break it min said after a moment it came out in a shocked whisper but even so she glanced worriedly at the canvas curtains that hid joni she did not think he could have heard i mean to do what i must siuan said firmly but just as softly in two or three days when i can be sure they really arent watching us especially we will leave i fear we must take horses since ours are gone bryne must have good stables i will regret that and leane just sat there like a cat with cream on her whiskers she must have realized from the first that was why she had not hesitated in swearing you will regret stealing horses min said hoarsely you plan to break an oath anyone but a darkfriend would keep and you regret stealing horses i cant believe either of you i dont know either of you do you really mean to stay and scrub pots leane asked her voice just as low as theirs when rand is out there with your heart in his pocket min glowered silently she wished they had never learned she was in love with rand althor sometimes she wished she had never learned it a man who barely knew she was alive a man like that what he was no longer seemed as important as the fact that he had never looked at her twice but it was all of a piece really she wanted to say she would keep her oath forget about rand for however long it took her to work off her debt only she could not open her mouth burn him if id never met him i wouldnt be in this pickle when the silence between them had gone on far too long for mins liking broken only by the rhythmic creak of the wheels and the soft thud of the horses hooves siuan spoke i mean to do as i swore to do when i have finished what i must do first i did not swear to serve him immediately i was careful not to even imply it strictly speaking a fine point i know and one gareth bryne might not appreciate but true all the same min sagged in amazement letting herself lurch with the carts slow motion you intend to run away then come back in a few years and hand yourselves over to bryne the man will sell your hides to a tannery our hides not until she said that did she realize she had accepted siuans solution run away then come back and i cant i love rand and he wouldnt notice if gareth bryne made me work in his kitchens the rest of my life not a man to cross i agree siuan sighed i met him once before i was terrified he might recognize my voice today faces may change but voices dont she touched her own face wonderingly as she sometimes did apparently unaware of doing so faces do change she murmured then her tone firmed ive paid heavy prices already for what i had to do and i will pay this one eventually if you must drown or ride a lionfish you ride and hope for the best that is all there is to it serenla being a servant is far from the future i would choose leane said but it is in the future and who knows what may happen before i can remember too well when i thought i had no future a small smile appeared on her lips her eyes halfclosed dreamily and her voice became velvet besides i dont think he will sell our hides at all give me a few years of practice and then a few minutes with lord gareth bryne and he will greet us with open arms and put us up in his best rooms hell deck us with silks and offer his carriage to carry us wherever we want to go min left her wrapped in her fantasy sometimes she thought the other two both lived in dreamworlds something else occurred to her a small thing but it was beginning to irritate ah mara tell me something ive noticed some people smile when you call me by name serenla bryne did and he said something about my mother having a premonition why in the old tongue siuan replied it means stubborn daughter you did have a stubborn streak when we first met a mile wide and a mile deep siuan said that siuan the most stubborn woman in the whole world her smile was as wide as her face of course you do seem to be coming along at the next village you might use chalinda that means sweet girl or maybe suddenly the cart gave a harder lurch than any before then picked up speed as if the horse were reaching for a gallop bumping around like grain on a chaffing sieve the three women stared at one another in surprise then siuan levered herself up and pulled aside the canvas hiding the drivers seat joni was gone throwing herself across the wooden seat siuan grabbed the reins and reared back hauling the horse to a halt min threw open the back curtains searching the road ran through a thicket here nearly a small forest of oak and elm pine and leatherleaf the dust of their short dash was still settling some of it on joni where he lay sprawled by the side of the hardpacked dirt road sixty or so paces back instinctively min leaped down and ran back to kneel beside the big man he was still breathing but his eyes were closed and a bloody gash on the side of his head was coming up in a purple lump leane pushed her aside and felt jonis head with sure fingers he will live she said crisply nothing seems broken but he will have a headache for days after he wakes sitting back on her heels she folded her hands and her voice saddened there is nothing i can do for him in any case burn me i promised myself i would not cry over it again the question min swallowed and started again the question is do we load him in the back of the cart and take him on to the manor or do we go light im no better than siuan we could carry him as far as the next farm leane said slowly siuan came up to them leading the cart horse as if afraid the placid animal might bite one glance at the man on the ground and she frowned he never had that falling off the cart i dont see root or rock here to cause it she started studying the wood around them and a man rode out of the trees on a tall black stallion leading three mares one shaggy and two hands shorter than the others he was a tall man in a blue silk coat with a sword at his side his hair curling to broad shoulders darkly handsome despite a hardening as though misfortune had marked him deeply and he was the last man min expected to see is this your work siuan demanded of him logain smiled as he reined in beside the cart though there was little amusement in it a sling is a useful thing mara you are lucky i am here i didnt expect you to leave the village for some hours yet and barely able to walk then the local lord was indulgent it seems abruptly his face went even darker and his voice was rough stone did you think i would leave you to your fate maybe i should have you made promises to me mara i want the revenge you promised ive followed you halfway to the sea of storms on this search though you wont tell me what for ive asked no questions as to how you plan to give me what you promised but i will tell you this now your time is growing short end your search soon and deliver your promises or i will leave you to find your own way youll quickly find most villages offer small sympathy to penniless strangers three pretty women alone the sight of this he touched the sword at his hip has kept you safe more times than you can know find what you are seeking soon mara he had not been so arrogant at the beginning of their journey then he had been humbly thankful for their help as humbly as a man like logain could manage anyway it seemed that time and a lack of results had withered his gratitude siuan did not flinch away from his stare i hope to she said firmly but if you want to go then leave our horses and go if you wont row get out of the boat and swim by yourself see how far you get with your revenge alone logains big hands tightened on his reins until min heard his knuckles crack he shivered with emotions in strong check i will stay a while longer mara he said finally a little while longer for an instant to mins eyes a halo flared around his head a radiant crown of gold and blue siuan and leane saw nothing of course though they knew what she could do sometimes she saw things about people viewings she called them images or auras sometimes she knew what they meant that woman would marry that man would die small matters or grand events joyous or bleak there was never any rhyme or reason to who or where or when aes sedai and warders always had auras most people never did it was not always pleasant knowing she had seen logains halo before and she knew what it meant glory to come but for him perhaps above all men surely that made no sense at all his horse and his sword and his coat had come from playing at dice though min was not certain how fair the games had been he had nothing else and no prospects except siuans promises and how could siuan ever keep them his very name was likely a death sentence it just made no sense logains humor returned as suddenly as it had gone pulling a fat roughly woven purse from his belt he jangled it at them ive come by a few coins we wont have to sleep in another barn for a while we heard of it siuan said dryly i suppose i should have expected no better from you think of it as a contribution to your search she stretched out her hand but he tied the purse back to his belt with a faintly mocking grin i would not want to taint your hand with stolen coin mara besides this way perhaps i can be sure you wont run off and leave me siuan looked as if she could have bitten a nail in two but she said nothing standing in his stirrups logain peered down the road toward kore springs i see a flock of sheep coming this way and a pair of boys time for us to ride theyll carry word of this as fast as they can run settling back down he glanced at joni still lying there unconscious and theyll fetch help for that fellow i dont think i hit him hard enough to hurt him badly min shook her head the man continually surprised her she would not have thought he would spare a second thought for a man whose head he had just cracked siuan and leane wasted no time scrambling into their highcantled saddles leane onto the gray mare she called moonflower siuan onto bela the short shaggy mare it was more of a scramble for siuan she was no horsewoman after weeks in the saddle she still treated sedate bela like a fieryeyed warhorse leane handled moonflower with effortless ease min knew she was somewhere in between she climbed onto wildrose her bay with considerably more grace than siuan considerably less than leane do you think he will come after us min asked as they started south away from kore springs at a trot she meant the question for siuan but it was logain who answered the local lord i doubt he thinks you important enough of course he may send a man and hell certainly spread your descriptions we will ride as far as we can manage before stopping and again tomorrow it seemed he was taking charge we arent important enough siuan said bouncing awkwardly in her saddle she might have been wary of bela but the look she directed at logains back said his challenge to her authority would not last long for herself min hoped bryne considered them unimportant he probably did as long as he never learned their real names logain quickened the stallions pace and she heeled wildrose to keep up putting her thoughts ahead not behind tucking his leather gauntlets behind his sword belt gareth bryne picked up the curlbrimmed velvet hat from his writing table the hat was the latest fashion from caemlyn caralin had seen to that he had no care for fashion but she thought he should dress suitably for his position and it was the silks and velvets she laid out for him in the mornings as he set the highcrowned hat on his head he caught sight of his shadowy reflection in one of the study windows fitting that it was so wavery and thin squint as much as he would his gray hat and gray silk coat embroidered with silver scrolls down the sleeves and collar looked nothing like the helmet and armor he was used to that was over and done and this this was something to fill empty hours that was all are you certain you want to do this lord gareth he turned from the window to where caralin stood beside her own writing table across the room from his hers was piled with the estate account books she had run his estates all the years he had been gone and without doubt she still made a better job of it than he did if you had set them to work for admer nem as the law required she went on this would be none of your affair at all but i did not he told her and would not if i had it to do again you know as well as i do nem and his male kin would be trying to corner those girls day and night and maigan and the rest of the women would make their lives the pit of doom that is if all three girls didnt accidentally fall down a well and drown even maigan would not use a well caralin said dryly not with the weather weve been having still i take your point lord gareth but they have had most of a day and a night to run in any direction you will locate them as soon by sending out word of them if they can be found thad can find them thad was over seventy but he could still track yesterdays wind across stone by moonlight and he had been more than happy to turn the brickyard over to his son if you say so lord gareth she and thad did not get on well when you bring them back i can certainly use them in the house something in her voice casual as it was pricked his attention a touch of satisfaction practically from the day he arrived home caralin had introduced a succession of pretty maids and farmgirls into the manor house all willing and eager to help the lord forget his miseries they are oathbreakers caralin i fear its the fields for them a brief exasperated tightening of her lips confirmed his suspicions but she kept her tone indifferent the other two perhaps lord gareth but the domani girls grace would be wasted in the fields and would suit serving at table very well a remarkably pretty young woman still it will be as you wish of course so that was the one caralin had picked out a remarkably pretty young woman indeed though oddly different from the domani women he had met a touch hesitant here a touch too fast there almost as if she were just now trying out her arts for the first time that was impossible of course domani women trained their daughters to twine men around their fingers almost from the cradle not that she had been ineffective he admitted if caralin had sprung her on him among the farmgirls remarkably pretty so why was it not her face that kept filling his mind why did he find himself thinking of a pair of blue eyes challenging him as though wishing she had a sword afraid and refusing to yield to fear mara tomanes he had been sure she was one to keep her word even without oaths i will bring her back he muttered to himself i will know why she broke oath as you say my lord caralin said i thought she might do for your bedchamber maid sela is getting a bit old to be running up and down the stairs to fetch for you at night bryne blinked at her what oh the domani girl he shook his head at caralins foolishness but was he being any less foolish he was the lord here he should remain here to take care of his people yet caralin had taken better care than he knew how all the years he was gone he knew camps and soldiers and campaigns and maybe a bit of how to maneuver in court intrigues she was right he should take off his sword and this fool hat and have caralin write out their descriptions and instead he said keep a close eye on admer nem and his kin theyll try to cheat you as much as they can as you say my lord the words were perfectly respectful the tone told him to go teach his grandfather to shear sheep chuckling to himself he went outside the manor house was really little more than a tremendously overgrown farmhouse two rambling stories of brick and stone under a slate roof added to again and again by generations of brynes house bryne had owned this land or it had owned them since andor was wrought from the wreckage of artur hawkwings empire a thousand years before and for all that time it had sent its sons off to fight andors wars he would fight no more wars but it was too late for house bryne there had been too many wars too many battles he was the last of the blood no wife no son no daughter the line ended with him all things had to end the wheel of time turned twenty men waited beside saddled horses on the stonepaved yard in front of the manor house men even grayer than he mostly if they had hair experienced soldiers all former squadmen squadron leaders and bannermen who had served with him at one time or another in his career joni shagrin who had been senior bannerman of the guards was right at the front with a bandage around his temples though bryne knew for a fact his daughters had set their children to keep him in his bed he was one of the few who had any family here or anywhere else most had chosen to come serve gareth bryne again rather than drink away their pensions over reminiscences no one but another old soldier wanted to hear all wore swords belted over their coats and a few carried long steeltipped lances that had hung for years on a wall until this morning every saddle had a fat blanket roll behind and bulging saddlebags plus a pot or kettle and full water bags just as if they were riding out on campaign instead of a weeks jaunt to chase down three women who set fire to a barn here was a chance to relive old days or pretend to he wondered if that was what was rousting him out he was certainly too old to go riding off after a set of pretty eyes on a woman young enough to be his daughter maybe his granddaughter i am not that big a fool he told himself firmly caralin could manage things better with him not getting in the way a lanky bay gelding came galloping up the oak lane that led down to the road and the rider threw himself out of the saddle before the animal came to a full stop the man halfstumbled but still managed to put fist to heart in a proper salute barim halle who served under him as a senior squadman years ago was hard and wiry with a leather egg for a head and white eyebrows that seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of other hair you been recalled to caemlyn my captaingeneral he panted no bryne said too sharply what do you mean riding in here as though you had cairhienin cavalry on your tail some of the other horses were frisking catching the bays mood never rode that hard unless we was chasing them my lord barims grin faded when the man saw he was not laughing well my lord i seen the horses and i reckoned the man took another look at his face and cut off that line well actually i got some news too i been over to new braem to see my sister and i heard plenty new braem was older than andor old braem had been destroyed in the trolloc wars a thousand years before artur hawkwing and it was a good place for news a middlingsized border town well to the east of his estates on the road from caemlyn to tar valon even with morgases current attitude the merchants would keep that road busy well out with it man if theres news what is it uh just trying to figure where to start my lord barim straightened unconsciously as though making a report most important i reckon they say tear has fallen aielmen took the stone itself and the sword that cannot be touched has flat been touched somebody drew it they say an aielman drew it bryne said incredulously an aiel would die before he touched a sword he had seen it happen in the aiel war though it was said callandor was not really a sword at all whatever that meant they didnt say my lord i heard names ren somebody or other most often but they was talking it like fact not rumor like everybody knew brynes forehead creased in a frown worse than troubling if true if callandor had been drawn then the dragon was reborn according to the prophecies that meant the last battle was coming the dark one breaking free the dragon reborn would save the world so the prophecies said and destroy it this was news enough by itself to have set halle galloping if he had thought twice but the leathery fellow was not finished word come down from tar valon is near as big my lord they say theres a new amyrlin seat elaida my lord who was the queens advisor blinking suddenly halle hurried on morgase was forbidden ground and every man on the estate knew it though bryne had never said so they say the old amyrlin siuan sanche was stilled and executed and logain died too that false dragon they caught and gentled last year they talked it like it was true my lord some of them claimed they was in tar valon when it all happened logain was no great news even if he had started a war in ghealdan by claiming to be the dragon reborn there had been several false dragons the last few years he could channel though that was a fact until the aes sedai gentled him well he was not the first man to be caught and gentled cut off from the power so he could never channel again they said men like that whether false dragons or just poor fools the red ajah took against never lived long it was said they gave up wanting to live siuan sanche though that was news he had met her once nearly three years ago a woman who demanded obedience and gave no reasons tough as an old boot with a tongue like a file and a temper like that of a bear with a sore tooth he would have expected her to tear any upstart claimant limb from limb with her bare hands stilling was the same as gentling for a man but more rare by far especially for an amyrlin seat only two amyrlins in three thousand years had suffered that fate so far as the tower admitted though it was possible they could have hidden two dozen more the tower was very good at hiding what they wanted hidden but an execution on top of stilling seemed unnecessary it was said women survived stilling no better than men did gentling it all stank of trouble everyone knew the tower had secret alliances strings tied to thrones and powerful lords and ladies with a new amyrlin raised in this fashion some would surely try to test whether the aes sedai still watched as closely and once this fellow in tear quelled any opposition not that there was likely to be much if he really did have the stone he would move against illian or cairhien the question was how quickly could he move would forces be gathered against him or for him he had to be the true dragon reborn but the houses would go both ways and the people too and if petty squabbles broke out because the tower old fool he muttered seeing barim give a start he added not you another old fool none of this was his affair any longer except to decide which way house bryne went when the time came not that anyone would care except to know whether or not to attack him bryne had never been a powerful house or large uh my lord barim glanced at the men waiting with their horses do you think you might need me my lord without even asking where or why he was not the only one bored with country life catch up to us when you have your gear together well be heading south on the four kings road to start barim saluted and dashed away dragging his horse behind him climbing into his saddle bryne swung his arm forward without a word and the men fell into a column of twos behind him as they headed down the oak lane he meant to have answers if he had to take this mara by the scruff of the neck and shake her he would have answers the high lady alteima relaxed as the gates of the royal palace of andor swung open and her carriage rolled in she had not been certain they would open it had surely taken long enough to get a note taken in and longer still to have a reply her maid a thin girl acquired here in caemlyn goggled and all but bounced on the seat across from her at the excitement of actually entering the palace snapping open her lace fan alteima tried to cool herself it was still well short of midday the heat would grow worse yet to think she had always thought of andor as cool hastily she reviewed what she meant to say one last time she was a pretty woman she knew exactly how pretty with large brown eyes that made some mistakenly think her innocent even harmless she knew she was neither but it suited her very well to have others believe her so especially here today this carriage had taken almost the last of the gold she had managed to carry away when she fled tear if she was to reestablish herself she needed powerful friends and there was none more powerful in andor than the woman she had come to see the carriage halted near a fountain in a columnringed courtyard and a servant in redandwhite livery rushed to open the door alteima barely glanced at the courtyard or the serving man her mind was all on the meeting ahead black hair spilled to the middle of her back from beneath a closefitting cap of seed pearls and more pearls lined the tiny pleats of her highnecked gown of watery green silk she had met morgase once briefly five years ago during a state visit a woman who radiated power as reserved and stately as one should expect of a queen and also proper in the andoran way which meant prim the rumors in the city that she had a lover a man not much liked it seemed did not fit that very well of course but from what alteima remembered the formality of the gown and the high neck should please morgase as soon as alteimas slippers were firmly on the paving stones the maid cara leaped down and began fussing over the fall of the pleats until alteima snapped her fan shut and slapped the girls wrist with it a courtyard was no place for that cara such a foolish name flinched back clutching her wrist with a wounded look and the beginnings of tears alteima compressed her lips in irritation the girl did not even know how to take mild reproof she had been fooling herself the girl would not do she was too obviously untrained but a lady had to have a maid especially if she was to differentiate herself from the mass of refugees in andor she had seen men and women laboring in the sun even begging in the streets while wearing the remnants of cairhienin nobles garb she thought she had recognized one or two perhaps she should take one of them in service who could know the duties of a ladys maid better than a lady and if they were reduced to working with their hands they should leap at the chance it might be amusing to have a former friend for a maid too late for today though and an untrained maid a local girl said a little too clearly that alteima was at the edge of her resources only one step removed from those beggars herself she put on a look of concerned gentleness did i hurt you cara she said sweetly remain here in the carriage and soothe your wrist i am certain someone will bring you cool water to drink the mindless gratitude on the girls face was stupefying the liveried men well trained stood looking at nothing at all still word of alteimas kindness would spread if she knew anything about servants a tall young man appeared before her in the whitecollared red coat and burnished breastplate of the queens guard bowing with a hand to his sword hilt i am guardsmanlieutenant tallanvor high lady if you will come with me i will escort you to queen morgase he offered an arm which she took but otherwise she was scarcely aware of him she had no interest in soldiers unless generals and lords as he attended her down broad corridors seemingly full of scurrying men and women in livery they took care not to impede her way of course she subtly examined the fine wall hangings the ivoryinlaid chests and highchests the bowls and vases of chased gold or silver or thin sea folk porcelain the royal palace did not display as much wealth as the stone of tear but andor was still a wealthy land perhaps even as wealthy as tear an older lord would do nicely malleable for a woman still young perhaps a touch feeble and infirm with vast estates that would be a beginning while she found out exactly where the strings of power lay in andor a few words exchanged with morgase some years ago were not much of an introduction but she had that which a powerful queen must want and need information finally tallanvor ushered her into a large sitting room with a high ceiling painted in birds and clouds and open sky where ornately carved and gilded chairs stood before a polished white marble fireplace a part of alteimas mind noted with amusement that the wide redandgold carpet was tairen work the young man went to one knee my queen he said in a suddenly rough voice as you have commanded i bring you the high lady alteima of tear morgase waved him away you are welcome alteima it is good to see you again sit and we will talk alteima managed a curtsy and murmured thanks before taking a chair envy curdled inside her she had remembered morgase as a beautiful woman but the goldenhaired reality told her how pale that memory had grown morgase was a rose in full bloom ready to overshadow every other flower alteima did not blame the young soldier for stumbling on his way out she was just glad he was gone so she would not have to be aware of him looking at the two of them comparing yet there were changes too vast changes morgase by the grace of the light queen of andor defender of the realm protector of the people high seat of house trakand so very reserved and stately and proper wore a gown of shimmering white silk that showed enough bosom to shock a tavern maid in the maule it clung to hip and thigh close enough to suit a taraboner jade the rumors were clearly true morgase had a lover and for her to have altered so much it was equally clear that she tried to please this gaebril not make him please her morgase still radiated power and a presence that filled the room but that dress transformed both to something less alteima was doubly glad she had worn a high neck a woman that deep in a mans thrall could lash out in a jealous rage on the smallest provocation or none at all if she met gaebril she would present him as near indifference as civility would allow even being suspected of thinking of poaching morgases lover could get her a hangmans noose instead of a rich husband on his last legs she herself would have done the same a woman in redandwhite livery brought wine an excellent murandian and poured it into crystal goblets deeply engraved with the rearing lion of andor as morgase took a goblet alteima noticed her ring a golden serpent eating its own tail the great serpent ring was worn by some women who had trained in the white tower as morgase had without becoming aes sedai as well as by aes sedai themselves it was a thousandyear tradition for the queens of andor to be tower trained but rumors were on every lip of a break between morgase and tar valon and the antiaes sedai sentiment in the streets could have been quashed quickly had morgase wanted to why was she still wearing the ring alteima would be careful of her words until she knew the answer the liveried woman withdrew to the far end of the room out of earshot but close enough to see when the wine needed replenishing taking a sip morgase said it is long since we met is your husband well is he in caemlyn with you hastily alteima shuffled her plans she had not thought morgase knew she had a husband but she had always been able to think on the run tedosian was well when i last saw him the light send he died soon as well to get on with it he was of some question about serving this rand althor and that is a dangerous chasm to straddle why lords have been hung as if they were common criminals rand althor morgase mused softly i met him once he did not look like one who would name himself the dragon reborn a frightened shepherd boy trying not to show it yet thinking back he seemed to be looking for some escape her blue eyes looked inward elaida warned me of him she seemed unaware of having spoken those last words elaida was your advisor then alteima said cautiously she knew it was so and it made the rumors of a break all the more difficult to believe she had to know if it was true you have replaced her now that she is amyrlin morgases eyes snapped back into focus i have not the next instant her voice softened again my daughter elayne is training in the tower she has already been raised to the accepted alteima fluttered her fan hoping sweat was not breaking out on her forehead if morgase did not know her own feelings toward the tower there was no way to speak safely her plans teetered on the edge of a precipice then morgase rescued them and her you say your husband was of two minds about rand althor and you she nearly sighed with relief morgase might be behaving like an untutored farmgirl over this gaebril but she still had her sense when it came to power and possible dangers to her realm i observed him closely of course in the stone that should plant the seed if it needed planting he can channel and a man who can channel is always to be feared yet he is the dragon reborn there is no doubt the stone fell and callandor was in his hand when it did the prophecies i fear i must leave decisions of what to do about the dragon reborn to those who are wiser than i i only know that i am afraid to remain where he rules even a high lady of tear cannot match the courage of the queen of andor the goldenhaired woman gave her a shrewd look that made her afraid she had overdone the flattery some did not like it too open but morgase merely leaned back in her chair and sipped her wine tell me about him this man who is supposed to save us and destroy us doing it success or at least the beginnings of it he is a dangerous man beyond any question of the power a lion seems lazy halfasleep until suddenly he charges then he is all speed and power rand althor seems innocent not lazy and naive not asleep but when he charges he has no proper respect for person or position at all i did not exaggerate when i said he has hanged lords he is a breeder of anarchy in tear under his new laws even a high lord or lady can be called before a magistrate to be fined or worse on the charges of the meanest peasant or fisherman he she kept strictly to the truth as she saw it she could tell the truth as quickly as a lie when it was necessary morgase sipped her wine and listened alteima might have thought her lounging indolently except that her eyes showed she was taking in every word and storing it you must understand alteima finished that i have only touched the surface rand althor and what he has done in tear are subjects for hours you will have them morgase said and in her mind alteima smiled success is it true the queen went on that he brought aiel with him to the stone oh yes great savages with their faces hidden half the time and even the women ready to kill as soon as look they followed him like dogs terrorizing everyone and took whatever they wanted from the stone i had thought it must be the wildest rumor morgase reflected there have been rumors this past year but they have not come out of the waste in twenty years not since the aiel war the world certainly does not need this rand althor bringing the aiel down on us again her look sharpened again you said followed they have gone alteima nodded just before i left tear and he went with them with them morgase exclaimed i feared he was in cairhien right this you have a guest morgase i should have been told so i could greet her a big man strode into the room tall his goldembroidered red silk coat fitting massive shoulders and a deep chest alteima did not need to see the radiant look on morgases face to name him as lord gaebril the assurance with which he had interrupted the queen did that he lifted a finger and the serving woman curtsied and left quickly he did not ask morgases permission to dismiss her servants from her presence either he was darkly handsome incredibly so with wings of white at his temples composing her face to commonplace alteima put on a marginally welcoming smile suitable for an elderly uncle with neither power wealth nor influence he might be gorgeous but even if he did not belong to morgase he was not a man she would try manipulating unless she absolutely had to there was perhaps even more of an air of power about him than about morgase gaebril stopped by morgase and put his hand on her bare shoulder in a very familiar way she clearly came close to resting her cheek on the back of his hand but his eyes were on alteima she was used to men looking at her but these eyes made her shift uneasily they were far too penetrating saw far too much you come from tear the sound of his deep voice sent a tingle through her her skin even her bones felt as though she had been dipped in icy water but oddly her momentary anxiety melted it was morgase who answered alteima could not seem to find her tongue with him watching her this is the high lady alteima gaebril she has been telling me all about the dragon reborn she was in the stone of tear when it fell gaebril there really were aiel the pressure of his hand cut her off irritation flashed across her face but then it was gone replaced by a smile beaming up at him his eyes still on alteima sent that shiver through her again and this time she gasped aloud so much talking must have fatigued you morgase he said without shifting his gaze you do too much go to your bedchamber and sleep go now i will wake you when you have rested enough morgase stood immediately still smiling at him devotedly her eyes seemed slightly glazed yes i am tired i will take a nap now gaebril she glided from the room with never a glance at alteima but alteimas attention was all on gaebril her heart beat faster her breath quickened he was surely the handsomest man she had ever seen the grandest the strongest the most powerful superlatives rolled through her mind like a flood gaebril paid no more attention to morgases leaving than she did taking the chair the queen had vacated he leaned back with his boots stretched out in front of him tell me why you came to caemlyn alteima again the chill ran through her the absolute truth but keep it brief you can give me details later if i want them she did not hesitate i tried to poison my husband and had to flee before tedosian and that trull estanda could kill me instead or worse rand althor meant to let them do it as an example telling made her cringe not because it was a truth she had kept hidden so much as because she found she wanted to please him more than anything else in the world and she feared that he might send her away but he wanted the truth i chose caemlyn because i could not bear illian and though andor is little better cairhien is in near ruins in caemlyn i can find a wealthy husband or one who thinks he is my protector if need be and use his power to he stopped her with a wave of his hand chuckling a vicious little cat though pretty perhaps pretty enough to keep with your teeth and claws drawn suddenly his face became more intent tell me what you know of rand althor and especially his friends if he has any his companions his allies she told him talking until her mouth and throat went dry and her voice cracked and rasped she never raised her goblet until he told her to drink then she gulped the wine down and spoke on she could please him she could please him better than morgase could think of the maids working in morgases bedchamber dropped hasty curtsies surprised to see her there in the middle of the morning waving them out of the room she climbed onto her bed still in her dress for a time she lay staring at the gilded carvings of the bedposts no lions of andor here but roses for the rose crown of andor but roses suited her better than lions stop being stubborn she chided herself then wondered why she had told gaebril she was tired and or had he told her impossible she was the queen of andor and no man told her to do anything gareth now why had she thought of gareth bryne he had certainly never told her to do anything the captaingeneral of the queens guards obeyed the queen not the other way around but he had been stubborn entirely capable of digging in his heels until she came around to his way why am i thinking of him i wish he were here that was ridiculous she had sent him away for opposing her about what no longer seemed quite clear but that was not important he had opposed her she could remember the feelings she had had for him only dimly as though he had been gone for years surely it had not been so long stop being stubborn her eyes closed and she fell immediately into sleep a sleep troubled by restless dreams of running from something she could not see chapter dragon rhuidean high in the city of rhuidean rand althor looked out from a tall window whatever glass might have once been in it was long since gone the shadows below slanted sharply east a bardharp played softly in the room behind him sweat evaporated from his face almost as soon as it appeared his red silk coat damp between the shoulders hung open in a fruitless bid for air and his shirt was unlaced half down his chest night in the aiel waste would bring freezing cold but during daylight even a breeze was never cool with his hands above his head on the smooth stone window frame his coatsleeves fell down to reveal the front part of the figure wrapped around each forearm a goldenmaned serpentine creature with eyes like the sun scaled in scarlet and gold each foot tipped with five golden claws part of his skin they were not tattoos they glittered like precious metals and polished gems seemed almost alive in the lateafternoon sunlight those marked him to the people on this side of the mountain range variously called the dragonwall or the spine of the world as he who comes with the dawn and like the herons branded into his palms they marked him for those beyond the dragonwall too according to the prophecies as the dragon reborn in both cases prophesied to unite save and destroy they were names he would have avoided if he could but that time was long past if it had ever existed and he no longer thought of it or if he did on rare occasion it was with the faint regret of a man recalling a foolish dream of his boyhood as if he were not close enough to boyhood to remember every minute instead he tried to think only of what he had to do fate and duty held him on the path like a riders reins but he had often been called stubborn the end of the road must be reached but if it could be attained by a different way maybe it need not be the end small chance no chance almost certainly the prophecies demanded his blood rhuidean stretched below him seared by a sun still pitiless as it sank toward craggy mountains bleak with barely a sign of vegetation this rugged broken land where men had killed or died over a pool of water they could step across was the last place on earth anyone would think to find a great city its longago builders had never finished their work impossibly tall buildings dotted the city stepped and slabsided palaces that sometimes ended after eight or even ten stories not with a roof but with the ragged masonry of another halfbuilt floor the towers soared higher yet but stopped in jagged abruptness as often as not now a good quarter of the great structures with their massive columns and immense windows of colored glass lay strewn as rubble across wide avenues with broad strips of bare dirt down their centers dirt that had never held the trees they were planned for the marvelous fountains stood dry as they had for hundreds upon hundreds of years all that futile labor the builders finally dying with their work undone yet at times rand thought that maybe the city had only been begun so he could find it too proud he thought a man would have to be halfmad at least to be so proud he could not help chuckling dryly there had been aes sedai with the men and women who had come here so long ago and they had known the karaethon cycle the prophecies of the dragon or perhaps they had written the prophecies too proud by tenfold directly below him lay a vast plaza halfcovered in stretching shadow littered with a jumble of statues and crystal chairs oddities and peculiar shapes of metal or glass or stone things he could put no name to scattered about in tangled heaps as if deposited by a storm even the shadows were cool only by comparison roughclothed men not aiel sweated to load wagons with items chosen by a short slender woman in pristine blue silk straightbacked and gliding from place to place as though the heat did not press down on her as hard as on the others still she wore a damp white cloth tied around her temples she just did not let herself show the effects of the sun rand would have wagered she did not even perspire the workmens leader was a dark bulky man named hadnan kadere a supposed merchant dressed all in creamcolored silk that was sweatsodden today he mopped his face continually with a large handkerchief shouting curses at the men his wagon drivers and guards but he leaped as quickly as they to haul at whatever the slim woman pointed out big or small aes sedai had no need of size to impose their will but rand thought moiraine would have done as well if she had never been near the white tower two of the men were trying to move what appeared to be an oddly twisted redstone doorframe the corners did not meet properly and the eye did not want to follow the straight pieces it stayed upright turning freely but refusing to tip over however they manhandled it then one slipped and fell through the doorway up to his waist rand tensed for a moment the fellow seemed not to exist above the waist his legs kicked wildly in panic until lan a tall man in drab shades of green strode over and hauled him out again by his belt lan was moiraines warder bonded to her in some way rand did not understand and a hard man who moved like the aiel like a hunting wolf the sword at his hip did not seem part of him it was part of him he dropped the workman on the paving stones on the seat of his breeches and left him there the fellows terrified cries rose thinly to rand and his companion looked ready to run several of kaderes men who had been close enough to see were looking at one another and at the mountains around the city plainly assessing their chances moiraine appeared among them so quickly it seemed by the power moving smoothly from man to man her manner made rand almost hear the cool imperious instructions coming from her lips so full of certainty that they would be obeyed that not obeying would seem foolish in short order she overrode resistance stamped firmly on objections chivvied them every one back to work the pair with the doorframe were soon dragging and shoving as hard as ever if with frequent looks at moiraine when they thought she would not see in her own way she was even harder than lan as far as rand knew all of those things down there were angreal or saangreal or terangreal made before the breaking of the world to magnify the one power or use it in various ways made with the power certainly though not even aes sedai knew how to construct such things now he more than suspected the use of the twisted doorframe a doorway to another world but for the rest he had no idea no one did that was why moiraine worked so hard to have as many as she could carted to the tower for study it was possible that even the tower did not contain as many objects of the power as lay about this square though supposedly the tower held the largest collection in the world even there the tower only knew the uses of some what was in the wagons or tossed about on the pavement did not interest rand he had already taken what he needed from down there had already taken more than he wanted in some ways in the center of the plaza near the burned remains of a great tree a hundred feet high stood a small forest of tall glass columns each nearly as tall as the tree and so slender it seemed the first stormwind must bring them all crashing down even with an edge of shadow touching them the columns caught and refracted the sunlight in glitters and sparkles for countless years aiel men had entered that array and returned marked as rand was but on only one arm marked as clan chiefs they came out marked or did not come out aiel women had come to this city as well on the path toward becoming wise ones no one else not and live a man may go to rhuidean once a woman twice more means death that was what the wise ones had said and it had been truth then now anyone could enter rhuidean hundreds of aiel walked the streets and increasing numbers actually dwelled in the buildings each day more of the dirt strips down the streets showed beans or squash or zemai arduously watered from clay pots hauled from the huge new lake that filled the south end of the valley the only such body of water in the entire land thousands made their camps in the surrounding mountains even on chaendaer itself where before they had come only with ceremony to send a single man or woman at a time into rhuidean wherever he went rand brought change and destruction this time he hoped against hope that the change was for the good it might yet be so the burned tree mocked him avendesora the legendary tree of life the stories never said where it was and it had been a surprise to find it here moiraine said it still lived that it would put out shoots again but so far he saw only blackened bark and bare branches with a sigh he turned from the window into a big room though not the biggest in rhuidean with tall windows on two sides its domed ceiling worked in a fanciful mosaic of winged people and animals most of the furniture left in the city had long since rotted away even in the dryness and much of the little that remained was riddled with beetles and worms but on the far side of the room stood one highbacked chair solid and its gilding largely intact but mismatched with its table a wide thing with legs and edges thickly carved in flowers someone had polished the wood with beeswax till it shone dully despite its age the aiel had found them for him though they shook their heads at such things there were few trees in the waste that could have produced wood straight and long enough to make that chair and none to make the table that was all the furniture as he thought of it a fine silk illianer carpet in blue and gold booty in some longago battle covered the middle of the dark red floor tiles cushions lay scattered about in bright silks and tasseled those were what aiel used instead of chairs when they did not merely sit on their heels as comfortable as he would be in a padded chair six men reclined against cushions on the carpet six clan chiefs representing the clans that had so far come to follow rand or rather to follow he who comes with the dawn not always eagerly he thought rhuarc a broadshouldered blueeyed man with heavy streaks of gray in his dark red hair might have some friendship for him but not the rest only six of the twelve ignoring the chair rand sat down crosslegged facing the aiel outside of rhuidean the only chairs in the waste were chiefs chairs used only by the chief and only for three reasons to be acclaimed as clan chief to accept the submission of an enemy with honor or to pass judgment taking the chair with these men now would imply that he meant to do one of those they wore the cadinsor coats and breeches in shades of brown and gray that would fade into the ground and soft boots that laced to the knee even here meeting with the man they had proclaimed the caracarn the chief of chiefs each had a heavybladed knife at his belt and the graybrown shoufa draped like a wide scarf around his neck if any man covered his face with the black veil that was part of the shoufa he would be ready to kill it was not beyond possibility these men had fought one another in a neverending cycle of clan raids and battles and feuds they watched him waited for him but an aiels waiting always spoke of a readiness to move suddenly and violently bael the tallest man rand had ever seen and jheran bladeslender and whipquick lay as far from one another as they could manage and still be on the carpet there was blood feud between baels goshien and jherans shaarad suppressed for he who comes with the dawn but not forgotten and perhaps the peace of rhuidean still held despite all that had happened still the tranquil sounds of the harp made a sharp contrast with the hard refusal of bael and jheran to look at one another six sets of eyes blue or green or gray in sundark faces aiel could make hawks look tame what must i do to bring the reyn to me he said you were sure they would come rhuarc the chief of the taardad looked at him calmly his face could have been carved stone for all its expression wait only that dhearic will bring them eventually whitehaired han lying next to rhuarc twisted his mouth as if about to spit his leathery face wore a sour look as usual dhearic has seen too many men and maidens sit staring for days then throw down their spears throw them down and run away bael added quietly i have seen them myself among the goshien even from my own sept running and you han among the tomanelle we all have i do not think they know where they are running to only what they are running from cowardly snakes jheran barked gray streaked his light brown hair there were no young men among aiel clan chiefs stinkadders wriggling away from their own shadows a slight shift of his blue eyes toward the far side of the carpet made it clear he meant it for a description of the goshien not just those who had thrown down their spears bael made as if to rise his face hardening further if that was possible but the man next to him put a quieting hand on his arm bruan of the nakai was big enough and strong enough for two blacksmiths but he had a placid nature that seemed odd for an aiel all of us have seen men and maidens run he sounded almost lazy and his gray eyes looked so yet rand knew otherwise even rhuarc considered bruan a deadly fighter and a devious tactician luckily not even rhuarc was stronger for rand than bruan but he had come to follow he who comes with the dawn he did not know rand althor as you have jheran you know how hard it was to face what they face if you cannot name coward those who died because they could not face it can you name coward those who run for the same reason they should never have learned han muttered kneading his redtasseled blue cushion like an enemys throat it was for those who could enter rhuidean and live he spoke the words to no one in particular but they had to be for rands ears it was rand who had revealed to everyone what a man learned amid the glass columns in the plaza revealed enough that the chiefs and wise ones could not turn aside when asked the rest if there was an aiel in the waste who did not know the truth now he had not spoken to anyone in a month far from the glorious heritage of battle most believed in the aiel had begun as helpless refugees from the breaking of the world everyone who survived had been refugees then of course but the aiel had never seen themselves as helpless worse they had been followers of the way of the leaf refusing to do violence even in defense of their lives aiel meant dedicated in the old tongue and it had been to peace that they were dedicated those who called themselves aiel today were the descendants of those who had broken a pledge of untold generations only one remnant of that belief remained an aiel would die before taking up a sword they had always believed it a part of their pride of their separateness from those who lived outside the waste he had heard aiel say that they had committed some sin to be placed in the desolate waste now they knew what it was the men and women who had built rhuidean and died here those called the jenn aiel the clan that was not on the few occasions they were spoken of had been the ones who kept faith with the aes sedai of the time before the breaking it was hard to face the knowledge that what you had always believed was a lie it had to be told rand said they had a right to know a man shouldnt have to live a lie their own prophecy said i would break them and i couldnt have done differently the past was past and done he should be worrying about the future some of these men dislike me and some hate me for not being born among them but they follow i need them all what of the miagoma erim lying between rhuarc and han shook his head his once bright red hair was half white but his green eyes were as strong as any younger mans his big hands wide and long and hard said his arms were as strong too timolan does not let his feet know which way he will jump until after he has leaped when timolan was young as a chief jheran said he tried to unite the clans and failed it will not sit well with him that at last one has come to succeed where he failed he will come rhuarc said timolan never believed himself he who comes with the dawn and janwin will bring the shiande but they will wait they must settle matters in their own minds first they must settle he who comes with the dawn being a wetlander han barked i mean no offense caracarn there was no obsequiousness in his voice a chief was not a king and neither was the chief of chiefs at best he was first among equals the daryne and the codarra will come eventually as well i think bruan said calmly and quickly lest silence should grow to a reason for dancing the spears first among equals at best they have lost more than any other clans to the bleakness that was what the aiel had taken to calling the long period of staring before someone tried to run away from being aiel for the moment mandelain and indirian are concerned with holding their clans together and both will want to see the dragons on your arms for themselves but they will come that left only one clan to be discussed the one none of the chiefs wanted to mention what news of couladin and the shaido rand asked silence answered him broken only by the softly serene sounds of the harp in the background each man waiting for another to speak all coming as close as aiel could to showing discomfort jheran frowned at his thumbnail and bruan toyed with one of the silvery tassels on his green cushion even rhuarc studied the carpet graceful whiterobed men and women moved into the hush pouring worked silver goblets of wine to set beside each man bringing small silver plates with olives rare in the waste and white ewesmilk cheese and the pale wrinkled nuts the aiel called pecara the aiel faces looking out of those pale cowls had downcast eyes and an unfamiliar meekness on their features whether captured in battle or on a raid the gaishain were sworn to serve obediently for one year and a day touching no weapon doing no violence at the end returning to their own clan and sept as if nothing had happened a strange echo of the way of the leaf jietoh honor and obligation required it and breaking jietoh was nearly the worst thing an aiel could do perhaps the worst it was possible that some of these men and women were serving their own clan chief but neither would acknowledge it by the blink of an eye so long as the period of gaishain held not even for a son or daughter it struck rand suddenly that this was the real reason that some aiel took what he had revealed so hard to those it must seem that their ancestors had sworn gaishain not only for themselves but for all succeeding generations and those generations all down to the present day had broken jietoh by taking up the spear had the men in front of him ever worried along those lines jietoh was very serious business to an aiel the gaishain departed on soft slippered feet barely making a sound none of the clan chiefs touched their wine or the food is there any hope that couladin will meet with me rand knew there was not he had stopped sending requests for a meeting once he learned couladin was having the messengers skinned alive but it was a way to start the others talking han snorted the only word we have had from him is that he means to flay you when next he sees you does that sound as if he will talk can i break the shaido away from him they follow him rhuarc said he is not a chief at all but they believe he is couladin had never entered those glass columns he might even still believe as he claimed that everything rand had said was a lie he says that he is the caracarn and they believe that as well the shaido maidens who came came for their society and that because far dareis mai carried your honor none else will we send scouts to watch them bruan said and the shaido kill them when they can couladin builds the makings of half a dozen feuds but so far he shows no signs of attacking us here i have heard that he claims we have defiled rhuidean and that attacking us here would only deepen the desecration erim grunted and shifted on his cushion he means there are enough spears here to kill every shaido twice over and to spare he popped a piece of white cheese into his mouth growling around it the shaido were ever cowards and thieves honorless dogs bael and jheran said together then stared at one another as though each thought the other had tricked him into something honorless or not bruan said quietly couladins numbers are growing calm as he sounded he still took a deep drink from his goblet before going on you all know what i am speaking of some of those who run after the bleakness do not throw away their spears instead they join with their societies among the shaido no tomanelle has ever broken clan han barked bruan looked past rhuarc and erim at the tomanelle chief and said deliberately it has happened in every clan without waiting for another challenge to his word he settled back on his cushion it cannot be called breaking clan they join their societies like the shaido maidens who have come to their roof herethere were a few mutters but no one disputed him this time the rules governing aiel warrior societies were complex and in some ways their members felt as closely bound to society as to clan for instance members of the same society would not fight each other even if their clans were in blood feud some men would not marry a woman too closely related to a member of their own society just as if that made her their own close blood kin the ways of far dareis mai the maidens of the spear rand did not even want to think about i need to know what couladin intends he told them couladin was a bull with a bee in his ear he might charge in any direction rand hesitated would it violate honor to send people to join their societies among the shaido he did not need to describe what he meant any further to a man they stiffened where they lay even rhuarc eyes cold enough to banish the heat from the room to spy in that manner erim twisted his mouth around spy as if the word tasted foul would be like spying on your own sept no one of honor would do such a thing rand refrained from asking whether they might find someone with a slightly less prickly honor the aiel sense of humor was a strange thing often cruel but about some matters they had none at all to change the subject he asked is there any word from across the dragonwall he knew the answer that sort of news spread quickly even among as many aiel as were gathered around rhuidean none worth the telling rhuarc replied with the troubles among the treekillers few peddlers come into the threefold land that was the aiel name for the waste a punishment for their sin a testing ground for their courage an anvil to shape them treekillers was what they called cairhienin the dragon banner still flies over the stone of tear tairens have moved north into cairhien as you ordered to distribute food among the treekillers nothing more you should have let the treekillers starve bael muttered and jheran closed his mouth with a snap rand suspected he had been about to say much the same treekillers are fit for nothing except to be killed or sold as animals in shara erim said grimly those were two of the things aiel did to those who came into the waste uninvited only gleemen peddlers and tinkers had safe passage though aiel avoided the tinkers as if they carried fever shara was the name of the lands beyond the waste not even the aiel knew much about them from the corner of his eye rand saw two women standing expectantly just inside the tall arched doorway someone had hung strings of colored beads there red and blue to replace the missing doors one of the women was moiraine for a moment he considered making them wait moiraine had that irritatingly commanding look on her face clearly expecting them to break off everything for her only there was really nothing left to discuss and he could tell from the mens eyes that they did not want to make conversation not so soon after speaking of the bleakness and the shaido sighing he stood and the clan chiefs imitated him all except han were as tall as he or taller where rand had grown up han would have been considered of average height or better among aiel he was accounted short you know what must be done bring in the rest of the clans and keep an eye on the shaido he paused a moment then added it will end well as well for the aiel as i can manage the prophecy said you would break us han said sourly and you have made a good beginning but we will follow you till shade is gone he recited till water is gone into the shadow with teeth bared screaming defiance with the last breath to spit in sightblinders eye on the last day sightblinder was one of the aiel names for the dark one there was nothing for rand except to make the proper response once he had not known it by my honor and the light my life will be a dagger for sightblinders heart until the last day the aiel finished to shayol ghul itself the harper played on pacifically the chiefs filed out past the two women eyeing moiraine respectfully there was nothing of fear in them rand wished he could be as sure of himself moiraine had too many plans for him too many ways of pulling strings he did not know she had tied to him the two women came in as soon as the chiefs were gone moiraine as cool and elegant as ever a small pretty woman with or without those aes sedai features he could never put an age to she had abandoned the damp cooling cloth for her temples in its place a small blue stone hung suspended on her forehead from a fine golden chain in her dark hair it would not have mattered if she had kept it nothing could diminish her queenly carriage she usually seemed to own a foot more height than she actually had and her eyes were all confidence and command the other woman was taller though still short of his shoulder and young not ageless egwene whom he had grown up with now except for her big dark eyes she could almost have passed as an aiel woman and not only for her tanned face and hands she wore a full aiel skirt of brown wool and a loose white blouse of a plant fiber called algode algode was softer than even the finestwoven wool it would do very well for trade if he ever convinced the aiel a gray shawl hung around egwenes shoulders and a folded gray scarf made a wide band to hold back the dark hair that fell below her shoulders unlike most aiel women she wore only one bracelet ivory carved into a circle of flames and a single necklace of gold and ivory beads and one more thing a great serpent ring on her left hand egwene had been studying with some of the aiel wise ones exactly what rand did not know though he more than suspected something to do with dreams egwene and the aiel women were closemouthed but she had studied in the white tower too she was one of the accepted on the way to becoming aes sedai and passing herself off here and in tear at least as full aes sedai already sometimes he teased her about that she did not take his japes very well though the wagons will be ready to leave for tar valon soon moiraine said her voice was musical crystalline send a strong guard rand said or kadere may not take them where you want he turned for the windows again wanting to look out and think about kadere youve not needed me to hold your hand or give you permission before abruptly something seemed to strike him across the shoulders for all the world like a thick hickory stick only the slight feel of goose bumps on his skin not likely in this heat told him that one of the women had channeled spinning back to face them he reached out to saidin filled himself with the one power the power felt like life itself swelling inside him as if he were ten times a hundred times as alive the dark ones taint filled him too death and corruption like maggots crawling in his mouth it was a torrent that threatened to sweep him away a raging flood he had to fight every moment he was almost used to it now and at the same time he would never be used to it he wanted to hold on to the sweetness of saidin forever and he wanted to vomit and all the while the deluge tried to scour him to the bone and burn his bones to ash the taint would drive him mad eventually if the power did not kill him first it was a race between the two madness had been the fate of every man who had channeled since the breaking of the world began since that day when lews therin telamon the dragon and his hundred companions had sealed up the dark ones prison at shayol ghul the last backblast from that sealing had tainted the male half of the true source and men who could channel madmen who could channel had torn the world apart he filled himself with the power and he could not tell which woman had done it they both looked at him as if butter would not melt in their mouths each with an eyebrow arched almost identically in slightly amused questioning either or both could be embracing the female half of the source right that instant and he would never know of course a stick across the shoulders was not moiraines way she found other means of chastising more subtle usually more painful in the end yet even sure that it must have been egwene he did nothing proof thought slid along the outside of the void he floated within in emptiness thought and emotion even his anger distant i will do nothing without proof i will not be goaded this time she was not the egwene he had grown up with she had become part of the tower since moiraine sent her there moiraine again always moiraine sometimes he wished he were rid of moiraine only sometimes he concentrated on her what do you want of me his voice sounded flat and cold to his own ears the power stormed inside him egwene had told him that for a woman touching saidar the female half of the source was an embrace for a man always it was a war without mercy and dont mention wagons again little sister i usually find out what you mean to do long after it is done the aes sedai frowned at him and no wonder she was surely not used to being addressed so not by any man even the dragon reborn he had no idea himself where little sister had come from sometimes of late words seemed to pop into his head a touch of madness perhaps some nights he lay awake till the small hours worrying about that inside the void it seemed someone elses worry we should speak alone she gave the harper a cool glance jasin natael as he called himself here lay halfsprawled on cushions against one of the windowless walls softly playing the harp perched on his knee its upper arm carved and gilded to resemble the creatures on rands forearms dragons the aiel called them rand had only suspicions where natael had gotten the thing he was a darkhaired man who would have been accounted taller than most elsewhere than the aiel waste in his middle years his coat and breeches were dark blue silk suitable for a royal court elaborately embroidered with threadofgold on collar and cuffs everything buttoned up or laced despite the heat the fine clothes were at odds with his gleemans cloak spread out beside him a perfectly sound cloak but covered completely with hundreds of patches in nearly as many colors all sewn so as to flutter at the slightest breeze it signified a country entertainer a juggler and tumbler musician and storyteller who wandered from village to village certainly not a man to wear silk the man had his conceits he appeared completely immersed in his music you can say what you wish in front of natael rand said he is gleeman to the dragon reborn after all if keeping the matter secret was important enough she would press it and he would send natael away though he did not like the man to be out of his sight egwene sniffed loudly and shifted her shawl on her shoulders your head is swelled up like an overripe melon rand althor she said it flatly as a statement of fact anger bubbled outside the void not at what she had said she had been in the habit of trying to take him down a rung even when they were children usually whether he deserved it or not but of late it seemed to him she had taken to working with moiraine trying to put him off balance so the aes sedai could push him where she wanted when they were younger before they learned what he was he and egwene had thought they would marry one day and now she sided with moiraine against him face hard he spoke more roughly than he intended tell me what you want moiraine tell me here and now or let it wait until i can find time for you im very busy that was an outright lie most of his time was spent practicing the sword with lan or the spears with rhuarc or learning to fight with hands and feet from both but if there was any bullying to be done here today he would do it natael could hear anything almost anything so long as rand knew where he was at all times moiraine and egwene both frowned but the real aes sedai at least seemed to see he would not be budged this time she glanced at natael her mouth tightening the man still seemed deep in his music then took a thick wad of gray silk from her pouch unfolding it she laid what it had contained on the table a disc the size of a mans hand half dead black half purest white the two colors meeting in a sinuous line to form two joined teardrops that had been the symbol of aes sedai before the breaking but this disc was more only seven like it had ever been made the seals on the dark ones prison or rather each was a focus for one of those seals drawing her belt knife its hilt wrapped in silver wire moiraine scraped delicately at the edge of the disc and a tiny flake of solid black fell away even encased in the void rand gasped the emptiness itself quivered and for an instant the power threatened to overwhelm him is this a copy a fake i found this in the square below moiraine said it is real though the one i brought with me from tear is the same she could have been saying she wanted pea soup for the midday meal egwene on the other hand clutched her shawl around her as if cold rand felt the stirrings of fright himself oozing across the surface of the void it was an effort to let go of saidin but he forced himself if he lost concentration the power could destroy him where he stood and he wanted all his attention on the matter at hand even so even with the taint it was a loss that flake lying on the table was impossible those discs were made of cuendillar heartstone and nothing made of cuendillar could be broken not even by the one power whatever force was used against it only made it stronger the making of heartstone had been lost in the breaking of the world but whatever had been made of it during the age of legends still existed even the most fragile vase even if the breaking had sunk it to the bottom of the ocean or buried it beneath a mountain of course three of the seven discs were broken already but it had taken a good deal more than a knife come to think of it though he did not know how those three really had been broken if no force short of the creator could break heartstone then that should be that how he asked surprised that his voice was still as steady as when the void had surrounded him i do not know moiraine replied just as calm outwardly but you do see the problem a fall from the table could break this if the others wherever they may be are like this four men with hammers could break open that hole in the dark ones prison again who can even say how effective one is in this condition rand saw im not ready yet he was not sure he ever would be ready but he surely was not yet egwene looked as though she were staring into her own open grave rewrapping the disc moiraine replaced it in her pouch perhaps i will think of a possibility before i carry this to tar valon if we know why perhaps something can be done about it he was caught by the image of the dark one reaching out from shayol ghul once more eventually breaking free completely fires and darkness covered the world in his mind flames that consumed and gave no light blackness solid as stone squeezing the air with that filling his head what moiraine had just said took a moment to penetrate you intend to go yourself he had thought she meant to stick to him like moss to a rock isnt this what you want eventually moiraine replied quietly eventually i will have to leave you after all what will be must be rand thought she shivered but it was so quick it could have been his imagination and the next instant she was all composure and selfcontrol once more you must be ready the reminder of his doubts came unpleasantly we should discuss your plans you cannot sit here much longer even if the forsaken are not planning to come after you they are out there spreading their power gathering the aiel will do no good if you find that everything beyond the spine of the world is in their hands chuckling rand leaned back against the table so this was just another ploy if he was anxious about her leaving perhaps he would be more willing to listen more amenable to being guided she could not lie of course not right out one of the vaunted three oaths took care of that to speak no word that was not true he had learned that it left a barnwidth of wriggle room she would leave him alone eventually after he was dead no doubt you want to discuss my plans he said dryly pulling a shortstemmed pipe and a leather tabac pouch from his coat pocket he thumbed the bowl full and briefly touched saidin to channel a flame dancing above the tabac why they are my plans puffing slowly he waited ignoring egwenes glower the aes sedais face never changed but her large dark eyes seemed to blaze what have you done when you refused to be guided by me her voice was as cool as her features yet the words still seemed to come like whipcracks wherever you have gone you have left death destruction and war behind you not in tear he said too quickly and too defensively he must not let her put him off balance determinedly he took spaced deliberate puffs at his pipe no she agreed not in tear for once you had a nation behind you a people and what did you do with it bringing justice to tear was commendable establishing order in cairhien feeding the hungry is laudable another time i would praise you for it she herself was cairhienin but it does not help you toward the day you face tarmon gaidon a singleminded woman and cold when it came to anything else even her own land but should he not be just as singleminded what would you have me do hunt down the forsaken one by one again he forced himself to draw more slowly on the pipe it was an effort do you even know where they are oh sammael is in illian you know that but the rest what if i go after sammael as you wish and find two or three or four of them or all nine you could have faced three or four perhaps all nine surviving she said icily had you not left callandor in tear the truth is you are running you do not really have a plan not a plan to ready you for the last battle you run from place to place hoping that in some way everything will come out for the best hoping because you do not know what else to do if you would take my advice at least you he cut her off gesturing sharply with his pipe with never a care for the glares the two women gave him i do have a plan if they wanted to know let them know and he would be burned if he changed a word first i mean to put an end to the wars and killing whether i started them or not if men have to kill let them kill trollocs not each other in the aiel war four clans crossed the dragonwall and had their way for better than two years they looted and burned cairhien defeated every army sent against them they could have taken tar valon had they wanted the tower couldnt have stopped them because of your three oaths not to use the power as a weapon except against shadowspawn or darkfriends or in defense of their own lives that was another of the oaths and the aiel had not threatened the tower itself anger had him in its grip now running and hoping was he four clans did that what will happen when i lead eleven across the spine of the world it would have to be eleven small hope of bringing in the shaido by the time the nations even think of uniting it will be too late theyll accept my peace or ill be buried in the can breat a discordant plunk rose from the harp and natael bent over the instrument shaking his head in a moment the soothing sounds came again a melon couldnt be swollen enough for your head egwene muttered folding her arms beneath her breasts and a stone couldnt be as stubborn moiraine is only trying to help you why wont you see that the aes sedai smoothed her silk skirts though they did not need it taking the aiel across the dragonwall might be the worst thing you could possibly do there was an edge to her voice anger or frustration at least he was getting across to her that he was no puppet by this time the amyrlin seat will be approaching the rulers of every nation that still has a ruler laying the proofs before them that you are the dragon reborn they know the prophecies they know what you were born to do once they are convinced of who and what you are they will accept you because they must the last battle is coming and you are their only hope humankinds only hope rand laughed out loud it was a bitter laugh sticking his pipe between his teeth he hoisted himself to sit crosslegged atop the table staring at them so you and siuan sanche still think you know everything there is to know the light willing they did not know near everything about him and would never find out youre both fools show some respect egwene growled but rand went on over her words the tairen high lords know the prophecies too and they knew me once they saw the sword that cannot be touched clutched in my fist half of them expect me to bring them power or glory or both the other half would as soon slip a knife in my back and try to forget the dragon reborn was ever in tear that is how the nations will greet the dragon reborn unless i quell them first the same way i did the tairens do you know why i left callandor in tear to remind them of me every day they know it is there driven into the heart of the stone and they know ill come back for it that is what holds them to me that was one reason he had left the sword that is not a sword behind he did not like even to think of the other be very careful moiraine said after a moment just that in a voice all frozen calm he heard stark warning in the words once he had heard her say in much the same tone that she would see him dead before letting the shadow have him a hard woman for a long moment she gazed at him her eyes dark pools that threatened to swallow him then she made a perfect curtsy by your leave my lord dragon i will see to letting master kadere know where i expect him to work tomorrow no one could have seen or heard the faintest mockery in action or words but rand felt it anything that might put him off balance make him more biddable by guilt or shame or uncertainty or whatever she would try he stared after her until the clicking beads in the doorway obscured her there is no need you scowling like that rand althor egwenes voice was low her eyes irate she held on to her shawl as if she wanted to strangle him with it lord dragon indeed whatever you are youre a rude illmannered lout you deserve more than you got it would not kill you to be civil so it was you he snapped but to his surprise she halfshook her head before catching herself it had been moiraine after all if the aes sedai was showing that much temper something must be wearing at her terribly him no doubt perhaps he should apologize i suppose it wouldnt hurt to be civil though he could not see why he was supposed to be mannerly to the aes sedai while she tried to lead him on a leash but if he was thinking of trying to be polite egwene was not if glowing coals were dark brown they would have been exactly like her eyes you are a woolheaded fool rand althor and i should never have told elayne you were good enough for her you arent good enough for a weasel bring your nose down i remember you sweating trying to talk your way out of some trouble mat had gotten you into i can remember nynaeve switching you till you howled and you needing a cushion to sit on the rest of the day not that many years gone either i ought to tell elayne to forget you if she knew half what youve turned into he gaped at her as the tirade went on with her more furious than at any time since first coming through the bead curtain then it hit him that little near shake of her head that she had not meant to give letting him know it had been moiraine who struck him with the power egwene worked very hard at doing what she was about in proper fashion studying with the wise ones she wore aiel clothes she might even be trying to adopt aiel customs for all he knew it would be like her but she worked hard at being a proper aes sedai all the time even if she was only one of the accepted aes sedai usually kept a rein on their tempers but they never ever gave anything away that they wanted to hide ilyena never flashed her temper at me when she was angry with herself when she gave me the rough side of her tongue it was because she his mind froze for an instant he had never met a woman named ilyena in his life but he could summon up a face for the name dimly a pretty face skin like cream golden hair exactly the shade of elaynes this had to be the madness remembering an imaginary woman perhaps one day he would find himself having conversations with people who were not there egwenes harangue shut off with a concerned look are you all right rand the anger was gone from her voice as if it had never been is something wrong should i fetch moiraine back to no he said and just as quickly softened his own tone she cant heal even an aes sedai could not heal madness none of them could heal any of what ailed him is elayne well she is well despite what egwene had said there was a hint of sympathy in her voice that was all he really expected beyond what he had known when elayne left tear what she was up to was an aes sedai concern and none of his so egwene had told him more than once and moiraine echoed her the three wise ones who could dreamwalk those egwene was studying with had been even less informative they had their own reasons not to be pleased with him i had best go too egwene went on settling her shawl over her arms you are tired frowning slightly she said rand what does it mean to be buried in the can breat he started to ask what under the light she was talking about then he remembered using that phrase just something i heard once he lied he had no more idea what it meant than where it had come from you rest rand she said sounding twenty years older rather than two younger promise me you will you need it he nodded she studied his face for a moment as though searching for the truth then started for the door rands silver goblet of wine floated up from the carpet and drifted to him he hastily snatched it out of the air just before egwene looked back over her shoulder perhaps i shouldnt tell you this she said elayne didnt give it to me as a message for you but she said she loves you perhaps you know already but if you dont you should think about it with that she was gone the beads clicking together behind her leaping from the table rand hurled the goblet away splashing wine across the floor tiles as he rounded on jasin natael in a fury chapter dice pale shadows seizing saidin rand channeled wove flows of air that snatched natael up from the cushions the gilded harp tumbled to the dark red tiles as the man was pinned against the wall immobile from neck to ankles and his feet half a pace above the floor ive warned you never channel when anyone else is around never natael tilted his head in that peculiar way he had as if trying to look at rand sideways or watch without being noticed if she had seen she would have thought it was you there was no apology in his voice no diffidence but no challenge either he seemed to think he was offering a reasonable explanation besides you looked thirsty a courtbard should look after his lords needs that was one of the small conceits he surrounded himself with if rand was the lord dragon then he himself must be a courtbard not a simple gleeman feeling disgusted with himself as much as angry at the man rand unraveled the weave and let him drop manhandling him was like picking a fight with a boy of ten he could not see the shield that constricted the other mans access to saidin it was female work but he knew it was there moving a goblet was about the extent of nataels ability now luckily the shield had been hidden from female eyes too natael called the trick inverting he did not seem able to explain it though and if shed seen my face and was suspicious i was as startled as if that goblet had flown at me by itself he stuck his pipe back between his teeth and sent up furious streams of smoke she still wouldnt suspect settling back onto the cushions the other man took up the harp again strumming a line of music that had a devious sound how could anyone suspect i do not entirely believe the situation myself if there was even a touch of bitterness in his voice rand could not detect it he was not entirely sure he believed it either though he had worked hard enough for it the man in front of him jasin natael had another name asmodean idly playing the harp asmodean did not look like one of the dreaded forsaken he was even moderately handsome rand supposed he would be attractive to women it often seemed strange that evil had left no outward mark he was one of the forsaken and far from trying to kill him rand hid what he was from moiraine and everyone else he needed a teacher if what was true for the women aes sedai called wilders also held for men he had only one chance in four of surviving the attempt to learn to use the power on his own that was discounting the madness his teacher had to be a man moiraine and others had told him often enough that a bird could not teach a fish to fly nor a fish a bird to swim and his teacher had to be someone experienced someone who already knew all the things he needed to learn with aes sedai gentling men who could channel as soon as they were found and fewer were found every year that left small choices a man who had simply discovered he could channel would know no more than he did a false dragon who could channel if rand could find one not already caught and gentled would not be likely to give up his own dreams of glory for another claiming to be the dragon reborn what remained what rand had lured to him was one of the forsaken asmodean plucked random chords as rand took a seat on a cushion facing him it was well to remember that the man had not changed not inside from the day so long ago when he had pledged his soul to the shadow what he did now he did under duress he had not come to the light do you ever think of turning back natael he was always careful of the name one breath of asmodean and moiraine would be sure he had gone over to the shadow moiraine and maybe others neither he nor asmodean might survive that the mans hands froze on the strings his face utterly blank turn back demandred rahvin any of them would kill me on sight now if i was lucky except lanfear perhaps and you will understand if dont want to put her to the test semirhage could make a boulder beg for mercy and thank her for death and as for the great lord the dark one rand broke in sharply around his pipestem the great lord of the dark was what darkfriends called the dark one darkfriends and the forsaken asmodean bowed his head briefly in acquiescence when the dark one breaks free if his face had been expressionless before now it was bleak in every line suffice it to say that i will find semirhage and give myself to her before ill face the the dark ones punishment for betrayal as well you are here to teach me then mournful music began to flow from the harp speaking of loss and tears the march of death asmodean said over the music the final movement of the grand passions cycle composed some three hundred years before the war of power by rand cut him off you are not teaching me very well as well as may be expected under the circumstances you can grasp saidin every time you try now and tell one flow from another you can shield yourself and the power does what you want it to he stopped playing and frowned not looking at rand do you think lanfear really intended me to teach you everything if she had wanted that she would have contrived to stay close so she could link us she wants you to live lews therin but this time she means to be stronger than you dont call me that rand snapped but asmodean did not seem to hear if you planned this between you trapping me rand sensed a surge in asmodean as if the forsaken were testing the shield lanfear had woven around him women who could channel saw a glow surrounding another woman who had embraced saidar and felt her channeling clearly but he never saw anything around asmodean and felt little if you worked it out together then you let her outfox you on more levels than one ive told you i am not a very good teacher especially without a link you did plan it between you didnt you he did look at rand then sidelong but still intent how much do you remember of being lews therin i mean she said you recalled nothing at all but she could lie to the gr the dark one himself this time she spoke the truth seating himself on one of the cushions rand channeled one of the clan chiefs untouched silver goblets to him even such a brief touch of saidin was exhilarating and fouling and hard to release he did not want to talk about lews therin he was tired of people thinking he was lews therin the bowl of his pipe had grown hot with all the puffing so he held it by the stem and gestured with it if linking will help you teach me why dont we link asmodean looked at him as if he had asked why they did not eat rocks then shook his head i continually forget how much you dont know you and i cannot not without a woman to join us you could ask moiraine i suppose or the girl egwene one of them might be able to reason out the method so long as you dont mind them finding out who i am dont lie to me natael rand growled well before meeting natael he had learned that a mans channeling and a womans were as different as men and women themselves but he took little the man said on trust ive heard egwene and others talk about aes sedai linking their powers if they can do it why not you and i because we cant exasperation filled asmodeans tone ask a philosopher if you want to know why why cant dogs fly perhaps in the grand scheme of the pattern its a balance for men being stronger we cannot link without them but they can without us up to thirteen of them can anyway a small mercy after that they need men to make the circle larger rand was sure he had caught a lie this time moiraine said that in the age of legends men and women had been equally strong in the power and she could not lie he said as much adding the five powers are equal earth fire air water and spirit natael strummed a chord for each they are equal true and it is also true that what a man can do with one a woman can also in kind at least but that has nothing to do with men being stronger what moiraine believes to be truth she tells as truth whether or not it is one of a thousand weaknesses in those fool oaths he played a bit of something that did indeed sound foolish some women have stronger arms than some men but in general it is the other way around the same holds with strength in the power and in about the same proportion rand nodded slowly it did make a kind of sense elayne and egwene were considered two of the strongest women to train in the tower for a thousand years or more but he had tested himself against them once and later elayne had confessed that she felt like a kitten seized by a mastiff asmodean was not finished if two women link they do not double their strength linking is not as simple as adding together the power of each but if they are strong enough they can match a man and when they take the circle to thirteen then you must be wary thirteen women who can barely channel could overpower most men linked the thirteen weakest women in the tower could overpower you or any man and barely breathe hard i came across a saying in arad doman the more women there are about the softer a wise man steps it would not be bad to remember it rand shivered thinking of a time when he had been among many more than thirteen aes sedai of course most of them had not known who he was if they had if egwene and moiraine linked he did not want to believe egwene had gone that far toward the tower and away from their friendship whatever she does she does with her whole heart and shes becoming aes sedai so is elayne swallowing half his wine did not completely wash the thought away what more can you tell me about the forsaken it was a question he was sure he had asked a hundred times but he always hoped there was a scrap more to dig out better than thinking about moiraine and egwene linking to i have told everything i know asmodean sighed heavily we were hardly close friends at the best do you believe i am holding back something i dont know where the others are if that is what you want except sammael and you knew hed taken illian for his kingdom before i told you graendal was in arad doman for a time but i expect she has gone now she likes her comforts too well i suspect moghedien is or was in the west somewhere as well but no one ever finds the spider unless she wants to be found rahvin has a queen for one of his pets but your guess is as good as mine as to what country she rules for him and that is all i know that might help locate them rand had heard all that before it seemed he had heard all asmodean had to say of the forsaken fifty times already so often that at moments it seemed he had always known what the man was telling him some of it he almost wished he had never learned what semirhage found amusing for instance and some made no sense demandred had gone over to the shadow because he envied lews therin telamon rand could not imagine envying someone enough to do anything because of it and surely not that asmodean claimed it had been the thought of immortality of endless ages of music that seduced him he claimed to have been a noted composer of music before senseless yet in that mass of often bloodchilling knowledge might lie keys to surviving tarmon gaidon whatever he told moiraine he knew he would have to face them then if not before emptying the goblet he set it on the floor tiles wine would not wash out facts the bead curtain rattled and he looked over his shoulder as gaishain entered whiterobed and silent while some began gathering up the food and drink that had been laid out for him and the chiefs another a man carried a large silver tray to the table on it were covered dishes a silver cup and two large greenstriped pottery pitchers one would hold wine the other water a gaishain woman brought in a gilded lamp already lit and set it beside the tray through the windows the sky was beginning to take on the yellowred of sunset in the brief time between baking and freezing the air actually felt comfortable rand stood as the gaishain departed but did not follow immediately what do you think of my chances when the last battle comes natael asmodean hesitated in pulling redandblue striped wool blankets from behind his cushions and looked up at him head tilted in that sideways manner of his you found something in the square the day we met here forget that rand said harshly there had been two not one i destroyed it in any case he thought asmodeans shoulders slumped a trifle then the dark one will consume you alive as for me i intend to open my veins the hour i know he is free if i get the chance a quick death is better than what ill find elsewhere he tossed the blankets aside and sat staring glumly at nothing better than going mad certainly im as subject to that as you now you broke the bonds that protected me there was no bitterness in his voice only hopelessness what if there was another way to shield against the taint rand demanded what if it could be removed somehow would you still kill yourself then asmodeans barked laugh was utterly acid the shadow take me you must be beginning to think you really are the bloody creator we are dead both of us dead are you too blind with pride to see it or just too thickwitted you hopeless shepherd rand refused to be drawn then why not go ahead and end it he asked in a tight voice i wasnt too blind to see what you and lanfear were up to i wasnt too thickwitted to fool her and trap you if theres no hope no chance not the smallest shred then why are you still alive still not looking at him asmodean rubbed the side of his nose i once saw a man hanging from a cliff he said slowly the brink was crumbling under his fingers and the only thing near enough to grasp was a tuft of grass a few long blades with roots barely clinging to the rock the only chance he had of climbing back up on the cliff so he grabbed it his abrupt chuckle held no mirth he had to know it would pull free did you save him rand asked but asmodean did not answer as rand started for the doorway the sounds of the march of death began again behind him the strings of beads fell together behind him and the five maidens who had been waiting in the wide empty hall flowed easily to their feet from where they had been squatting on the pale blue tiles they were all but one tall for women though not for aiel women their leader adelin lacked little more than a hand of being able to look him in the eyes the exception a fiery redhead named enaila was no taller than egwene and extremely touchy about being so short like the clan chiefs their eyes were all blue or gray or green and their hair light brown or yellow or red was cut short except for a tail at the nape of the neck full quivers balanced the longbladed knives at their belts and they wore cased horn bows on their backs each carried three or four short longbladed spears and a round bullhide buckler aiel women who did not want hearth and children had their own warrior society far dareis mai the maidens of the spear he acknowledged them with a small bow which made them smile it was not an aiel custom at least not the way he had been taught to do it i see you adelin he said where is joinde i thought she was with you earlier has she taken ill i see you rand althor she replied her pale yellow hair seemed paler framing her sundark face which had a fine white scar across one cheek in a way she has she had been talking to herself all day and not an hour ago she went off to lay a bridal wreath at the feet of garan of the jhirad goshien some of the others shook their heads marrying meant giving up the spear tomorrow is his last day as her gaishain joinde is black rock shaarad she added significantly it was significant marriages came frequently with men or women taken gaishain but very seldom between clans with blood feud even blood feud in abeyance it is an illness that spreads enaila said heatedly her voice was usually as hot as her hair one or two maidens make their bridal wreaths every day since we came to rhuidean rand nodded with what he hoped they took for sympathy it was his fault if he told them he wondered how many would still risk staying near him all probably honor would hold them and they had no more fear than the clan chiefs at least it was only marriages so far even maidens would think marrying better than what some had experienced maybe they would i will be ready to go in a moment he told them we will wait with patience adelin said it hardly seemed patience standing there they all appeared poised on the edge of sudden movement it really did take him only a moment to do what he wanted weave flows of spirit and fire into a box around the room and tie them so the weave held on its own anyone could go in or out except a man who could channel for himself or asmodean walking through that doorway would be like walking through a wall of solid flame he had discovered the weave and that asmodean blocked was too weak to channel through it by accident no one was likely to question the doings of a gleeman but if someone did jasin natael had simply chosen to sleep as far from aiel as he could manage in rhuidean that was a choice that hadnan kaderes drivers and guards at least could sympathize with and this way rand knew exactly where the man was of a night the maidens asked him no questions he turned away the maidens folowed him spread out and wary as if they expected an attack right there asmodean was still playing the lament arms outstretched to either side mat cauthon walked the wide white coping of the dry fountain singing to the men who watched him in the fading light well drink the wine till the cup is dry and kiss the girls so theyll not cry and toss the dice until we fly to dance with jak o the shadows the air felt cool after the days heat and he thought briefly of buttoning up his fine green silk coat with the golden embroidery but the drink the aiel called oosquai had put a buzz in his head like giant flies and the thought flittered away the white stone figures of three women stood on a platform in the dusty basin twenty feet tall and unclothed each had been made with one hand upraised the other holding a huge stone jar tilted over her shoulder for water to pour from but one was missing her head and upraised hand and on another the jar was a shattered ruin well dance all night while the moon runs free and dandle the lasses upon our knee and then youll ride along with me to dance with jak o the shadows a fine song to be singing about death one of the wagon drivers shouted in a heavy lugarder accent kaderes men kept themselves in a tight knot apart from the aielmen around the fountain they were all tough hardfaced men but every one was sure any aiel would slit his throat for a wrong glance they were not far wrong i heard my old grandmother talk about jak o the shadows the bigeared lugarder went on tisnt right to sing about death that way mat muzzily considered the song he had been singing and grimaced no one had heard dance with jak o the shadows since aldeshar fell in his head he could still hear the defiant song rising as the golden lions launched their last futile charge at artur hawkwings encircling army at least he had not been babbling it in the old tongue he was not as juicy as he looked by half but there had indeed been too many cups of oosquai the stuff looked and tasted like brown water but it hit your head like a mules kick moiraine will pack me off to the tower yet if im not careful at least it would get me out of the waste and away from rand maybe he was drunker than he thought if he considered that a fair trade he shifted to tinker in the kitchen tinker in the kitchen with a job of work to do mistress up above slipping on a robe of blue she dances down the staircase her fancy all so free crying tinker oh dear tinker wont you mend a pot for me some of kaderes men joined in the song as he danced back to where he had begun the aiel did not among them men did not sing except for battle chants or laments for the slain and neither did maidens except among themselves two aielmen were squatting on the coping showing none of the effects of the oosquai they had consumed unless their eyes were the faintest bit glassy he would be glad to get back where lightcolored eyes were a rarity growing up he had not seen anything but brown or black except on rand a few pieces of wood wormholed arms and legs from chairs lay on the broad paving stones in the area left open by the watchers an empty red pottery crock lay beside the coping as did another that still held oosquai and a silver cup the game was to take a drink then try to hit a target thrown into the air with a knife none of kaderes men and few of the aiel would dice with him not when he won as often as he did and they did not play at cards knife throwing was supposed to be different especially with oosquai added in he had not won as often as he did with dice but half a dozen worked gold cups and two bowls lay inside the basin beneath him along with bracelets and necklaces set with rubies or moonstones or sapphires and a scattering of coins as well his flatcrowned hat and an odd spear with a black haft rested beside his winnings some of it was even aiel made they were more likely to pay for something with a piece of loot than with a coin corman one of the aiel on the coping looked up at him as he cut off singing a white scar slanted across his nose you are nearly as good with knives as you are with dice matrim cauthon shall we call it an end the light is failing theres plenty of light mat squinted at the sky pale shadows covered everything here in the valley of rhuidean but the sky was still light enough to see against at least my grandmother could make the throw in this i could make it blindfolded jenric the other squatting aiel peered around the onlookers are there women here built like a bear he considered himself a wit the only time a man talks like that is when there are women to impress the maidens scattered through the crowd laughed as hard as anyone else and maybe harder you think i cant mat muttered ripping off the dark scarf he wore around his neck to hide the scar where he had once been hung just you shout now when you throw it up corman hastily he tied the scarf around his eyes and drew one of his knives from his sleeve the loudest sound was the watchers breathing not drunk im juicier than a fiddlers whelp and yet he suddenly felt his luck felt that surge the way he did when he knew which spots would show before the dice stopped tumbling it seemed to clear his head a little throw it he murmured calmly now corman called and mats arm whipped back then forward in the stillness the thunk of steel stabbing wood was as loud as the clatter of the target on the pavement no one said a word as he pulled the scarf back down around his neck a piece of a chair arm no bigger than his hand lay in the open space his blade stuck firmly in the middle corman had tried to shave the odds it appeared well he had never specified the target he suddenly realized he had not even made a wager finally one of kaderes men halfshouted the dark ones own luck that luck is a horse to ride like any other mat said to himself no matter where it came from not that he knew where his luck came from he only tried to ride it as best he could as quietly as he had spoken jenric frowned up at him what was that you said matrim cauthon mat opened his mouth to repeat himself then closed it again as the words came clear in his mind sene sovya cabadonde am dovienya the old tongue nothing he muttered just talking to myself the onlookers were beginning to drift away i guess the light really is fading too much to go on corman put a foot on the piece of wood to wrench mats knife free and brought it back to him some time again maybe matrim cauthon some day that was the aiel way of saying never when they did not want to say it right out mat nodded as he slipped the blade back into one of the sheaths inside his sleeve it was the same as the time he had rolled six sixes twentythree times in a row he could hardly blame them being lucky was not all it was made out he noted with a bit of envy that neither aiel staggered in the slightest as they joined the departing crowd scrubbing a hand through his hair mat sat down heavily on the coping the memories that had once cluttered his head like raisins in a cake now blended with his own in one part of his mind he knew he had been born in the two rivers twenty years before but he could remember clearly leading the flanking attack that turned the trollocs at maighande and dancing in the court of tarmandewin and a hundred other things a thousand mostly battles he remembered dying more times than he wanted to think of no seams between lives anymore he could not tell his memories from the others unless he concentrated reaching behind him he set his widebrimmed hat on his head and fished the odd spear across his knees instead of an ordinary spearhead it had what looked like a twofoot sword blade marked with a pair of ravens lan said that that blade had been made with the one power during the war of the shadow the war of the power the warder claimed it would never need sharpening and never break mat thought he would not trust that unless he had to it might have lasted three thousand years but he had little trust of the power cursive script ran along the black haft punctuated at either end with another raven inlaid in some metal even darker than the wood in the old tongue but he could read it now of course thus is our treaty written thus is agreement made thought is the arrow of time memory never fades what was asked is given the price is paid one way down the wide street half a mile off was a square that would have been called large in most cities the aiel traders were gone for the night but their pavilions still stood made of the same grayish brown wool used for aiel tents hundreds of traders had come to rhuidean from every part of the waste for the biggest fair the aiel had ever seen and more arrived every day the traders had been among the first to actually start living in the city mat did not really want to look the other way toward the great plaza he could make out the shapes of kaderes wagons awaiting more loading tomorrow what appeared to be a twisted redstone doorframe had been heaved into one that afternoon moiraine had taken particular care to see it lashed firmly in place just as she wanted he did not know what she knew of it and he was not about to ask better if she forgot he was alive though small chance of that but whatever she knew he was sure he knew more he had stepped through it a fool looking for answers what he had gotten instead was a head full of other mens memories that and dead he tucked the scarf closer around his neck and two other things a silver foxhead medallion that he wore under his shirt and the weapon across his knees small recompense he ran his fingers lightly down the script memory never fades they had a sense of humor fit for aiel those folk on the other side of that doorway can you do that every time he jerked his head around to stare at the maiden who had just sat down beside him tall even for an aiel maybe taller than he was she had hair like spun gold and eyes the color of a clear morning sky she was older than he maybe by ten years but that had never put him off then again she was far dareis mai i am melindhra she went on of the jumai sept can you do that every time she meant the knife throwing he realized she gave her sept but no clan aiel never did that unless she had to be one of the shaido maidens who had come to join rand he did not really understand all this about societies but as for shaido he remembered them trying to stick spears in him too well couladin did not like anyone associated with rand and what couladin hated the shaido hated on the other hand melindhra had come here to rhuidean a maiden but she wore a small smile her gaze held an inviting light most of the time he said truthfully even when he did not feel it his luck was good when he did it was perfect she chuckled her smile widening as if she thought he was boasting women seemed to make up their minds whether you were lying without looking at the evidence on the other hand if they liked you they either did not care or else decided even the most outrageous lie was true maidens could be dangerous whatever their clan any woman could he had learned that on his own but melindhras eyes were definitely not just looking at him dipping into his winnings he pulled up a necklace of gold spirals each centered on a deep blue sapphire the largest as big as the joint of his thumb he could remember a time his own memory when the smallest of those stones would have made him sweat theyll look pretty with your eyes he said laying the heavy strand in her hands he had never seen a maiden wear baubles of any sort but in his experience every woman liked jewelry strangely they liked flowers nearly as well he did not understand it but then he was willing to admit that he understood women less than he did his luck or what had happened on the other side of that twisted doorway very fine work she said holding it up i accept your offer the necklace disappeared into her belt pouch and she leaned over to push his hat back on his head your eyes are pretty like dark polished catseye she twisted around to pull her feet up onto the coping and sat with her arms wrapped around her knees studying him intently my spear sisters have told me about you mat pulled his hat back into place and watched her warily from under the brim what had they told her and what offer it was only a necklace the invitation was gone from her eyes she looked like a cat studying a mouse that was the trouble with maidens of the spear sometimes it was hard to tell whether they wanted to dance with you kiss you or kill you the street was emptying the shadows deepening but he recognized rand slanting across down the way pipe clenched between his teeth he was the only man in rhuidean likely to be walking with a fistful of far dareis mai theyre always around him mat thought guarding him like a pack of shewolves leaping to do whatever he says some men might have envied him that much at least not mat not most of the time if it had been a pack of girls like isendre now excuse me for a moment he told melindhra hurriedly leaning his spear against the low wall around the fountain he leaped up already running his head still buzzed but not so loudly as before and he did not stagger he had no worries about his winnings the aiel had very definite views of what was allowed taking in a raid was one thing theft another kaderes men had learned to keep their hands in their pockets after one of them had been caught stealing after a beating that left him striped from shoulders to heels he had been sent away the one water bag he had been allowed would not have been nearly enough for him to reach the dragonwall even if he had had any clothes on now kaderes men would not pick up a copper they found lying in the street rand the other man walked on with his encircling escort rand rand was not even ten paces away but he did not waver some of the maidens looked back but not rand mat felt cold suddenly and it had nothing to do with the onset of night he wet his lips and spoke again not a shout lews therin and rand turned around mat almost wished he had not for a time they only looked at one another in the twilight mat hesitated about going closer he tried telling himself it was because of the maidens adelin had been one of those who taught him a socalled game maidens kiss that he was never likely to forget or play again if he had any say in it and he could feel enailas gaze like an auger boring into his skull who would have expected a woman to go up like oil thrown on a fire just because you told her she was the prettiest little flower you had ever seen rand now he and rand had grown up together they and perrin the blacksmiths apprentice back in emonds field had hunted together fished together tramped through the sand hills to the edge of the mountains of mist camped under the stars rand was his friend only now he was the kind of friend who might bash your head in without meaning to perrin could be dead because of rand he made himself walk to arms reach of the other man rand was nearly a head taller and in the earlyevening gloom he seemed taller yet colder than he had been ive been thinking rand mat wished he did not sound hoarse he hoped rand would answer to his right name this time ive been away from home a long time we both have rand said softly a long time suddenly he gave a laugh not loud but almost like the old rand are you beginning to miss milking your fathers cows mat scratched his ear grinning a bit not that exactly if he never saw the inside of another barn it would be too soon but i was thinking that when kaderes wagons go i might go with them rand was silent when he spoke again the brief flash of mirth was gone all the way to tar valon it was mats turn to hesitate he wouldnt give me away to moiraine would he maybe he said casually i dont know thats where moiraine will want me maybe ill find a chance to get back to the two rivers see if everythings all right at home see if perrins alive see if my sisters are and mother and da we all have to do what we must mat not what we want to very often what we must it sounded like an excuse to mat as if rand was asking him to understand only he had done what he had to himself a few times i cant blame perrin on him not by himself nobody bloody forced me to follow after rand like some bloody heelhound only that was not true either he had been forced just not by rand you wont stop me leaving i dont try to tell you to come or go mat rand said wearily the wheel weaves the pattern not me and the wheel weaves as the wheel wills for all the world like a bloody aes sedai half turning to go rand added dont trust kadere mat in some ways hes about as dangerous a man as you ever met dont trust him an inch or you might get your throat slit and you and i wouldnt be the only ones to regret that then he was gone down the street in the deepening dusk with the maidens around him like slinking wolves mat stared after him trust the merchant i wouldnt trust kadere if he was tied in a sack so rand did not weave the pattern he came close before ever any of them learned that the prophecies had anything to do with them they had learned that rand was taveren one of those rare individuals who instead of being woven willynilly into the pattern instead forced the pattern to shape itself around them mat knew about being taveren he was one himself though not as strong as rand sometimes rand could affect peoples lives change the course of them just by being in the same town perrin was taveren as well or maybe had been moiraine had thought it was significant finding three young men who grew up in the same village all destined to be taveren she meant to fit them all into her plans whatever they were it was supposed to be a grand thing all the taveren mat had been able to learn about had been men like artur hawkwing or women like mabriam en shereed who stories said had founded the compact of the ten nations after the breaking but none of the stories told what happened when one taveren was close to another as strong as rand it was like being a leaf in a whirlpool melindhra stopped beside him and handed him his spear and a heavy coarsewoven sack that clinked i put your winnings in this for you she was taller than he was by a good two inches she glanced after rand i had heard you were nearbrother to rand althor in a manner of speaking he said dryly it does not matter she said dismissively and concentrated her gaze on him fists on her hips you attracted my interest mat cauthon before you gave me a regardgift not that i will give up the spear for you of course but i have had my eye on you for days you have a smile like a boy about to do mischief i like that and those eyes in the failing light her grin was slow and wide and warm i do like your eyes mat tugged his hat straight though it had not been crooked from pursuer to pursued in the blink of an eye it could happen like that with aiel women especially maidens does daughter of the nine moons mean anything to you it was a question he asked women sometimes the wrong answer would send him out of rhuidean tonight if he had to try walking out of the waste nothing she said but there are things i like to do by moonlight putting an arm around his shoulder she took off his hat and began to whisper in his ear in no time at all he was grinning even more widely than she chapter spears and shield twilight with his far dareis mai escort rand approached the rhuidean roof of the maidens white stairs as wide as the tall building each step a stride deep ran up to thick columns twenty paces high blackseeming in the twilight but bright blue by day and fluted in spirals the outside of the building was a patterned mosaic of glazed tiles white and blue in spirals that appeared endless to the eye and a huge window of colored glass directly above the columns showed a blackhaired woman fifteen feet tall in complicated blue robes right hand upraised either to bless or command a halt her face was serene and stern at the same time whoever she had been she was surely no aiel not with that pale skin and those dark eyes an aes sedai perhaps he tapped his pipe out on his bootheel and stuffed it into his coat pocket before starting up the steps except for gaishain men were not allowed beneath a roof of the maidens not any man not in any hold in the waste a chief or a maidens blood kin could die trying though in fact no aielman would ever think of it it was the same for any society only members and the gaishain were allowed inside the two maidens standing guard at the tall bronze doors flashed maiden handtalk at one another cutting their eyes in his direction as he came through the columns then shared a small grin he wished he knew what they had said even in as dry a land as the waste bronze would tarnish with enough time but gaishain had polished these doors until they looked newmade they stood wide open and the pair of guards made no move to hinder him as he walked through adelin and the others on his heels the wide whitetiled corridors and great rooms inside were full of maidens sitting about on bright cushions talking tending to weapons playing cats cradle or stones or thousand flowers an aiel game that involved laying out patterns of flat bits of stone carved with what seemed a hundred different symbols of course a profusion of gaishain moved smoothly about their chores cleaning serving mending seeing to oil lamps that ranged from simple glazed pottery to gilded loot from somewhere to the tall standlamps that had been found in the city in most rooms colorful carpets and bright tapestries covered the floors and walls in nearly as many patterns and styles as there were carpets and tapestries the walls and ceilings themselves were detailed mosaics of forests and rivers and skies that had never been seem in the waste young or old the maidens smiled when they saw him and some nodded familiarly or even patted his shoulder others called out asking how he was had he eaten would he like the gaishain to bring him wine or water he responded briefly though with answering smiles he was well and neither hungry nor thirsty he kept walking not even slowing when he spoke slowing would lead inevitably to stopping and he was not up to that tonight far dareis mai had adopted him after a fashion some treated him as a son others as a brother age seemed not to come into it women with white in their hair might talk to him as a brother over tea while maidens no more than a year older than he tried to make sure he wore the proper clothes for the heat there was no avoiding the mothering they simply did it and he could not see how to make them stop short of using the power against the whole lot of them he had thought of trying to have another society provide his guards shaeen mtaal the stone dogs perhaps or aethan dor the red shields rhuarc had been a red shield before becoming chief only what reason could he possibly give not the truth certainly just thinking about explaining that to rhuarc and the others made him uncomfortable aiel humor being what it was even sour old han would likely break his ribs laughing any reason at all would probably offend the honor of every last maiden at least they rarely mothered him except under the roof where there was no one to see but themselves and gaishain who knew better than to speak of anything that happened there the maidens he had once said carry my honor everyone remembered that and the maidens were as proud of it as if he had given them all thrones but it had turned out that they carried it in a manner they chose adelin and the other four left him to join their friends but he was hardly alone as he climbed higher in the building along curving flights of wide white stairs he had to answer the same questions at practically every step no he was not hungry yes he knew he was not used to the heat yet and no he had not spent too much time in the sun he bore it all patiently but he did heave a sigh of relief when he reached the second story above the huge window here there were no maidens and no gaishain in the broad hallways or on the stairs that led on upward the bare walls and empty chambers emphasized the absence of people but after traversing the floors below he found solitude a blessing his bedroom was a windowless chamber near the center of the building one of the few that was not huge though its ceiling still reached high enough to make height the rooms longest dimension what it had been meant for originally he had no idea a mosaic of vines around the small fireplace was the only ornamentation a servants room he would have said but servants rooms did not have a door sheathed in bronze however plain that he pushed most of the way shut gaishain had polished the metal to a dull gleam a few tasseled cushions lay scattered on the blue floor tiles for sitting and a thick pallet atop bright layered rugs for sleeping a simple blueglazed pitcher of water and a dark green cup sat on the floor near the bed that was it except for two threepronged standlamps already lit and a pacehigh pile of books in one corner with a tired sigh he lay down on the pallet still in his coat and boots no matter how he shifted it was not much softer than sleeping on the bare floor the nights chill was already seeping into the room but he did not bother to light the dried cow dung on the hearth he was readier to face the cold than the smell asmodean had tried to show him a simple way to keep the room warm simple but something the man did not have enough strength to do himself the one time rand had tried it he had awakened in the middle of the night gasping for breath while the edges of the rugs smoldered from the heat of the floor he had not made another attempt he had chosen this building for his quarters because it was whole and near to the plaza its great high ceilings gave a semblance of coolness even to the hottest part of the day and its thick walls kept out the worst of the cold at night it had not been the roof of the maidens then of course one morning he simply awakened to find it so maidens in every room on the first two floors and their guards on the doors it had taken him a while to realize that they intended the building for their societys roof in rhuidean yet expected him to continue to stay in it in fact they were ready to move the roof wherever he went that was why he had to meet the clan chiefs elsewhere the best he had been able to manage was to make the maidens agree to stay below the floor where he slept that had amused them all no end even the caracarn is not a king he reminded himself wryly twice already he had moved upward as the numbers of maidens increased idly he tried to calculate how many more could come in before he was sleeping on the roof that was better than remembering how he had let moiraine get under his skin he had not meant her to learn his plans until the day the aiel moved she knew exactly how to manipulate his emotions how to make him so angry that he said more than he wanted to i never used to get so angry why is it so hard to hold on to my temper well there was nothing she could do to stop him he did not think there was he had to remember to be careful around her his increasing abilities occasionally made him careless toward her but if he was far stronger she still knew more than he even with asmodeans teaching in a way letting asmodean know his plans was less important than revealing his intentions to the aes sedai to moiraine im still just a shepherd she can use for the towers ends but to asmodean im the only branch he can hold on to in a flood strange to think he could probably trust one of the forsaken more than he could moiraine not that he could trust either very far asmodean if his bonds to the dark one had shielded him from the taint on saidin there had to be another way to do it or to cleanse it the trouble was that before they went over to the shadow the forsaken had been among the most powerful aes sedai in the age of legends when things the white tower never dreamed of were commonplace if asmodean did not know a way it probably did not exist it has to there has to be something im not going to just sit until i go mad and die that was plain foolish prophecy had made a rendezvous for him at shayol ghul when he did not know but afterward he would not have to worry about going mad any longer he shivered and thought about unfolding his blankets the faint sound of softsoled footsteps in the hall snapped him upright i told them if they cant the woman who pushed open the door her arms full of thick wool blankets was not anyone he expected aviendha paused just inside the room to regard him with cool bluegreen eyes a more than pretty woman of an age with him she had been a maiden until she gave up the spear to become a wise one not very long ago her dark reddish hair still came well short of her shoulders and hardly needed the folded brown scarf to keep it out of her face she seemed a bit awkward with her brown shawl a bit impatient with her full gray skirts he felt a stab of jealousy at the silver necklace she wore an elaborate string of intricately worked discs each different who gave her that she would not have chosen it herself she did not seem to like jewelry the only other piece she wore was a wide ivory bracelet carved in finely detailed roses he had given her that and he was not sure she had forgiven him for it yet it was foolish of him to be jealous in any case i havent seen you in ten days he said i thought the wise ones would have tied you to my arm once they found out id blocked them out of my dreams asmodean had been amused at the first thing he wanted to learn and then frustrated at how long rand took to learn it i have my training to do rand althor she would be one of the few wise ones who could channel that was part of what she was being taught i am not one of your wetlander women to stand about so you can look at me whenever you wish despite knowing egwene and elayne for that matter she had an oddly wrongheaded view of what she called wetlander women and of wetlanders in general they are not pleased at what you have done she meant amys bair and melaine the three wise one dreamwalkers who were teaching her and trying to watch him aviendha shook her head ruefully they were especially not pleased that i had let you know they were walking your dreams he stared at her you told them but you didnt really say anything i figured it out myself and i would have eventually even if you hadnt let a hint slip out aviendha they told me they could speak to people in their dreams it was only a step from that would you have had me dishonor myself further her voice was level enough but her eyes could have started the fire laid on the hearth i will not dishonor myself for you or any man i gave you the trail to follow and i will not deny my shame i should have let you freeze she threw the blankets right on top of his head he pulled them off and laid them beside him on the pallet while trying to think of what to say it was jietoh again the woman was as prickly as a thornbush supposedly she had been given the task of teaching him aiel customs but he knew her true job to spy on him for the wise ones whatever dishonor was attached to spying among aiel apparently it did not extend to the wise ones they knew he knew but for some reason it did not seem to concern them and as long as they were willing to let matters remain as they were so was he for one thing aviendha was not a very good spy she almost never tried to find anything out and her own temper got in the way of making him angry or guilty the way moiraine did for another she was actually pleasant company sometimes when she forgot to keep her thorns out at least he knew who it was that amys and the others had set to watch him if it was not she it would be someone else and he would be constantly wondering who besides she was never wary around him mat egwene even moiraine sometimes looked at him with eyes that saw the dragon reborn or at least the danger of a man who could channel the clan chiefs and the wise ones saw he who comes with the dawn the man prophesied to break the aiel like dried twigs if they did not fear him they still sometimes treated him like a red adder they had to live with whatever aviendha saw it never stopped her being scathing whenever she chose which was most of the time an odd sort of comfort but compared to the rest it was a comfort nonetheless he had missed her he had even picked flowers from some of the spiny plants around rhuidean bloodying his fingers until he realized he could use the power and sent them to her half a dozen times the maidens had carried the blossoms themselves instead of sending gaishain she had never acknowledged them of course thank you he said finally touching the blankets they seemed a safe enough subject i suppose you cant have too many in the nights here enaila asked me to bring them to you when she found out i was here to see you her lips twitched in the beginnings of an amused smile a number of the spearsisters were worried that you might not be warm enough i am to see that you light your fire tonight you didnt last night rand felt his cheeks coloring she knew well she would wouldnt she the bloody maidens may not tell her everything anymore but they dont bother to keep anything from her either why did you want to see me to his surprise she folded her arms beneath her breasts and paced the short length of the room twice before stopping to glare at him this was not a regard gift she said accusingly shaking the bracelet at him you admitted as much true though he thought she might have put a knife in his ribs had he not conceded it it was simply a fool gift from a man who did not know or care what my what the spearsisters might think well this has no meaning either she pulled something from her pouch and tossed it onto the pallet beside him it cancels debt between us rand picked up what she had thrown and turned it over in his hands a belt buckle in the shape of a dragon ornately made in good steel and inlaid with gold thank you its beautiful aviendha there is no debt to cancel if you will not take it against my debt she said firmly then throw it away i will find something else to repay you it is only a trinket hardly a trinket you must have had this made do not think that means anything rand althor when i gave up the spear my spears my knife unconsciously her hand brushed her belt where that longbladed knife used to hang even the points of my arrows were taken from me and handed to a smith to make simple things to give away most i gave to friends but the wise ones had me name the three men and three women i most hate and i was told to give each of them a gift made from my weapons with my own hands bair says it teaches humility straightbacked and glaring biting off each word she looked and sounded anything but humble so you will not think that means anything it means nothing he said nodding sadly not that he wanted it to mean anything really but it would have been pleasing to think she might be beginning to see him as a friend it was plain foolish to feel jealousy over her i wonder who gave it to her aviendha was i one of those you hate so much yes rand althor she suddenly sounded hoarse for a moment she turned her face away eyes shut and quivering i hate you with all of my heart i do and i always will he did not bother to ask why once he had asked her why she disliked him and practically had his nose snapped off she had not told him though but this was more than a dislike she sometimes seemed to forget if you really hate me he said reluctantly i will ask the wise ones to send someone else to teach me no but if you no if anything her denial was even more fierce this time she planted her fists on her hips and lectured as if she meant to drive every word home in his heart even if the wise ones allowed me to stop i have toh obligation and duty to my nearsister elayne to watch you for her you belong to her rand althor to her and no other woman remember that he felt like throwing up his hands at least this time she was not describing to him how elayne looked without any clothes some aiel customs took even more getting used to than others he sometimes wondered if she and elayne had agreed on this watching between them he could not believe it but then again even women who were not aiel were odd as often as not more than that he wondered who aviendha was supposed to be protecting him from except for the maidens and the wise ones aiel women seemed to look at him half as prophecy made flesh and thus not really flesh at all and half as a blood snake loose among children the wise ones were nearly as bad as moiraine when it came to trying to make him do what they wanted and the maidens he did not want to think about the whole thing made him furious now you listen to me i kissed elayne a few times and i think she enjoyed it as much as i did but i am not promised to anyone im not even sure she wants that much from me anymore in the space of a few hours she had written him two letters one called him the dearest light of her heart before going on to make his ears burn while the other named him a coldhearted wretch she never wanted to see again and then proceeded to rip him up one side and down the other better than aviendha ever had women were definitely odd i dont have time to think about women anyway the only thing on my mind is uniting the aiel even the shaido if i can i he cut off with a groan as the very last woman he could have hoped for swayed into the room in a clatter of jewelry carrying a silver tray with a blownglass flagon of wine and two silver cups a diaphanous red silk scarf wrapped around isendres head did nothing to hide her palely beautiful heart shaped face her long dark hair and dark eyes never belonged to any aiel her full pouting lips were curved enticingly until she saw aviendha then the smile faded to a sickly thing aside from the scarf she had on a dozen or more necklaces of gold and ivory some set with pearls or polished gems as many bracelets weighted each wrist and even more bunched around her ankles that was it she wore not another thing he made himself keep his eyes strictly on her face but even so his cheeks felt hot aviendha looked like a thunderhead about to spit lightning isendre like a woman who had just learned she was to be boiled alive rand wished he were in the pit of doom or anywhere but there still he got to his feet he would have more authority looking down on them than the other way around aviendha he began but she ignored him did someone send you with that she asked coldly isendre opened her mouth the intended lie plain on her face then gulped and whispered no you have been warned about this sorda a sorda was a kind of rat especially sly according to the aiel and good for absolutely nothing its flesh was so rank that even cats seldom ate the ones they killed adelin thought the last time would have taught you isendre flinched and swayed as if about to faint rand gathered himself aviendha whether she was sent or not doesnt matter i am a little thirsty and if she was kind enough to bring me wine she should be thanked for it aviendha glanced coolly at the two cups and raised her eyebrows he took a deep breath she should not be punished just for bringing me something to drink he was careful not to look at the tray himself half the maidens under the roof must have asked if i she was taken by the maidens for theft from maidens rand althor aviendhas voice was even colder than it had been for the other woman you have meddled too much already in the business of far dareis mai more than you should have been allowed not even the caracarn can thwart justice this is no concern of yours he grimaced and let it go whatever the maidens did to her isendre certainly had coming just not for this she had entered the waste with hadnan kadere but kadere had not cracked his teeth when the maidens took her for stealing the jewelry that was now all they let her wear it had been all rand could do to keep her from being sent off to shara tethered like a goat or else dispatched naked toward the dragonwall with one water bag watching her plead for mercy once she realized what the maidens intended he had not been able to make himself stay out of it once he had killed a woman a woman who meant to kill him but the memory still burned he did not think he would ever be able to do it again even with his life in the balance a foolish thing with female forsaken likely seeking his blood or worse but there it was and if he could not kill a woman how could he stand by and let a woman die even if she deserved it that was the rub in any land west of the dragonwall isendre would face the gallows or the headsmans block for what he knew about her about her and kadere and probably most of the merchants men if not all they were darkfriends and he could not expose them not even they were aware that he knew if any one of them was revealed as a darkfriend isendre endured as best she could because even being a servant and kept naked was better than being tied hand and foot and left for the sun but none would keep silent once moiraine had her hands on them aes sedai had no more mercy for darkfriends than for anyone else she would loosen their tongues in short order and asmodean had come into the waste with the merchants wagons too just another darkfriend so far as kadere and the others knew though one with authority no doubt they thought he had taken service with the dragon reborn on orders from some still higher power to keep his teacher to keep moiraine from trying to kill both of them very probably rand had to keep their secret luckily no one questioned why the aiel kept such a close watch on the merchant and his men moiraine thought it was the usual aiel suspicion of outsiders in the waste magnified by them being in rhuidean she had had to use all of her persuasion to make the aiel let kadere and his wagons into the city the suspicion was there rhuarc and the other chiefs likely would have set guards even if rand had not asked and kadere just seemed happy he did not have a spear through his ribs rand had no idea how he was going to resolve the situation or if he could it was a fine mess in gleemens stories only villains got caught in a cleft stick like this once she was sure that he was not going to try to interfere further aviendha turned her attention back to the other woman you may leave the wine isendre halfknelt gracefully to set the tray beside his pallet a peculiar grimace on her face it took rand a moment to recognize an attempt to smile at him without letting the aiel woman see and now you will run to the first maiden you can find aviendha went on and tell her what you have done run sorda moaning and wringing her hands isendre ran in a great rattle of jewelry as soon as she was out of the room aviendha rounded on him you belong to elayne you have no right to try luring any woman but especially not that one her rand gasped you think i believe me aviendha if she were the last woman on earth id still stay as far from her as i could run so you say she sniffed she has been switched seven times seven for trying to sneak to your bed she would not persist like that without some encouragement she faces far dareis mai justice and she is no concern of even the caracarn take that as your lesson for today on our customs and remember that you belong to my nearsister without letting him get a word in she stalked out wearing such a look that he thought isendre might not survive if aviendha caught up to her letting out a long breath he got up long enough to put the tray and its wine in a corner of the room he was not about to drink anything isendre brought him seven times shes tried to reach me she must have learned that he interceded for her no doubt to her way of thinking if he was willing to do that for a smoky look and a smile what might he do for more he shivered at the thought as much as the increasing cold he would rather have a scorpion in his bed if the maidens failed to convince her he might tell her what he knew about her that should put an end to any schemes snuffing the lamps he crawled onto his pallet in the dark still booted and fully dressed and fumbled around until he had pulled all of the blankets over him without the fire he suspected he really would be grateful to aviendha before morning setting the wards of spirit that shielded his dreams from intrusion was almost automatic to him now but even as he did it he chuckled to himself he could have gotten into bed and then put out the lamps with the power it was the simple things that he never thought of doing with the power for a time he lay waiting for his bodys heat to warm the inside of the blankets how the same place could be so hot by day and so cold by night was beyond him sticking one hand under his coat he fingered the halfhealed scar on his side that wound the one that moiraine could never completely heal was what would kill him eventually he was sure of it his blood on the rocks of shayol ghul that was what the prophecies said not tonight i wont think of that tonight i have a little time yet but if the seals can be shaved with a knife now do they still hold as strongly no not tonight the inside of the blankets was becoming a little warmer and he shifted around trying and failing to find a comfortable way to lie i should have washed he thought drowsily egwene was probably in a warm sweat tent right that minute half the time he used one a fistful of maidens tried to come in with him and nearly rolled on the ground laughing when he insisted on them staying outside it was bad enough having to undress and dress in the steam sleep finally came and with it safely protected dreams safe from the wise ones or anyone else not protected from his own thoughts though three women invaded them continually not isendre except in a brief nightmare that nearly woke him by turns he dreamed of elayne and min and aviendha by turns and together only elayne had ever looked at him as a man but all three saw him as who he was not what he was aside from the nightmare they were all pleasant dreams chapter flame of tar valon among the wise ones standing as close as she could to the small fire in the middle of the tent egwene still shivered as she poured water from the generous teakettle into a wide bluestriped bowl she had lowered the sides of the tent but cold seeped through the colorful layered rugs covering the ground and all the fires heat seemed to rush up and out of the smoke hole in the middle of the tent roof leaving only the smell of the burning cow dung her teeth wanted to chatter already the steam from the water was beginning to fade she embraced saidar for a moment and channeled fire to heat it more amys or bair would probably have washed in it cold though in fact they always took sweat baths so im not as tough as they are i did not grow up in the waste i dont have to freeze to death and wash in cold water if i dont want to she still felt guilty as she lathered a cloth with a piece of lavenderscented soap bought from hadnan kadere the wise ones had never asked her to do differently but it still felt like cheating letting go of the true source made her sigh with remorse even trembling with cold she laughed softly at her own foolishness the wonder of being filled with the power the wondrous rush of life and awareness was its own danger the more you drew on saidar the more you wanted to draw and without selfdiscipline you eventually drew more than you could handle and either died or stilled yourself and that was nothing to laugh at thats one of your biggest faults she lectured herself firmly you always want to do more than youre supposed to you ought to wash in cold water that would teach you selfdiscipline only there was so much to learn and it sometimes seemed a lifetime would be too short to learn it her teachers were always so cautious whether wise ones or aes sedai in the tower it was hard to hold back when she knew that in so many ways she already outstripped them i can do more than they realize a blast of freezing air hit her swirling smoke from the fire about the tent and a womans voice said if it pleases you egwene jumped yelping shrilly before managing to get out shut that she hugged herself to stop from capering get in or get out but shut it all that effort to be warm and now she was icy goose bumps from head to toe the whiterobed woman shuffled into the tent on her knees and let the tent flap drop she kept her eyes downcast her hands folded meekly she would have done the same if egwene had hit her instead of just shouting if it pleases you she said softly the wise one amys sent me to bring you to the sweat tent wishing she could stand on top of the fire egwene groaned the light burn bair and her stubbornness if not for the whitehaired old wise one they could be in rooms in the city instead of tents on the edge of it i could have a room with a proper fireplace and a door she was willing to bet that rand did not have to put up with people wandering in on him whenever they wanted rand bloody dragon althor snaps his fingers and the maidens jump like serving girls ill wager theyve found him a real bed instead of a pallet on the ground she was sure that he got a hot bath every night the maidens probably haul buckets of hot water up to his rooms ill bet they even found him a proper copper bathtub amys and even melaine had been amenable to egwenes suggestion but bair had put her foot down and they acquiesced like gaishain egwene supposed that with rand bringing so much change bair wanted to hold on to as much of the old ways as she could but she wished the woman could have chosen something else to be intractable over there was no thought of refusing she had promised the wise ones to forget that she was aes sedai the easy part since she was not and do exactly as she was told that was the hard part she had been away from the tower long enough to become her own mistress again but amys had told her flatly that dreamwalking was dangerous even after you knew what you were about and far more so until then if she would not obey in the waking world they could not trust her to obey in the dream and they would not take the responsibility so she did chores right along with aviendha accepted chastisement with as good a grace as she could muster and hopped whenever amys or melaine or bair said frog in a manner of speaking none of them had ever seen a frog not that theyll want anything but for me to hand them their tea no it would be aviendhas turn to do that tonight for a moment she considered donning stockings but finally just bent to slip on her shoes sturdy shoes suitable for the waste she rather regretted the silk slippers she had worn in tear what is your name she asked trying to be companionable cowinde was the docile replyegwene sighed she kept trying to be friends with the gaishain but they never responded servants were one thing she had not had a chance to get used to though of course gaishain were not precisely servants you were a maidena quick fierce flash of deep blue eyes told her that her guess was correct but just as quickly they lowered again i am gaishain before and after are not now and only now exists what is your sept and clan usually there was no need to ask not even with gaishain i serve the wise one melaine of the jhirad sept of the goshien aiel trying to choose between two cloaks a stout brown woolen and a blue quilted silk she had purchased from kadere the merchant had sold everything in his wagons to make room for moiraines freight and at very good prices egwene paused to frown at the woman that was no proper response she had heard that a form of the bleakness had taken some gaishain when their year and a day was done they simply refused to put off the robe when is your time up she asked cowinde crouched lower almost huddling over her knees i am gaishain but when will you be able to return to your sept to your own hold i am gaishain the woman hoarsely told the rugs in front of her face if the answer displeases punish me but i can give no other dont be silly egwene said sharply and straighten up you arent a toad the whiterobed woman obeyed immediately and sat there on her heels submissively awaiting another command that brief flare of spirit might as well never have been egwene took a deep breath the woman had made her own accommodation with the bleakness a foolish one but nothing she could say would change it anyway she was supposed to be on her way to the sweat tent not talking with cowinde remembering that cold draft she hesitated the icy gust had made two large white blossoms resting in a shallow bowl curl partway closed they came from a plant called a segade a fat leafless leathery thing that bristled with spines she had come on aviendha looking at them in her hands that morning the aiel woman had given a start when she saw her then pushed them into egwenes hands saying she had picked them for her she supposed there was enough of the maiden left in aviendha that she did not want to admit liking flowers though come to think of it she had seen the occasional maiden wearing a blossom in her hair or on her coat you are just trying to put it off egwene alvere now stop being a silly woolhead you are being as foolish as cowinde lead the way she said and just had time to swing the woolen cloak around her nakedness before the woman swept open the tent flap for her and for the bonechilling night overhead the stars were crisp points in the darkness and the threequarter moon was bright the wise ones camp was a cluster of two dozen low mounds not a hundred paces from where one of rhuideans paved streets ended in hard cracked clay and stones moonshadows turned the city into strange cliffs and crags every tent had its flaps down and the smells of fires and cooking blended to fill the air the other wise ones came here for almost daily gatherings but they spent nights with their own septs several even slept in rhuidean now but not bair this was as close to the city as bair had been willing to come if rand had not been there doubtless she would have insisted on making camp in the mountains egwene held the cloak tight with both hands and walked as fast as she could icy tendrils curled under the cloaks bottom swept in every time her bare legs kicked a gap open cowinde had to pull her white robes to her knees in order to keep ahead egwene did not need the gaishains guidance but since the woman had been sent to bring her she would be shamed and maybe offended if not allowed to clenching her teeth to keep them from chattering egwene wished the woman would run the sweat tent looked like any other low and wide with the flaps lowered all around except that the smoke hole had been covered nearby a fire had burned down to glowing embers scattered over a few rocks the size of a mans head there was not enough light to define the much smaller shadowed mound beside the tent entrance but she knew it was neatly folded womens clothes taking one deep chilling breath she hurriedly scuffed off her shoes let her cloak drop and all but dove into the tent an instant of shuddering cold before the flap fell shut behind her then steamy heat clamped down squeezing out sweat that covered her in an instant sheen while she was still gasping and shaking the three wise ones who were teaching her about dreamwalking sat sweating unconcernedly their waistlength hair hanging damply bair was talking to melaine whose greeneyed beauty and redgold hair made a sharp contrast to the older womans leathery face and long white tresses amys was whitehaired too or perhaps it was just so pale a yellow that it seemed white but she did not look old she and melaine could both channel not many wise ones could and she had something of the aes sedai look of agelessness about her moiraine seeming slight and small beside the others also looked unruffled although sweat rolled down her pale nudity and slicked her dark hair to her scalp with a regal refusal to acknowledge that she had no clothes on the wise ones were using slim curved pieces of bronze called staera to scrape off sweat and the days dirt aviendha was squatting sweatily beside the big black kettle of hot sooty rocks in the middle of the tent carefully using a pair of tongs to move a last stone from a smaller kettle to the larger that done she sprinkled water onto the rocks from a gourd adding to the steam if she let the steam fall too far she would be spoken to sharply at the very least the next time the wise ones met in the sweat tent it would be egwenes turn to tend the rocks egwene cautiously sat down crosslegged next to bair instead of layered rugs there was only rocky ground unpleasantly hot lumpy and damp and realized with a shock that aviendha had been switched and recently when the aiel woman gingerly took her own place beside egwene she did so with a face as stony as the ground but a face that could not hide her flinch this was something egwene did not expect the wise ones exacted a hard discipline harder even than the tower which took some doing but aviendha worked at learning to channel with a grim determination she could not dreamwalk but she surely put as much effort into absorbing every art of a wise one as she could ever have put into learning her weapons as a maiden of course after she confessed to letting rand know about the wise ones watching his dreams they had made her spend three days digging shoulderdeep holes and filling them in again but that was one of the few times aviendha had ever seemed to put a foot wrong amys and the other two had held her up to egwene so often as a model of meek obedience and proper fortitude that sometimes egwene wanted to shriek even if aviendha was a friend you took long enough in coming bair said grumpily while egwene was still gingerly searching for a comfortable seat her voice was thin and reedy but a reed of iron she continued to scrape her arms with a staera i am sorry egwene said there that should be meek enough bair sniffed you are aes sedai beyond the dragonwall but here you are yet a pupil and a pupil does not dally when i send for aviendha or send her for something she runs even if all i want is a pin you could do much worse than to pattern yourself after her flushing egwene tried to make her voice humble i will try bair this was the first time a wise one had made the comparison in front of others she sneaked a glance at aviendha and was surprised to find her looking thoughtful sometimes she wished her nearsister were not always such a good example the girl will learn bair or she will not melaine said irritably instruct her in promptness later if she still needs it no more than ten or twelve years older than aviendha she usually sounded as if she had a burr under her skirts maybe she was sitting on a sharp rock she would not move if she was she would expect the rock to move i tell you again moiraine sedai the aiel follow he who comes with the dawn not the white tower obviously egwene was meant to pick up what they were talking about as they went on it may be amys said in a level voice that the aiel will serve the aes sedai again but that time has not come yet moiraine sedai her scraping barely paused as she eyed the aes sedai calmly it would come egwene knew now that moiraine was aware that some of the wise ones could channel aes sedai would be journeying into the waste to find girls who could be taught and would almost certainly be trying to take any wise one with the ability back to the tower too once she had worried about the wise ones being browbeaten and dominated hauled away whenever they wanted aes sedai never let any woman who could channel run free of the tower for long she did not worry anymore though the wise ones themselves seemed to amys and melaine could match any aes sedai will for will as they showed every day with moiraine bair could very likely make even siuan sanche jump through hoops and bair could not even channel for that matter bair was not the strongestwilled wise one that honor went to an even older woman sorilea of the jarra sept of the chareen aiel the wise one of shende hold could channel less than most novices but she was as likely to send another wise one on an errand as a gaishain and they went no there was no reason to distress herself over wise ones being bullied it is understandable that you wish to spare your lands bair put in but rand althor obviously does not mean to lead us to punish no one who submits to he who comes with the dawn and the aiel will be harmed so that was it of course it is not only sparing lives or lands that concerns me moiraine made wiping sweat from her brow with one finger into a queenly gesture but her voice sounded nearly as tight as melaines if you allow this it will be disastrous years of planning are coming to fruition and he means to ruin it all plans of the white tower amys said so smoothly she might have been agreeing those plans have nothing to do with us we and the other wise ones must consider what is right for the aiel we will see that the aiel do what is best for the aiel egwene wondered what the clan chiefs would say about that of course they frequently complained that the wise ones meddled in matters that were not theirs so perhaps it would not come as a surprise the chiefs all seemed to be hardwilled intelligent men but she believed they had as much chance against the combined wise ones as the village council back home did against the womens circle this time though moiraine was right if rand she began but bair stepped on her firmly we will hear what you have to say later girl your knowledge of rand althor is valuable but you will hold your peace and listen until you are bidden to speak and stop looking sullen or i will dose you with bluespine tea egwene grimaced respect for the aes sedai though a respect between equals included but little for the pupil even one they believed was aes sedai she kept her tongue still in any case bair was capable of sending her to fetch her herb pouches and telling her to brew the incredibly bitter tea herself it had no purpose at all except to cure sullenness or sulkiness or whatever else a wise one might find disfavor with which it did by taste alone aviendha gave her a comforting pat on the arm you believe it will not be a catastrophe for the aiel as well it must have been difficult to sound as cool as a winter stream when you glistened from head to foot with condensed steam and your own sweat but moiraine apparently had no difficulty it will be the aiel war all over again you will kill and burn and loot towns as you did then until you have turned every man and woman against you the fifth is our due aes sedai melaine said throwing her long hair back over her shoulder so she could work a staera across a smooth shoulder even heavy and damp with the steam her hair glistened like silk we took no more even from the treekillers her glance at moiraine was too bland not to be significant they knew she was cairhienin your kings and queens take as much in their taxes and when the nations turn against you moiraine persisted in the aiel war the nations united turned you back that can and will happen again with great loss of life on both sides none of us fears death aes sedai amys told her smiling gently as if explaining something to a child life is a dream from which we all must wake before we can dream again besides only four clans crossed the dragonwall under janduin six are here already and you say rand althor means to take all of the clans the prophecy of rhuidean says he will break us the spark in melaines green eyes could have been for moiraine or because she was not as resigned as she sounded what does it matter whether it is here or beyond the dragonwall you will lose him the support of every nation west of the dragonwall moiraine said she looked as calm as ever but an edge in her voice said she was ready to chew rocks he must have their support he has the support of the aiel nation bair told her in that fragile unyielding voice she emphasized her words by gesturing with the slim metal blade the clans have never been a nation but now he makes us one we will not help you turn him in this moiraine sedai amys added just as firmly you may leave us now aes sedai if it pleases you bair said we have discussed what you wished to discuss as much as we will tonight it was politely said but a dismissal all the same i will leave you moiraine replied once again all serenity she sounded as though it were her suggestion her decision by this time she was used to the wise ones making it clear they were not under the towers authority i have other matters to see to that much had to be the truth of course very likely something concerning rand egwene knew better than to ask if moiraine wanted her to know she would tell her and if not if not she would be handed some slippery bit of aes sedai avoidance of a lie or else be told bluntly that it was none of her business moiraine knew that egwene sedai of the green ajah was a fraud she tolerated the lie in public but otherwise she let egwene know her proper place whenever it suited her as soon as moiraine had gone in a burst of cold air amys said aviendha pour the tea the young aiel woman gave a startled jerk and her mouth opened twice before she said faintly i must brew it yet with that she scurried out of the tent on all fours the second blast from outside dimmed the steam the wise ones exchanged looks that were almost as surprised as aviendhas and egwenes aviendha always did even the most onerous chores efficiently if not always with a good grace something must be troubling her greatly to make her forget a thing like making tea the wise ones always wanted tea more steam girl melaine said that was her egwene realized with aviendha gone hurriedly splashing more water on the rocks she channeled to heat the stones further and the kettle until she heard stones cracking and the kettle itself radiated heat like a furnace the aiel might be used to leaping from roasting in their own juices to freezing but she was not hot thick clouds rolled up to fill the tent amys nodded approvingly she and melaine could see the glow of saidar surrounding her of course though she herself could not melaine merely went on scraping with her staera letting go of the true source she sat back and leaned close to bair to whisper has aviendha done something very wrong she did not know how aviendha would feel about it but she saw no reason to embarrass her even behind her back bair had no such compunctions you mean her stripes she said in a normal voice she came to me and said she had lied twice today though she would not say to whom or about what it was her own affair of course so long as she did not lie to a wise one but she claimed her honor required that a toh must be met she asked you to egwene gasped but could not finish bair nodded as if it were not very much out of the ordinary at all i gave her a few extra for troubling me with it if ji was involved her obligation is not to me very likely her socalled lies were nothing anyone but a far dareis mai would worry about maidens even former maidens are sometimes as fussy as men amys gave her a flat look that was plain even in the thick steam like aviendha amys had been far dareis mai before becoming a wise one egwene had never met an aiel who was not fussy about jietoh the way she saw it but this aiel were all mad as loons apparently bair had already put the matter out of her mind there are more lost ones in the threefold land than i can ever remember before she said to the tent at large that was what the aiel had always called the tinkers the tuathaan they flee the troubles beyond the dragonwall the sneer in melaines voice was clear i have heard amys said slowly that some of those who run after the bleakness have gone to the lost ones and asked to be taken in a long silence followed they knew now that the tuathaan had the same descent as themselves that they had broken away before the aiel crossed the spine of the world into the waste but if anything the knowledge had only deepened their aversion he brings change melaine whispered harshly into the steam i thought you were reconciled to the changes he brings egwene said sympathy welling up in her voice it must be very hard to have your whole life stood on end she halfexpected to be told to hold her tongue again but no one did reconciled bair said as though tasting the word better to say we endure them as best we can he transforms everything amys sounded troubled rhuidean the lost ones the bleakness and telling what should not have been told the wise ones all the aiel for that matter still had difficulty speaking of that the maidens cluster about him as though they owe more to him than to their own clans bair added for the first time ever they have allowed a man beneath a roof of the maidens for a moment amys looked about to say something but whatever she knew about the inner workings of far dareis mai she shared with no one but those who were or had been maidens of the spear the chiefs no longer listen to us as they did melaine muttered oh they ask our advice as always they have not become complete fools but bael will no longer tell me what he has said to rand althor or rand althor to him he says i must ask rand althor who tells me to ask bael the caracarn i can do nothing about but bael he has always been a stubborn infuriating man yet now he is beyond all bounds sometimes i want to thump his head with a stick amys and bair chuckled as if that were a fine joke or perhaps they just wanted to laugh to forget the changes for a time there are only three things you can do with a man like that bair chortled stay away from him kill him or marry him melaine stiffened her sundark face going red for a moment egwene thought the goldenhaired wise one was about to let fly words hotter than her face then a biting gust announced aviendhas return carrying a worked silver tray holding a yellowglazed teapot delicate cups of golden sea folk porcelain and a stone jar of honey she shivered as she poured no doubt she had not bothered to wrap anything around herself out there and hurriedly passed around the cups and the honey she did not fill cups for herself and egwene until amys told her she could of course more steam melaine said the chill air seemed to have cooled her temper aviendha set down her cup untouched and scrambled for the gourd plainly trying to make up for her lapse with the tea egwene amys said sipping her tea how would rand althor take it if aviendha asked to sleep in his sleeping chamber aviendha froze with the gourd in her hands in his egwene gasped you cannot ask her to do such a thing you cannot fool girl bair muttered we do not ask her to share his blankets but will he think that is what she asks will he even allow it men are strange creatures at the best and he was not raised among us so he is stranger still he certainly would not think any such thing egwene spluttered then more slowly i dont think he would but it isnt proper it just isnt i ask that you not require this of me aviendha said sounding more humble than egwene would have believed she could she was sprinkling water in jerky motions sending up increasing clouds of steam i have been learning a great deal the past days not having to spend time with him since you have allowed egwene and moiraine sedai to help me with channeling i learn even faster not that they teach any better than you of course she added hastily but i want very much to learn you will still learn melaine told her you will not have to stay every hour with him as long as you apply yourself your lessons will not be much slowed you do not study while you sleep i cannot aviendha mumbled head down over the water gourd more loudly and more firmly she added i will not her head came up and her eyes were bluegreen fire i will not be there when he summons that flipskirt isendre to his blankets again egwene gaped at her isendre she had seen and heartily disapproved of the scandalous way the maidens kept the woman naked but this you cant really mean he be silent bair snapped like a whip her blueeyed stare could have chipped stone both of you you are both young but even the maidens should know men can be fools especially when they are not attached to a woman who can guide them i am glad amys said dryly to see you no longer hold your emotions so tightly aviendha maidens are as foolish as men when it comes to that i remember it well and it embarrasses me still letting emotions go clouds judgment for a moment but holding them in clouds it always just be sure you do not release them too often or when it is best to keep control of them melaine leaned forward on her hands until it seemed the sweat dripping from her face must fall on the hot kettle you know your fate aviendha you will be a wise one of great strength and great authority and more besides you already have a strength in you it saw you through your first test and it will see you through this my honor aviendha said hoarsely then swallowed unable to go on she crouched there huddling around the gourd as if it contained the honor she wanted to protect the pattern does not see jietoh bair told her with only a hint of sympathy if that only what must and will be men and maidens struggle against fate even when it is clear the pattern weaves on despite their struggles but you are no longer far dareis mai you must learn to ride fate only by surrendering to the pattern can you begin to have some control over the course of your own life if you fight the pattern will still force you and you will find only misery where you might have found contentment instead to egwene that sounded very much like what she had been taught concerning the one power to control saidar you first had to surrender to it fight and it would come wildly or overwhelm you surrender and guide it gently and it did as you wished but that did not explain why they wanted aviendha to do this thing she asked as much adding again it is not proper instead of answering amys said will rand althor refuse to allow her we cannot force him bair and melaine were looking at egwene as intently as amys they were not going to tell her why it was easier to make a stone talk than to get something out of a wise one against her will aviendha was studying her toes in sulky resignation she knew the wise ones would get what they wanted one way or another i dont know egwene said slowly i do not know him as well as i used to she regretted that but so much had happened quite aside from her realizing that she did not love him as more than a brother her training in the tower as well as here had changed things just as much as him being who he had become if you give him a good reason perhaps i think he likes aviendha the young aiel woman heaved a heavy sigh without looking up a good reason bair snorted when i was a girl any man would have been overjoyed to have a young woman show that much interest in him he would have gone to pick the flowers for her bridal wreath himself aviendha started and glared at the wise ones with some of her old spirit well we will find a reason even someone raised in the wetlands can accept it is several nights before your agreed meeting in telaranrhiod amys said with nynaeve this time that one could learn much bair put in if she were not so stubborn your nights are free until then melaine said that is unless you have been entering telaranrhiod without us egwene suspected what was coming of course not she told them it had only been a little any more than a little and they would find out for sure have you succeeded in finding either nynaeves or elaynes dreams amys asked casually as if it were nothing no amys finding someone elses dreams was a lot harder than stepping into telaranrhiod the world of dreams especially if they were any distance away it was easier both the closer they were and the better you knew them the wise ones still demanded that she not enter telaranrhiod without at least one of them along but someone elses dream was maybe just as dangerous in its own way in telaranrhiod she was in control of herself and of things around her to a large degree unless one of the wise ones decided to take over her command of telaranrhiod was increasing but she still could not match any of them with their long experience in anothers dream though you were a part of that dream it took all you could muster not to behave as the dreamer wanted be as their dream took you and still sometimes it did not work the wise ones had been very careful when watching rands dreams never to enter fully even so they insisted she learn if they were to teach dreamwalking they meant to teach all that they knew of it she was not reluctant exactly but the few times they had let her practice with themselves and once with rhuarc had been chastening experiences the wise ones had some considerable mastery over their own dreams so what had happened there to show her the dangers they said had all been their doing but it had been a shock to learn that rhuarc saw her as a little more than a child like his youngest daughters and her own control had wavered for one fatal moment after that she had been little more than a child she still could not look at the man without remembering being given a doll for studying hard and being as pleased with the gift as with his approval amys had had to come and take her away from happy play with it amys knowing was bad enough but she suspected that rhuarc remembered some of it too you must keep trying amys said you have the strength to reach them even as far as they are and it will do you no harm to learn how they see you she was not so sure of that herself elayne was a friend but nynaeve had been wisdom of emonds field for most of her growing up she suspected nynaeves dreams would be worse than rhuarcs tonight i will sleep away from the tents amys went on not far you should be able to find me easily if you try if i do not dream of you we will speak of it in the morning egwene suppressed a groan amys had guided her to rhuarcs dreams she herself had remained only an instant barely long enough to reveal that rhuarc still saw her unchanged as the young woman he had married and the wise ones had always been in the same tent before when she tried well bair said rubbing her hands we have heard what needed to be heard the rest of you can remain if you wish but i feel clean enough to go to my blankets i am not so young as the rest of you young or not she could probably run any of them into the ground then carry them the rest of the way as bair was getting to her feet melaine spoke and strangely for her she was hesitant i need i must ask your help bair and you amys the older woman settled back and both she and amys looked at melaine expectantly i would ask you to approach dorindha for me the last words came out in a rush amys smiled widely and bair cackled aloud aviendha seemed to understand too and be startled but egwene was lost then bair laughed you always said you did not need a husband and did not want one i have buried three and would not mind another they are very useful when the night is cold a woman can change her mind melaines voice was firm enough but belied by the deep flush in her cheeks i cannot stay away from bael and i cannot kill him if dorindha will accept me as her sisterwife i will make my bridal wreath to lay at baels feet what if he steps on it instead of picking it up bair wanted to know amys fell back laughing and slapping her thighs egwene did not think there was much danger of that not the way aiel customs ran if dorindha decided she wanted melaine for sisterwife bael would not have much say in the matter it no longer shocked her precisely that a man could have two wives not exactly different lands mean different customs she reminded herself firmly she had never been able to bring herself to ask but for all she knew there might be aiel women with two husbands they were very strange people i ask you to act as my firstsisters in this i think that dorindha likes me well enough as soon as melaine spoke those words the other womens hilarity changed to something else they still laughed but they hugged her and told her how happy they were for her and how well she would do with bael amys and bair at least took dorindhas acceptance for granted the three of them departed all but arminarm still laughing and giggling like girls not before telling egwene and aviendha to straighten the tent though egwene could a woman of your land accept a sisterwife aviendha asked using a stick to push the cover off the smoke hole egwene wished she had left that duty till last the heat began to dissipate immediately i dont know she said quickly gathering the cups and the honey jar the staera went onto the tray too i dont think so maybe if it was a close friend she added hurriedly there was no point in seeming to denigrate aiel ways aviendha only grunted and began pushing up the side flaps teeth chattering as loudly as the rattle of teacups and bronze blades on the tray egwene scurried outside the wise ones were dressing unhurriedly as though this were a balmy night and they in sleeping chambers in some hold a whiterobed figure pale in the moonlight took the tray from her and she quickly began searching for her cloak and shoes they were nowhere among the remaining garments on the ground i had your things taken to your tent bair said tying the laces of her blouse you will not need them yet egwenes stomach sank into her feet hopping in place she flapped her arms in a futile effort for warmth at least they did not tell her to stop abruptly she realized the snowyrobed figure bearing the tray away was too tall for even an aiel woman gritting her teeth she glared at the wise ones who seemed not to care if she froze to death jumping up and down to the aiel women it might not matter that a man had seen them with no clothes on at least if he was gaishain but it did to her in a moment aviendha joined them and seeing her leaping about merely stood there without any effort to find her own garments she showed no more effect of the cold than the wise ones now bair said settling her shawl on her shoulders you aviendha are not only stubborn as a man you cannot remember a simple task you have done many times you egwene are just as stubborn and you still think you can linger in your tent when you are summoned let us hope running fifty times around the camp will temper your stubbornness clear your minds and remind you of how to answer a summons or do a chore off with you without a word aviendha immediately began loping toward the edge of the camp easily dodging dark shrouded tent ropes egwene hesitated only a moment before following the aiel woman kept her pace down so she could catch up the night air froze her and the cracked stony clay underfoot was just as cold and tried to catch her toes besides aviendha ran with effortless ease as they reached the last tent and turned southward aviendha said do you know why i study so hard neither the cold nor running had made an impression on her voice egwene was shivering so hard she could barely speak no why because bair and the others always point to you and tell me how easily you learn how you never have to have something explained twice they say i ought to be more like you she gave egwene a sidelong glance and egwene found herself sharing a giggle as they ran that is part of the reason the things i am learning to do aviendha shook her head wonderment plain even by moonlight and the power itself i have never felt like that so alive i can smell the faintest scent feel the slightest stir in the air it is dangerous to hold on too long or too much egwene said running did seem to warm her a little though now and again a shudder ran through her ive told you that and i know the wise ones have too aviendha merely sniffed do you think i would stab my own foot with a spear for a time they ran in silence did rand really egwene said finally the cold had nothing to do with her difficulty getting the words out in fact she was beginning to sweat again i mean isendre she could not make herself say it clearer than thatat last aviendha said slowly i do not think that he did she sounded angry but why would she ignore switchings if he has shown no interest in her she is a milkhearted wetlander who waits for men to come to her i saw how he looked at her though he tried to hide it he enjoyed looking at her egwene wondered if her friend ever thought of her as a milkhearted wetlander probably not or they would not be friends but aviendha had never learned to worry if what she said might hurt someone she would probably be surprised to learn that egwene could even think of being hurt the way the maidens make her dress egwene admitted reluctantly any man would look reminded that she herself was in the open without any clothes she stumbled and almost fell as she looked around anxiously the night was empty as far as she could make out even the wise ones were already back in their tents warm in their blankets she was sweating but the beads seemed to want to freeze as soon as they appeared he belongs to elayne aviendha said fiercely i admit i dont know your customs fully but ours are not the same as yours he is not betrothed to elayne why am i defending him hes the one who ought to be switched but honesty made her go on even your aiel men have the right to say no if theyre asked you and she are nearsisters as you and i are aviendha protested slowing a step before picking it up again did you not ask me to look after him for her do you not want her to have him of course i do if he wants her that was not exactly true she wanted elayne to have what happiness she could in love with the dragon reborn as she was and she would do everything short of tying rand hand and foot to see that elayne got what she wanted maybe not far short at that if need be admitting it was another thing aiel women were far more forward than she could ever make herself be it would not be right otherwise he belongs to her aviendha said determinedly egwene sighed aviendha simply did not want to understand any customs but her own the aiel woman was still shocked that elayne would not ask rand to marry her that a man could ask that question im sure the wise ones will listen to reason tomorrow they cant make you sleep in a mans bedchamber the other woman looked at her in clear surprise for a moment her grace left her and she stubbed a toe on the uneven ground the mishap brought a few curses that would have made even kaderes wagon drivers listen with interest and made bair reach for the bluespine but she did not stop running i do not understand why that upsets you so she said when the last curse died i have slept next to a man many times on raids even sharing blankets for warmth if the night was very cold but it disturbs you that i will sleep within ten feet of him is this part of your customs i have noticed you will not bathe in the sweat tent with men do you not trust rand althor or is it me you do not trust her voice had sunk to a concerned whisper by the end of course i trust you egwene protested heatedly and him its just that she trailed off uncertain how to go on aiel notions of propriety were sometimes stricter than what she had grown up with but in other ways they would have had the womens circle back home trying to decide whether to faint or reach for a stout stick aviendha if your honor is involved somehow this was touchy ground surely if you explain to the wise ones they will not make you go against your honor there is nothing to explain the other woman said flatly i know i dont understand jietoh egwene began and aviendha laughed you say you do not understand aes sedai yet you show that you live by it egwene regretted maintaining that lie with her it had been hard work to get aviendha to call her simply egwene and sometimes she slipped back but it had to be kept with everyone if it was to hold with anyone you are aes sedai and strong enough in the power to overcome amys and melaine together aviendha continued but you said that you would obey so you scrub pots when they say scrub pots and you run when they say run you may not know jietoh but you follow it it was not the same thing at all of course she gritted her teeth and did as she was told because that was the only way to learn dreamwalking and she wanted to learn to learn everything more than anything else she could imagine to even think that she could live by this foolish jietoh was simply silly she did what she had to do and only when and because she had to they were coming back to where they had begun as her foot hit the spot egwene said thats one and ran on through the darkness with no one to see but aviendha no one to say whether she went back to her tent right then aviendha would not have told but it never occurred to egwene to stop short of the fifty chapter crescent moon and stars gateways rand woke in total darkness and lay there beneath his blankets trying to think of what had wakened him it had been something not the dream he had been teaching aviendha how to swim in a pond in the waterwood back home in the two rivers something else then it came again like a faint whiff of a foul miasma creeping under the door not a smell at all really a sense of otherness but that was how it felt rank like something dead a week in stagnant water it faded again but not all the way this time tossing aside his blankets he stood up wrapping himself in saidin inside the void filled with the power he could feel his body shiver but the cold seemed in another place from where he was cautiously he pulled open the door and stepped out arched windows at either end of the corridor let in falls of moonlight after the pitch black of his room it was nearly like day nothing moved but he could feel something coming closer something evil it felt like the taint that roared through him on the power one hand went to his coat pocket to the small carved figure of a round little man holding a sword across his knees an angreal with that he could channel more of the power than even he could safely handle unaided he thought it would not be necessary whoever had sent this attack against him did not know who they were dealing with now they should never have let him wake for a moment he hesitated he could take the fight to whatever had been sent against him but he thought it was still below him down where the maidens were still sleeping by the silence with luck it would not bother them unless he rushed down to battle it in their midst that would surely wake them and they would not stand by and watch lan said that you should choose your ground if you could and make your enemy come to you smiling he raced the thud of his boots up the nearest curving stairway on upward until he reached the top floor the highest level of the building was one large chamber with a slightly domed ceiling and scattered thin columns fluted in spirals glassless arched windows all around flooded every corner with moonlight the dust and grit and sand on the floor still faintly showed his own footprints from the one time he had come up here and no other mark it was perfect striding to the center of the room he planted himself atop the mosaic there the ancient symbol of the aes sedai ten feet across it was an apt place under this sign will he conquer that was what the prophecy of rhuidean said of him he stood straddling the sinuous dividing line one boot on the black teardrop that was now called the dragons fang and used to represent evil the other on the white now called the flame of tar valon some men said it stood for the light an appropriate place to meet this attack between light and darkness the fetid feel grew stronger and a burned sulfur smell filled the air suddenly things moved slinking away from the stairs like moonshadows along the outside of the room slowly they resolved into three black dogs darker than night and big as ponies eyes shining silver they circled him warily with the power in him he could hear their hearts beat like deep drums pounding he could not hear them breathe though perhaps they did not he channeled and a sword was in his hands its slightly curving heronmarked blade seeming hammered out of fire he had expected myrddraal or something even worse than the eyeless but for dogs even shadowspawn dogs the sword would be enough whoever had sent them did not know him lan said he had very nearly reached the level of a blademaster now and the warder was sparing enough with praise to make him think he might have passed onto that level already with snarls like bones being ground to dust the dogs hurtled at him from three sides faster than galloping horses he did not move until they were almost on him then he flowed one with the sword move to move as though dancing in the blink of an eye the sword form called whirlwind on the mountain became the wind blows over the wall became unfolding the fan great black heads flew apart from black bodies their dripping teeth like burnished steel still bared as they bounced across the floor he was already stepping from the mosaic as the dark forms collapsed in twitching bleeding heaps laughing to himself he let the sword go though he held on to saidin to the raging power the sweetness and the taint contempt slid along the outside of the void dogs shadowspawn certainly but still just laughter died slowly the dead dogs and their heads were melting settling into pools of liquid shadow that quivered slightly as if alive their blood fanned across the floor trembled suddenly the smaller pools flowed across the floor in viscous streams to merge with the larger which oozed away from the mosaic to mound higher and higher until the three huge black dogs stood there once more slavering and snarling as they gathered massive haunches under them he did not know why he felt surprise dim outside the emptiness dogs yes but shadowspawn whoever had sent them had not been as careless as he had thought but they still did not know him instead of reaching for the sword again he channeled as he remembered doing once long ago howling the huge dogs leaped and a thick shaft of white light shot from his hands like molten steel like liquid fire he swept it across the springing creatures for an instant they became strange shadows of themselves all colors reversed and then they were made of sparkling motes that broke apart smaller and smaller until there was nothing he let go of the thing he had made with a grim smile a purple bar of light still seemed to cross his vision in afterimage across the great chamber a piece of one of the columns crashed to the floor tiles where that bar of light or whatever it had been not light exactly had swung neat slices were gone from the columns a gaping swath cut half the width of the wall behind them did any of them bite you or bleed on you he spun at the sound of moiraines voice absorbed in what he had done he had not heard her come up the stairs she stood clutching her skirts with both hands peering at him face lost in moonshadow she would have sensed the things the same way he did but to be here so quickly she must have run the maidens let you pass have you become far dareis mai moiraine they grant me some privileges of a wise one she said in a rush impatience raw in her usually melodious voice i told the guards i had to speak with you urgently now answer me did the darkhounds bite you or bleed on you did their saliva touch you no he answered slowly darkhounds the little he knew he had gotten from old stories the sort used to frighten children in the southlands some grownups believed too why should a bite worry you you could heal it does this mean the dark one is free enclosed in the void as he was even fear was distant the tales he had heard said the darkhounds ran the night in the wild hunt with the dark one himself the hunter they left no print on even the softest dirt only on stone and they would not stop until you faced and defeated them or put running water between you crossroads were supposed to be particularly dangerous places to meet them and the time just after sunset or just before sunrise he had seen enough old stories walking by now to believe that any of it could be true no not that rand she seemed to be regaining her selfcontrol her voice was silver chimes again calm and cool they are only another kind of shadowspawn something that should never have been made but their bite is death as surely as a dagger in the heart and i do not think i could have healed such a wound before it killed you their blood even their saliva is poison a drop on the skin can kill slowly with great pain at the end you are lucky there were only three unless you killed more before i arrived their packs are usually larger as many as ten or twelve or so say the scraps left from the war of the shadow larger packs he was not the only target in rhuidean for one of the forsaken we must speak of what you used to kill them moiraine began but he was already running as hard as he could ignoring her cries to know where he was going and why down flights of stairs through darkened corridors where sleepy maidens roused by the pounding boots peered at him in consternation from moonlit rooms through the front doors where lan stood restlessly with the two women on guard his colorshifting warders cloak about his shoulders making parts of him seem to blend into the night where is moiraine he shouted as rand dashed by but rand leaped down the broad steps two at a time without replying the halfhealed wound in his side clenched like a fist pain he was only vaguely aware of inside the void by the time he reached the building he sought it stood at the very edge of rhuidean far from the plaza as far from the camp moiraine shared with the wise ones as it was possible to be and remain in the city the upper floors had collapsed in a mound of rubble that fanned out onto the cracked earth beyond the pavement only the bottom two floors remained whole refusing his bodys efforts to hunch over around the pain he went in still at a dead run once the great antechamber encircled by a stone balcony had been tall now it was taller open to the night sky its pale stone floor strewn with rubble from the collapse in the moonshadows beneath the balcony three darkhounds were up on their hind legs clawing and chewing at a bronzeclad door that shivered under their assault the smell of burned sulfur hung strong in the air remembering what had happened before rand darted to one side as he channeled the shaft of liquid white fire streaking by the door as it destroyed the shadowspawn he had tried to make it less this time to confine the destruction to the darkhounds but the thick wall at the far end of the chamber had a shadowed hole in it not all the way through he thought it was hard to tell by moonlight but he would have to fine his control of this weapon the bronze sheathing on the door was tattered and torn as though the teeth and toenails of the darkhounds really had been steel lamplight shone through a number of small holes there were pawprints in the floorstones but surprisingly few releasing saidin he found a place where he would not cut his hand to shreds and pounded on the door suddenly the pain in his side was very real and present he took a deep breath and tried to thrust it away mat its me rand open up mat after a moment the door opened a crack letting out a spill of lamplight mat peered through doubtfully then pulled the door wider leaning against it as if he had run ten miles carrying a sack of rocks except for a silver foxhead medallion hanging around his neck its eye shaped and shaded like the ancient aes sedai symbol he was naked the way mat felt about aes sedai rand was surprised he had not sold the thing long since deeper in the room a tall goldenhaired woman was calmly wrapping a blanket around herself a maiden by the spears and buckler lying at her feet rand hastily averted his eyes and cleared his throat i just wanted to make sure you were all right were fine uneasily mat looked around the antechamber now we are you killed it or something i dont want to know what it was as long as its gone its bloody hard on a man sometimes being your friend not only a friend another taveren and perhaps a key to victory in tarmon gaidon anyone who wanted to strike at rand had reason to strike at mat as well but mat always tried to deny both things theyre gone mat darkhounds three of them i told you i didnt want to know mat groaned darkhounds now i cant say it isnt always something new around you a man wouldnt get bored not until the day he died if i hadnt been on my feet for a drink of wine when the door started to open he trailed off shivering and scratched a red place on his right arm as he studied the ravaged metal sheathing you know its funny how the mind plays tricks when i was putting everything i had into holding this door shut i could have sworn one of them had chewed a hole right through it i could see its bloody head and its teeth melindhras spear didnt even faze it moiraines arrival was more spectacular this time running in skirts held up panting and fuming lan was at her heels with his sword in hand and thunderclouds on his stone face and right behind a throng of far dareis mai that spilled out into the street some of the maidens wore no more than smallclothes but every one held her spears alertly and had her shoufa wrapped around her head black veil hiding all but her eyes ready to kill moiraine and lan at least looked relieved to see him standing there calmly talking to mat though the aes sedai also looked as if she meant to have strong words with him with the veils it was impossible to tell what the aiel thought letting out a loud yelp mat darted back into his room and began hastily tugging on a pair of breeches his capering impeded by the way he kept trying to haul at the breeches and scratch his arm at the same time the goldenhaired maiden watched with a broad grin that threatened to break into laughter whats the matter with your arm rand asked i told you the mind plays funny tricks mat said still trying to scratch and pull at the same time when i thought that thing chewed through the door i thought it slobbered all over my arm too and now it bloody itches like fire even looks like a burn there rand opened his mouth but moiraine was already pushing past him staring at her mat fell down while frantically dragging his breeches on the rest of the way but she knelt beside him ignoring his protests clasping his head in her hands rand had been healed before and seen it done but instead of what he expected mat only gave a shiver and lifted up the medallion by its leather thong so that it hung against his hand bloody thing is colder than ice all of a sudden he muttered what are you doing moiraine if you want to do something heal this itch it has my whole arm now his right arm was red from wrist to shoulder and had begun to look puffy moiraine stared at him with the most startled expression rand had ever seen on her face maybe the only one i will she said slowly if the medallion is cold take it off mat frowned at her then finally pulled it over his head and laid it beside him she took his head again and he gave a shout as if he had been ducked headfirst into ice his legs stiffened and his back arched his eyes stared at nothing as wide as they would go when moiraine took her hands away he slumped gulping air the redness and swelling were gone it took three tries before he could speak blood and does it have to be that flaming way every flaming time it was just a bloody itch you watch your tongue with me moiraine told him getting up or i will find nynaeve and put her in charge of you but her heart was not in it she could have been talking in her sleep she was trying not to stare at the foxhead as mat hung it back around his neck you will need rest she said absently stay in bed tomorrow if you feel like it the maiden in the blanket melindhra knelt behind mat and put her hands on his shoulders looking up at moiraine over his head i will see that he does as you say aes sedai with a sudden grin she ruffled his hair he is my little mischief maker now from the horrified look on mats face he was gathering his strength to run rand became aware of soft amused chuckles behind him the maidens shoufas and veils around their shoulders now had crowded around and were peering into the room teach him to sing spearsister adelin said and the other maidens crowed with laughter rand rounded on them firmly let the man rest dont some of you have to put on clothes they gave way reluctantly still trying to peer into the room until moiraine came out will you leave us please the aes sedai said as the mangled door banged shut behind her she half looked back with a vexed tightening of her mouth i must speak with rand althor alone nodding the aiel women started for the door some still jesting about whether melindhra a shaido it seemed rand wondered if mat knew that would teach mat to sing whatever that meant rand stopped adelin with a hand on her bare arm others who noticed stopped as well so he spoke to them all if you will not go when i tell you to what will you do if i have to use you in battle he did not intend to if he could help it he knew they were fierce warriors but he had been raised to believe it was a mans place to die if necessary before a woman had to logic might say it was foolish especially with women like this but that was how he felt he knew better than to tell them that however will you think it a joke or decide to go in your own good time they looked at him with the consternation of those listening to someone who had revealed his ignorance of the simplest facts in the dance of spears adelin told him we will go as you direct but this is not the dance besides you did not tell us to go even the caracarn is not a wetlander king a grayhaired maiden added sinewy and hard despite her age she wore only a short shift and her shoufa he was getting tired of that phrase the maidens resumed their joking as they left him alone with moiraine and lan the warder had finally put up his sword and looked as at ease as he ever did which was to say as still and calm as his face all stony planes and angles in the moonlight and with an air of being on the brink of sudden movement that made the aiel appear placid in comparison a braided leather cord held lans hair graying at the temples back from his face his gaze could have come from a blueeyed hawk i must speak with you about moiraine began we can talk tomorrow rand said cutting her off lans face hardened further if such was possible warders were far more protective of their aes sedai of their position as well as their persons than they were of themselves rand ignored lan his side still wanted to hunch him over but he managed to keep erect he was not about to show her any weakness if you think ill help you get that foxhead away from mat you can think again somehow that medallion had stopped her channeling or at least it had stopped her channeling from affecting mat while he touched it he paid a hard price for it moiraine and it is his thinking of how she had thumped his shoulders with the power he added dryly maybe ill ask if i can borrow it from him he turned away from her there was still one he had to check on though one way or another the urgency was gone the darkhounds would have done what they intended by now please rand moiraine said and the open pleading in her voice halted him in his tracks he had never heard anything like that from her before the tone seemed to offend lan i thought you had become a man the warder said harshly is this how a man behaves you act like an arrogant boy lan practiced the sword with him and liked him rand thought but if moiraine said the right word the warder would do his best to kill him i will not be with you forever moiraine said urgently her hands gripped her skirts so hard that they trembled i might die in the next attack i could fall from my horse and break my neck or take a darkfriends arrow through my heart and death cannot be healed i have given my entire life to the search for you to find you and help you you still do not know your own strength you cannot know half of what you do i apologize most humbly for any offense i have given you those words words he had never thought to hear from her came out as if dragged but they came and she could not lie let me help you as much as i can while i can please its hard to trust you moiraine he disregarded lan shifting in the moonlight his attention was all on her you have handled me like a puppet made me dance the way you wanted from the day we met the only times ive been free of you were either when you were far away or when i ignored you and you make even that hard her laugh was as silvery as the moon above but bitterness tinged it it has been more like wrestling with a bear than pulling strings on a puppet do you want an oath not to try manipulating you i give it her voice hardened to crystal i even swear to obey you like one of the maidens like one of the gaishain if you require but you must taking a deep breath she began again more softly i ask you humbly to allow me to help you lan was staring at her and rand thought his own eyes must be popping out of his head i will accept your help he said slowly and i apologize too for all the rudeness ive shown he had the feeling he was still being manipulated he had had good cause to be rude when he was but she could not lie tension drained from her visibly she stepped closer to look up at him what you used to kill the darkhounds is called balefire i can still sense the residue of it here he could too like the fading smell remaining after a pie was carried out of the room or the memory of something just snatched out of sight since before the breaking of the world the use of balefire has been forbidden the white tower forbids us even to learn it in the war of power the forsaken and the shadowsworn themselves used it only reluctantly forbidden rand said frowning i saw you use it once he could not be sure in the pale light of the moon but he thought color flamed in her cheeks for this once perhaps she was the one off balance sometimes it is necessary to do that which is forbidden if she was flustered it did not show in her voice when anything is destroyed with balefire it ceases to exist before the moment of its destruction like a thread that burns away from where the flame touched it the greater the power of the balefire the further back in time it ceases to exist the strongest i can manage will remove only a few seconds from the pattern you are much stronger very much so but if it doesnt exist before you destroy it rand raked fingers through his hair in confusion you begin to see the problems the dangers mat remembers seeing one of the darkhounds chew through the door but there is no opening now if it had slavered on him as much as he remembers he would have been dead before i could reach him for as far back as you destroyed the creature whatever it did during that time no longer happened only the memories remain for those who saw or experienced it only what it did before is real now a few tooth holes in the door and one drop of saliva on mats arm that sounds just fine to me he told her mats alive because of it it is terrible rand an urgent note entered her voice why do you think even the forsaken feared to use it think of the effect on the pattern of a single thread one man removed from hours or days that have already been woven like one thread picked partly out of a piece of cloth fragments of manuscripts remaining from the war of power say several entire cities were destroyed with balefire before both sides realized the dangers hundreds of thousands of threads pulled from the pattern gone for days already past whatever those people had done now no longer had been done and neither had what others had done because of their actions the memories remained but not the actions the ripples were incalculable the pattern itself nearly unraveled it could have been the destruction of everything world time creation itself rand shivered nothing to do with the cold cutting through his coat i cant promise not to use it again moiraine you yourself said there are times when its necessary to do whats forbidden i did not think that you would she said coolly her agitation was vanishing her balance restored but you must be careful she was back to must again with a saangreal like callandor you could annihilate a city with balefire the pattern could be disrupted for years to come who can say that the weave would even remain centered on you taveren as you are until it settled down being taveren and so strongly so may be your margin of victory even in the last battle perhaps it will he said bleakly in tale after heroic tale the protagonist proclaimed he would have victory or death it seemed that the best he could hope for was victory and death i have to check on someone he went on quietly i will see you in the morning gathering the power into him life and death in swirling layers he made a hole in the air taller than he was opening into blackness that made the moonlight seem day a gateway asmodean called it what is that moiraine gaspedonce ive done something i remember how most of the time that was no answer but it was time to test moiraines vows she could not lie but aes sedai could find loopholes in a stone you are to leave mat alone tonight and you wont try to take that medallion away from him it belongs in the tower for study rand it must be a terangreal but none has ever been found that whatever it is he said firmly it is his you will leave it with him for a moment she seemed to struggle with herself back stiffening and head coming up as she stared at him she could not be used to taking orders from anyone except siuan sanche and rand was willing to wager she had never done that without a tussle finally she nodded and even made the suggestion of a curtsy as you say rand it is his please be careful rand learning a thing like balefire by yourself can be suicide and death cannot be healed this time there was no mockery until the morning lan followed her as she left the warder giving rand an unreadable expression he would not be pleased by this turn of events rand stepped through the gateway and it vanished he was standing on a disc a sixfoot copy of the ancient aes sedai symbol even the black half of it seemed lighter against the endless darkness that surrounded him above and below he was sure that if he fell off he would fall forever asmodean claimed there was a faster method called traveling for using a gateway but he had not been able to teach it partly because he did not have the strength to make a gateway while wearing lanfears shield in any case traveling required that you know your starting point very well it seemed more logical to him that you should have to know where you were heading well but asmodean seemed to think that that was like asking why air was not water there was a great deal that asmodean took for granted anyway skimming was fast enough as soon as he planted his boots on it the disc lurched what seemed to be a foot and stopped another gateway appearing in front of it fast enough especially over this short distance rand stepped into the hallway outside the room where asmodean was the moon through the windows at the ends of the corridor gave the only light asmodeans lamp was out the flows he had woven around the room were still in place still firmly tied nothing moved but there was still a faint smell of burned sulphur moving close to the bead curtain he peered through the doorway moonshadows filled the room but one of them was asmodean tossing in his blankets wrapped in the void rand could hear his heartbeat smell the sweat of troubled dreams he bent to examine the pale blue floor tiles and the prints impressed in them he had learned to track as a boy and reading them was no difficulty three or four darkhounds had been there they had approached the doorway one by one it seemed each stepping almost in the others footprints had the net woven around the room stopped them there or had they merely been sent to look and report troubling to think of even shadowspawn dogs having that much intelligence but then myrddraal used ravens and rats for spies too and other animals closely linked to death shadoweyes the aiel called them channeling fine flows of earth he smoothed out the floor tiles lifting up the compressions until he was out in the empty nightcloaked street and a hundred paces from the tall building in the morning anyone would be able to see the trail ending there but none would suspect that the darkhounds had gone anywhere near asmodean darkhounds could have no interest in jasin natael the gleeman every maiden in the city was likely awake by this time certainly none would still be asleep under the roof of the maidens making another gateway there in the street a deeper blackness against the night he let the disc carry him back to his own room he wondered why he had chosen the ancient symbol it was his choice if unconscious other times it had been a stairstep or a piece of floor the darkhounds had oozed away from that sign before reforming under this sign will he conquer standing in his pitchblack bedchamber he channeled the lamps alight but he did not let go of saidin instead he channeled again careful not to spring any of his own traps and a piece of the wall vanished revealing a niche he had carved there himself in the little alcove stood two figurines a foot tall a man and a woman each in flowing robes and serene of face each holding a crystal globe aloft in one hand he had lied to asmodean about them there were angreal like the round little man in rands coat pocket and saangreal like callandor that increased the amount of the power that could be safely handled as much over angreal as angreal did over channeling unaided both were very rare and prized by aes sedai though they could only recognize those attuned to women and saidar these two figures were something else not so rare but just as highly valued terangreal had been made to use the power not magnify it but to use it in specific ways the aes sedai did not know the intended purpose even of most terangreal they had in the white tower some they used but without knowing whether the use they put them to was anything like the function they had been made for rand knew the function of these two the male figure could link him to a huge replica of itself the most powerful male saangreal ever made even if he were on the other side of the aryth ocean from it it had only been finished after the dark ones prison was resealed how do i know that and hidden before any of the male aes sedai going mad could find it the female figure could do the same for a woman joining her to the female equivalent of the great statue he hoped was still almost completely buried in cairhien with that much power moiraine had said death could not be healed unbidden unwanted memory returned of the nexttolast time he had dared let himself hold callandor images floating beyond the void the body of the darkhaired girl little more than a child lay sprawled with eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling blood blackening the bosom of her dress where a trolloc had run her through the power was in him callandor blazed and he was the power he channeled directing flows into the childs body searching trying fumbling she lurched to her feet arms and legs unnaturally rigid and jerky rand you cannot do this moiraine cried not this breathe she had to breathe the girls chest rose and fell heart had to beat blood already thick and dark oozed from the wound in her chest live burn you his mind howled i didnt mean to be too late her eyes stared at him filmed heedless of all the power in him lifeless tears trickled unheeded down his cheeks he forced the memory away roughly even encased in the void it hurt with this much power with this much power he could not be trusted you are not the creator moiraine had told him as he stood over that child but with that male figure with only half of its power he had made the mountains move once with far less with only callandor he had been sure he could turn back the wheel make a dead child live not only the one power was seductive the power of it was too he should destroy them both instead he rewove the flows reset the traps what are you doing there a womans voice said as the wall became apparently whole again tying off the flows hastily and the knot with its own deadly surprises he pulled the power into him and turned beside lanfear in her white and silver elayne or min or aviendha would look almost ordinary her dark eyes alone were enough to make a man give up his soul at the sight of her his stomach clenched until he wanted to vomit what do you want he demanded once he had blocked egwene and elayne both from the true source but he could not remember how so long as lanfear could touch the source he had more chance of catching the wind in his hands than of holding her prisoner one flash of balefire and he could not do it she was one of the forsaken but the memory of a womans head rolling on the ground stopped him dead you have two of them she said finally i thought i glimpsed one is a woman isnt it her smile could have halted a mans heart and made him grateful you are beginning to consider my plan arent you with those together the other chosen will kneel at our feet we can supplant the great lord himself challenge the creator we you were always ambitious mierin his voice grated in his ears why do you think i turned away from you it wasnt ilyena whatever you like to think you were out of my heart long before ever i met her ambition is all there is to you power is all you ever wanted you disgust me she stared at him both hands pressed hard against her stomach her dark eyes even larger than usual graendal said she began faintly swallowing she began again lews therin i love you lews therin i have always loved you and i always will you know that you must rands face was like rock he hoped it hid his shock he had no idea where his words had come from but it seemed he could remember her a dim memory from before i am not lews therin telamon i am rand althor he said harshly of course you are studying him she nodded slowly to herself that cool composure returned of course asmodean has been telling you things about the war of power and me he lies you did love me until that yellowhaired trollop ilyena stole you for an instant rage made her face a contorted mask he did not think she was even aware of it did you know that asmodean severed his own mother what they call stilling now severed her and let myrddraal drag her away screaming can you trust a man like that rand laughed aloud after i caught him you helped trap him so he had to teach me and now you say i cannot trust him for teaching she sniffed dismissively he will do that because he knows his lot is cast with you for good even if he managed to convince the others that he has been a prisoner they would still tear him apart and he knows it the weakest dog in the pack often suffers that fate besides i watch his dreams on occasion he dreams of you triumphing over the great lord and putting him up beside you on high sometimes he dreams of me her smile said those dreams were pleasant for her but not so for asmodean but he will try to turn you against me why are you here he demanded turn against her no doubt she was full of the power right that moment ready to shield him if she even suspected he meant to try anything she had done it before with humiliating ease i like you like this arrogant and proud full of your own strength once she had said that she liked him unsure that lews therin had been too arrogant why are you here rahvin sent the darkhounds after you tonight she said calmly folding her hands at her waist i would have come sooner to help you but i cannot let the others know i am on your side yet on his side one of the forsaken loved him or rather the man he had been three thousand years ago and all she wanted was for him to give his soul to the shadow and rule the world with her or a step below her at least that and try to replace both the dark one and the creator was she completely mad or could the power of those two huge saangreal really be as great as she claimed that was a direction he did not want his thoughts to take why would rahvin choose now to attack me asmodean says he looks to his own interests that hell sit to one side even in the last battle if he can and wait for the dark one to destroy me why not sammael or demandred asmodean says they hate me not me they hate lews therin but to the forsaken that was the same thing please light i am rand althor he pushed away a sudden memory of this woman in his arms both of them young and just learning what they could do with the power i am rand althor why not semirhage or moghedien or graen but you are impinging on his interests now she laughed dont you know where he is in andor in caemlyn itself he rules there in all but name morgase simpers and dances for him her and half a dozen others her lip curled in disgust he has men scouring town and countryside to find new pretties for him for a moment shock held him elaynes mother in the hands of one of the forsaken yet he dared not show concern lanfear had displayed her jealousy more than once she was capable of hunting elayne down and killing her if she even thought he had feelings for her what do i feel for her aside from that one hard fact floated beyond the void cold and cruel in its truth he would not run off to attack rahvin even if what lanfear said was true forgive me elayne but i cant she might well be lying she would weep no tears for any of the other forsaken he killed they all stood in the way of her own plans but in any event he was done with reacting to what others did if he reacted they could reason out what he would do let them react to him and be as surprised as lanfear and asmodean had been does rahvin think ill rush to defend morgase he said i have seen her once in my life the two rivers is part of andor on a map but i never saw a queens guardsman there no one has in generations tell a two rivers man morgase is his queen and hell probably think youre crazy i doubt rahvin expects you to run to defend your homeland lanfear said wryly but he will expect you to defend your ambitions he means to sit morgase on the sun throne too and use her like a puppet until the time he can come into the open more andoran soldiers move into cairhien every day and you sent tairen soldiers north to secure your own hold on the land no wonder that he attacked you as soon as he found you rand shook his head it had not been that way at all sending the tairens but he did not expect her to understand or believe him if he told her for that matter i thank you for the warning politeness to one of the forsaken of course there was nothing he could do except hope that some of what she told him was truth a good reason not to kill her shell tell you more than she thinks if you listen carefully he hoped that was his own thought chill and cynical as it was you ward your dreams against me against everyone that was simple truth though she was at least as prominent in the list as the wise ones dreams are mine you and your dreams are mine especially her face remained smooth but her voice hardened i can break through your warding you would not like it to show his unconcern he sat down on the foot of his pallet legs folded and hands on his knees he thought his face was as calm as hers inside him the power swelled he had flows of air ready to bind her and flows of spirit that was what wove a shield against the true source the racking of his brain for the how of it seemed far off but he could not remember anyway without that the other was useless she could pick apart or slice through anything he wove even if she could not see it asmodean was trying to teach him that trick but it was hard going without a womans weaving to practice on lanfear eyed him in a disconcerted fashion a slight frown marring her beauty i have examined the aiel womens dreams these socalled wise ones they do not know how to shield themselves very well i could frighten them till they never dream again never even think of invading yours surely i thought you would not help me openly he did not dare tell her to leave the wise ones alone she might well do something to spite him she had made it plain from the start if not in words that she meant to have the upper hand between them wouldnt that risk another of the forsaken finding out you arent the only one who knows how to enter peoples dreams the chosen she said absently for a moment she chewed a full underlip i have watched the girls dreams too egwene once i thought you had feelings for her do you know who she dreams of morgases son and stepson the son gawyn most often smiling she put on a tone of mock shock you would not believe a simple country girl could have such dreams she was trying to test his jealousy he realized she really thought he warded his dreams to hide thoughts of another woman the maidens guard me closely he said dryly if you want to know how close look at isendres dreams spots of color flared in her cheeks of course he was not supposed to see what she was trying confusion rolled outside the void or did she think isendre lanfear knew she was a darkfriend lanfear had brought kadere and the woman to the waste in the first place and planted most of the jewelry isendre was accused of stealing lanfears spite was cruel even when petty still if she thought he could love her isendre being a darkfriend was probably no obstacle in her eyes i should have let them send her off to try reaching the dragonwall he went on casually but who knows what she might have said to save herself i must protect her and kadere to some extent in order to protect asmodean the color faded but as she opened her mouth again a knock came at the door rand bounded to his feet no one would recognize lanfear yet if a woman were discovered in his room a woman whom none of the maidens below had seen enter questions would be asked and he had no answers but lanfear already had a gateway open to somewhere full of white silk hangings and silver remember that i am your only hope of surviving my love it was a very cool voice in which to call someone that beside me you need fear nothing beside me you can rule everything that is or will be lifting her snowy skirts she stepped through and the gateway winked shut the knock sounded again before he could make himself push away saidin and haul open the door enaila peered past him suspiciously muttering i thought perhaps isendre she gave him an accusing look spearsisters are searching everywhere for you no one saw you return with a shake of her head she straightened she always tried to stand as tall as possible the chiefs have come to speak with the caracarn she said formally they wait below they waited on the columned portico as it turned out being men the sky was still dark but the first glimmers of dawn lined the mountains to the east if they felt any impatience with the two maidens who stood between them and the tall doors it did not show on their shadowed faces the shaido are moving han barked as soon as rand appeared and the reyn the miagoma the shiande every clan joining couladin or me rand demanded the shaido are moving toward the jangai pass rhuarc said for the others it is too early to tell but they are on the march with every spear not needed to defend the holds herds and flocks rand only nodded all of his determination not to let anyone else dictate what he would do and now this whatever the other clans intended couladin had to plan a crossing into cairhien so much for his grand schemes of imposing peace if the shaido ravaged cairhien even further while he sat in rhuidean waiting for the other clans then we move for the jangai too he said finally we cannot catch him if he means to cross erim cautioned and han added sourly if any of the others are joining him we will be caught strung out like blindworms in the sun i wont sit here until i find out rand said if i cant catch couladin i mean to be right behind him into cairhien rouse the spears we leave as soon after first light as you can manage giving him that odd aiel bow used only on the most formal occasions one foot forward and one hand extended the chiefs departed only han said anything to shayol ghul itself chapter dragon a departure yawning in the earlymorning grayness egwene pulled herself up onto her fogcolored mare then had to handle her reins smartly as mist frisked about the animal had not been ridden in weeks aiel not only preferred their own legs they avoided riding almost completely though they did use packhorses and pack mules even if there had been enough wood to build wagons the terrain in the waste was not hospitable to wheels as more than one peddler had learned to his or her sorrow she was not looking forward to the long journey west the mountains hid the sun now but the heat would grow by the hour once it climbed clear and there would be no convenient tent to duck into at nightfall she was not certain that aiel garb was suitable for riding either the shawl worn over her head always did a surprisingly good job of keeping the sun off but those bulky skirts would bare her legs to the thigh if she was not careful blisters worried her as much as modesty the sun on one side and a month out of the saddle should not have softened her that much she hoped it had not or this would be a very long journey once she had settled mist down egwene found amys looking at her and shared a smile with the wise one all of that running the night before was not the reason she was still sleepy if anything it had helped her sleep even more soundly she had found the other womans dreams last night and in celebration they had sipped tea in the dream in cold rocks hold early on an evening when children were playing among the cropplanted terraces and a pleasant breeze blew down the valley as the sun sank of course that would not have been enough to steal her rest but she had been so exultant that when she left amys dreams she did not stop she could not not then no matter what amys would have said there had been dreams all around though with most she had no idea whose they were with most not all melaine had been dreaming of suckling a babe at her breast and bair of one of her dead husbands both of them young and yellowhaired she had been especially careful not to enter those the wise ones would have known an intruder in an instant and she shuddered to think of what they would have done before letting her go rands dreams had been a challenge of course one she could not fail to face now that she could flit from dream to dream how could she not try where the wise ones failed only attempting to enter his dreams had been like running headlong into an invisible stone wall she knew that his dreams lay on the other side and she was sure she could find a way through but there had been nothing to work on nothing to pry at a wall of nothing it was a problem she meant to worry at until she solved it once she put her mind on something she could be as persistent as a badger all around her gaishain were bustling about loading the wise ones camp onto mules before long only an aiel or someone just as skilled at tracking would be able to tell there had ever been tents on that patch of hard clay the same activity covered the surrounding mountain slopes and the hubbub extended into the city as well not everyone would be going but thousands would aiel thronged the streets and master kaderes train of wagons stood strung out across the great plaza laden with moiraines selections the three whitepainted water wagons at the end of the line like huge barrels on wheels behind twentymule teams kaderes own wagon at the head of the column was a little white house on wheels with steps at the back and a metal stovepipe sticking out of the flat roof the thick hawknosed merchant all in ivorycolored silk today swept off his incongruously battered hat as she rode past his dark tilted eyes not sharing in the wide smile he flashed at her she ignored him frostily his dreams had been decidedly dark and unpleasant where they were not lewd as well he ought to have his head dunked in a cask of bluespine tea she thought grimly approaching the roof of the maidens she threaded her way through scurrying gaishain and patiently standing mules to her surprise one of those loading the maidens things wore a black robe not white a woman by the size of her and staggering under the weight of a cordtied bundle on her back bending as she guided mist past to get a look inside the womans cowl egwene saw isendres haggard face sweat already rolling down her cheeks she was glad the maidens had stopped letting the woman go outside or sending her out more naked than not but it did seem needlessly cruel to robe her in black if she was sweating so hard already she would nearly die once the days heat took hold still far dareis mai business was none of hers aviendha had told her so gently but firmly adelin and enaila had been little short of rude about it and a wiry whitehaired maiden named sulin had actually threatened to haul her back to the wise ones by her ear despite her efforts to persuade aviendha to stop addressing her as aes sedai it had been irritating to find that after walking a fine line of uncertainty toward her the rest of the maidens had come down on the side of her being just another pupil of the wise ones why they would not even let her past the door of the roof unless she claimed to be on an errand the quickness with which she heeled mist on through the crowd had nothing to do with acceptance of far dareis mai justice or her uncomfortable awareness that some of the maidens were eyeing her no doubt ready to lecture if they thought she intended to interfere it even had little to do with her dislike of isendre she did not want to think about her glimpse of the womans dreams just before cowinde had come to rouse her they had been nightmares of torture of things being done to the woman that sent egwene fleeing in horror and with something dark and evil laughing as it watched her run no wonder isendre looked haggard egwene had started up out of her sleep so quickly that cowinde had jumped back from lying a hand on her shoulder rand was in the street in front of the maidens roof wearing a shoufa against the coming sun and a blue silk coat with enough gold embroidery to befit a palace though it hung open halfway down the front his belt had a new buckle an elaborate thing shaped like a dragon he really was beginning to think a great deal of himself that was clear standing beside jeadeen his dappled stallion he was talking with the clan chiefs and some of the aiel traders who would be staying in rhuidean jasin natael nearly at rands heels with his harp on his back and holding the reins of a saddled mule bought from master kadere was even more elaborately dressed with silver embroidery nearly hiding his black coat and spills of white lace at his neck and cuffs even his boots were worked in silver where they turned down at the knee the gleemans cloak with its patches did spoil the effect but gleemen were odd folk the male traders wore the cadinsor and though their belt knives were smaller than those of warriors egwene knew they could all handle a spear if called to they had something if not all of the deadly grace of their brothers who carried the spear the women traders in loose white algode blouses and full woolen skirts head scarves and shawls were more easily distinguishable except for maidens and gaishain and aviendha aiel women all wore multiple bracelets and necklaces of gold and ivory silver and gemstones some of aiel make some traded for and some looted among aiel traders though the women displayed twice as many if not more she caught part of what rand was telling the traders give the ogier stonemasons a free hand on some of what they build at least on as much as you can make yourselves theres no point in just trying to remake the past so he was having them send to the stedding for ogier to rebuild rhuidean that was good much of tar valon was ogier work and where they were left to their own devices their buildings were enough to take the breath away mat was already up on his gelding pips with his widebrimmed hat pulled down and the butt of that odd spear resting on his stirrup as usual his highcollared green coat looked slept in she had avoided his dreams one of the maidens a very tall goldenhaired woman gave mat a roguish grin that seemed to embarrass him and well it should she was much too old for him egwene sniffed i know very well what he was dreaming about thank you very much she only reined in beside him to look around for aviendha he told her to be quiet and she did he said as she halted mist he nodded toward moiraine and lan she in pale blue silk gripping the reins of her white mare and he in his warders cloak holding his great black warhorse lan was watching moiraine intently expressionless as always while she looked ready to burst with impatience as she glared at rand she started telling him why this is the wrong thing to do sounded to me like she was saying it for the hundredth time and he said ive decided moiraine stand over there and be quiet till i have time for you like he expected her to do as she was told and she did is that steam coming out of her ears his chortle was so pleased so amused at his own wit that she nearly embraced saidar and taught him a lesson right there in front of everybody instead she sniffed again loudly enough to let him know it was for him and his wit and his amusement he gave her a wry sidelong look and chuckled again which did nothing for her temper for a moment she stared at moiraine perplexed the aes sedai had done as rand told her without protest that was like one of the wise ones obeying or the sun rising at midnight she had heard about the attack of course rumors about giant dogs that left footprints on stone had been all over this morning she could not see what that could have to do with this but aside from the news of the shaido it was the only new thing she knew of and not enough to produce this reaction nothing could produce it that she could think of doubtless moiraine would tell her it was none of her concern but one way or another she would worry it out she did not like not understanding things spotting aviendha standing on the bottom step of the roof she guided mist around to the other side of the crowd near rand the aiel woman was staring at him as hard as the aes sedai did but with absolutely no expression she kept turning the ivory bracelet on her wrist over and over apparently without realizing it somehow or other that bracelet was part of the difficulty the woman was having with him egwene did not understand aviendha refused to talk about it and she could not just ask someone else not when it might embarrass her friend her own flamecarved ivory bracelet was a gift from aviendha to seal them as nearsisters her return gift had been the silver necklace the other woman wore which master kadere claimed was a kandori pattern called snowflakes she had had to ask moiraine for enough money but it had seemed appropriate for a woman who would never see snow or would not have if she was not leaving the waste small chance that she could return before winter whatever that bracelet meant egwene was confident she could puzzle it out eventually are you all right she asked as she leaned out of her highcantled saddle her skirts shifted till her legs showed but she was concerned enough with her friend to hardly notice she had to repeat the question before aviendha gave a start and stared up at her all right of course i am let me speak to the wise ones aviendha im sure i can convince them that they cannot just make you she could not make herself say it not out here where anyone in the crowd might hear does that still worry you aviendha shifted her gray shawl and gave a small shake of her head your customs are still very strange to me her eyes drifted back to rand like iron filings drawn to a lodestone you do not have to be afraid of him i am not afraid of any man the other woman snapped eyes flashing bluegreen fire i want no trouble between us egwene but you should not say such things egwene sighed friend or not aviendha was quite capable of trying to box her ears when offended enough in any case she was not sure she would have admitted it either aviendhas dream had been too painful to watch for long naked but for that ivory bracelet and that seeming to drag at her as if it weighed a hundred pounds aviendha had been running as hard as she could across a cracked clay flat and behind her rand came a giant twice the size of an ogier on a huge jeadeen slowly but inexorably catching up but you could not simply tell a friend that she was lying egwenes face reddened slightly especially not when you would have to tell her how you knew she would box my ears then i wont do it again go rummaging about in peoples dreams not in aviendhas dreams anyway it was not right to spy on a friends dreams not that it was spying exactly but still the crowd around rand was beginning to break up he swung into his saddle easily imitated promptly by natael one of the traders a broadfaced flamehaired woman wearing a small fortune in worked gold cut gems and carved ivory lingered though caracarn do you mean to leave the threefold land forever you have spoken as if you will never return the others stopped at that and turned back silence spread on an expanding ripple of murmurs telling what had been asked for a moment rand was silent as well looking around at the faces turned to him at last he said i hope to return but who can say what will happen the wheel weaves as the wheel wills he hesitated with every eye on him but i will leave you something to remember me by he added sticking a hand in his coat pocket abruptly a fountain near the roof burst to life water gushing from the mouths of incongruous porpoises standing on their tails beyond that a statue of a young man with a horn raised to the sky suddenly was putting up a spreading fan and then two stone women farther on were casting sprays of water from their hands in stunned stillness the aiel watched as all the fountains of rhuidean flowed once more i should have done that long since rands mutter was no doubt meant for himself but in the hush egwene could hear him quite clearly the splash of hundreds of fountains was the only other sound natael shrugged as if he had expected no less it was at rand that egwene stared not the fountains a man who could channel rand hes still rand despite everything but each time she saw him do it was like learning that he could all over again growing up she had been taught that only the dark one was more to be feared than a man who could channel maybe aviendhas right to be afraid of him but when she looked down at aviendha open wonder shone on her face so much water delighted the aiel woman as the finest silk dress might have egwene or a garden full of flowers it is time to march rand announced reining the dapple westward anyone who isnt ready will have to catch up natael followed close behind on the mule why did rand let such a bootlicker stay near him the clan chiefs immediately began passing orders and the bustle increased tenfold maidens and water seekers darted ahead and more far dareis mai closed around rand as a guard of honor incidentally enclosing natael aviendha strode beside jeadeen right at rands stirrup easily matching the stallion stride for stride even in her bulky skirts falling in beside mat behind rand and his escort egwene frowned her friend wore that look of grim determination again as if she had to put her arm into a viper den i have to do something to help her egwene did not give up on a problem once she had her teeth into it settling herself in her saddle moiraine patted aldiebs arched neck with a gloved hand but she did not immediately follow rand hadnan kadere was bringing his wagons up the street driving the lead wagon himself she should have made him tear that wagon down to carry cargo as she had the other like it the man was frightened enough of her of aes sedai to have done it the doorframe terangreal was lashed firmly in the wagon behind kadere canvas tied over it tightly so no one could fall through by accident again a long line of aiel seia doon black eyes strode along on either side of the wagon train kadere bowed to her from the drivers seat but her gaze swept on down to the line of wagons all the way to the great square surrounding the forest of slim glass columns already sparkling in the morning light she would have taken everything in the plaza if she could rather than the small fraction that would fit into the wagons some were too large like the three dull gray metal rings each more than two paces across standing on edge and joined at the middle a braided leather rope had been strung around that one to warn all from entering without the wise ones permission not that anyone was likely to of course only the clan chiefs and the wise ones entered that square with any sense of ease only the wise ones touched anything and they with something approaching proper reticence for countless years the second test faced by an aiel woman who wanted to be a wise one had been to enter the array of glittering glass columns seeing exactly what the men saw more women survived it than men bair said it was because women were tougher amys that those too weak to survive were winnowed out before reaching that point but it was not a certainty those who did survive were not marked the wise ones claimed that only men needed visible signs for a woman to be alive was enough the first test the first winnowing before any training even was to step through one of those three rings which one did not matter or perhaps the choice was a matter of fate that step seemingly took her through her life again and again her future spread out before her all of the possible futures based on every decision she might make for the rest of her life death was possible in those too some women could not face the future any more than others could face the past all possible futures were too many for a mind to retain of course they jumbled together and faded away for the most part but a woman gained a sense of things that would happen in her life that must happen that might happen usually even that was hidden until the moment was on her not always though moiraine had been through those rings a spoonful of hope and a cup of despair she thought i do not like seeing you like this lan said from mandarbs back and his own height he looked down on her disquiet creasing the corners of his eyes for him that was near tears of frustration from another man aiel streamed by on both sides of their horses and gaishain with pack animals moiraine was startled to realize that kaderes water wagons had already gone by she had not realized she had been staring at the plaza for so long like what she asked turning her mare to join the throng rand and his escort were already out of the city worried he said bluntly no readable expression on that stonecarved face now afraid ive never seen you afraid not when we had trollocs and myrddraal swarming over us not even when you learned the forsaken were loose and sammael was sitting almost on top of us is the end coming she gave a start and immediately wished she had not he was looking straight ahead over his stallions ears but the man never missed anything sometimes she thought he could see a leaf fall behind his back do you mean tarmon gaidon a redbird in seleisin knows as well as i the light send not so long as any of the seals remain unbroken the pair she had were on one of kaderes wagons too each packed by itself in a cask stuffed with wool a different wagon than the redstone doorframe she had made sure of that what else could i mean he asked slowly still not looking at her and making her wish she had bitten her tongue you have become impatient i can remember when you could wait weeks for one tiny scrap of information one word without twitching a finger but now he did look at her then a blueeyed gaze that would have intimidated most women and most men as well the oath you gave to the boy moiraine whatever under the light possessed you he has been drawing further and further away from me lan and i must be close to him he needs whatever guidance i can give and i will do everything short of sharing his bed to see that he gets it the rings had told her that that would be disaster not that she had ever considered it the very idea still shocked her but in the rings it was something she would or could have considered in the future it was a measure of her growing desperation no doubt and in the rings she had seen that it would bring ruination on everything she wished she could remember how there were keys to rand althor in anything she could learn about him but only the simple fact of calamity remained in her mind perhaps it will help your humility grow if he tells you to fetch his slippers and light his pipe she stared at him could that be a joke if so it was not amusing she had never found that humility served very well in any situation siuan claimed that growing up in the sun palace in cairhien had put arrogance deeply into moiraines bones where she could not even see it something she firmly denied but for all that siuan was a tairen fishermans daughter she could match any queen stare for stare and to her arrogance meant opposition to her own plans if lan was attempting jokes however feeble and wrongheaded he was changing for nearly twenty years he had followed her and saved her life more times than she cared to count often at great risk to his own always he had accounted his life a small thing valuable only for her need of it some said he wooed death the way a bridegroom wooed his bride she had never held his heart and never felt jealousy toward the women who seemed to throw themselves at his feet he had long claimed that he had no heart but he had found one this past year found it when a woman tied it on a string to hang around her neck he denied her of course not his love for nynaeve almeara once a wisdom in the two rivers and now an accepted of the white tower but that he could ever have her he had two things he said a sword that would not break and a war that could not end he would never gift a bride with those that at least moiraine had taken care of though he would not know how until it was done if he did he would very probably try to change matters stubborn fool man that he could be this arid land seems to have withered your own humility allan mandragoran i shall have to find some water to make it grow again my humility is honed to razor sharpness he told her dryly you never let it grow too dull wetting a white scarf from his leather water bottle he handed her the sodden cloth she tied it around her temples without comment the sun was beginning to rise above the mountains behind them a searing ball of molten gold the thick column snaked up the barren side of chaendaer its tail still in rhuidean when its head had crested the slope then down onto rough hilly flats dotted with rock spires and flattopped buttes some streaked with red or ocher through the gray or brown the air was so clear that moiraine could see for miles even after they were down off chaendaer great natural arches reared and in every direction jagged mountains clawed at the sky dry gullies and hollows split a land sparsely dotted with low thorny bushes and leafless spiny plants the rare tree gnarled and stunted usually bore spines or thorns as well the sun made it an oven a hard land that had shaped a hard people but lan was not the only one changing or being changed she wished she could see what rand would make of the aiel in the end there was a long journey ahead for everyone chapter sunburst over the border clinging to her perch at the rear of the jouncing wagon nynaeve used one hand for herself and one for her straw hat as she peered back at the furious dust storm dwindling behind them in the distance the broad brim shaded her face in the morning heat but the breeze generated by the wagons rumbling speed was enough to snatch it from her head despite the dark red scarf tied under her chin lowhilled grassland with occasional thickets rolled by the grass sere and thin in the latesummer heat dust churned up by the wagon wheels obscured her vision somewhat and made her cough besides the white clouds in the sky lied there had been no rain since before they left tanchico weeks earlier and it had been some time since the wide road had borne the traffic of wagons that once kept it hard packed no one appeared riding out of that seemingly solid wall of brown which was just as well she had lost her anger at brigands trying to stop them this close to escaping the madness of tarabon and unless she was angry she could not sense the true source much less channel even angry she had been surprised at being able to raise such a storm once whipped up full of her fury it held a life of its own elayne had been startled at the size of it too though thankfully she had not let on to thom or juilin but even if her strength was increasing her teachers in the tower had said that it would and certainly none of them was strong enough to best one of the forsaken as she had even with that she still had that limitation had any of the bandits appeared elayne would have had to deal with them alone and she did not want that her earlier anger was gone but she was making fine for another crop awkwardly climbing up over the canvas lashed across the load of casks she reached down to one of the water barrels fastened along the sides of the wagon together with the chests of their possessions and supplies immediately her hat was on the back of her head held only by the scarf her fingers could just touch the lid of the barrel unless she released the rope that she was gripping with her other hand and the way the wagon was lurching along that would probably send her off onto her nose juilin sandar guided the lanky brown gelding he was riding skulker was the improbable name he had put on the animal close to the wagon and reached over to hand her one of the leather water bottles slung about his saddle she drank gratefully though not gracefully hanging there like a bunch of grapes on a windblown vine she spilled nearly as much water down the front of her good gray dress as she did down her throat it was a suitable dress for a merchant highnecked finely woven and wellcut but still plain the pin on her breast a small circle of dark garnets in gold was perhaps too much for a merchant but it had been a gift from the panarch of tarabon along with other jewelry much richer hidden in a compartment beneath the wagon drivers seat she wore it to remind herself that even women who sat on thrones sometimes needed to be taken by the scruff of the neck and shaken she had a little more sympathy for the towers manipulations of kings and queens now that she had dealt with amathera she suspected that amathera had meant her gifts as a bribe to make them depart tanchico the woman had been willing to buy a ship so that they would not remain an hour more than necessary but no one had been willing to sell the few vessels remaining in tanchico harbor that were suitable for more than coasting had been jammed with refugees besides a ship was the obvious way the fastest way to leave and the black ajah might well be watching for her and elayne after what had happened they had been sent to hunt aes sedai who were darkfriends not to be ambushed by them thus the wagon and the long trek across a land torn by civil war and anarchy she was beginning to wish she had not insisted on avoiding the ships not that she would ever admit it to the others when she tried to hand the water bottle back to juilin he waved it away a tough man seemingly carved from some dark wood he was not very comfortable on the back of a horse he looked ridiculous to her not because of his obvious ill ease in the saddle but for the silly red taraboner hat that he had taken to wearing on his flat black hair a brimless conical thing tall and flattopped it did not go well with his dark tairen coat tight to the waist then flaring she did not think it would go well with anything in her opinion he looked as if he were wearing a cake on his head it was clumsy scrambling the rest of the way forward with the leather bottle in one hand and her hat flapping and she did it muttering imprecations for the tairen thiefcatcher never thieftaker not him for thom merrilin puffedup gleeman and for elayne of house trakand daughterheir of andor who ought to be shaken by the scruff of the neck herself she meant to slide onto the wooden drivers seat between thom and elayne but the goldenhaired girl was pressed tightly against thom her own straw hat hanging on her back she was clutching the white mustached old fools arm as if afraid of falling off tightmouthed nynaeve had to settle for elaynes other side she was glad she had her hair in one proper braid again wristthick and hanging down to her waist she could give it a tug instead of thumping elaynes ear for her the girl had used to seem reasonably sensible but something seemed to have addled her wits in tanchico they arent following us anymore nynaeve announced pulling her hat back into place you can slow this thing down now thom she could have shouted that from the back and not needed to clamber over the casks but the image of herself bouncing about and calling for them to slow had stopped her she did not like making a fool of herself and liked even less others seeing her in a foolish light put your hat on she told elayne that fair skin of yours will not appreciate this sun for long as she had halfexpected the girl ignored her friendly advice you drive so wonderfully elayne gushed as thom drew back on the reins pulling the fourhorse team to a walk you were in control every minute the tall wiry man glanced down at her bushy white eyebrows twitching but all he said was we have more company ahead child well maybe he was not such a fool nynaeve looked and saw the snowycloaked mounted column approaching them over the next low rise perhaps half a hundred men in burnished mail and shining conical helmets escorting as many heavily laden wagons children of the light she was suddenly very conscious of the leather thong hanging around her neck beneath her dress and the two rings dangling between her breasts lans heavy gold signet ring the ring of the kings of lost malkier would mean nothing to the whitecloaks but if they saw the great serpent ring fool woman they arent likely to unless you decide to undress hastily she ran an eye over her companions elayne could not stop being beautiful and now that she had let go of thom and was retying the green scarf that held her hat her manner looked more suited to a throne room than a merchants wagon but aside from being blue her dress was no different from nynaeves she wore no jewelry she had called amatheras gifts gaudy she would pass she had done so fifty times since tanchico barely only this was the first meeting with whitecloaks thom in stout brown wool could have been any of a thousand gnarled whitehaired men who worked wagons and juilin was juilin he knew how to behave though he looked as though he wished he were sure footed on the ground with his staff or the slotted swordbreaker he wore at his belt rather than on a horse thom drew the team over to one side of the road and halted as several whitecloaks broke away from the head of the column nynaeve put on a welcoming smile she hoped they had not decided that they needed another wagon the light illumine you captain she said to the narrowfaced man who was obviously the leader the only one not carrying a steeltipped lance she had no idea what rank the two golden knots signified on the breast of his cloak right below the flaring sunburst they all wore but in her experience men would accept any flattery we are very glad to see you bandits tried to rob us a few miles back but a dust storm appeared like a miracle we barely esc you are a merchant few merchants have come out of tarabon in some time the mans voice was as harsh as his face and that looked as though all joy had been boiled out of it before he left the cradle suspicion filled his dark deepset eyes nynaeve did not doubt that was permanent too bound to where with what i carry dyes captain she worked to maintain her smile under that steady unblinking stare it was a relief when he shifted it to the others briefly thom was making a good job of appearing bored just a wagon driver who would be paid stopped or moving and if juilin had not snatched off that ridiculous hat as he once would have at least he seemed no more than idly interested a hired man with nothing to hide when the whitecloaks gaze dropped to elayne nynaeve felt the other woman stiffen and hurried on taraboner dyes the finest in the world i can get a good price for them in andor at a signal from the captain or whatever he was one of the other whitecloaks heeled his horse to the back of the wagon slicing one of the ropes with his dagger he jerked some of the canvas loose enough to expose three or four casks theyre branded tanchico lieutenant this one says crimson do you want me to break open a few nynaeve hoped the whitecloak officer took the anxiety on her face the right way even without looking at her she could all but feel elayne wanting to call the soldier down for his manners but any real merchant would be worried at having dyes exposed to the elements if you will show me the ones you want opened captain i will be more than happy to do it myself the man showed no response at all to flattery or offers of cooperation the casks were sealed to keep out dust and water you see if the cask head is broken ill never be able to cover it over with wax again here the rest of the column reached them and began to pass in a cloud of dust the wagon drivers were roughly dressed nondescript men but the soldiers rode stiffly erect their long steel lance points all slanted at exactly the same angle even sweatyfaced and coated with dust they looked hard men only the drivers glanced at nynaeve and the others the whitecloak lieutenant waved dust away from his face with one gauntleted hand then motioned the man back from the wagon his eyes never left nynaeve you come from tanchico nynaeve nodded a picture of cooperation and openness yes captain tanchico what word have you of the city there have been rumors rumors captain when we left there was little order remaining the city was full of refugees and the countryside of rebels and bandits trade hardly exists that was the truth pure and simple thats why these dyes will fetch particularly good prices there will be no more taraboner dyes available for a long while i think i do not care about refugees trade or dyes merchant the officer said in flat tones was andric still on the throne yes captain obviously rumor said someone had taken tanchico and supplanted the king and perhaps someone had but who one of the rebel lords who fought each other as hard as they did andric or the dragonsworn who had pledged themselves to the dragon reborn without ever seeing him andric was still king and amathera still panarch when we left his eyes said she could be lying it is said the tar valon witches were involved did you see any aes sedai or hear of them no captain she said quickly the great serpent ring seemed hot against her skin fifty whitecloaks close at hand a dust storm would not help this time and anyway though she tried to deny it she was more scared than angry plain merchants dont mingle with that sort he nodded and she risked adding a question anything to change the subject if you please captain have we entered amadicia yet the border is five miles east he pronounced for the time being the first village you come to will be mardecin obey the law and you will be well there is a garrison of the children there he sounded as if the garrison would spend all of its time making sure they did obey the law have you come to move the border elayne asked suddenly and coolly nynaeve could have strangled her the deepset suspicious eyes shifted to elayne and nynaeve said hastily forgive her my lord captain my eldest sisters girl she thinks she should have been born a lady and she cant keep away from the boys besides thats why her mother sent her to me elaynes indignant gasp was perfect it was also probably quite real nynaeve supposed she had not needed to add that about boys but it seemed to fit the whitecloak stared at them a moment longer then said the lord captain commander sends food into tarabon otherwise we would have taraboner vermin over the border and stealing anything they could chew walk in the light he added before swinging his horse to gallop back to the head of the column it was neither suggestion nor blessing thom got the wagon moving as soon as the officer left but everyone sat silent except for coughing until they were well beyond the last soldier and out of the other wagons dust swallowing a little water to wet her throat nynaeve pushed the water bottle at elayne what did you mean back there she demanded we arent in your mothers throne room and your mother would not stand for it anyway elayne emptied the rest of the leather bottle before deigning to reply you were crawling nynaeve she pitched her voice high in a mock servility i am very good and obedient captain may i kiss your boots captain we are supposed to be merchants not queens in disguise merchants do not have to be lickspittles you are lucky he didnt think we were trying to hide something acting so servile they dont stare down their noses at whitecloaks with fifty lances either or did you think we could overwhelm them all with the power if need be why did you tell him i could not keep away from boys there was no need for that nynaeve i was ready to tell him anything that would make him go away and leave us alone and you both of you shut up thom barked suddenly before they come back to see which of you is murdering the other nynaeve actually twisted around on the wooden seat to look back before she realized the whitecloaks were too far off to hear even if they had been shouting well maybe they had been it did not help that elayne did the same nynaeve took a firm hold on her braid and glared at thom but elayne snuggled herself against his arm and practically cooed you are right thom i am sorry i raised my voice juilin was watching them sideways pretending not to but he was wise enough not to bring his horse close enough to become part of it letting go of her braid before she pulled it out by the roots nynaeve adjusted her hat and sat staring straight ahead over the horses whatever had gotten into the girl it was high time to get it out again only a tall stone pillar to each side of the road marked the border between tarabon and amadicia there was no traffic on the road but them the hills gradually became a little higher but otherwise the land remained much the same brown grass and thickets with few green leaves except on pine or leatherleaf or other evergreens stonefenced fields and thatchroofed stone farmhouses dotted the slopes and dells but they had a look of abandonment no smoke rising from chimneys no men working crops no sheep or cows sometimes a few chickens scratched in a farmyard near the road but they scurried away gone feral at the wagons approach whitecloak garrison or no apparently no one was willing to risk taraboner brigands this close to the border when mardecin appeared from the top of a rise the sun still had a long way to climb to its zenith the town ahead looked too big for the name of village nearly a mile across straddling a small bridged stream between two hills with as many slate roofs as thatched and considerable bustle in the wide streets we need to buy supplies nynaeve said but we want to be quick about it we can cover a lot of ground yet before nightfall we are wearing out nynaeve thom said first light to last light every day for nearly a month one day resting will not make much difference in reaching tar valon he did not sound tired more likely he was looking forward to playing his harp or his flute in one of the taverns and getting men to buy him wine juilin had finally brought his mount close to the wagon and he added i could do with a day on my feet i do not know whether this saddle or that wagon seat is worse i think we should find an inn elayne said looking up at thom i have had quite enough of sleeping under this wagon and i would like to listen to you tell stories in the common room onewagon merchants are little more than peddlers nynaeve said sharply they cannot afford inns in a town like this she did not know whether that was true or not but despite her own desire for a bath and clean sheets she was not going to let the girl get away with directing the suggestion at thom it was not until the words were out of her mouth that she realized that she had given in to thom and juilin one day wont hurt its a long way to tar valon yet she wished she had insisted on a ship with a fast ship a sea folk raker they could have gotten to tear in a third of what it had taken them to cross tarabon as long as they had good winds and with the right athaan miere windfinder that would have been no problem she or elayne could have handled it for that matter the tairens knew that she and elayne were friends of rands and she expected that they still sweated buckets for fear of offending the dragon reborn they would have provided a carriage and escort for the journey up to tar valon find us a place to camp she said reluctantly she should have insisted on a ship they might have been back in the tower by now chapter leaf a signal nynaeve had to admit that thom and juilin between them had chosen a good campsite in a sparse thicket growing on an eastern slope covered with dead leaves a scant mile from mardecin scattered sourgums and some sort of small droopybranched willow screened the wagon from the road and the town and a twofootwide rivulet ran from a stone outcrop near the top of the rise down a bed of dried mud twice as broad enough water for their purposes it was even a little cooler under the trees with a small and welcome breeze once the two men had watered the team and hobbled them where the horses could feed on the sparse grass upslope they tossed a coin to decide which should take the lanky gelding into mardecin to purchase what they needed the coin flipping was a ritual that they had developed thom whose nimble fingers were used to performing sleightofhand never lost when he flipped the coin so juilin always did it now thom won anyway and while he was stripping the saddle from skulker nynaeve put her head under the wagon seat and levered up a floorboard with her belt knife besides two small gilded coffers containing amatheras presents of jewelry several leather purses bulging with coin lay in the recess the panarch had been more than generous in her desire to see their backs the other things looked trifling by comparison a small dark wooden box polished but plain and uncarved and a washleather purse lying flat and showing the impression of a disc inside the box held the two terangreal they had recovered from the black ajah both linked to dreams and the purse that was their prize from tanchico one of the seals on the dark ones prison as much as she wanted to find out where siuan sanche wanted them to chase the black ajah next the seal was the source of her haste to reach tar valon digging coins from one of the fat purses she avoided touching the flat purse the longer it remained in her possession the more she wanted to hand it to the amyrlin and be done with it sometimes she thought she could feel the dark one trying to break through when she was near the thing she saw thom off with a pocketful of silver and a strong admonition to search out some fruit and green vegetables either man was likely as not to buy nothing but meat and beans left to himself thoms limp as he led the horse off toward the road made her grimace an old injury and nothing to be done for it now so moiraine said that rankled as much as the limp itself nothing to be done when she had left the two rivers it had been to protect young people from her village snatched away in the night by an aes sedai she had gone to the tower still with the hope that she could somehow shelter them and the added ambition of bringing down moiraine for what she had done the world had changed since then or maybe she only saw the world differently no it is not me thats changed im the same it is everything else thats different now it was all she could do to protect herself rand was what he was and no turning back and egwene eagerly went her own way not letting anyone or anything hold her back even if her way led over a cliff and mat had learned to think of nothing but women carousing and gambling she even found herself sympathizing with moiraine sometimes to her disgust at least perrin had gone back home or so she had heard through egwene secondhand from rand perhaps perrin was safe hunting the black ajah was good and right and satisfying and also terrifying though she tried to hide that part she was a grown woman not a girl who needed to hide in her mothers apron yet that was not the main reason she was willing to keep on bashing her head against a wall keep on trying to learn to use the power when most of the time she could not channel any more than thom that reason was the talent called healing as wisdom of emonds field it had been gratifying to bring the womens circle around to her way of thinking especially since most were old enough to be her mother with not many years on elayne she had been the youngest wisdom ever in the two rivers and even more so to see that the village council did what they should stubborn men that they were the most satisfaction though had always come from finding the right combination of herbs to cure an illness to heal with the one power she had done it fumbling curing what her other skills never could the joy of it was enough to bring tears one day she meant to heal thom and watch him dance one day she would even heal that wound in rands side surely there was nothing that could not be healed not if the woman wielding the power was determined enough when she turned from watching thom go she found that elayne had filled the bucket that normally hung beneath the wagon and was kneeling to wash her hands and face a towel around her shoulders to keep her dress dry that was something she particularly wanted to do herself in this heat it was pleasant sometimes to wash in water cool from a stream often enough there had been no water but what was in the barrels strapped to the wagon and that was needed for drinking and cooking more than washing juilin was sitting with his back against one of the wagon wheels his thumbthick staff of pale ridged wood leaning next to him his head was down that silly hat tipped precariously over his eyes but she was not willing to bet on even a man sleeping at this time of the morning there were things he and thom did not know things it was best they did not know the thick carpet of dead sourgum leaves crackled as she seated herself near elayne do you think tanchico really has fallen rubbing a soapy cloth slowly across her face the other woman did not reply she tried again i think that whitecloaks aes sedai were us perhaps elaynes voice was cool a pronouncement from the throne her eyes were blue ice she did not look at nynaeve and perhaps reports of what we did got tangled with other rumors tarabon could have a new king and a new panarch very easily nynaeve kept her temper in check and her hands away from her braid they clutched her knees instead you are trying to put her at ease with you watch your tongue amathera was difficult but i do not wish her any harm do you a pretty woman juilin said especially in one of those taraboner serving girls dresses with a pretty smile i thought she he saw elayne and her looking at him and quickly pulled his hat back down pretending to sleep again she and elayne shared a glance and she knew the others thought was the same as hers men whatever has happened to amathera nynaeve she is behind us now elayne sounded more normal her washcloth slowed i wish her well but mainly i hope the black ajah is not behind us not following i mean juilin stirred uneasily without raising his head he was still uncomfortable with the knowledge that black aes sedai were real and not simply a tale in the streets he should be happy he doesnt have our knowledge nynaeve had to admit that the thought was not entirely logical but if he had known about the forsaken being loose even rands foolish instruction to look after her and elayne would not have kept him from running still he was useful at times he and thom both it had been moiraine who had fastened thom to them and the man knew a great deal about the world for an ordinary gleeman if they were following theyd have caught up by now that was surely true considering the usual lumbering speed of the wagon with any luck they still do not know who we are elayne nodded grim but her old self again and began rinsing her face she could be almost as determined as a two rivers woman liandrin and most of her cronies surely escaped from tanchico maybe all of them and we still dont know who is giving orders for the black ajah in the tower as rand would say we still have it to do nynaeve despite herself nynaeve winced true they had a list of eleven names but once they were back in the tower almost any aes sedai they spoke to might be black ajah or any women they encountered on the road for that matter anyone they met might be a darkfriend but that was hardly the same thing not by a wide degree more than the black ajah elayne continued i worry about mo nynaeve put a quick hand on her arm and nodded slightly toward juilin elayne coughed and went on as though that was what had stopped her about mother she has no reason to like you nynaeve quite the opposite she is far away from here nynaeve was glad her voice was steady they were not talking about elaynes mother but the forsaken she had defeated part of her hoped fervently that moghedien was far away very far but if she was not she is nynaeve said firmly but she still hitched her shoulders uncomfortably a part of her remembered humiliations suffered at moghediens hands and desired nothing more than to face the woman again to defeat her again for good this time only what if moghedien took her by surprise came at her when she was not angry enough to channel the same was true of any of the forsaken of course or of any black sister for that matter but after her rout in tanchico moghedien had reason to hate her personally not pleasant at all to think that one of the forsaken knew your name and likely wanted your head that is just rank cowardice she told herself sharply you are not a coward and you will not be that did not stop the itch between her shoulder blades every time moghedien came to mind as if the woman was staring at her back i suppose looking over my shoulder for bandits has made me nervous elayne said casually patting her face with the towel why sometimes when i dream of late i have the feeling that someone is watching me nynaeve gave a start at what seemed an echo of her own thoughts but then she realized there had been a slight emphasis on dream not any dreams but telaranrhiod another thing the men did not know about she had had the same sensation but then there was often a feel of unseen eyes in the world of dreams it could be uncomfortable but they had discussed the sensation before she made her voice light well your mother is not in our dreams elayne or she would probably snatch us both up by an ear moghedien would probably torture them until they begged for death or arrange a circle of thirteen black sisters and thirteen myrddraal they could turn you to the shadow against your will that way bind you to the dark one maybe moghedien could even do it by herself dont be ridiculous woman if she could have she would have you beat her remember i do hope not the other woman replied soberly do you mean to give me a chance to wash nynaeve asked irritably putting the girl at ease was all very well but she could do with less talk of moghedien the forsaken had to be somewhere distant she would not have let them come this far peacefully if she knew where they were light send that thats true elayne emptied and refilled the bucket herself she was a very nice girl usually when she remembered that she was not in the royal palace in caemlyn and when she was not acting the fool that nynaeve would take care of when thom came back once nynaeve had enjoyed a slow cooling wash of face and hands she set about making the camp ready and put juilin to breaking dead branches from the trees for a fire by the time thom returned with two wicker hampers slung across the geldings back her and elaynes blankets were laid out under the wagon and the two mens under the hanging branches of one of the twentyfoot willows a good supply of firewood had been stacked the teakettle stood cooling beside the ashes of a fire in a circle cleared of leaves and the thick pottery cups had been washed juilin was grumbling to himself as he caught water in the tiny stream to refill the water barrels from the snatches nynaeve heard she was glad he kept most of it to an inaudible mutter from her perch on one of the wagon shafts elayne hardly tried to hide her interested attempt to make out what he was saying both she and nynaeve had put on clean dresses on the other side of the wagon switching colors as it happened after fastening hobbles between the geldings forelegs thom lifted the heavy hampers down easily and began unpacking them mardecins not as prosperous as it looks from a distance he set a net bag of small apples on the ground and another of some dark green leafy vegetable with no trade into tarabon the town is withering the rest seemed to be all sacks of dried beans and turnips plus peppercured beef and saltcured hams and a gray pottery bottle sealed with wax that nynaeve was sure held brandy both men had complained of not having a bit of something with their pipes of an evening you can hardly take six steps without seeing a whitecloak or two the garrison is about fifty men or so with barracks over the hill from the town on the far side of the bridge it was considerably larger but it seems pedron niall is pulling whitecloaks from everywhere into amador knuckling his long mustaches he looked thoughtful for a moment i cannot see what he is up to thom was not a man who liked that usually a few hours in a place was enough for him to begin ferreting out the currents between noble and merchant houses the alliances and schemes and counterplots that made up the socalled game of houses the rumors are all about niall trying to stop a war between illian and altara or maybe illian and murandy no reason there for him to be gathering in soldiers ill tell you one thing though whatever that lieutenant said it is a kings tax that buys the food being sent into tarabon and the people are not happy with it not to feed taraboners king ailron and the lord captain commander are not our concern nynaeve said studying what he had brought three salted hams we will pass through amadicia as quickly and unobtrusively as we can perhaps elayne and i will have more luck finding vegetables than you did would you care for a walk elayne elayne got up immediately smoothing her gray skirts and lifting her hat from the wagon that would be very nice after that wagon seat it might be different if thom and juilin let me take a turn riding skulker more often for once she did not give the old gleeman a coquettish look which was something thom and juilin exchanged glances and the tairen thiefcatcher pulled a coin from his coat pocket but nynaeve gave him no chance to flip it we will be quite all right by ourselves we could hardly expect trouble of any sort with so many whitecloaks to keep order planting her hat on her head she tied the scarf under her chin and gave them a firm look besides all those things thom bought need to be put away both men nodded slowly reluctantly but they did it sometimes they took their roles as supposed protectors entirely too seriously she and elayne had reached the empty road and were walking down the verge on the thin grass so as not to kick up dust before she had it settled in her mind how to bring up what she wanted to say before she could speak though elayne said you obviously want to talk to me alone nynaeve is it about moghedien nynaeve blinked and looked at the other woman sideways it was well to remember that elayne was no fool she had only been acting like one nynaeve resolved to keep a tight hold on her temper this was going to be difficult enough without letting it dissolve into a shouting match not that elayne the girl thought they should add moghedien to their hunt she could not seem to realize the difference between one of the forsaken and say liandrin or chesmal i thought we should discuss how youve been behaving toward thom i do not know what you mean elayne said staring straight ahead toward the town but sudden spots of color in her cheeks gave her the lie not only is he old enough to be your father twice over but he is not my father elayne snapped my father was taringail damodred a prince of cairhien and first prince of the sword of andor straightening her hat needlessly she went on in a milder tone though not by much i am sorry nynaeve i did not mean to shout temper nynaeve reminded herself i thought you were in love with rand she said making her voice gentle it was not easy the messages you have me give to egwene for him certainly say so i expect you tell her the same the color in the other womans face heightened i do love him but he is very far away nynaeve in the waste surrounded by a thousand maidens of the spear who jump to do his bidding i cannot see him or speak to him or touch him she was whispering by the end you cant think hell turn to a maiden nynaeve said incredulously he is a man but he isnt as fickle as that and besides one of them would put a spear in him if he looked at her crossways even if he is this dawn whatever anyway egwene says aviendha is keeping an eye on him for you i know but i should have made sure that he knew i love him elaynes voice was determined and worried i should have told him so nynaeve had hardly looked at a man before lan at least not seriously but she had seen and learned much as wisdom from her observations there was no quicker way to send a man running for his life unless he said it first i think min had a viewing elayne went on about me and about rand she always used to joke about having to share him but i think it wasnt a joke and she could not bring herself to say what it really was that is ridiculous it certainly was though in tear aviendha had told her of a vile aiel custom you share lan with moiraine a small voice whispered that isnt the same thing at all she told it briskly are you certain min had one of her visions yes i wasnt at first but the more i think on it the more sure i become she joked about it too often to mean anything else well whatever min had seen rand was no aiel oh his blood might be aiel as the wise ones claimed but he had grown up in the two rivers and she would not stand by and let him take up wicked aiel ways she doubted very much that elayne would either is that why youve been she would not say throwing yourself at teasing thom elayne gave her a sidelong glance the crimson back in her cheeks there are a thousand leagues between us nynaeve do you think rand is refraining from looking at other women a man is a man on a throne or in a pigsty she had a stock of homely sayings from her childhood nurse a clearheaded woman named lini whom nynaeve wished she would meet one day well i dont see why you have to flirt just because you think rand might she refrained from bringing up thoms age again lan is old enough so be your father that small voice murmured i love lan if i can only reason out how to get him free of moiraine that is not the matter at hand thom is a man with secrets elayne remember that moiraine sent him with us whatever he is he is no simple country gleeman he was a great man elayne said softly he could have been greater except for love with that nynaeves temper snapped she rounded on the other woman seizing her by the shoulders the man doesnt know whether to turn you over his knee or or climb a tree i know elayne gave a frustrated sigh but i do not know what else to do nynaeve ground her teeth in the effort not to shake her until her skull rattled if your mother heard of this shed send lini to haul you back to the nursery i am not a child any longer nynaeve elaynes voice was strained and now the flush in her cheeks was not embarrassment i am as much a woman as my mother is nynaeve stalked on toward mardecin gripping her braid so hard that her knuckles hurt after a few strides elayne caught up are we really going to buy vegetables her face was composed her tone light did you see what thom brought back nynaeve said tightly elayne shuddered elaborately three hams and that awful peppered beef do men ever eat anything but meat if it isnt set before them nynaeves temper faded as they walked on talking about the foibles of the weaker sex men of course and such simple matters as that not completely away of course she liked elayne and enjoyed her company at times it seemed as if the girl really was egwenes sister as they sometimes called each other when elayne was not acting the twitchskirt thom could put a stop to it of course but the old fool indulged elayne like a fond father with his favorite daughter even when he did not know whether to say boo or faint one way or another she meant to get to the bottom of it not for rands sake but because elayne was better than this it was as if she had contracted a strange fever nynaeve intended to cure it granite slabs paved the streets of mardecin worn by generations of feet and wagon wheels and the buildings were all brick or stone a number of them were empty though both shops and houses sometimes with the front door standing open so nynaeve could see the bare interior she saw three blacksmiths shops two abandoned and in the third the smith was halfheartedly rubbing his tools with oil and the forges were cold one slateroofed inn with men sitting morosely on benches out front had a number of broken windows and at another the adjoining stable had its doors halfoff the hinges and a dusty coach squatting in the stableyard one forlorn hen nesting on the drivers high seat somebody in that one was playing the bittern heron on the wing it sounded like but the tune was dispirited the door of a third inn was barred by two splintery planks nailed across it people thronged the streets but they moved lethargically weighted down by the heat dull faces said they had no real reason to stir at all beyond habit many women in large deep bonnets that almost hid their faces had on dresses worn at the hem and more than one man had a frayed collar or cuffs on his kneelength coat there were indeed whitecloaks scattered through the streets if not so many as thom had made out still enough nynaeves breath caught every time she saw a man in a pristine cloak and shining armor look at her she knew she had not worked with the power nearly long enough to take on aes sedai agelessness but those men might well try to kill her a tar valon witch and outlawed in amadicia if they even suspected a connection to the white tower they strode through the crowds seemingly oblivious of the apparent poverty around them people moved out of their way respectfully receiving perhaps a nod if that and often a sternly pious walk in the light ignoring the children of the light as best she could she set herself to finding fresh vegetables but by the time the sun reached its peak a blazing ball of gold that burned through the thin clouds she and elayne had wandered both sides of the low bridge and between them had managed to garner one small bunch of honeypeas some tiny radishes a few hard pears and a basket to carry them in perhaps thom really had looked this time of year the barrows and stalls should have been full of the summers produce but most of what they saw was heaped potatoes and turnips that had known better days thinking of all those empty farms approaching the town nynaeve wondered how these people were going to make it through the winter she walked on hanging upside down beside the door of a thatchroofed seamstress shop was a bunch of what looked almost like broomweed with tiny yellow flowers the stalks wrapped their whole length in a white ribbon then tied with a dangling yellow one it might have been some womans feeble attempt at a festive decoration in the midst of hard times but she was sure it was not stopping beside an empty shop with a carving knife incised on the sign still hanging over the door she pretended to search for a stone in her shoe while furtively studying the seamstress shop the door was open and colorful bolts of cloth stood in the smallpaned windows but no one went in or out can you not find it nynaeve take off your shoe nynaeves head jerked she had almost forgotten that elayne was there no one else was paying any attention to them and no one looked close enough to overhear she still lowered her voice that bunch of broomweed by that shop door it is a yellow ajah signal an emergency signal from one of the yellows eyesandears she did not have to tell elayne not to stare the girls eyes barely moved toward the shop are you certain she asked quietly and how do you know of course i am certain its exact the hanging bit of yellow ribbon is even split in three she paused to take a deep breath unless she was completely mistaken that insignificant fistful of weeds held a dire meaning if she was wrong she was making a fool of herself and she did hate to do that i spent a good deal of time talking with yellows in the tower healing was the main purpose of the yellows they did not care much for her herbs but you did not need herbs when you could heal with the power one of them told me she did not think it too great a transgression since she was sure ill choose yellow besides it has not been used in nearly three hundred years elayne only a few women in each ajah actually know who the ajahs eyesandears are but a bunch of yellow flowers tied and hung like that tells any yellow sister that here one is and with a message urgent enough to risk uncovering herself how are we going to find out what it is nynaeve liked that not what are we going to do the girl had backbone follow my lead she said gripping the basket tighter as she straightened she hoped she remembered everything shemerin had told her she hoped shemerin had told her everything the plump yellow could be fluttery for an aes sedai the interior of the shop was not large and every scrap of wall was taken up by shelves holding bolts of silk or finely woven wool spools of piping and binding and ribbon and lace of every width and description dressmakers dummies stood about the floor wearing garments ranging from halfmade to complete from something suitable for a dance in embroidered green wool to a pearly gray silk gown that could have done very well at court at first glance the shop had a look of prosperity and activity but nynaeves sharp eye caught a hint of dust in one high neck of frothy solinde lace and on a large black velvet bow at the waist of another gown there were two darkhaired women in the shop one young and thin and trying to wipe her nose surreptitiously with the back of her hand held a bolt of pale red silk clutched anxiously to her bosom her hair was a mass of long curls to her shoulders in the amadician fashion but it seemed a tangle beside the other womans neat array the other handsome and in her middle years was assuredly the seamstress as proclaimed by the large bristling pincushion fastened to her wrist her dress was of a good green wool well cut and well made to show her skill but only lightly worked with white flowers around the high neck so as not to overshadow her patrons when nynaeve and elayne walked in both women gaped as if none had entered in a year the seamstress recovered first regarding them with careful dignity as she made a slight curtsy may i serve you i am ronde macura my shop is yours i want a dress embroidered with yellow roses on the bodice nynaeve told her but no thorns mind she added with a laugh i dont heal very fast what she said did not matter so long as she included yellow and heal in it now if only that bunch of flowers was not happenstance if that was the case she would have to find some reason not to buy a dress with roses and a way to keep elayne from recounting the whole miserable experience to thom and juilin mistress macura stared at her for a moment with dark eyes then turned to the thin girl pushing her toward the back of the shop go on to the kitchen luci and make a pot of tea for these good ladies from the blue canister the waters hot thank the light go on girl put that down and stop gawking quickly quickly the blue canister mind my best tea she said turning back to nynaeve as the girl vanished through a door at the rear i live over the shop you see and my kitchen is in the back she was smoothing her skirts nervously thumb and forefinger of her right hand forming a circle for the great serpent ring there would be no need for an excuse about the dress it seemed nynaeve repeated the sign and after a moment elayne did too i am nynaeve and this is elayne we saw your signal the woman fluttered as if she might fly away the signal ah yes of course well nynaeve said what is the urgent message we should not talk about that out here uh mistress nynaeve anyone might walk in nynaeve doubted that i will tell you over a nice cup of tea my best tea did i say nynaeve exchanged looks with elayne if mistress macura was this reluctant to speak her news it must be appalling indeed if we may just step into the back elayne said no one will hear but us her regal tone made the seamstress stare for a moment nynaeve thought it might cut through her nervousness but the next instant the fool woman was babbling again the tea will be ready in a moment the waters already hot we used to get taraboner tea through here that is why i am here i suppose not the tea of course all the trade that used to be and all the news that came both ways with the wagons they you are mainly interested in outbreaks of disease or a new kind of illness but i find that interesting myself i dabble a little with she coughed and rushed on if she smoothed her dress any harder she would wear a hole in it some about the children of course but they you are not much interested in them really the kitchen mistress macura nynaeve said firmly as soon as the other woman paused for breath if the womans news made her this afraid nynaeve would brook no more delay in hearing it the door at the back opened enough to admit lucis anxious head its ready mistress she announced breathlessly this way mistress nynaeve the seamstress said still rubbing the front of her dress mistress elayne a short hallway led past narrow stairs to a snug beamceilinged kitchen with a steaming kettle sitting on the hearth and tall cupboards everywhere copper pots hung between the back door and a window that looked out into a small yard with a high wooden fence the small table in the middle of the floor held a brilliant yellow teapot a green honey jar three mismatched cups in as many colors and a squat blue pottery canister with the lid beside it mistress macura snatched the canister lidded it and hastily put it into a cupboard that held more in two dozen shades and hues sit please she said filling the cups please nynaeve took a ladderback chair next to elayne and the seamstress set cups in front of them flitting to one of the cupboards for pewter spoons the message nynaeve said as the woman sat down across from them mistress macura was too nervous to touch her own teacup so nynaeve stirred a little honey into hers and took a sip it was hot but had a cool minty aftertaste hot tea might settle the womans nerves if she could be made to drink a pleasant taste elayne murmured over the edge of her cup what sort of tea is it good girl nynaeve thought but the seamstress hands only fluttered beside her cup a taraboner tea from near the shadow coast sighing nynaeve took another swallow to settle her own stomach the message she said insistently you did not hang that signal to invite us for tea what is your urgent news ah yes mistress macura licked her lips eyed them both then said slowly it came near a month ago with orders that any sister passing through heard it at all costs she wet her lips again all sisters are welcome to return to the white tower the tower must be whole and strong nynaeve waited for the rest but the other woman fell silent this was the dire message she looked at elayne but the heat seemed to be catching up to the girl drooping in her chair she was staring at her hands on the table is that all of it nynaeve demanded and surprised herself by yawning the heat must be reaching her too the seamstress only watched her intently i said nynaeve began but suddenly her head felt too heavy for her neck elayne had slumped onto the table she realized eyes closed and arms hanging limply nynaeve stared at the cup in her hands with horror what did you give us she said thickly that minty taste was still there but her tongue felt swollen tell me letting the cup fall she levered herself up against the table knees wobbling the light burn you what mistress macura scraped back her chair and stepped out of reach but her earlier nervousness was now a look of quiet satisfaction blackness rolled in on nynaeve the last thing she heard was the seamstress voice catch her luci chapter harp figs and mice elayne realized that she was being carried upstairs by her shoulders and ankles her eyes opened she could see but the rest of her body might as well have belonged to someone else for all the control she had over it even blinking was slow her brain felt crammed full of feathers shes awake mistress luci shrilled nearly dropping her feet shes looking at me i told you not to worry mistress macuras voice came from above her head she cannot channel or twitch a muscle not with forkroot tea in her i discovered that by accident but it has certainly come in handy it was true elayne sagged between them like a doll with half the stuffing gone bumping her bottom along the steps and she could as well have run as channel she could sense the true source but trying to embrace it was like trying to pick up a needle on a mirror with coldnumbed fingers panic welled up and a tear slid down her cheek perhaps these women meant to turn her over to the whitecloaks for execution but she could not make herself believe that the whitecloaks had women setting traps in the hope that an aes sedai might wander in that left darkfriends and almost certainly serving the black ajah right along with the yellow she would surely be put in the hands of the black ajah unless nynaeve had escaped but if she was to escape she could not count on anyone else and she could neither move nor channel suddenly she realized that she was trying to scream and producing only a thin gurgling mew halting it took all the strength she had left nynaeve knew all about herbs or claimed she did why had she not recognized whatever that tea was stop this whining the small firm voice in the back of her head sounded remarkably like lini a shoat squealing under a fence just attracts the fox when it should be trying to run desperately she set herself to the simple task of embracing saidar it had been a simple task but now she might as well have been attempting to reach saidin she kept on though it was the only thing she could do mistress macura at least seemed to have no worry as soon as they had dropped elayne onto a narrow bed in a small close room with one window she hustled luci right out again with not even a backward glance elaynes head had fallen so she could see another cramped bed and a highchest with tarnished brass pulls on the drawers she could move her eyes but shifting her head was beyond her in a few minutes the two women returned puffing with nynaeve slung between them and heaved her onto the other bed her face was slack and glistening with tears but her dark eyes fury filled them and fear too elayne hoped anger was uppermost nynaeve was stronger than she when she could channel perhaps nynaeve could manage where she was failing miserably time after time those had to be tears of rage telling the thin girl to stay there mistress macura hurried out once more this time coming back with a tray that she placed atop the highchest it held the yellow teapot one cup a funnel and a tall hourglass now luci mind you pour a good two ounces into each of them as soon as that hourglass empties as soon mind why dont we give it to them now mistress the girl moaned wringing her hands i want them to go back to sleep i dont like them looking at me they would sleep like the dead girl and this way we can let them rouse just enough to walk when we need them to i will dose them more properly when its time to send them off theyll have headaches and stomach cramps to pay for it but no more than they deserve i suppose but what if they can channel mistress what if they do theyre looking at me stop blathering girl the older woman said briskly if they could dont you think they would have by now they are helpless as kittens in a sack and they will stay that way as long you keep a good dose in them now you do as i told you understand i must go tell old avi to send off one of his pigeons and make a few arrangements but i will be back as soon as i can you had better brew another pot of forkroot just in case ill go out the back close up the shop someone might wander in and that would never do after mistress macura left luci stood staring at them for a while still wringing her hands then finally scurried out herself her sniffling faded down the stairs elayne could see sweat beading on nynaeves brow she hoped it was effort not the heat try nynaeve she herself reached for the true source fumbling clumsily through the wads of wool that seemed to pack her head failed tried again and failed tried again oh light try nynaeve try the hourglass filled her eyes she could not look at anything else sand pouring down each grain marking another failure on her part the last grain dropped and luci did not come elayne strained harder for the source to move after a bit the fingers of her left hand twitched yes a few minutes more and she could lift her hand only a feeble inch before it fell again but it had lifted with an effort she could turn her head fight it nynaeve mumbled thickly barely intelligible her hands were gripping the coverlet under her tightly she seemed to be trying to sit up not even her head lifted but she was trying i am elayne tried to say it sounded more like a grunt to her ears slowly she managed to raise her hand to where she could see it and hold it there a thrill of triumph shot through her stay afraid of us luci stay down there in the kitchen a little while longer and the door banged open and sobs of frustration racked her as luci dashed in she had been so close the girl took one look at them and with a yelp of pure terror darted for the highchest elayne tried to fight her but thin as she was luci batted her floundering hands away effortlessly forced the funnel between her teeth just as easily the girl panted as if running cold bitter tea filled elaynes mouth she stared up at the girl in a panic that lucis face shared but luci held elaynes mouth shut and stroked her throat with a grim if fearful determination until she swallowed as darkness overwhelmed elayne she could hear liquid sounds of protest coming from nynaeve when her eyes opened again luci was gone and the sands trickled through the glass again nynaeves dark eyes were bulging whether in fear or anger elayne could not have said no nynaeve would not give in that was one of the things she admired in the other woman nynaeves head could have been on the chopping block and she would not give up our heads are on the block it made her ashamed that she was so much weaker than nynaeve she was supposed to be queen of andor one day and she wanted to howl with terror she did not even in her head doggedly she went back to trying to force her limbs to move to trying to touch saidar but she wanted to how could she ever be a queen when she was so weak again she reached for the source again again racing the grains of sand again once more the glass emptied itself without luci ever so slowly she reached the point where she could raise her hand again and then her head even if it did flop back immediately she could hear nynaeve muttering to herself and she could actually understand most of the words the door crashed open once more elayne lifted her head to stare at it despairingly and gaped thom merrilin stood there like the hero of one of his own tales one hand firmly gripping the neck of a luci near fainting the other holding a knife ready to throw elayne laughed delightedly though it came out more like a croak roughly he shoved the girl into a corner you stay there or ill strop this blade on your hide in two steps he was at elaynes side smoothing her hair back worry painting his leathery face what did you give them girl tell me or not her nynaeve muttered other one went away help me up have to walk thom left her reluctantly elayne thought he showed luci his knife again threateningly she cowered as if she never meant to move again then made it disappear up his sleeve in a twinkling hauling nynaeve to her feet he began walking her up and down the few paces the room allowed she sagged against him limply shuffling i am glad to hear this frightened little cat didnt trap you he said if she had been the one he shook his head no doubt he would think just as little of them if nynaeve told him the truth elayne certainly did not intend to i found her rushing up the stairs so panicked she did not even hear me behind her i am not so glad that another one got away without juilin seeing her is she likely to bring others back elayne rolled over onto her side i do not think so thom she mumbled she cant let too many people know about herself in another minute she might be able to sit up she was looking right at luci the girl flinched and tried to shrink through the wall the whitecloaks would take her as quickly as they would us juilin nynaeve said her head wavered as she glared up at the gleeman she had no trouble speaking though i told the pair of you to stay with the wagon thom blew out his mustaches irritably you told us to put up the supplies which did not take two men juilin followed you and when none of you came back i went looking for him he snorted again for all he knew there were a dozen men in here but he was ready to come in after you alone he is tying skulker in the back a good thing i decided to ride in i think well need the horse to get you two out of here elayne found that she could sit up barely pulling herself hand over hand along the coverlet but an effort to stand nearly put her flat again saidar was as unobtainable as ever her head still felt like a goosedown pillow nynaeve was beginning to hold herself a little straighter to lift her feet but she still hung on thom minutes later juilin arrived pushing mistress macura ahead of him with his belt knife she came through a gate in the back fence thought i was a thief it seemed best to bring her on in the seamstress face had gone so pale at the sight of them that her eyes seemed darker and about to come out of her head besides she licked her lips and smoothed her skirt incessantly and cast quick little glances at juilins knife as if wondering whether it might not be best to run anyway for the most part though she stared at elayne and nynaeve elayne thought it an even chance whether she would burst into tears or swoon put her over there nynaeve said nodding to where luci still shivered in the corner with her arms wrapped around her knees and help elayne i never heard of forkroot but walking seems to help the effects pass you can walk most things off juilin pointed to the corner with his knife and mistress macura scurried to it and sat herself down beside luci still wetting her lips fearfully i would not have done what i did only i had orders you must understand that i had orders gently helping elayne to her feet juilin supported her in walking the few steps available crisscrossing the other pair she wished it were thom juilins arm around her waist was much too familiar orders from whom nynaeve barked who do you report to in the tower the seamstress looked sick but she clamped her mouth shut determinedly if you dont talk nynaeve told her scowling ill let juilin have you hes a tairen thiefcatcher and he knows how to bring out a confession as quickly as any whitecloak questioner dont you juilin some rope to tie her he said grinning a grin so villainous that elayne almost tried to step away from him some rags to gag her until she is ready to talk some cooking oil and salt his chuckle curdled elaynes blood she will talk mistress macura held herself rigidly against the wall staring at him eyes as wide as they would go luci looked at him as if he had just turned into a trolloc eight feet tall and complete with horns very well nynaeve said after a moment you should find everything you need in the kitchen juilin elayne shifted a startled look from her to the thiefcatcher and back surely they did not really mean to not nynaeve narenwin barda the seamstress gasped suddenly words tripped over one another spilling out of her i send my reports to narenwin barda at an inn in tar valon called the upriver run avi shendar keeps pigeons for me on the edge of town he doesnt know who i send messages to or who i get them from and he does not care his wife had the falling sickness and she trailed off shuddering and watching juilin elayne knew narenwin or at least had seen her in the tower a thin little woman you could forget was there she was so quiet and kind too one day a week she let children bring their pets to the tower grounds for her to heal hardly the sort of woman to be black ajah on the other hand one of the black ajah names they knew was marillin gemalphin she liked cats and went out of her way to look after strays narenwin barda nynaeve said grimly i want more names inside the tower or out i dont have any more mistress macura said faintly we will see about that how long have you been a darkfriend how long have you served the black ajah an indignant squall erupted from luci we arent darkfriends she glanced at mistress macura and sidled away from her at least im not i walk in the light i do the other womans reaction was no less strong if her eyes had bulged before they popped now the black you mean it really exists but the tower has always denied why i asked narenwin the day she chose me for the yellows eyesandears and it was the next morning before i could stop weeping and crawl out of my bed i am not not a darkfriend never i serve the yellow ajah the yellow still hanging on to juilins arm elayne exchanged puzzled looks with nynaeve any darkfriend would deny it of course but there seemed a ring of truth in the womens voices their outrage at the accusation was nearly enough to overcome their fear from the way nynaeve hesitated she heard the same thing if you serve the yellow she said slowly why did you drug us it was her the seamstress replied nodding at elayne i was sent her description a month since right down to that way she holds her chin sometimes so she seems to be looking down at you narenwin said she might use the name elayne and even claim to be of a noble house word by word her anger over being called a darkfriend seemed to bubble higher maybe you are a yellow sister but shes no aes sedai just a runaway accepted narenwin said i was to report her presence and that of anyone with her and to delay her if i could or even capture her and anyone with her how they expected me to capture an accepted i do not know i dont think even narenwin knows about my forkroot tea but that is what my orders said they said i should risk exposure even here where itd be my death if i had to you just wait until the amyrlin puts her hands on you young woman on all of you the amyrlin elayne exclaimed what does she have to do with this it was on her orders by order of the amyrlin seat it said it said the amyrlin herself said i could use any means short of killing you you will wish you were dead when the amyrlin gets hold of you her sharp nod was full of furious satisfaction remember that we are not in anyones hands yet nynaeve said dryly you are in ours her eyes looked as shocked as elayne felt though was any reason given the reminder that she was the captive sapped the brief burst of spirit from the woman she sagged listlessly against luci each keeping the other from falling over no sometimes narenwin gives a reason but not this time did you intend to just keep us here drugged until someone came for us i was going to send you off by cart dressed in some old clothes not even a shred of resistance remained in the womans voice i sent a pigeon to tell narenwin you were here and what i was doing therin lugay owes me a strong favor and i meant to give him enough forkroot to last all the way to tar valon if narenwin didnt send sisters to meet you sooner he thinks you are ill and the tea is the only thing keeping you alive until an aes sedai can heal you a woman has to be careful dealing in remedies in amadicia cure too many or too well somebody whispers aes sedai and the next you know your house is burning down or worse therin knows to hold his tongue about what he nynaeve made thom help her closer where she could stare down at the seamstress and the message the real message you did not put that signal out in the hope of luring us in i gave you the real message the woman said wearily i did not think it could do any harm i dont understand it and i please suddenly she was sobbing clinging to luci as hard as the younger woman did to her both of them wailing and babbling please dont let him use the salt on me please not the salt oh please tie them up nynaeve said disgustedly after a moment and we will go downstairs where we can talk thom helped her to sit on the edge of the nearest bed then quickly cut strips from the other coverlet in short order both women were bound back to back the hands of one to the feet of the other with wadded bits of coverlet tied in for gags the pair were still weeping when thom assisted nynaeve from the room elayne wished she could walk as well as the other woman but she still needed juilins support not to go tumbling down the stairs she felt a small stab of jealousy watching thom with his arm around nynaeve you are a foolish little girl linis voice said sharply i am a grown woman she told it with a firmness she would not have dared with her old nurse even today i do love rand but he is far away and thom is sophisticated and intelligent and it sounded too much like excuses even to her lini would have given the snort that meant she was about to stop tolerating foolishness juilin she asked hesitantly what were you going to do with the salt and cooking oil not exactly she added more quickly just a general idea he looked at her for a moment i do not know but they did not either that is the trick of it their minds made up worse than i ever could i have seen a tough man break when i sent for a basket of figs and some mice you have to be careful though some will confess anything true or not just to escape what they imagine i do not think those two did though she did not either she could not repress a shiver however what would somebody do with figs and mice she hoped she stopped wondering before she gave herself nightmares by the time they reached the kitchen nynaeve was tottering about without help poking into the cupboard full of colorful canisters elayne needed one of the chairs the blue canister sat on the table and a full green teapot but she tried not to look at them she still could not channel she could embrace saidar yet it slipped away as soon as she did at least she was confident now that the power would return to her the alternative was too horrible to contemplate and she had not let herself until this moment thom nynaeve said lifting the lids on various containers and peering in juilin she paused took a deep breath and still not looking at the two men said thank you i begin to see why aes sedai have warders thank you very much not all aes sedai did reds considered all men tainted because of what men who could channel did and a few never bothered because they did not leave the tower or simply did not replace a warder who died the greens were the only ajah to allow bonding with more than one warder elayne wanted to be a green not for that reason of course but because the greens called themselves the battle ajah where browns searched for lost knowledge and blues involved themselves in causes green sisters held themselves ready for the last battle when they would go forth as they had in the trolloc wars to face new dreadlords the two men stared at one another in open amazement they had surely been ready for the usual rough side of nynaeves tongue elayne was almost as shocked nynaeve liked having to be helped as much as she liked being wrong either made her as prickly as a briar though of course she always claimed to be a picture of sweet reason and sense a wisdom nynaeve took a pinch of powder from one of the canisters and sniffed it touched it to the tip of her tongue or whatever they call it here they dont have a name for it here thom said not many women follow your old craft in amadicia too dangerous for most of those its only a sideline pulling a leather scrip from the bottom of the cupboard nynaeve began making up small bundles from some of the containers and who do they go to when theyre ill a hedgedoctor yes elayne said it always pleased her to show thom that she knew things about the world too in amadicia it is men who study herbs nynaeve frowned scornfully what could a man ever know about curing anything id as soon ask a farmer to make a dress abruptly elayne realized that she had been thinking of anything and everything except what mistress macura had said not thinking about a thorn doesnt make it hurt your foot less one of linis favorites nynaeve what do you think that message means all sisters are welcome to return to the tower it makes no sense that was not what she wanted to say but at least she was closing in on it the tower has its own rules thom said what aes sedai do they do for reasons of their own and often not for those they give if they give reasons at all he and juilin knew they were only accepted of course that was at least part of why neither man did as he was told nearly as well as he might the struggle was plain on nynaeves face she did not like being interrupted or people answering for her there was quite a list of things nynaeve did not like but it was only a moment since she had thanked thom it could not be easy to call down a man who had just saved you from being hauled off like a cabbage very little in the tower makes sense most of the time she said sourly elayne suspected that the tartness was as much for thom as the tower do you believe what she said elayne took a deep breath about the amyrlin saying i was to be brought back by any means the brief look nynaeve gave her was touched with sympathy i dont know elayne she was telling the truth juilin turned one of the chairs around and straddled it leaning his staff against the back ive questioned enough thieves and murderers to know truth when i hear it part of the time she was too frightened to lie and the rest too angry the pair of you taking a deep breath nynaeve tossed the scrip onto the table and folded her arms as if to trap her hands away from her braid i am afraid juilin is probably right elayne but the amyrlin knows what we are doing she sent us out of the tower in the first place nynaeve sniffed loudly i can believe anything of siuan sanche i would like to have her for one hour where she could not channel we would see how tough she is then elayne did not think that would make any difference remembering that commanding blue gaze she suspected nynaeve would earn a fine lot of bruises in the unlikely event that she ever got her wish but what are we going to do about it the ajahs have eyesandears everywhere it seems and the amyrlin herself we could have women trying to slip things into our food all the way to tar valon not if we do not look like what they expect lifting a yellow jug out of the cupboard nynaeve set it on the table beside the teapot this is white henpepper it will soothe a toothache but it will also turn your hair black as night elayne put a hand to her redgold tresses her hair not nynaeves she would wager but as much as she hated the idea it was a good one a little needlework on some of those dresses in the front and we are not merchants anymore but two ladies traveling with their servants riding on a wagonload of dye juilin said her level look said gratitude for saving her extended only so far there is a coach in a stableyard on the other side of the bridge i think the owner will sell it if you go back to the wagon before somebody steals it i do not know what got into you two just leaving it for whoever came along if it is still there you can take one of the purses a few people goggled when noy torvalds coach pulled up in front of ronde macuras shop drawn by a team of four with chests strapped to the roof and a saddled horse tied on behind noy had lost everything when the trade with tarabon collapsed he was scraping a living doing odd jobs for widow teran now no one in the street had ever seen the coachman before a tall leathery fellow with long white mustaches and cold imperious eyes or the dark hardfaced footman in a taraboner hat who jumped down nimbly to open the coach door the goggling turned to murmurs when two women swept out of the shop with bundles in their arms one wore a green silk gown the other plain blue wool but each had a scarf wrapped around her head so that not so much as a hint of her hair was visible they all but leaped into the coach two of the children began sauntering over to inquire who the strangers were but while the footman was still scrambling up to the drivers seat the coachman cracked his long whip shouting something about making way for a lady her name was lost as the children threw themselves out of the way tumbling in the dusty street and the coach rumbled away at a gallop toward the amador road the onlookers walked away talking among themselves a mysterious lady obviously with her maid making purchases from ronde macura and rushing away from the children little enough happened in mardecin of late and this would provide days of conversation the children of the light brushed themselves off furiously but finally decided that reporting the incident would make them look foolish besides their captain did not like nobles he would probably send them to bring the coach back a long ride in the heat for no more than an arrogant young sprig of one house or another if no charges could be brought always tricky with the nobility it would not be the captain who took the blame hoping that word of their humiliation did not spread they certainly never thought of questioning ronde macura a short time later therin lugay led his cart into the yard behind the shop provisions for the long journey ahead already packed away under the round canvas top indeed ronde macura had cured him of a fever that had taken twentythree the winter before but it was a nagging wife and a shrewish motherinlaw that made him glad of a journey all the way to where the witches lived ronde had said someone might meet him though not who but he hoped to make it to tar valon he tapped on the kitchen door six times before going in but it was not until he climbed the stairs that he found anyone in the back bedroom ronde and luci lay stretched out on the beds sound asleep and fully clothed if rather rumpled with the sun still in the sky neither woman roused when he shook them he did not understand that or why one of the coverlets was lying on the floor cut into knotted strips or why there were two empty teapots in the room but only one cup or why a funnel was lying on rondes pillow but he had always known that there was a great deal in the world he did not understand returning to his cart he thought about the supplies rondes money had purchased thought of his wife and her mother and when he led the cart horse off it was with the intention of seeing what altara was like or maybe murandy one way and another it was quite a time before a disheveled ronde macura tottered up to avi shendars house and sent off a pigeon a thin bone tube tied to its leg the bird launched itself north and east straight as an arrow toward tar valon after a moments thought ronde prepared another copy on another narrow strip of thin parchment and fastened it to a bird from another coop that one headed west for she had promised to send duplicates of all of her messages in these hard times a woman had to make out as best she could and there could be no harm in it not the sort of reports she made to narenwin wondering if she could ever get the taste of forkroot out of her mouth she would not have minded if the report brought just a little harm to the one who called herself nynaeve hoeing in his garden patch as usual avi paid no attention to what ronde did and as usual as soon as she was gone he washed his hands and went inside she had placed a larger sheet of parchment underneath the strips to cushion the nib of the pen when he held it up to the afternoon light he could make out what she had written soon a third pigeon was on its way heading in still another direction chapter flame of tar valon the nine horse hitch a wide straw hat shaded siuans face as she let logain lead the way through lugards shilene gate under the lateafternoon sun the citys tall gray outer walls were in some disrepair in two places she could see tumbled stone lowered the wall to no more than a tall fence min and leane rode close behind her both tired from the pace the man had set over the weeks since kore springs he wanted to be in charge and it took little enough to convince him that he was if he said when they started of a morning when and where they stopped of a night if he kept the money even if he expected them to serve his meals as well as cook them it was of little account to her all in all she felt sorry for him he had no idea what she planned for him a big fish on the hook to catch a bigger she thought grimly in name lugard was the capital of murandy the seat of king roedran but lords in murandy spoke the words of fealty then refused to pay their taxes or do much of anything else that roedran wanted and the people did the same murandy was a nation in name only the people barely held together by supposed allegiance to the king or queen the throne changed hands at sometimes short intervals and fear that andor or illian might snap them up if they did not hold together in some fashion stone walls crisscrossed the city most in a worse state than the outer bastions for lugard had grown haphazardly over the centuries and more than once had actually been divided among feuding nobles it was a dirty city many of the broad streets unpaved and all of them dusty men in highcrowned hats and aproned women in skirts that showed their ankles dodged between merchants lumbering trains while children played in wagon ruts trade kept lugard alive trade up from illian and ebou dar from ghealdan to the west and andor to the north large bare patches of ground through the city held wagons parked wheeltowheel many heavyladen under strappeddown canvas covers others empty and awaiting freight inns lined the main streets along with horse lots and stables nearly outnumbering the gray stone houses or shops all roofed with tiles in blue or red or purple or green dust and noise filled the air clanging from the smithies the rumble of wagons and curses of the drivers boisterous laughter from the inns the sun baked lugard as it slid toward the horizon and the air felt as though it might never rain again when logain finally turned in to a stableyard and dismounted behind a greenroofed inn called the nine horse hitch siuan clambered down from bela gratefully and gave the shaggy mare a doubtful pat on the nose wary of teeth in her view sitting on the back of an animal was no way to travel a boat went as you turned the rudder a horse might decide to think for itself boats never bit either bela had not so far but she could at least those awful first days of stiffness were gone when she was sure leane and min were grinning behind her back as she hobbled about in the evening camp after a day in the saddle she still felt as if she had been thoroughly beaten but she managed to hide it as soon as logain began bargaining with the stableman a lanky freckled old fellow in a leather vest and no shirt siuan sidled close to leane if you want to practice your wiles she said softly practice them on dalyn the next hour leane gave her a dubious look she had dabbled in smiles and glances at some of the villages since kore springs but logain had gotten no more than a flat look then sighed and nodded taking a deep breath she glided forward in that startling sinuous way leading her archnecked gray and already smiling at logain siuan could not see how she did that it was as if some of her bones were no longer rigid moving over to min she spoke just as quietly again the instant dalyn is done with the stableman tell him you are going to join me inside then hurry ahead and stay away from him and amaena until i come back from the noise roaring out of the inn the crowd inside was big enough to hide an army surely big enough to hide the absence of one woman min got that mulish look about her eyes and opened her mouth no doubt to demand why siuan forestalled her just do it serenla or ill let you add cleaning his boots to handing him his plate the stubborn look remained but min gave a sullen nod pushing belas reins into the other womans hands siuan hurried out of the stable yard and started down the street in what she hoped was the right direction she did not want to have to search the entire city not in this heat and dust heavy wagons behind teams of six or eight or even ten filled the streets drivers cracking long whips and cursing equally at the horses and at the people who darted between the wagons roughly dressed men mingling through the crowds in lone wagondrivers coats sometimes directed laughing invitations at women who passed them the women who wore colorful aprons sometimes striped their heads wrapped in bright scarves walked on with eyes straight ahead as though they did not hear women without aprons hair hanging loose around their shoulders and skirts sometimes ending a foot or more clear of the ground often shouted back even ruder replies siuan gave a start when she realized that some of the mens suggestions were aimed at her they did not make her angry she really could not apply them to herself in her own mind only startled she was still not used to the changes in herself that men might find her attractive her reflection in the filthy window of a tailors shop caught her eye not much more than a murky image of a fairskinned girl under a straw hat she was young not just youngappearing as far as she could tell but young not much older than min a girl in truth from the vantage of the years she had actually lived an advantage to having been stilled she told herself she had met women who would pay any price to lose fifteen or twenty years some might even consider her price a fair bargain she often found herself listing such advantages perhaps trying to convince herself they were real freed from the three oaths she could lie at need for one thing and her own father would not have recognized her she did not really look as she had as a young woman the changes maturity had made were still there but softened into youth coldly objective she thought she might be somewhat prettier than she had been as a girl pretty was the best that had ever been said of her handsome had been the more usual compliment she could not connect that face to her to siuan sanche only inside was she still the same her mind yet held all its knowledge there in her head she was still herself some of the inns and taverns in lugard had names like the farriers hammer or the dancing bear or the silver pig often with garish signs painted to match others had names that should not have been allowed the mildest of that sort being the domani wenchs kiss with a painting of a copperyskinned woman bare to the waist with her lips puckered siuan wondered what leane would make of that but the way the woman was now it might only give her notions at last on a side street just as wide as the main just beyond a gateless opening in one of the collapsing inner walls she found the inn she wanted three stories of rough gray stone topped with purple roof tiles the sign over the door had an improbably voluptuous woman wearing only her hair arranged to hide as little as possible astride a barebacked horse and a name that she skipped over as soon as she recognized it inside the common room was blue with pipesmoke packed with raucous men drinking and laughing trying to pinch serving maids who dodged as best they could with longsuffering smiles barely audible over the babble a zither and a flute accompanied a young woman singing and dancing on a table at one end of the long room occasionally the singer swirled her skirts high enough to show nearly the whole length of her bare legs what siuan could catch of her song made her want to wash out the girls mouth why would a woman go walking with no clothes on why would a woman sing about it to a lot of drunken louts it was not a sort of place she had ever been into before she intended to make this visit as brief as possible there was no mistaking the inns owner a tall heavyset woman encased in a red silk dress that practically glowed elaborate dyed curls nature had never produced that shade of red surely never with such dark eyes framed a thrusting chin and a hard mouth in between shouting orders to the serving girls she stopped at this table or that to speak a few words or slap a back and laugh with her patrons siuan held herself stiffly and tried to ignore the considering looks men gave her as she approached the crimsonhaired woman mistress tharne she had to repeat the name three times each louder than the last before the inns owner looked at her mistress tharne i want a job singing i can sing you can can you now the big woman laughed well i have a singer but i can always use another to give her a rest let me be seeing your legs i can sing the song of the three fishes siuan said loudly this had to be the right woman surely two women in one city could not have hair like that not and answer to the right name at the right inn mistress tharne laughed harder still and slapped one of the men at the nearest table on the shoulder jolting him half off his bench not much call for that one here eh pel gaptoothed pel a wagon drivers whip curled around his shoulder cackled with her and i can sing blue sky dawning the woman shook scrubbing at her eyes as though she had laughed herself to tears can you now ah im sure the lads will love that now let me see your legs your legs girl or get out siuan hesitated but mistress tharne only stared at her and an increasing number of the men did too this had to be the right woman slowly she pulled her skirt up to her knees the tall woman gestured impatiently closing her eyes siuan gathered more and more of her skirt in her hands she felt her face growing redder by the inch a modest one mistress tharne chortled well if those songs are the extent of your knowledge youd better have legs to make a man fall on his face cant tell till we get those woolen stockings off her eh pel well come on with me maybe you have a voice anyway but i cant hear it in here come on girl hustle your rump siuans eyes snapped open blazing but the big woman was already striding toward the back of the common room backbone like an iron rod siuan let her skirts fall and followed trying to ignore the guffaws and lewd suggestions directed at her her face was stone but inside worry warred with anger before being raised to the amyrlin seat she had run the blue ajahs network of eyesandears some had also been her own personal listeners both then and later she might no longer be amyrlin or even aes sedai but she still knew all of those agents duranda tharne had already been serving the blue when she took over the network a woman whose information was always timely eyesandears were not to be found everywhere and their reliability varied there had been only one that she trusted enough to approach between tar valon and here at four kings in andor and she had vanished but a vast amount of news and rumor passed through lugard with the merchants wagon trains there might be eyesandears for other ajahs here it would be well to remember that caution gets the boat home she reminded herself this woman fit the description of duranda tharne perfectly and surely no other inn could have a name so vile but why had she responded as she did when siuan identified herself as another agent of the blue she had to risk it min and leane in their own fashion were growing as impatient as logain caution got the boat home but sometimes boldness brought back a full hold at the worst she could knock the woman over the head with something and escape out the back eyeing the womans width and height and the firmness of her thick arms she hoped that she could a plain door in the corridor that led to the kitchens opened into a sparsely furnished room a desk and one chair on a scrap of blue carpet a large mirror on one wall and surprisingly a short shelf with a few books as soon as the door was shut behind them diminishing if not cutting off the noise of the common room the big woman rounded on siuan fists planted on ample hips now then what do you want with me dont bother giving me a name i dont want to know whether its yours or not a little of the tension oozed out of siuan not the anger though you had no right to treat me in that manner out there what did you mean forcing me to i had every right mistress tharne snapped and every necessity if youd come at opening or closing as youre supposed to i could have hustled you in here and none the wiser do you think some of those men wouldnt be wondering if i escorted you back here like a longlost friend i cant afford to have anyone wondering about me youre lucky i didnt make you take susus place on the table for a song or two and you watch your manner with me she raised a wide hard hand threateningly ive married daughters older than you and when i visit them they step right and talk proper you come mistress snip with me and youll be learning why nobody out there will even hear you yelp and if they did they wouldnt interfere with a sharp nod as if that were settled she put fists on hips again now what do you want several times during the onslaught siuan had tried to speak but the woman rolled over her like a tidal wave that was not something she was accustomed to by the time mistress tharne was done she quivered with anger both hands held her skirts in a whiteknuckled grip she held on to her temper every bit as hard i am supposed to be just another agent she reminded herself firmly not the amyrlin anymore just another agent besides she suspected that the woman might carry out her threat this was something else still new to her having to be wary of someone under her eye just because they were larger and stronger i was given a message to deliver to a gathering of those we serve she hoped mistress tharne took the strain in her voice for being cowed the woman might be more helpful if she thought siuan properly intimidated they were not where i was told to find them i can only hope you know something to help me find them folding her arms under a massive bosom mistress tharne studied her know how to hold your temper when it suits eh good whats happened in the tower and dont try denying you come from there my fine haughty wench your message has courier writ large all over it and you never got that snooty manner in a village siuan drew a deep breath before answering siuan sanche has been stilled her voice did not even tremble she was proud of that elaida aroihan is the new amyrlin she could not keep a hint of bite out of that however mistress tharnes face showed no reaction well that explains some of the orders ive gotten some of them maybe stilled her did they i thought shed be amyrlin forever i saw her once a few years ago in caemlyn at a distance she looked like she could chew harness straps for breakfast those impossible scarlet curls swung as she shook her head well dones done the ajahs have split havent they only thing that fits my orders and the old buzzard stilled the towers broken and the blues are running siuan ground her teeth she tried telling herself the woman was loyal to the blue ajah not to her personally but it did not help old buzzard shes old enough to be my mother and if she was id drown myself with an effort she made her voice meek my message is important i must be on my way as soon as possible can you help me important is it well im doubting it trouble is i can give you something but its up to you to cipher it out do you want it the woman refused to make this any easier yes please sallie daera i dont know who she is or was but i was told to give her name to any blue who came around looking lost so to speak you may not be one of the sisters but you carry your nose high enough for one so there it is sallie daera make of it what you will siuan suppressed a thrill of excitement and made her face dejected i never heard of her either ill just have to go on looking if you find them you tell aeldene sedai im still loyal whatevers happened ive worked for the blues so long i wouldnt know what to do with myself else i will tell her siuan said she had not known that aeldene was her replacement controlling the blues eyesandears the amyrlin whatever ajah she came from was of all but part of none i suppose you need some reason for not hiring me i really cannot sing that should do as if it mattered to that lot out there the big woman quirked an eyebrow and grinned in a way siuan did not like ill think of something wench and ill give you a bit of advice if you dont climb down a rung or two some aes sedai will take you down the whole ladder im surprised it hasnt been done already now go on get out of here hateful woman siuan growled in her head if there was a way to manage it id have her doing penance till her eyes popped the woman thought she deserved more respect did she thank you for your help she said coolly making a curtsy that would have graced any court you have been too kind she was three steps into the common room when mistress tharne appeared behind her raising her voice in a laughing shout that cut through the noise a shy maiden that one legs white and slender enough to set you all drooling and she bawled like a baby when i told her shed have to show them to you just sat right down on the floor and cried hips round enough for any taste and she siuan stumbled as the tide of laughter rose never quite drowning out the womans recitation she managed another three steps face red as a beet then fled at a run in the street she paused to get her breath back and let her heart stop pounding that horrible old harridan i should it did not matter what she should do that disgusting woman had told her what she needed not sallie daera not a woman at all only a blue would know or even suspect salidar birthplace of deane aryman the blue sister who had become amyrlin after bonwhin and had rescued the tower from the ruin bonwhin had poised it for salidar one of the last places anyone would look for aes sedai short of amadicia itself two men in snowy cloaks and brightly burnished mail were riding down the street toward her reluctantly moving their horses aside for wagons children of the light they could be found everywhere these days tipping her head down watching the whitecloaks cautiously from beneath the brim of her hat siuan moved closer to the blueandgreen front of the inn they glanced at her as they rode by hard faces beneath shining conical helmets and passed on siuan bit her lip in vexation she had probably called their attention to her by shrinking back and if they had seen her face nothing of course whitecloaks might try to kill an aes sedai they found alone but hers was an aes sedai face no longer only they had seen her try to hide from them if duranda tharne had not upset her so she would not have made such a foolish error she could remember when a little thing like mistress tharnes remarks would not have made her stride waver in the least when that overgrown dyed fishwife would not have dared say a word of it if that termagant doesnt like my manner ill what she would do was continue about the business she was on before mistress tharne pummeled her so she could not sit a saddle sometimes it was hard remembering that the days were gone when she could call kings or queens and have them come striding down the street she glared so hard that some of the wagon drivers bit back the comments they had been going to make to a pretty young woman alone some of them did min sat on a bench against the wall of the crowded common room in the nine horse hitch watching a table surrounded by standing men some with coiled drivers whips others wearing the swords that marked them merchants guards six more sat shoulder to shoulder around the table she could just make out logain and leane sitting on the far side he wore a disgruntled frown the other men hung on leanes every smiling word the air was thick with pipesmoke and full of chatter that nearly drowned the music of flute and tambour and the singing of a girl dancing on a table between the stone fireplaces her song had to do with a woman convincing six men that each was the only man in her life min found it interesting even when it made her blush the singer darted jealous glances at the crowded table from time to time or rather at leane the tall domani woman had already been leading logain by the nose when they entered the inn and she had attracted more men like flies to honey with that swaying walk and the smoldering light in her eyes there had very nearly been a riot logain and the merchants guards with hands on swords knives being drawn the stout proprietor and two heavily muscled fellows rushing in with cudgels and leane had doused the flames much as she had ignited them with a smile here a few words there a pat on the cheek even the innkeeper had lingered awhile grinning like a fool until his custom called him away and leane thought she needed practice it hardly seemed fair if i could do that to one particular man id be more than satisfied maybe shed teach me light what am i thinking she had always been herself and everyone else could accept her as she was or not now she was thinking about changing what she was for a man it was bad enough that she had to hide herself in a dress instead of the coat and breeches she had always worn hed look at you in a dress with neckline cut low youve more to show than leane does and she stop that we have to go south siuan said at her shoulder and min gave a start she had not seen the other woman come in now from the shine in siuans blue eyes she had learned something whether she would share it was another matter the woman seemed to think she was still amyrlin most of the time we cannot reach anywhere else with an inn before nightfall min said we might as well take rooms here for the night it was pleasant to sleep in a bed again instead of under hedges and in haystacks even if she did usually have to share it with leane and siuan logain was willing to rent them all rooms but siuan was tight with their coin even when logain was doling it out siuan looked around but whoever in the common room was not staring at leane was listening to the singer that isnt possible i i think some whitecloaks may be asking questions about me min whistled softly dalyn wont like that then do not tell him siuan shook her head at the gathering about leane just tell amaena that we have to go hell follow let us just hope the rest dont as well min grinned wryly siuan might claim that she did not care that logaindalyn had taken charge mostly by just ignoring her whenever she tried to make him do anything but she was still determined to bring him to heel again what is a nine horse hitch anyway she asked getting to her feet she had gone out front hoping for a hint but the sign over the door bore only the name i have seen eight and ten but never nine in this town siuan said primly it is better not to ask sudden spots of color in her cheeks made min think that she knew very well go fetch them weve a long way to go and no time to waste and dont let anyone overhear you min snorted softly with that small smile on leanes face none of those men would even see her she wished she knew how siuan had brought herself to the whitecloaks attention that was the last thing they needed and it was not like siuan to make mistakes she wished she knew how to make rand look at her like those men were looking at leane if they were going to be riding all night and she suspected they were maybe leane would be willing to give her a few tips chapter bull an old pipe a gust of wind swirling dust down the lugard street caught gareth brynes velvet hat sweeping it from his head directly under one of the lumbering wagons an ironrimmed wheel ground the hat into the hard clay of the street leaving a flattened ruin behind for a moment he stared at it then walked on it was showing travel stains anyway he told himself his silk coat had been dusty before reaching murandy too brushing no longer did much good when he even took the trouble it looked more brown than gray now he should find something plainer he was not on his way to a ball dodging between wagons rumbling down the rutted street he ignored the drivers curses that followed him any decent squadman could give better in his sleep and ducked into a redroofed inn called the wagon seat the painting on the sign gave the name an explicit interpretation the common room was like every common room he had seen in lugard wagon drivers and merchants guards packed in with stablemen farriers laborers every sort of man all talking or laughing as loud as they could while drinking as much as they could one hand for the cup and one to fondle the serving girls for that matter it was not all that much different from common rooms and taverns in many other towns though most were considerably milder a buxom young woman in a blouse that seemed about to fall off capered and sang atop a table at one side of the room to the supposed music of two flutes and a twelvestring bittern he had little ear for music but he paused a moment to appreciate her song she would have gone over well in any soldiers camp he had ever seen but then she would have been as popular if she could not sing a note wearing that blouse she would have found a husband in short order joni and barim were already there jonis size enough to grant them a table by themselves despite his thin hair and the bandage he still wore around his temples they were listening to the girl sing or at least staring at her he touched each man on the shoulder and nodded toward the side door that led to the stableyard where a sullen groom with a squint delivered their horses for three silver pennies a year or so earlier bryne could have bought a fair horse for no more the troubles to the west and in cairhien were playing havoc with trade and prices no one spoke until they passed the city gates and were on a seldomtraveled road winding north toward the river storn little more than a wide dirt track then barim said they was here yesterday my lord bryne had learned that much himself three pretty young women together obvious outlanders could not pass through a city like lugard without being remarked by men anyway them and a fellow with shoulders barim went on sounds maybe like that dalyn was with them when they burned down nems barn anyway whoever he is they was at the nine horse hitch for a bit but all they did was drink some and leave that domani girl the lads was telling me about she nearly kicked up a fuss flashing her smile and swaying about but then she calmed everything down again the same way burn me but id like to meet me a domani woman did you hear which way they went barim bryne asked patiently he had not been able to learn that uh no my lord but i heard theres been plenty of whitecloaks passing through all heading west you think maybe old pedron nialls planning something maybe in altara thats not our business anymore barim bryne knew his patience sounded a little frayed this time but barim was an old enough campaigner to stick to the matter at hand i know where they went my lord joni said west on the jehannah road and pushing hard by what i heard he sounded troubled my lord i found two merchants guards lads who used to be in the guards and had a drink with them happens they were in a stew called the good nights ride when that girl mara came in and asked for a job singing she didnt get it didnt want to show her legs the way the singers in most of these places do as who can blame her and she left from what barim told me it was right after that they all set off west i dont like it my lord she isnt the kind of girl to want a job in a place like that i think shes trying to get away from that dalyn fellow strangely despite the lump on his head joni had no animosity toward the three young women it was his opinion often expressed since leaving the manor that the girls were in some sort of predicament and needed to be rescued bryne suspected that if he did catch up to the young women and take them back to his estate joni would be after him to turn them over to jonis daughters to mother barim had no such feelings ghealdan he scowled or maybe altara or amadicia well kiss the dark one getting them back hardly seems worth the annoyance for a barn and some cows bryne said nothing they had followed the girl this far and murandy was a bad place for andormen too many border troubles over too many years only a fool would chase into murandy after an oathbreakers eyes how much bigger a fool to follow halfway across the world those lads i talked to joni said diffidently my lord it seems a lot of the old lads who who served under you are being sent off emboldened by brynes silence he went on lots of new fellows in lots those lads said at least four or five for everyone told he wasnt wanted anymore the sort that like to cause trouble more than stop it theres some calling themselves the white lions who only answer to this gaebril he spat to show what he thought of thatand a bunch more not part of the guards at all not house levies near as they could say gaebrils got ten times as many men under arms as there are guards and theyve all sworn to the throne of andor but not to the queen thats no longer our business either bryne said curtly barim had his tongue stuffed into his cheek the way he always did when he knew something he either did not want to tell or was not sure was important enough what is it barim out with it man the leatherfaced fellow stared at him in amazement barim had never figured out how bryne knew he was holding back well my lord some of the folks i talked to said some of those whitecloaks yesterday was asking questions about a girl sounds like that mara wanted to know who she was where she went like that i heard they got real interested when they learned she was gone if theyre after her she could be hanged before we ever find her if they have to go to the trouble of chasing her down they might not ask too many questions about whether shes really a darkfriend or whatever it is theyre after her for bryne frowned whitecloaks what would the children of the light want with mara he would never believe she was a darkfriend but then he had seen a babyfaced young fellow hanged in caemlyn a darkfriend who had been teaching children in the streets about the glories of the dark one the great lord of the dark he had called him the lad had killed nine of them in three years as near as could be discovered when they looked like turning him in no that girl is no darkfriend and ill stake my life on it whitecloaks were suspicious of everyone and if they took it into their heads that she had fled lugard to avoid them he booted traveler to a canter the bignosed bay gelding was not flashy but he had endurance and courage the other two caught up soon enough and they kept their mouths shut seeing the mood he was in two miles or so from lugard he turned off into a thicket of oak and leatherleaf the rest of his men had made a temporary camp here in a clear space under thick spreading oak limbs several small smokeless fires were burning they would take any opportunity to brew up some tea some were dozing sleep was another thing an old soldier never missed a chance to snatch those awake kicked the rest out of their naps and they all looked up at him for a moment he sat his saddle studying them gray hair and bald heads and age creased faces still hard and fit but even so he had been a fool to risk bringing them into murandy just because he had to know why a woman had broken an oath and maybe with whitecloaks after them no telling how far or how long from home before it was done if he turned back now they would have been gone more than a month before they saw kore springs again if he went on there was no guarantee the chase would stop short of the aryth ocean he should be taking these men and himself home he should he had no call to ask them to try snatching those girls out of whitecloak hands he could leave mara to whitecloak justice we will be heading west he announced and immediately there was a scramble of dousing fires with the tea and fastening pots to saddles we will have to press hard i mean to catch them in altara if i can but if not theres no telling where theyll lead us you could see jehannah or amador or ebou dar before were done he affected a laugh youll find out how tough you are if we reach ebou dar theyve taverns there where the barmaids skin illianers for dinner and spit whitecloaks for sport they laughed harder than the jest was worth we wont worry with you along my lord thad cackled stuffing his tin cup into his saddlebags his face was wrinkled like crumpled leather why i hear you had a runin with the amyrlin herself once and jar silvin kicked him on the ankle and he rounded on the younger man grayhaired but still younger with a clenched fist whyd you do that silvin you want a broke head you just what the meaningful glares silvin and some of the others were giving him finally sank in oh oh yes he buried himself in checking the girth straps on his saddle but no one was laughing anymore bryne forced his face to relax from stoniness it was time he put the past in the past just because a woman whose bed he had shared and more he had thought just because that woman looked at him as though she had never known him was no reason to stop speaking her name just because she had exiled him from caemlyn on pain of death for giving her the advice he had sworn to give if she came a cropper with this lord gaebril who had suddenly appeared in caemlyn it was no longer any concern of his she had told him in a voice as flat and cold as smooth ice that his name would never be spoken in the palace again that only his long service kept her from sending him to the headsman for treason treason he needed to keep spirits up especially if this turned into a long chase hooking a knee around the high cantle of his saddle he took out his pipe and pouch and filled his pipe with tabac the bowl was carved with a wild bull collared with the rose crown of andor for a thousand years that had been the sign of house bryne strength and courage in service of the queen he needed a new pipe this one was old i didnt come out of that as well as you might have heard he leaned down for one of the men to hand him a twig still glowing from one of the spent fires then straightened to puff his pipe alight it was some three years ago the amyrlin was making a progression cairhien tear illian and finishing up in caemlyn before returning to tar valon at that time we were having problems with murandian border lords as usual laughter rippled they had all served on the murandian border at one time or another i had sent some of the guards down to set the murandians straight on who owned the sheep and cattle on our side of the border i never expected the amyrlin to take an interest he certainly had their attention preparations to leave were still going on but more slowly siuan sanche and elaida closeted themselves with morgase there he had said her name again and it did not even smart and when they came out morgase was half thunderhead with lightning shooting out of her eyes and half tenyearold whod been hauled up by her mother for stealing honeycakes shes a tough woman but caught between elaida and the amyrlin seat he shook his head and they chuckled aes sedai attentions were one thing none of them envied lords and rulers she ordered me to remove all troops from the border with murandy immediately i asked her to discuss it with me in private and siuan sanche jumped all over me in front of half the court she chewed me up one side and down the other like a raw recruit said if i couldnt do as i was told shed use me for fishbait he had had to beg her pardon before it was done in front of everyone for trying to do as he had been sworn to do but there was no need to add that even at the end he had not been sure that she would not make morgase behead him or have it done herself must have meant to catch herself a mighty big fish someone laughed and others joined in the upshot was bryne went on my hide got singed and the guards were ordered back from the border so if youre looking to me to protect you in ebou dar just remember its my opinion those barmaids would hang the amyrlin out to dry along with the rest of us they roared with mirth did you ever find out what it was about my lord joni wanted to know bryne shook his head aes sedai business of some sort i expect they dont tell the likes of you and me what they are up to that earned a few chuckles as well they mounted up with an alacrity that belied their ages some of them are no older than me he thought wryly too old to go chasing after a pretty pair of eyes young enough to be his daughters if not his granddaughters i only want to know why she broke oath he told himself firmly only that raising his hand he signaled forward and they headed west leaving a trail of dust it would take hard riding to catch up but he meant to in ebou dar or the pit of doom he would find them chapter elephant a small room in sienda elayne held herself against the swaying of the coach on its leather hinges trying to ignore nynaeves sour face across from her the curtains were drawn back despite a sprinkling of dust that sometimes whipped through the windows the breeze blew away some of the lateafternoon heat rolling forested hills streamed past the woods occasionally broken by short stretches of farmland a lords manor in the fashion of amadicia topped one of the hills a few miles from the road a huge stone foundation fifty feet high with an elaborate wooden structure atop that all ornate balconies and redtiled roofs once it all would have been stone but many years had passed since a lord needed a fortress in amadicia and the kings law now required the wooden construction no rebel lord would be able to hold out against the king for long of course the children of the light were exempted from that law they were immune to a number of amadician laws she had had to learn something of the laws and customs of other countries from the time she was a child cleared fields dotted the distant hills too like brown patches on a mostly green cloth the men working them seeming ants everything looked dry one bolt of lightning would set a fire that could burn for leagues but lightning meant rain and the few clouds in the sky were too high and thin for that idly she wondered whether she could make it rain she had learned considerable control over weather still it was very difficult if you had to begin with nothing is my lady bored nynaeve asked acidly the way my lady is staring at the countryside down my ladys nose i think my lady must want to travel faster reaching back over her head she pushed open a small flap and shouted more speed thom dont argue with me you hold your tongue too juilin thiefcatcher i said more speed the wooden flap banged down but elayne could still hear thom muttering loudly cursing very likely nynaeve had been barking at the men all day a moment later his whip cracked and the coach racketed ahead even faster rocking so hard that both women bounced on the goldencolored silk seats the silk had been thoroughly dusted when thom bought the vehicle but the padding had long since gone hard yet jounced about as she was the set of nynaeves jaw said she would not ask thom to slow again right after ordering him to go faster please nynaeve elayne said i the other woman cut her off is my lady uncomfortable i know ladies are used to comfort the sort of thing a poor maid wouldnt know about but surely my lady wants to make the next town before dark so my ladys maid can serve my ladys supper and turn down my ladys bed her teeth clicked shut as the seat coming up met her coming down and she glowered at elayne as though it were her fault elayne sighed heavily nynaeve had seen the point back in mardecin a lady never traveled without a maid and two ladies would probably have a pair unless they put thom or juilin in a dress that meant one of them nynaeve had seen that elayne knew more of how ladies behaved she had put it very gently and nynaeve usually knew sense when she heard it usually but that was back in mistress macuras shop after they had filled the two women with their own horrible concoction leaving mardecin they had traveled hard until midnight to reach a small village with an inn where they had roused the innkeeper from his bed to rent two cramped rooms with narrow beds waking before first light yesterday to push on skirting around amador by a few miles neither of them would be taken for anything but what they claimed on sight but neither felt comfortable about passing through a great city full of whitecloaks the fortress of the light was in amador elayne had heard it said that the king reigned in amador but pedron niall ruled the trouble had started last night at a place called bellon on a muddy stream grandly named the gaean river some twenty miles or so beyond the capital the bellon ford inn was larger than the first and mistress alfara the innkeeper offered the lady morelin a private dining room which elayne could not very well refuse mistress alfara had been sure that only the lady morelins maid nana would know how to serve her properly ladies did require everything just so the woman said as well they should and her girls were simply not used to ladies nana would know exactly how the lady morelin wanted her bed turned down and would prepare her a nice bath after a hot day of travel the list of things that nana would do exactly right for her mistress had been endless elayne was not sure whether arnadician nobility expected such or mistress alfara was just getting work out of an outlanders servant she had tried to spare nynaeve but the woman had been as full of as you wish and my lady is most particular as the innkeeper she would have seemed a fool or at least odd to press it they were trying to avoid attracting undue attention as long as they had been in bellon nynaeve had acted the perfect ladys maid in public in private was another matter elayne wished the woman would just revert to herself instead of bludgeoning her with a ladys maid from the blight apologies had been met with my lady is too kind or simply ignored i will not apologize again she thought for the fiftieth time not for what was not my fault i have been thinking nynaeve gripping a hanging strap she felt like the ball in the childrens game called bounce in andor where you tried to keep a colorful wooden bail bouncing up and down on a paddle she would not ask for the coach to be slowed though she could stand it as long as nynaeve did the woman was so stubborn i want to reach tar valon and find out what is going on but my lady has been thinking my lady must have a headache from all that effort i will make my lady a nice tea of sheepstongue root and red daisy as soon as be quiet nana elayne said calmly but firmly it was her very best imitation of her mother nynaeves jaw dropped if you pull that braid at me you can ride on the roof with the baggage nynaeve made a strangled sound trying so hard to talk that nothing came out quite satisfactory sometimes you seem to think i am still a child but you are the one behaving like a child i did not ask you to wash my back but i would have had to wrestle to stop you i did offer to scrub yours in turn remember and i offered to sleep in the trundle bed but you climbed in and wouldnt get out stop sulking if you like i will be the maid at the next inn it would probably be a disaster nynaeve would shout at thom in public or box someones ears but anything for a little peace we can stop right now and change in the trees we chose the gowns to fit you the other woman muttered after a moment pushing the flap open again she shouted slow down are you trying to kill us fool men there was dead silence from above as the coachs speed diminished to something much more reasonable but elayne would have wagered the two men were talking she straightened her hair as best she could without a mirror it was still startling to see those glistening black tresses when she did look in one the green silk was going to need a thorough brushing itself what was it you were thinking elayne nynaeve asked crimson stained her cheeks at least she knew that elayne was right but backing down was very likely as much apology as she would ever give we are rushing back to tar valon but do we really have any idea what awaits us in the tower if the amyrlin truly did give those orders i do not really believe it and i cannot understand it but i do not intend to walk into the tower until i do a fool puts her hand into a hollow tree without finding out whats inside first a wise woman lini nynaeve said we may learn more if i see another bunch of yellow flowers hanging upside down but until then i think we should behave as though the black ajah itself has control of the tower mistress macura will have sent off another pigeon to narenwin by now with descriptions of this coach and the dresses we took and most likely thom and juilin too it cannot be helped this would not have happened if we hadnt dawdled across tarabon we should have taken ship elayne gaped at her accusatory tone and nynaeve had the grace to blush again well done is done moiraine knows siuan sanche perhaps egwene can ask her if abruptly the coach lurched to a halt throwing elayne forward on top of nynaeve she could hear horses screaming and thrashing as she frantically untangled herself nynaeve pushing her off as well embracing saidar she put her head out of the window and released it again in relief here was something of a sort that she had seen pass through caemlyn more than once a traveling menagerie was camped amid afternoon shadows in a large clearing by the side of the road a great blackmaned lion lay halfasleep in one cage that took up the entire back of a wagon while his two consorts paced in the confines of another a third cage stood open in front of it a woman was making two black bears with white faces balance themselves on big red balls another cage held what appeared to be a large hairy boar except that its snout was too pointed and it had toes with claws that came from the aiel waste she knew and was called a capar other cages held other animals and brightly colored birds but unlike any menagerie she had ever seen this one traveled with human performers two men were juggling ribbontwined hoops between them four acrobats were practicing standing on one anothers shoulders in a tall column and a woman was feeding a dozen dogs that walked on their hind legs and did backflips for her in the background some other men were putting up two tall poles she had no idea what they were for none of that was what had the horses rearing in their harness and rolling their eyes though despite all that thom could do with the reins she could smell the lions herself but it was at three huge wrinkled gray animals that the horses gazed wildeyed two were as tall as the coach with big ears and great curving tusks beside a long nose that dangled to the ground the third shorter than the horses if likely as heavy had no tusks a baby she supposed a woman with pale yellow hair was scratching that one behind the ear with a heavy hooked goad elayne had seen creatures like this before too and had never expected to see them again a tall darkhaired man strode out of the camp of all things in this heat wearing a red silk cloak that he flourished as he made an elegant bow he was goodlooking with a wellturned leg and very much aware of both things forgive me my lady if the giant boarhorses frightened your animals as he straightened he beckoned two of his men to help quiet the horses then paused staring at her and murmured be still my heart it was just loud enough for elayne to be sure she was supposed to hear i am valan luca my lady showman extraordinary your presence overwhelms me he made another bow even more elaborate than the first elayne shared a look with nynaeve catching the same amused smile that she knew she herself wore a man very full of himself this valan luca his men did seem to be very good at soothing the horses they still snorted and stamped but their eyes were not so wide as they had been thom and juilin were staring at the strange animals almost as hard as the horses were boarhorses master luca elayne said where do they come from giant boarhorses my lady was the ready reply from fabled shara where i myself led an expedition into a wilderness full of strange civilizations and stranger sights to trap them it would fascinate me to tell you of them gigantic people twice the size of ogier he made grand gestures to illustrate beings with no heads birds big enough to carry off a fullgrown bull snakes that can swallow a man cities made of solid gold descend my lady and let me tell you elayne had no doubt that luca would fascinate himself with his own tales but she certainly doubted that those animals came from shara for one thing even the sea folk saw no more of shara than the walled ports they were confined to any who went beyond the walls were never seen again the aiel knew little more for another she and nynaeve had both seen creatures like these in falme during the seanchan invasion the seanchan used them for work animals and for war i think not master luca she told him then let us perform for you he said quickly as you can see this is no ordinary wandering menagerie but something entirely new a private performance tumblers jugglers trained animals the strongest man in the world even fireworks we have an illuminator with us we are on our way to ghealdan and tomorrow we will be gone on the wind but for a pittance my mistress said she thinks not nynaeve broke in she has better things to spend her money on than looking at animals in fact she herself kept a tight fist on all their coin reluctantly doling out what they needed she seemed to think everything should cost what it had back in her two rivers why would you want to go to ghealdan master luca elayne asked the other woman did make rough spots and leave them to her to smooth over i hear there is a great deal of trouble there i hear the army has not been able to suppress this man called the prophet with his preaching of the dragon reborn surely you do not want to travel into riots greatly exaggerated my lady greatly exaggerated where there are crowds people want to be entertained and where people want to be entertained my show is always welcome luca hesitated then stepped closer to the coach an embarrassed look crossed his face as he gazed up into elaynes eyes my lady the truth of the matter is that you would do me a very great favor by allowing me to perform for you the fact is that one of the boarhorses caused a little trouble in the next town up the road it was an accident he added hastily i assure you they are gentle creatures not dangerous at all but not only are the people of sienda unwilling to let me put on a show or even come to one here well it took all of my coin to pay for the damages and the fines he winced especially the fines if you allowed me to entertain you for a trifle truly i would name you as patroness of my show wherever we go across the world spreading the fame of your generosity my lady morelin she said the lady morelin of house samared with her new hair she could pass for cairhienin she had no time to see his show as much as she would have enjoyed it another time and she told him so adding but i will help you a little if you have no money give him something nana to help him on his way to ghealdan the last thing she wanted was him spreading her fame but helping the poor and those in distress was a duty she would not slight when she had the means even in a foreign land grumbling nynaeve dug a purse out of her belt pouch and dipped into it she leaned out of the coach enough to press lucas hand around what she gave him he looked startled as she said if you took a decent job of work you would not have to beg drive on thom thoms whip cracked and elayne was thrown back into her seat you did not have to be rude she said or so abrupt what did you give him a silver penny nynaeve replied calmly putting the purse back into her pouch and more than he deserved nynaeve elayne groaned the man probably thinks we were making sport of him nynaeve sniffed with those shoulders a good days work would not kill him elayne kept silent though she did not agree not exactly certainly work would not harm the man but she did not think there was much available not that i think master luca would accept work that didnt allow him to wear that cape if she brought it up though nynaeve would probably argue when she gently pointed out things that nynaeve did not know the woman was quite capable of accusing her of having an arrogant manner or of lecturing and valan luca was hardly worth another altercation so soon after smoothing over the last the shadows were lengthening by the time they reached sienda a sizable village of stone and thatch with two inns the first the kings lancer had a gaping hole where the front door had been and a crowd was watching workmen make repairs perhaps master lucas boarhorse had not liked the sign propped up beside the hole now a charging soldier with lance lowered it seemed to have been ripped down somehow surprisingly there were even more whitecloaks in the crowded dirt streets than back in mardecin far more and other soldiers besides men in mail and conical steel caps whose blue cloaks bore the star and thistle of amadicia there must be garrisons nearby the kings men and the whitecloaks did not seem to like each other at all they either brushed by as if the man wearing the wrong color did not exist or else with challenging stares little short of drawn swords some of the whitecloaked men had red shepherds crooks behind the sunbursts on their cloaks the hand of the light those named themselves the hand that seeks out truth but everyone else called them questioners even the other whitecloaks kept clear of them all in all it was enough to make elaynes stomach clench but there was no more than another hours sunlight left if that and that was taking into account the latesummer sunsets even driving half the night again would not guarantee another inn ahead and driving on this late might call attention besides they had reason to halt early today she exchanged looks with nynaeve and after a moment the other woman nodded and said we have to stop when the coach drew up in front of the light of truth juilin hopped down to open the door and nynaeve waited with a deferential look on her face for him to hand elayne down she did flash elayne a smile though she would not slide back into sulks the leather scrip she slung from her shoulder appeared a bit incongruous but not too much so elayne hoped now that nynaeve had acquired a stock of herbs and ointments again she did not mean to let them out of her sight from her first sight of the inns sign a flaring golden sun like that the children wore on their cloaks she wished the boarhorse had taken exception to this place instead of the other at least there was no shepherds crook behind it half the men filling the common room wore snowy white cloaks their helmets set on the tables in front of them she took a deep breath and a firm hold on herself not to spin on her heel and leave aside from the soldiers it was a pleasant inn with highbeamed ceilings and dark polished paneling cut green branches decorated the cold hearths of two large fireplaces and good cooking smells wafted from the kitchens the whiteaproned serving maids all seemed cheerful as they scurried among the tables with trays of wine and ale and food the arrival of a lady created little stir this close to the capital or perhaps it was because of that lords manor a few men looked at her more eyed her maid with interest though nynaeves stern frown when she realized they were staring at her quickly turned them back to their wine nynaeve seemed to think a man looking was a crime even if he said nothing and did not leer given that sometimes elayne wondered why she did not wear less becoming clothes she had had to work very hard to make sure that simple gray dress fit the other woman properly nynaeve was hopeless with a needle when it came to fine work the innkeeper mistress jharen was a plump woman with long gray curls a warm smile and searching dark eyes elayne suspected she could spot a worn hem or a flat purse at ten paces they obviously passed muster for she made a deep curtsy spreading her gray skirts wide and made effusive welcome inquiring whether the lady was on her way to or from amador from elayne replied with a languid hauteur the citys balls were most enjoyable and king ailron is quite as handsome as they say which is not always so for kings but i must return to my estates i require a room for myself and nana and something for my footman and driver thinking of nynaeve and the trundle she added i must have two full beds i need nana close and if she has only a trundle she will keep me awake with her snoring nynaeves respectful face slipped just a fraction thankfully but it was quite true she had snored terribly of course my lady the plump innkeeper said i have just the thing but your men will have to bed down in the stable in the hayloft i am quite crowded as you can see a troupe of vagabonds brought some horrible great animals into the village yesterday and one of them quite destroyed the kings lancer poor sim has lost half his custom or more and theyve all come here mistress jharens smile was more satisfaction than commiseration i do have one room left however i am sure it will do very well if you will send up a light repast and some wash water i think i shall retire early there was still sunlight showing in the windows but she put a hand delicately over her mouth as if stifling a yawn of course my lady as you wish this way mistress jharen seemed to think she had to keep elayne entertained as she showed them to the second floor she went on the whole way about the crowding at the inn and how it was a miracle that she had a room left about the vagrants with their animals and how they had been chased out of town and good riddance to rubbish about all the nobles who had stayed at her establishment over the years even the lord captain commander of the children once why a hunter of the horn had come through just the day before on his way to tear where they said the stone of tear had fallen into the hands of some false dragon and was it not horrible wickedness that men could do such things i hope they never find it the innkeepers gray curls swung as she shook her head the horn of valere elayne said why ever not why my lady if they find it it means the last battle is coming the dark one breaking free mistress jharen shivered the light send the horn is never found that way the last battle cannot happen can it there did not seem to be much answer to such curious logic the bedchamber was snug if not exactly cramped two narrow beds with striped coverlets stood to either side of a window looking out onto the street and little more than walking room separating them from each other or the whiteplastered walls a small table holding a lamp and tinderbox between the beds a tiny flowered rug and a washstand with a small mirror above it completed the furnishings everything was clean and well polished at least the innkeeper plumped the pillows and smoothed the coverlets and said the mattresses were the best goose down and the ladys men would be bringing her chests up by the back stairs and everything would be very cozy there was a good breeze at night if the lady opened the window and left the door cracked as though she would sleep with her door open to a public hallway two aproned girls arrived with a large blue pitcher of steaming water and a large lacquered tray covered with a white cloth before elayne managed to get mistress jharen out the shape of a wine pitcher and two cups mounded up one side of the cloth i think she believed we might go to the kings lancer even with a hole in it she said once the door was firmly shut looking around the room she grimaced there would barely be room for them and the chests i am not certain we shouldnt i do not snore nynaeve said in a tight voice of course you do not i had to say something though nynaeve gave a loud harrumph but all she said was i am glad i am tired enough to go to sleep aside from that forkroot i did not recognize anything to aid sleep in what that macura woman had it took thom and juilin three trips to bring the ironbound wooden chests up grumbling all the while the way men did about having to haul them up the narrow stairs at the rear of the inn they were muttering about being made to sleep in the stables too when they brought in the first one between them it had leafshaped hinges the bulk of their money and valuables were in the bottom of that including the recovered terangreal but one glance at the room and they shared a look and shut their mouths about that at least were going to see what we can learn in the common room thom said once the last chest was jammed in barely enough space remained to reach the washstand and maybe take a walk around the village juilin added men talk when theres as much dislike as i saw in the street that will be very good elayne said they did so want to think they had more to do than haul and carry it had been so in tanchico and mardecin of course and might well be again but hardly here do be careful not to get into any trouble with the whitecloaks now a longsuffering look passed between them just as if she had not seen both with bruised and bleeding faces after jaunts for information but she forgave them and smiled at thom i cannot wait to hear what you learn in the morning nynaeve said firmly she was looking away from elayne so hard that she might as well have been glowering at her if you disturb us before then for less than trollocs youll learn the reason why the glance that passed between the two men spoke volumes it made nynaeves eyebrows rise sharply but once she had reluctantly handed over a few coins they left agreeing to let the women sleep untroubled if i cannot even speak to thom elayne began when they were gone but nynaeve cut her off i am not having them walk in on me asleep in my shift she was awkwardly undoing the buttons down the back of her dress elayne went to help her and she said i can manage you get the ring out for me with a sniff elayne pulled up her skirt to reach the small pocket she had sewn to the underside if nynaeve wanted to be peevish let her she would not respond even if nynaeve began ranting again there were two rings in the pocket she left the golden great serpent she had been given on being raised to accepted and took out the stone ring all flecks and stripes of red and blue and brown it was just too large to fit a finger and flattened and twisted besides odd as it seemed the ring had only one edge a finger drawn along that edge would circle inside and out before coming back to where it began it was a terangreal and what it did was allow access to telaranrhiod even for someone who did not have the talent that egwene and the aiel dreamwalkers shared all that was needed was to sleep with it next to your skin unlike the two terangreal they had recovered from the black ajah it did not require channeling for all elayne knew even a man might be able to use it clad only in her linen shift nynaeve threaded the ring onto the leather thong with lans signet and her own great serpent then reknotted and hung it back around her neck before lying down atop one of the beds carefully tucking the rings in next to her skin she settled her head on the pillows is there time before egwene and the wise ones get there elayne asked i can never reason out what hour it is in the waste there is time unless she comes early which she wont the wise ones keep her on a very short leash it will do her good in the long run she was always headstrong nynaeve opened her eyes looking right at her at her as if that could stand for her as well remember to tell egwene to let rand know that i am thinking of him she was not going to let the woman start a row tell her to tell him that i love him and only him there she had it out nynaeve rolled her eyes in what was really a most offensive way if you wish me to she said dryly snuggling herself into the pillows as the other womans breathing began to slow elayne pushed one of the chests against the door and sat on it to wait she always hated waiting it would serve nynaeve right if she went down to the common room thom would probably still be there and and nothing he was supposed to be her coachman she wondered whether nynaeve had thought of that before agreeing to be the maid with a sigh she leaned back against the door she did hate waiting chapter dream ring meetings the effects of the ring terangreal did not startle nynaeve anymore she was in the place she had been thinking of when sleep closed in the great chamber in tear called the heart of the stone within the massive fortress called the stone of tear the gilded standlamps were unlit but pale light seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere to simply be all around her fading into dim shadows in the distance at least it was not hot it never seemed hot or cold in telaranrhiod huge redstone columns ran off in every direction the vaulted dome far above lost in dim shadows along with more golden lamps hanging on golden chains the pale floorstones beneath her feet were worn the high lords of tear had come to this chamber in the waking world of course only when their law and custom demanded but they had come ever since the breaking of the world centered beneath the dome was callandor apparently a glittering sword made of crystal driven half its length into the stone of the floor just as rand had left it she did not go near callandor rand claimed to have woven traps around it with saidin traps that no woman could see she expected they would be nasty the best of men could be vicious when they tried to be devious nasty and just as primed for a woman as for the men who might use that saangreal he had meant to guard it against those in the tower as much as the forsaken aside from rand himself the one who touched callandor might die or worse that was a fact of telaranrhiod what was in the waking world was here too although the reverse was not always so the world of dreams the unseen world reflected the waking world if sometimes in odd ways and perhaps other worlds as well verin sedai had told egwene that there was a pattern woven of worlds of the reality here and others just as the weaving of peoples lives made up the pattern of the ages telaranrhiod touched them all yet few could enter except accidentally for unknowing moments during their own mundane dreams dangerous moments for those dreamers though they never knew it unless they were very unlucky another fact of telaranrhiod was that what happened to the dreamer here happened in the waking world too to die in the world of dreams was to die in fact she had the sensation of being watched from the dimnesses between the columns but it did not trouble her it was not moghedien imaginary eyes there are no watchers i told elayne to ignore them and here i moghedien would certainly do more than look even so she wished she were angry enough to channel not that she was frightened of course only not angry not frightened at all the twisted stone ring felt light as if it were trying to drift up out of her shift reminding her that she was wearing only that as soon as she thought of clothing herself she was in a dress it was a trick of telaranrhiod that she liked in some ways channeling was unnecessary for here she could do things that she doubted any aes sedai had ever done with the power it was not the dress she had expected though not good stout two rivers wool the high neck trimmed in jaerecuz lace came right up under her chin but pale yellow silk draped her in folds that clung revealingly how many times had she called taraboner gowns like this indecent when she had worn them to blend into tanchico it seemed that she had grown more used to them than she knew giving her braid a sharp pull for the waywardness of her own mind she left the dress as it was the gown might not be as she wanted but she was no flighty girl to go leaping and squealing over it a dress is a dress she would wear it when egwene arrived with whichever of the wise ones accompanied her this time and if any of them said a word i did not come early to blather at myself about dresses birgitte silence answered her and she raised her voice though it should not have been necessary in this place this particular woman could hear her own name spoken on the other side of the world birgitte a woman stepped out from among the columns blue eyes calm and proudly confident her golden hair in a long braid more intricate than nynaeves own her short white coat and voluminous yellow silk trousers gathered at the ankles above short boots with raised heels were garments of more than two thousand years ago that she had taken a liking to the arrows in the quiver at her side appeared to be silver and so did the bow she carried is gaidal about nynaeve asked he was usually close by birgitte and he made nynaeve nervous refusing to acknowledge her existence scowling when birgitte spoke to her it had been something of a shock at first to find gaidal cain and birgitte longdead heroes linked in so many stories and legends in telaranrhiod but as birgitte herself had said where better for heroes bound to the wheel of time to await rebirth than in a dream a dream that had existed as long as the wheel it was they birgitte and gaidal cain and rogosh eagleeye and artur hawkwing and all the others that the horn of valere would summon back to fight at tarmon gaidon birgittes braid swung as she shook her head i have not seen him for some time i think the wheel has spun him out again it always happens so expectation and concern both touched her voice if birgitte was right then somewhere in the world a boychild had been born a mewling babe with no knowledge of who he was yet destined for adventures that would make new legends the wheel wove the heroes into the pattern as they were needed to shape the pattern and when they died they returned here to wait again that was what it meant to be bound to the wheel new heroes could find themselves bound so as well men and women whose bravery and accomplishments raised them far above the ordinary but once bound it was forever how long do you have nynaeve asked years yet surely birgitte was always tied to gaidal had been tied in story after story in age after age of adventure and a romance that even the wheel of time did not break she was always born after gaidal a year or five or ten but after i do not know nynaeve time here is not like time in the waking world i met you here last ten days gone as it seems to me and elayne only a day before what was it for you four days and three nynaeve muttered she and elayne had been coming to speak with birgitte as often as they could though too frequently it had not been possible with thom and juilin sharing the camp and standing night guard birgitte actually remembered the war of power one lifetime of it anyway and the forsaken her past lives were like books fondly remembered from long ago the more distant dimmer than the nearer but the forsaken stood out especially moghedien you see nynaeve the flow of time here can shift in larger ways too it might be months before i am born again or days here for me in the waking world it could be years yet before my birth with an effort nynaeve suppressed her vexation then we mustnt waste what time we have have you seen any of them since we last met there was no need to say who too many lanfear is often in telaranrhiod of course but i have seen rahvin and sammael and graendal demandred and semirhage birgittes voice tightened at the last name even moghedien who hated her did not frighten her visibly but semirhage was another matter nynaeve shivered as well the goldenhaired woman had told her too much of that one and realized she was wearing a thick wool cloak with a deep hood pulled up to hide her face flushing she made it disappear none of them have seen you she asked anxiously birgitte was more vulnerable than herself in many ways despite her knowledge of telaranrhiod she had never been able to channel any of the forsaken could destroy her as if crushing an ant without breaking stride and if she were destroyed here there would be no rebirth for her ever again i am not so unskilled or so foolish as to allow that birgitte leaned on her silver bow legend said she never missed with that bow and her silver arrows they are concerned with each other not anyone else i have seen rahvin and sammael graendal and lanfear each stalking the others unseen and demandred and semirhage each shadowing them as well i have not seen so much of them here since they were freed they are up to something nynaeve bit her lip in vexed frustration but what i cannot say yet nynaeve in the war of the shadow they were always plotting against each other as often as not but their work has never boded well for the world waking or dreaming try to find out birgitte as much as you can safely at any rate do not take any risks the other womans face did not change but nynaeve thought she was amused the fool woman thought as little of danger as did lan she wished she could ask about the white tower about what siuan might be scheming but birgitte could neither see nor touch the waking world unless she was called there by the horn you are just trying to avoid what you really want to ask have you seen moghedien no birgitte sighed but not for lack of trying in the usual course i can find anyone who knows they are in the world of dreams there is a feel like ripples spreading through the air from them or perhaps from their awareness i do not know really i am a soldier not a scholar either she has not come into telaranrhiod since you defeated her or she hesitated and nynaeve wanted to stop her from saying what she knew would come next but birgitte was too strong to dodge unpalatable possibilities or else she knows i have been looking for her she can hide that one she is not called the spider for nothing that was what a moghedien had been in the age of legends a tiny spider that spun its webs in secret places its bite poisonous enough to kill in heartbeats suddenly very much aware of feeling unseen eyes nynaeve shivered heavily it was not trembling just a shiver not trembling still she kept the sleek taraboner gown firmly in mind lest she abruptly find herself wearing armor it was embarrassing enough if that sort of thing happened when she was alone even more under the cool blue gaze of a woman valiant enough to be a match for gaidal cain can you find her even when she wants to remain hidden birgitte it was a very great deal to ask if moghedien knew she was being hunted like searching for a lion in high grass armed only with a stick the other woman did not hesitate perhaps i will try hefting her bow she added i must go now i do not want to risk being seen by the others when they come nynaeve put a hand on her arm to stop her it would be a help if you let me tell them that way i could share what youve told me about the forsaken with egwene and the wise ones and they could tell rand birgitte he needs to know you promised nynaeve those bright blue eyes were unyielding as ice the prescripts say that we must not let anyone know that we reside in telaranrhiod i have broken many by speaking to you much more by giving aid because i cannot stand by and watch you battle the shadow i have fought that battle in more lifetimes than i can remember but i will keep as many of the prescripts as i can you must hold to your promise of course i will she said indignantly unless you release me from it and i do ask you to no and birgitte was gone one moment nynaeves hand rested on a white coatsleeve the next on empty air in her mind she ran through a few curses she had overheard from thom and juilin the sort she would have scolded elayne for listening to much less using there was no point calling birgittes name again she probably would not come nynaeve only hoped she responded the next time she or elayne called birgitte i will keep my promise birgitte she would have heard that perhaps by their next meeting she would know something of moghediens activities nynaeve almost hoped she would not if she did it meant that moghedien really was stalking telaranrhiod fool woman if you dont look for snakes you cannot complain when one bites you she really did want to meet elaynes lini one day the emptiness of the vast chamber oppressed her all those great polished columns and that sense of being watched from the dimness between if there really was anybody there birgitte would have known she realized that she was smoothing the silk gown over her hips and to take her mind off eyes that were not there she concentrated on the dress it had been in good two rivers woolens that lan had first seen her and a simple embroidered dress that she had been wearing when he professed his love but she wanted him to see her in gowns like this it would not be indecent if he was the one seeing her a tall standing mirror appeared casting her reflection as she turned this way and that even peering back over her shoulder the yellow folds sheathed her closely suggesting everything they hid the womens circle in emonds field would have hauled her off for a good talking to in private wisdom or no wisdom yet it was quite beautiful here alone she could admit that she had a bit more than gotten used to wearing something like this in public you enjoyed it she scolded herself you are every bit as much a hussy as elayne seems to be turning into but it was beautiful and maybe not as immodest as she had always said not a neckline cut halfway to her knees like the first of mayene for instance well perhaps berelains were not that low but they were still far deeper than respectability required she had heard about what domani women often wore even taraboners called those indecent with the thought the yellow silk folds became rippling flows with a narrow belt of woven gold and thin her face colored very thin barely opaque at all in fact the gown certainly did more than suggest if lan saw her in that he would not gabble that his love for her was hopeless and that he would not give her widows weeds for a bridal gift one glimpse and his blood would catch fire he would what under the light is that you have on nynaeve egwene asked in scandalized tones nynaeve leaped straight up spinning and when she came down facing egwene and melaine it would be melaine though none of the wise ones would have been any better the mirror was gone and she was wearing a dark woolen two rivers dress thick enough for the depths of winter mortified at being startled as much as anything else it was mainly at being startled she changed the dress instantly without thinking flashing back into the gossamer domani and just as quickly to the yellow taraboner folds her face flamed they probably thought her a complete fool and in front of melaine at that the wise one was beautiful with her long redgold hair and clear green eyes not that she cared a whit how the woman looked but melaine had been at her last meeting here with egwene too and taunted her about lan nynaeve had lost her temper over it egwene claimed they were not taunts not among aiel women but melaine had complimented lans shoulders and his hands and his eyes what right did that greeneyed cat have to look at lans shoulders not that she had any doubts of his faithfulness but he was a man and far away from her and melaine was right there and firmly she put a stop to that line of reasoning is lan she thought her face was going to burn off cant you control your own tongue woman but she would not could not back away not with melaine there egwenes bemused smile was bad enough but melaine dared to put on a look of understanding is he well she tried for cool composure but it came out strained he is well egwene said he worries about whether you are safe nynaeve let out a breath she had not realized she was holding the waste was a dangerous place even without the likes of couladin and the shaido and the man did not know the meaning of caution he was worried about her safety did the fool man think she could not take care of herself weve finally reached amadicia she said quickly hoping to cover herself a flapping tongue and then sighs the man has stolen my wits there was no telling from the others faces whether she was succeeding a village called sienda east of amador whitecloaks everywhere but they dont look at us twice it is others we have to worry about in front of melaine she had to be careful to bend the truth a little in fact here and there but she told them of ronde macura and her odd message and her trying to drug them trying because she could not make herself admit in front of melaine that the woman had succeeded light what am i doing ive never lied to egwene before in my life the supposed reason the return of a runaway accepted certainly could not be mentioned not in front of one of the wise ones they thought that she and elayne were full aes sedai but she had to let egwene know the truth of that somehow it might have to do with some plot concerning andor but elayne and you and i have things in common egwene and i think we should be just as careful as elayne the girl nodded slowly she looked stunned as well she might but she seemed to understand a good thing the taste of that tea made me suspicious imagine trying to feed forkroot to someone who knows herbs as well as i do schemes within schemes melaine murmured the great serpent is a good sign for you aes sedai i think someday you may swallow yourselves by accident we have news ourselves egwene said nynaeve could see no reason for the girls haste i am certainly not going to let the woman bait me into losing my temper and i certainly wouldnt get angry over her insulting the tower she took her hand away from her braid what egwene had to say put temper right out of her head couladin crossing the spine of the world was surely grave and rand following scarcely less so he was pushing hard for the jangai pass marching from first light until after dusk and melaine said they would soon reach it conditions in cairhien were harsh enough without a war between aiel on its territory and a new aiel war to come surely if he tried to carry out his mad plan mad not yet surely he had to hang on to sanity somehow how long since i was worrying how to protect him she thought bitterly and now i just want him to stay sane to fight the last battle not only for that reason but for that one too he was what he was the light burn me im as bad as siuan sanche or any of them it was what egwene had to say about moiraine that shocked her she obeys him she said incredulously egwene gave a vigorous nod in that ridiculous aiel scarf last night they had an argument shes still trying to convince him not to cross the dragonwall and finally he told her to stand outside until she cooled down she looked about to swallow her tongue but she did it she stayed out in the night for an hour anyway it is not proper melaine said resettling her shawl firmly men have no more business ordering aes sedai about than they do wise ones even the caracarn they certainly do not nynaeve agreed then had to clamp her mouth shut to keep from gaping at herself what do i care if he makes her dance to his tune she has made all of us dance to hers often enough but it was not proper i do not want to be aes sedai just to learn more about healing i want to stay who i am let him order her about still it was not proper at least he talks with her now egwene said before he turned to acid if she came within ten feet of him nynaeve his head swells bigger every day back when i thought youd follow me as wisdom nynaeve told her wryly i taught you how to take swelling down best for him if you do it even if he has turned into the king bull in the pasture maybe most because he is it seems to me that kings and queens can be fools when they forget what they are and act like who they are but theyre worse when they only remember what they are and forget who most could do with someone whose only job is to remind them that they eat and sweat and cry the same as any farmer melaine folded her shawl around her seeming unsure whether to agree or not but egwene said i try but sometimes he doesnt seem like himself at all and even when he is his arrogance is usually too thick a bubble to prick do the best you can helping him hold on to himself may be the best thing that anyone could do for him and the rest of the world that produced a silence she and egwene certainly did not like to talk about the eventuality of rand going mad and melaine could not like it any better i have something else important to tell you she went on after a moment i think the forsaken are planning something it was not the same as telling them about birgitte she made it seem that she herself had seen lanfear and the others in truth moghedien was the only one she could recognize at sight and maybe asmodean though she had only seen him once and at a distance she hoped neither of them thought to ask how she knew who was who or why she thought moghedien might be skulking about in actuality the problem did not arise from that at all have you been wandering the world of dreams melaines eyes were green ice nynaeve met her level stare for level stare despite egwenes rueful headshaking i could hardly see rahvin and the rest without it now could i aes sedai you know little and you try too much you should not have been taught the few pieces that you have for myself i sometimes regret that we agreed even to these meetings unschooled women should not be allowed in telaranrhiod i have schooled myself in more than you ever taught me nynaeve kept her voice cool with an effort i learned to channel on my own and i do not see why telaranrhiod should be any different it was only stubborn anger that made her say that she had taught herself to channel true but without knowing what it was that she was doing and only after a fashion before the white tower she had healed sometimes but unaware until moiraine proved it to her her teachers in the tower had said that was why she needed to be angry in order to channel she had hidden her ability from herself afraid of it and only fury could break through that longburied fear so you are one of those the aes sedai call wilders there was a hint of something in the last word but whether scorn or pity nynaeve did not like it the term was seldom complimentary in the tower of course there were no wilders among the aiel the wise ones who could channel found every last girl with the spark born in her those who would develop the ability to channel sooner or later even if they did not try to learn they claimed also to find every girl without the spark who could learn if instructed no aiel girl died trying to learn by herself you know the dangers of learning the power without guidance aes sedai do not think the dangers of the dream are less they are just as great perhaps more for those who venture without knowledge i am careful nynaeve said in a tight voice she had not come to be lectured by this sunhaired vixen of an aiel i know what i am doing melaine you know nothing you are as headstrong as this one was when she came to us the wise one gave egwene a smile that actually seemed affectionate we tamed her excessive exuberance and now she learns swiftly though she does have many faults still egwenes pleased grin faded nynaeve suspected that grin was why melaine had added the last if you wish to wander the dream the aiel woman went on come to us we will tame your zeal as well and teach you i do not need taming thank you very much nynaeve said with a polite smile aanallein will die on the day he learns that you are dead ice stabbed into nynaeves heart aanallein was what the aiel called lan one man it meant in the old tongue or man alone or the man who is an entire people exact translations from the old tongue were often difficult the aiel had a great deal of respect for lan the man who would not give up his war with the shadow the enemy that had destroyed his nation you are a dirty fighter she muttered melaine quirked an eyebrow do we fight if we do then know that in battle there is only winning and losing rules against hurting are for games i want your promise that you will do nothing in the dream without first asking one of us i know aes sedai cannot lie so i would hear you say it nynaeve gritted her teeth the words would be easy to say she did not have to hold to them she was not bound by the three oaths but it would be admitting that melaine was right she did not believe it and she would not say it shell not promise melaine egwene said finally when she gets that muley look she wouldnt come out of the house if you showed her the roof on fire nynaeve spared a piece of glare for her muley indeed when all she did was refuse to be pushed about like a rag doll after a long moment melaine sighed very well but it would be well to remember aes sedai that you are but a child in telaranrhiod come egwene we must go an amused wince crossed egwenes face as the two faded away abruptly nynaeve realized that her clothes had changed had been changed the wise ones knew enough of telaranrhiod to alter things about others as well as themselves she wore a white blouse and a dark skirt but unlike those of the women who had just gone this stopped well short of her knees her shoes and stockings were gone and her hair was divided into two braids one over each ear woven with yellow ribbons a rag doll with a carved and painted face sat beside her bare feet she could hear her teeth grinding this had happened once before and she had pried out of egwene that this was how the aiel dressed little girls in a fury she switched back to the yellow taraboner silk this time it adhered even more closely and kicked the doll it sailed away vanishing in midair that melaine probably had her eye on lan the aiel all seemed to think he was some sort of hero the high neck became a tall lace collar and the deep narrow neckline showed her cleavage if that woman so much as smiled at him if he suddenly she became aware of her fastsinking rapidly widening neckline and hastily brought it back up not all the way but enough that she did not have to blush the dress had grown so tight that she could not move she took care of that too so she was supposed to ask permission was she go begging the wise ones before doing anything had she not defeated moghedien they had been properly impressed at the time but they seemed to have forgotten if she could not use birgitte to find out what was going on in the tower perhaps there was a way she could do it herself chapter flame of tar valon what can be learned in dreams carefully nynaeve formed an image in her mind of the amyrlins study just as she had envisioned the heart of the stone on going to sleep nothing happened and she frowned she should have been taken to the white tower to the room she had visualized trying again she imagined a room there that she had visited much more often if more unhappily the heart of the stone became the study of the mistress of novices a compact darkpaneled room full of plain sturdy furnishings that had been used by generations of women who had held that office when a novices transgressions were such that extra hours of scrubbing floors or raking paths would not atone it was here that she was sent for an accepted to receive that summons took a greater transgression but still she went on leaden feet knowing the outcome would be just as painful perhaps more so nynaeve did not want to look at the room sheriam had called her willfully stubborn on her numerous visits but found herself staring into the mirror on the wall where novices and accepted had to look at their own weeping faces while listening to sheriam lecture about obeying the rules or showing proper respect or whatever obeying others rules and showing required respect had always tripped up nynaeve the faint remnants of gilt on the carved frame said it had been there since the war of the hundred years if not the breaking the taraboner dress was beautiful but anyone who saw her in it would be suspicious even domani women usually dressed circumspectly when they visited the tower and she could not imagine anybody dreaming of herself in the tower except on her best behavior not that she was likely to meet anyone except perhaps someone who had dreamed herself into telaranrhiod for a few moments before egwene there had not been a woman in the tower who could enter the world of dreams unaided since corianin nedeal over four hundred years ago on the other hand among the terangreal stolen from the tower that were still in the hands of liandrin and her confederates eleven had last been studied by corianin the two others of corianins study the two that she and elayne had in hand both gave access to telaranrhiod it was best to assume that the rest did too there was small chance that liandrin or any of the others would dream themselves back to the tower they had fled but even that chance was too big to risk when it might mean being waylaid for that matter she could not really be sure that the stolen terangreal were all that corianin had investigated the records were often murky about terangreal no one understood and others could very well be in the hands of black sisters still in the tower the dress changed completely became white wool soft but not of a particularly fine quality and banded at the hem with seven colored stripes one for each ajah if she saw anyone who did not vanish after a few moments she would take herself back to sienda and they would think she was only one of the accepted touching telaranrhiod in her dreams no not the inn but sheriams study anyone like that would have to be black ajah and after all she was supposed to be hunting them completing her disguise she gripped her suddenly redgold braid and grimaced at melaines face in the mirror now there was a woman she would like to hand over to sheriam the study of the mistress of novices was near the novices quarters and the wide tiled hallways flickered with occasional motion past elaborate wall hangings and unlit standlamps flashes of frightened girls all in novice white a good many novice nightmares would contain sheriam she ignored them as she hurried by they were not in the world of dreams long enough to see her or if they did they would simply think her part of their own dream it was only a short climb up broad stairs to the amyrlins study as she approached suddenly elaida was in front of her sweatyfaced in a bloodred gown the stole of the amyrlin seat around her shoulders or almost the amyrlins stole it had no blue stripe those stern dark eyes focused on nynaeve i am the amyrlin seat girl do you not know how to show respect i will have yo in midword she was gone nynaeve exhaled raggedly elaida as amyrlin that was a nightmare for certain probably her fondest dream she thought wryly it will snow in tear before she ever rises that high the anteroom was much as she remembered it with one wide table and a chair behind it for the keeper of the chronicles a few chairs sat against the wall for aes sedai waiting to speak with the amyrlin novices and accepted stood the neat array of papers on the table bound scrolls and large parchments with seals and letters seemed unlike leane though not that she was untidy quite the reverse yet nynaeve had always thought she would put everything away at night she pushed open the door to the inner room but her step slowed as she entered no wonder she had not been able to dream herself here the room was nothing like what she remembered that heavily carved table and tall thronelike chair the vinecarved stools arranged in a perfect curve in front of the table not one so much as an inch out of place siuan sanche affected simple furnishings as if pretending she was still only a fishermans daughter and she kept only one extra chair which she did not always let visitors use and that white vase full of red roses rigidly arranged on a pedestal like a monument siuan enjoyed flowers but she preferred a bouquet of colors like a field of wildflowers in miniature above the fireplace had hung a simple drawing of fishing boats in tall reeds now there were two paintings one of which nynaeve recognized rand battling the forsaken who had called himself baalzamon in the clouds above falme the other on three wooden panels portrayed scenes that linked to nothing she could pull out of her memory the door opened and nynaeves heart leaped into her throat a redhaired accepted she had never seen before stepped into the room and stared at her she did not wink out of existence just as nynaeve was preparing to leap back to sheriams study the redhaired woman said nynaeve if melaine knew you were using her face shed do more than put you in a childs dress and just that suddenly she was egwene in her aiel garb you nearly frightened ten years out of me nynaeve muttered so the wise ones have finally decided to let you come and go as you please or is melaine behind you should be frightened egwene snapped color rising in her cheeks you are a fool nynaeve a child playing in the barn with a candle nynaeve gaped egwene berating her you listen to me egwene alvere ill not take that from melaine and i wont take it you had best take it from someone before you get yourself killed i i ought to take that stone ring away from you i should have given it to elayne and told her not to let you use it at all told her not do you think melaine was exaggerating egwene said sternly shaking her finger almost exactly like melaine she was not nynaeve the wise ones have told you the simple truth about telaranrhiod time and again but you seem to think theyre fools whistling in a high wind you are supposed to be a grown woman not a silly little child i vow whatever sense you once had in your head seems to have vanished like a puff of smoke well find it nynaeve she sniffed loudly rearranging the shawl on her shoulders right now you are trying to play with the pretty flames in the fireplace too foolish to realize you might fall in nynaeve stared in amazement they argued often enough but egwene had never ever tried to dress her down like a girl caught with her fingers in the honey jar never the dress it was the accepteds dress she was wearing and someone elses face she changed herself back to herself in a good blue wool that she had often worn for circle meetings and to put the council straight she felt robed in all her old authority as wisdom i am well aware of how much i dont know she said levelly but those aiel do you realize you could dream yourself into something you could not get out of dreams are real here if you let yourself drift into a fond dream it could trap you youd trap yourself until you died will you there are nightmares walking telaranrhiod nynaeve will you let me speak nynaeve barked or rather she tried to bark it there was rather too much frustrated pleading in there to suit her any at all would have been too much no i will not egwene said firmly not until you want to say something worth listening to i said nightmares and i meant nightmares nynaeve when someone has a nightmare while in telaranrhiod it is real too and sometimes it survives after the dreamer has gone you just dont realize do you suddenly rough hands enveloped nynaeves arms her head whipped from side to side eyes bulging two huge ragged men lifted her into the air faces halfmelted ruins of coarse flesh drooling mouths full of sharp yellowed teeth she tried to make them vanish if a wise one dreamwalker could so could she and one of them ripped her dress open down the front like parchment the other seized her chin in a horny callused hand and twisted her face toward him his head bent toward her mouth opening whether to kiss or bite she did not know but she would rather die than allow either she flailed for saidar and found nothing it was horror filling her not anger thick fingernails dug into her cheeks holding her head steady egwene had done this somehow egwene please egwene it was a squeal and she was too terrified to care please the men creatures vanished and her feet thudded to the floor for a moment all she could do was shudder and weep hastily she repaired the damage to her dress but the scratches from long fingernails remained on her neck and chest clothing could be mended easily in telaranrhiod but whatever happened to a human her knees shook so badly that it was all she could do to stay upright she halfexpected egwene to comfort her and for once she would have accepted it gladly but the other woman only said there are worse things here but nightmares are bad enough i made these and unmade them but even i have trouble with those i just find and i did not try to hold them nynaeve if you knew how to unmake them you could have nynaeve tossed her head angrily refusing to scrub the tears from her cheeks i could have dreamed myself away to sheriams study or back to my bed she did not sound sulky of course she did not if you had not been too scared spitless to think of it egwene said dryly oh take that sullen look off your face it looks silly on you she glared at the other woman but it did not work as it usually did instead of flaring into argument egwene merely arched an eyebrow at her none of this looks like siuan sanche nynaeve said to change the subject what had gotten into the girl it doesnt egwene agreed looking around the room i see why i had to come by way of my old room in the novices quarters but i suppose people do decide to try something new sometimes that is what i mean nynaeve told her patiently she had not sounded sulky and she had not looked sullen it was ridiculous the woman who furnished this room doesnt look at the world the same as the woman who chose what used to be here look at those paintings i dont know what the triple thing is but you can recognize the other as well as i they had both seen it happen bonwhin i should say egwene said thoughtfully you never did listen to the lectures as you should it is a triptych whatever it is its the other thats important she had listened to the yellows well enough the rest was a pack of useless nonsense often as not it seems to me that the woman who hung it wants to be reminded how dangerous rand is if siuan sanche has turned against rand for some reason egwene this could be far worse than just her wanting elayne back in the tower perhaps egwene said judiciously maybe the papers will tell us something you search in here when i finish with leanes desk i will help you nynaeve stared indignantly at egwenes back as she left you search in here indeed egwene had no right to give her orders she ought to march right after her and tell her so in no uncertain terms then why are you standing here like a lump she asked herself angrily searching the papers was a good idea and she might as well do so in here as out there in fact the amyrlins desk was more likely to hold something important grumbling to herself about what she would do to set egwene straight she stalked to the thickly carved table kicking her skirts with every step there was nothing on the table except three ornately lacquered boxes arrayed with painful precision remembering the sorts of traps that could be set by someone wanting to insure privacy she made a long stick to push open the hinged lid of the first a gold and green thing decorated with wading herons it was a writing case with pens and ink and sand the largest box with red roses twining through golden scrolls held twenty or more delicate carvings of ivory and turquoise animals and people all laid out on pale gray velvet as she pushed up the lid of the third box golden hawks fighting among white clouds in a blue sky she noticed that the first two were closed again things like that happened here everything seemed to want to remain as it was in the waking world and on top of that if you took your eyes away for a moment details could be different when you looked back the third box did hold documents the stick vanished and she gingerly lifted out the top sheet of parchment formally signed joline aes sedai it was a humble request to serve a set of penances that made nynaeve wince just scanning them rapidly nothing there that mattered except to joline a scrawl at the bottom said approved in angular script as she reached to put the parchment down it faded away the box was closed too sighing she opened it again the papers inside looked different holding the lid she lifted them out one by one and read quickly or tried to read sometimes the letters and reports vanished while she was still picking them up sometimes when she was no more than halfway down a page if they had a salutation it was simply mother with respect some were signed by aes sedai others by women with other titles nobles or no honorific at all none of it seemed to bear on the matter at hand the marshal general of saldaea and his army could not be found and queen tenobia was refusing to cooperate she managed to finish that report but it assumed that the reader knew why the man was not in saldaea and what the queen was supposed to be cooperating about no report had come from any ajahs eyesandears in tanchico for three weeks but she got no further than that one fact some trouble between illian on one side and murandy on the other was abating and pedron niall was claiming credit even in the few lines she got she could see the writers teeth gnashing the letters were all no doubt very important those she was able to hurry through and those that faded away under her eyes but of no use to her at all she had just begun what seemed to be a report on a suspected that was the word used gathering of blue sisters when a wretched cry of oh light no came from the outer room darting for the door she made a stout wooden club appear in her hands its head bristling with spikes but when she dashed in expecting to find egwene defending herself the woman was standing behind the keepers table staring at nothing with a look of horror on her face to be sure but still unharmed and unthreatened that nynaeve could see egwene gave a start at the sight of her then gathered herself visibly nynaeve elaida is amyrlin seat dont be a goose nynaeve scoffed yet the other room so unlike siuan sanche youre imagining things you must be i had a parchment in my hands nynaeve signed elaida do avriny aroihan watcher of the seals flame of tar valon the amyrlin seat and sealed with the amyrlins seal nynaeves stomach tried to flutter up into her chest but how what has happened to siuan egwene the tower doesnt depose an amyrlin except for something serious only two in nearly three thousand years maybe rand was serious enough egwenes voice was steady though her eyes were still too wide maybe she became ill with something the yellows couldnt heal or fell down the stairs and broke her neck what matters is that elaida is amyrlin i dont think she will support rand as siuan did moiraine nynaeve muttered so sure that siuan would put the tower behind him she could not imagine siuan sanche dead she had hated the woman often been the slightest bit afraid of her on occasion she could admit that now to herself anyway yet she had respected her too she had thought that siuan would last forever elaida light shes as mean as a snake and as cruel as a cat theres no telling what she might do i am afraid i have a clue egwene pressed both hands to her stomach as though to quell flutters of her own it was a very short document i managed to read it all all loyal sisters are required to report the presence of the woman moiraine damodred she is to be detained if possible by whatever means are necessary and returned to the white tower for trial on charge of treason the same sort of language that was apparently used about elayne if elaida wants moiraine arrested it must mean she knows moiraine has been helping rand and she does not like it talking was good talking kept her from sicking up treason they stilled women for that she had wanted to bring moiraine down now elaida was going to do it for her she certainly wont support rand exactly loyal sisters egwene that fits with the macura womans message whatever happened to siuan the ajahs have split over elaida as amyrlin it must be yes of course very good nynaeve i did not see that her smile was so pleased that nynaeve smiled back theres a report on siu the amyrlins writing table about a gathering of blues i was just reading it when you shouted ill wager the blues didnt support elaida the blue and red ajahs had a sort of armed truce at the best of times and came near going for each others throats at the worst but when they went back into the inner room the report was not to be found there were plenty of documents jolines letter had reappeared a brief reading made egwenes eyebrows climb nearly to her hair but not the one that they wanted can you remember what it said egwene asked i had just gotten a few lines when you shouted and i just cant remember try nynaeve try very hard i am egwene but it will not come i am trying what she was doing hit nynaeve like a sudden hammer between the eyes excusing herself to egwene a girl whose bottom she had switched for throwing a tantrum not more than two years ago and a moment earlier she had been proud as a hen with a new egg because egwene was pleased with her she remembered quite clearly the day when the balance between them had shifted when they ceased being the wisdom and the girl who fetched when the wisdom said fetch becoming instead just two women far from home it seemed that balance had shifted further and she did not like it she was going to have to do something to move it back where it belonged the lie she had deliberately lied to egwene for the first time ever today that was why her moral authority had vanished why she was floundering around unable to assert herself properly i drank the tea egwene she forced each word deliberately she had to force them the macura womans forkroot tea she and luci hauled us upstairs like sacks of feathers that is about how much strength we had between us if thom and juilin hadnt come to pull us out by the scruffs of our necks we would probably be there still or else on our way to the tower so full of forkroot we wouldnt wake up until we got here taking a deep breath she tried for a tone of righteous firmness but it was difficult when you had just confessed to having been an utter fool what came out sounded much more tentative than she liked if you tell the wise ones about this especially that melaine ill box your ears something in that should have sparked egwenes ire it seemed odd to want to start a row usually their quarrels were over egwene refusing to see reason and they seldom ended pleasantly since the girl had formed the habit of continuing to refuse but that was certainly better than this yet egwene only smiled at her an amused smile a condescending amused smile i more than suspected as much nynaeve you used to drone on about herbs day and night but you never mentioned any plant called forkroot i was sure youd never heard of it until that woman mentioned it youve always tried to put the best face on things if you fell head first into a pigsty youd try to convince everybody you did it on purpose now what we have to decide i do no such thing nynaeve spluttered you certainly do facts are facts you might as well stop whining about it and help me decide whining this was not going at all the way she wanted they are no such thing not facts i mean i have never done what you said for a moment egwene stared at her silently you will not let go of this will you very well you lied to me it was not a lie she muttered not exactly the other woman ignored her interruption and you lie to yourself do you remember what you made me drink the last time i lied to you suddenly a cup was in her hand full of viscous sickly green liquid it looked as if it had been scooped from a scummy stagnant pond the only time i ever lied to you the memory of that taste was an effective discouragement if you cannot tell the truth even to yourself nynaeve took a step back before she could stop herself boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf her tongue writhed at just the thought i did not really lie actually why was she making excuses i just didnt tell the whole truth i am the wisdom i was the wisdom that ought to count for something still you cannot really think just tell her youre not the child here and you certainly are not going to drink egwene i egwene pushed the cup nearly under her nose she could smell the acrid tang all right she said hastily this cant be happening but she could not take her eyes off that brimming cup and she could not stop the words tumbling out sometimes i try to make things look better for myself than they were sometimes but never anything important ive never lied about anything important never i swear only small things the cup vanished and nynaeve heaved a sigh of relief fool fool woman she couldnt have made you drink it what is wrong with you what we have to decide egwene said as if nothing at all had happened is who to tell moiraine certainly has to know and rand but if everyone hears of it the aiel are peculiar about aes sedai no less than anything else i think theyll follow rand as he who comes with the dawn in spite of anything but once they learn the white tower is against him maybe they wont be so fervent theyll learn sooner or later nynaeve muttered she could not have made me drink it later better than sooner nynaeve so dont you go bursting out in a temper and telling the wise ones about this at our next meeting in fact it would be best if you didnt mention this visit to the tower at all that way maybe you can keep it secret i am not a fool nynaeve said stiffly and felt a slow burn when egwene quirked that eyebrow at her again she was not about to bring the visit up with the wise ones not because it was easier defying them behind their backs nothing like that and she was not trying to put a good face on things it was not fair that egwene could leap about telaranrhiod however she wanted while she had to put up with lectures and bullying i know you are not egwene said unless you let your temper get the better of you you need to hold your temper and keep your wits about you if youre right about the forsaken especially moghedien nynaeve glowered at her opening her mouth to say that she could too keep her temper and she would smack egwenes ears if she thought differently but the other woman gave her no chance we must find that gathering of blue sisters nynaeve if they oppose elaida maybe just maybe they will support rand the way siuan did was a town mentioned or a village a country even i think i cannot remember she struggled to take the defensive note out of her voice light i confessed everything made a fool of myself and its only made things worse i will keep trying good we must find them nynaeve for a moment egwene studied her while she refused to repeat herself nynaeve take care concerning moghedien do not go rushing off like a bear in spring just because she got away from you in tanchico i am not a fool egwene nynaeve said carefully it was frustrating having to hold her temper but if all egwene would do was ignore it or scold her there was nothing to be gained beyond looking a bigger ninnyhead than she did already i know you said that just be sure you remember it be careful egwene did not fade away this time she vanished as suddenly as birgitte nynaeve stared at the spot where she had been running through her head all the things she should have said finally she realized that she could stand there all night she was repeating herself and the time for saying anything was past grumbling under her breath she stepped out of telaranrhiod back to her bed in sienda egwenes eyes popped open in near total darkness broken only by a little moonlight streaming in through the smoke hole she was glad to be under a pile of blankets the fire was out and freezing cold filled the tent her breath turned to mist in front of her face without raising her head she scanned the interior no wise ones she was still alone that was her biggest fear on these solitary excursions into telaranrhiod returning to find amys or one of the others waiting for her well maybe not her biggest fear the dangers in the world of dreams were every bit as great as she had told nynaeve but a big one nonetheless it was not punishment that frightened her not the sort that bair doled out had she wakened to find a wise one staring at her she would have accepted such gladly but amys had told her near the beginning that if she entered telaranrhiod without one of them accompanying her they would send her away refuse to teach her any longer that made her quail far more than anything else they could do but even so she had to push ahead as rapidly as they taught they were not rapid enough she wanted to know now to know everything channeling she lit her lamp and put flames in the firepit nothing remained for them to burn but she tied the weave off she lay there watching her breath mist in front of her mouth and waited for warmth enough to dress it was late but perhaps moiraine would still be awake what had happened with nynaeve still amazed her i think shed actually have drunk if i had pressed her she had been so afraid that nynaeve would learn that she certainly did not have the wise ones permission to jaunt about in the world of dreams alone so sure that the flush of embarrassment had given her away that all she could think of was keeping nynaeve from speaking keeping her from winkling out the truth and she had been so sure that nynaeve would find out anyway the woman was quite capable of turning her in and saying it was for her own good that all she could do was talk try to keep the focus on whatever nynaeve was doing wrong no matter how angry nynaeve made her she could not seem to bring up a shout and with all of that somehow she had gained the upper hand come to think of it moiraine seldom raised her voice and when she did she was least effective in having what she wanted done it had been so even before she began behaving so strangely with rand the wise ones never yelled at anyone either except each other sometimes and for all their grumping about the chiefs no longer listening they still seemed to get their way much more often than not there was an old saying that she had never really understood before he strains to hear a whisper who refuses to hear a shout she would not shout at rand again a quiet firm womanly voice that was the thing for that matter she ought not to shout at nynaeve either she was a woman not a girl throwing tantrums she found herself giggling she especially ought not to raise her voice with nynaeve when speaking calmly produced such results the tent finally seemed warm enough and she scampered out dressing quickly she still had to break ice in her water pitcher before she could wash the sleep out of her mouth tossing the dark woolen cloak about her shoulders she untied the strands of fire fire by itself was dangerous to leave tied and as the flames vanished ducked out of the tent cold closed on her like an icy vise as she hurried through the camp only the nearest tents were really visible to her low shadowed shapes that could have been part of the rugged earth save that the camp extended for miles into the mountainous land to either side these tall jagged peaks were not the spine of the world that was much higher and lay days to the west yet she approached rands tent hesitantly a sliver of light showed along the tent flap a maiden seemed to rise out of the ground as she came closer horn bow on her back quiver at her waist and spears and buckler in hand egwene could not make out any others in the darkness but she knew they were there even here surrounded by six clans all claiming loyalty to the caracarn the miagoma were somewhere to the north paralleling their march timolan would not say what his intentions were where the other clans were rand did not seem to care his attention was all on the race for jangai pass is he awake enaila she asked moonshadows shifted on the maidens face as she nodded he does not sleep enough a man cannot go without rest she sounded for all the world like a mother fretting over her son a shadow beside the tent stirred became aviendha with her shawl wrapped around her she did not seem to feel the cool only the hour i would sing him a lullaby if i thought it might work i have heard of women being kept awake all night by an infant but a grown man should know that others would like to have their blankets she and enaila shared a quiet chuckle shaking her head over aiel strangeness egwene bent to peer through the crack several lamps lit the interior he was not alone nataels dark eyes looked haggard and he stifled a yawn he at least wanted sleep rand lay sprawled close by one of the gilded oil lamps reading a battered leatherbound book one translation or another of the prophecies of the dragon if she knew him at all abruptly he flipped back through the pages read then laughed she tried to tell herself there was nothing of madness in that laugh only bitterness a fine joke he told natael snapping the book shut and tossing it to him read page two hundred eightyseven and page four hundred and tell me if you dont agree egwenes mouth tightened as she straightened he really should be more careful with a book she could not speak to him not in front of the gleeman it was a shame that he had to use a man he barely knew for company no he had aviendha and the chiefs often enough and lan every day and mat sometimes why dont you join them aviendha if you were there maybe hed want to talk of something besides that book he wanted to talk with the gleeman egwene and he seldom does that in front of me or anyone had i not left he and natael would have children are a great worry i have heard enaila laughed and sons the worst you may find out the truth of this for me now that you have given up the spear aviendha gave her a moonlit frown and stalked back to her place against the side of the tent like an offended cat enaila seemed to think that funny too she clutched her sides laughing muttering to herself about aiel humor she almost never understood it egwene made her way to moiraines tent not far from rands here too there was a sliver of light and she knew that the aes sedai was awake moiraine was channeling only tiny amounts of the power but still enough for egwene to sense lan lay sleeping nearby wrapped in his warders cloak except for his head and boots the rest of him seemed part of the night gathering her cloak she held her skirts up and tiptoed so as not to wake him his breathing did not change but something made her look at him again moonlight glinted on his eyes open and watching her even as she turned her head they closed again not another muscle stirred he might never have wakened at all sometimes the man unnerved her whatever nynaeve saw in him she could not see kneeling beside the tent flap she peered in moiraine sat surrounded by the glow of saidar the small blue stone that usually hung on her forehead dangling from her fingers in front of her face it shone adding a bit to the light of a single lamp the firepit held only ashes even the smell was gone may i come in she had to repeat herself before moiraine answered of course the light of saidar faded away and the aes sedai began fastening the fine golden chain back into her hair you were eavesdropping on rand egwene settled herself beside the other woman it was as cold in the tent as it was outside she channeled flames atop the ashes in the firepit and tied the flow you said you would not do it again i said that since the wise ones could watch his dreams we should allow him some privacy they have not asked again since he shut them out and i have not offered remember that they have their own goals which may not be those of the tower as quickly as that they had come to it egwene was still not sure how to tell what she knew without betraying herself to the wise ones but perhaps the only method was to just tell it and then feel her way elaida is amyrlin moiraine i do not know what has happened to siuan how do you know moiraine said quietly did you learn something dreamwalking or has your talent as a dreamer finally manifested itself that was her way out some of the aes sedai in the tower thought that she might be a dreamer a woman whose dreams foretold the future she did have dreams that she knew were significant but learning to interpret them was another matter the wise ones said the knowledge had to come from within and none of the aes sedai had been any more help rand sitting down in a chair and somehow she knew that the chairs owner would be murderously angry at having her chair taken that the owner was a woman was as much as she could pick out of that and not a thing more sometimes the dreams were complex perrin lounging with faile on his lap kissing her while she played with the shortcut beard that he wore in the dream behind them two banners waved a red wolfs head and a crimson eagle a man in a bright yellow coat stood near to perrins shoulder a sword strapped to his back in some way she knew that he was a tinker though no tinker would even touch a sword and every bit of it except the beard seemed important the banners faile kissing perrin even the tinker every time he moved closer to perrin it was as if a chill of doom shot through everything another dream mat throwing dice with blood streaming down his face the wide brim of his hat pulled low so she could not see his wound while thom merrilin put his hand into a fire to draw out the small blue stone that now dangled on moiraines forehead or a dream of a storm great dark clouds rolling without wind or rain while forked lightning bolts every one identical rent the earth she had the dreams but as a dreamer she was a failure so far i saw an arrest warrant for you moiraine signed by elaida as amyrlin and it was no ordinary dream all true just not all of the truth she was suddenly glad that nynaeve was not there id be the one staring at a cup if she was the wheel weaves as the wheel wills perhaps it will not matter so much if rand takes the aiel across the dragonwall i doubt that elaida has continued to approach rulers even if she knows that siuan was doing so is that all you can say i think siuan was your friend once moiraine cant you shed a tear for her the aes sedai looked at her and that cool serene gaze told her how far she had to go before she could use that title herself sitting egwene was nearly a head taller and she was stronger in the power besides but there was more to being aes sedai than strength i have no time for tears egwene the dragonwall is not many days distant now and the alguenya siuan and i were friends once in a few months it will be twentyone years since we began the search for the dragon reborn only the two of us newly raised aes sedai sierin vayu was raised amyrlin shortly after a gray with more than a touch of red in her had she learned what we intended we would have spent the rest of our lives doing penance with red sisters watching us even while we slept there is a saying in cairhien though i have heard it as far away as tarabon and saldaea take what you want and pay for it siuan and i took the path we wanted and we knew we would have to pay for it eventually i do not see how you can be so calm siuan could be dead or even stilled elaida will either oppose rand altogether or try to hold him somewhere until tarmon gaidon you know shell never let a man who can channel run free at least not everyone is behind elaida some of the blue ajah are gathering somewhere i dont know where yet and i think others have left the tower too nynaeve said that she was given a message about all sisters being welcome to return to the tower by an eyesandears of the yellow if blues and yellows have both gone others must have and if they oppose elaida they may support rand moiraine sighed a soft sound do you expect me to be happy that the white tower has split apart i am aes sedai egwene i gave my life to the tower long before i ever suspected the dragon would be reborn in my lifetime the tower has been a bulwark against the shadow for three thousand years it has guided rulers to wise decisions stopped wars before they began halted wars that did begin that humankind even remembers that the dark one waits to escape that the last battle will come is because of the tower the tower whole and united i could almost wish that every sister had sworn to elaida whatever happened to siuan and rand egwene kept her voice just as steady just as smooth the flames were beginning to put a little warmth into the air but moiraine had just added her own chill the dragon reborn you yourself said that he cannot be ready for tarmon gaidon unless he is allowed his freedom both to learn and to affect the world the tower united could take him prisoner despite all the aiel in the waste moiraine smiled a small smile you learn cool reason is always better than hot words but you forget that only thirteen sisters linked can shield any man from saidin and even if they do not know the trick of tying flows fewer can hold that shield i know you are not giving up moiraine what do you mean to do i mean to deal with the world as i find the world for as long as i can at least rand will be easier to be around now that i no longer need try to turn him from what he wants i suppose i should be happy that he does not make me fetch his wine he does listen most of the time even if he seldom gives any sign what he thinks of what i tell him i will leave you to tell him about siuan and the tower that would avoid awkward questions with rand as bigheaded as he was he might want to know more about her dreaming than she could invent theres something else nynaeve has seen forsaken in telaranrhiod she mentioned every last one still alive except asmodean and moghedien including lanfear she thinks they are plotting something perhaps together lanfear moiraine said after a moment they both knew that lanfear had visited rand in tear and maybe other times that he had not told them of no one had much knowledge of the forsaken except the forsaken themselves only fragments of fragments remained in the tower but it was known that lanfear had loved lews therin telamon they two and rand knew that she still did with luck the aes sedai went on we will not have to worry about lanfear the others nynaeve saw are another matter you and i must keep as close a watch as we can i wish more of the wise ones could channel she gave a small laugh but i might as well wish they were all tower trained while i am about it or to live forever they may be strong in many ways but they are sadly lacking in others a watch is all very well but what else if six forsaken come at him together he will need every bit of help we can give him moiraine leaned over to put a hand on her arm a look of affection on her face we cannot hold his hand forever egwene he has learned to walk he is learning to run we can only hope he learns before his enemies catch him and of course continue to advise him to guide him when we can straightening she stretched and stifled a small yawn behind her hand it is late egwene and i expect that rand will have us breaking camp in a very few hours now even if he gets no sleep at all i however would like to take what rest i can before facing my saddle egwene made ready to go but first she had a question moiraine why have you started doing everything rand tells you to even nynaeve doesnt think it is right she does not does she moiraine murmured she will be aes sedai yet whatever she wishes why because i remembered how to control saidar after a moment egwene nodded to control saidar first you had to surrender to it it was not until she was shivering her way back to her own tent that she realized moiraine had spoken to her the whole time as an equal perhaps she was closer to being ready to choose her ajah than she thought chapter sunburst an unexpected offer sunlight creeping through the window woke nynaeve for a moment she lay sprawled atop the striped coverlet elayne lay sleeping in the other bed the early morning was already warm and the night had not been much better but that was not the reason nynaeves shift was twisted and sweaty her dreams after discussing what she had seen with elayne had not been good in most she had been back in the tower being dragged before the amyrlin who was sometimes elaida and sometimes moghedien in some rand had been lying beside the amyrlins writing table like a dog collared and leashed and muzzled the dreams about egwene had been as bad in a way boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf tasted just as bad in a dream as they did awake making her way to the washstand she cleansed her face and scrubbed her teeth with salt and soda the water was not hot but it could not be called cool either the sodden shift she stripped off and dug a fresh one from one of the chests along with a hairbrush and mirror peering at her own image she regretted undoing her braid for comfort it had not helped and now her hair hung in a tangle to her waist sitting down on the chest she laboriously worked the knots out then began giving her hair its hundred strokes three scratches ran down her neck and disappeared beneath her shift they were not as red as they might have been thanks to an ointment of healall taken from the macura woman she had told elayne they came from brambles foolish she suspected that elayne knew it was not true despite her tale of looking about the tower grounds after egwene left but she had been too upset to think straight she had snapped at the other woman several times for no reason except that she was thinking about her unfair treatment by melaine and egwene not that it doesnt do her good to be reminded shes not the daughterheir here still it was none of the girls fault she would have to make it up to her in the mirror she saw elayne rise and begin washing i still think my plan is best the girl said scrubbing her face her ravendyed hair did not seem to have one snarl despite her curls we could be in tear much more quickly my way her plan was to abandon the coach once they reached the eldar at some small village where there would not likely be many whitecloaks and just as important no eyesandears for the tower there they were to take a riverboat down to ebou dar where they could find a ship for tear that they had to go to tear was no longer in doubt tar valon they would avoid at all cost how long before a boat stops where we are nynaeve said patiently she had thought this was all settled before they went to sleep it had been to her mind you yourself said that every boat might not stop and how long do we wait in ebou dar before we find a ship for tear putting the brush down she began remaking her braid the villagers hang out a flag if they want a boat to put in and most will and there are always ships for anywhere in a seaport the size of ebou dar as if the girl had ever been in a seaport of any size before leaving the tower with nynaeve elayne always thought that whatever she had not learned of the world as daughterheir of andor she had learned in the tower even after plenty of proof to the contrary and how dare she put on that forbearing tone with her we are not likely to find that gathering of blues on a ship elayne her own plan was to stick with the coach cross the rest of amadicia then altara and murandy to far madding in the hills of kintara and over the plains of maredo to tear it would certainly take longer but aside from the chance of finding that gathering somehow coaches very rarely sank she could swim but she was not comfortable with land completely out of sight patting her face dry elayne changed her shift and came to help with doing the braid nynaeve was not fooled she would hear about boats again her stomach did not like boats not that that had influenced her decision of course if she could bring aes sedai to rands aiel it would be well worth the longer travel time have you recalled the name elayne asked weaving the strands of hair at least i remembered there was a name light give me time she was sure there had been a name a town it would have to be or a city she could not have seen the name of a country and forgotten it drawing a long breath she took a hold on her temper and went on in a milder tone i will remember it elayne just give me time elayne made a noncommittal sound and continued braiding after a bit she said was it really wise to send birgitte looking for moghedien nynaeve shot the young woman a sidelong frown but it rolled off her like water off oiled silk as a change of subject this was not the one she would have chosen better we find her than she finds us i suppose so but what will we do when we find her she had no answer for that but it was better to be the hunter than the hunted however roughly it went the black ajah had taught her that the common room was not crowded when they went down yet even at that early hour there was a sprinkling of pale cloaks among the patrons mostly on older men all with officers rank no doubt they preferred to eat from the inns kitchens rather than what whitecloak cooks dished up in the garrison nynaeve would almost rather have eaten on a tray again but that little room was like a box all of these men were intent on their food the whitecloaks no less than the others surely it was quite safe cooking smells filled the air apparently these men wanted beef or mutton even first thing in the morning no sooner did elaynes foot leave the last step than mistress jharen bustled up to offer them or the lady morelin rather a private dining room nynaeve never shifted her eyes toward elayne but the other woman said i think we will eat here i seldom have the opportunity to eat in a common room and i quite enjoy it really have one of your girls bring us something cooling if the day is like this already i fear ill swelter before we reach the next stop it was a constant wonder to nynaeve that that haughty manner never got them thrown bodily into the street she had met enough lords and ladies by now to know that nearly all behaved in that fashion but still she would not have put up with it for a minute the innkeeper though bobbed a curtsy smiling and drywashing her hands then showed them to a table near a window looking onto the street and scurried away to do elaynes bidding perhaps that was her way of getting back at the girl they were off by themselves well away from the men already at other tables but anyone walking by could stare in at them and if any of their food was hot which she hoped it was not they were as far from the kitchens as it was possible to be when it came breakfast consisted of spicy muffins wrapped in a white cloth and still warm and pleasant even so yellow pears blue grapes that looked a bit wizened and some sort of red things that the serving girl called strawberries though they looked like no berry that nynaeve had ever seen they certainly did not taste anything like straw especially with clotted cream spooned on top elayne claimed to have heard of them but then she would with a lightly spiced wine supposedly cooled in the springhouse one sip told her that the spring was not very cool if there was one it made a refreshing morning meal the nearest man was three tables away and he wore a dark blue woolen coat a prosperous tradesman perhaps but they did not talk plenty of time for that when they were on the road again and could be sure that there was no danger of sharp ears nynaeve finished her food well before elayne the way the girl took her time quartering a pear you would think they had all day to sit at table suddenly elaynes eyes went wide with shock and the short knife clattered to the table nynaeves head whipped around to find a man taking the bench on the other side of the table i thought it was you elayne but the hair put me off at first nynaeve stared at galad elaynes halfbrother stared was the word of course tall and steely slender dark of hair and eye he was the most handsome man she had ever seen handsome was not enough he was gorgeous she had seen women cluster around him in the tower even aes sedai all of them smiling like fools she wiped the smile from her own face but she could do nothing about her racing heart nor make herself breathe properly she did not feel anything for him it was just that he was beautiful take hold of yourself woman what are you doing here she was pleased that she did not sound strangled it was not fair for a man to look like that and what are you doing wearing that elaynes voice was low but it still held a snap nynaeve blinked and realized he wore a shirt of shining mail and a white cloak with two golden knots of rank beneath a flaring sun she felt color rising in her cheeks staring at a mans face so hard that she had not even seen what he was wearing she wanted to hide her own face from humiliation he smiled and nynaeve had to take a deep breath i am here because i was one of the children recalled from the north and i am a child of the light because it seemed the right thing to do elayne when you two and egwene vanished it did not take long for gawyn and me to find out that you were not doing penance on a farm whatever we were told they had no right to involve you in their plots elayne any of you you seem to have attained rank very quickly nynaeve said did the fool man not realize that talking of aes sedai plots here was a good way to get them both killed eamon valda seemed to think my experience warranted it wherever gained his shrug dismissed rank as unimportant it was not modesty precisely but not pretense either the finest swordsman among those who came to study with the warders in the tower he had also stood high in the classes on strategy and tactics but nynaeve could not remember him boasting about his prowess even in jest accomplishments meant nothing to him perhaps because they came so easily does mother know of this elayne demanded still in that quiet voice her scowl would have frightened a wild boar though galad shifted just a hair uneasily there has been no good time to write her but do not be so sure she will disapprove elayne she is not so friendly with the north as she was i hear a ban may be made law i sent her a letter explaining elaynes glare had transformed to puzzlement she must understand she trained in the tower too keep your voice down he said low and hard remember where you are elayne flushed a deep red but whether in anger or embarrassment nynaeve could not say abruptly she realized that he had been speaking as quietly as they and carefully too he had not mentioned the tower once or aes sedai is egwene with you he went on no she replied and he sighed deeply i had hoped gawyn was nearly unhinged with worry when she disappeared he cares for her too will you tell me where she is nynaeve took note of that too the man had become a whitecloak yet he cared for a woman who wanted to be aes sedai men were so strange they were hardly human sometimes we will not elayne said firmly the crimson receding from her cheeks is gawyn here too i will not believe he has become a she had the wit to lower her voice further but she still said a whitecloak he remains in the north elayne nynaeve supposed that he meant tar valon but surely gawyn had gone from there surely he could not support elaida you cannot know what has happened there elayne he continued all the corruption and vileness in that place bubbled to the top as it had to the woman who sent you away has been deposed he looked around and dropped his voice to a momentary whisper despite no one being close enough to overhear stilled and executed taking a deep breath he made a disgusted sound it was never a place for you or for egwene i have not been long with the children but i am certain my captain will give me leave to escort my sister home that is where you should be with mother tell me where egwene is and i will see that she is brought to caemlyn too you will both be safe there nynaeves face felt numb stilled and executed not an accidental death or illness that she had considered the possibility did not make the fact less shocking rand had to be the reason if there had ever been any small hope that the tower might not oppose him it was gone elayne showed no expression at all her eyes staring at the distance i see my news shocks you he said in a low voice i do not know how deeply that woman meshed you in her plot but you are free of her now let me see you safely to caemlyn no one need know you had any more contact with her than the other girls who went there to learn either of you nynaeve showed him her teeth in what she hoped looked like a smile it was nice to be included finally she could have smacked him if only he were not so goodlooking i will think on it elayne said slowly what you say makes sense but you must give me time to think i must think nynaeve stared at her it made sense the girl was blathering i can give you a little time he said but i do not have much if i am to ask leave we may be ordered suddenly there was a squarefaced blackhaired whitecloak clapping galad on the shoulder and grinning widely older he wore the same two knots of rank on his cloak well young galad you cant keep all the pretty women for yourself every girl in town sighs when you walk by and most of their mothers as well introduce me galad scraped back his bench to stand i thought i knew them when they came downstairs trom but whatever charm you think i possess it does not work on this lady she does not like me and i think she will not like any friend of mine if you practice the sword with me this afternoon perhaps you can attract one or two never with you around trom grumped goodnaturedly and id sooner let the farrier pound my head with his hammer than practice against you but he let galad start him for the door with only a regretful look at the two women as they left galad shot a glance back at the table full of frustration and indecision no sooner were they out of sight than elayne stood nana i need you upstairs mistress jharen materialized at her side inquiring if she had enjoyed her repast and elayne said i require my driver and footman immediately nana will settle the bill she was moving for the stairs before she finished speaking nynaeve stared after her then dug out her purse and paid the woman making assurances that everything had been to her mistresss liking and trying not to wince at the price once rid of the woman she hurried upstairs elayne was stuffing their things into the chests any which way including the sweaty shifts they had hung on the ends of the beds to dry elayne whats the matter we must leave immediately nynaeve at once she did not look up until the last article was crammed in right this minute wherever he is galad is puzzling over something he may never have faced before two things that are right but opposite to his mind it is right to tie me to a packhorse if necessary and haul me to mother to salve her worries and save me from becoming aes sedai whatever i want and it is also right to turn us in to the whitecloaks or the army or both that is the law in amadicia and whitecloak law too aes sedai are outlawed here and so is any woman who has ever trained in the tower mother met ailron once to sign a trade treaty and they had to do it in altara because mother could not legally enter amadicia i embraced saidar the moment i saw him and i wont let it go until we are far from him surely you exaggerate elayne he is your brother he is not my brother elayne drew a deep breath and let it out slowly we had the same father she said in a calmer voice but he is not my brother i will not have him nynaeve ive told you time and again but you will not take it in galad does what is right always he never lies did you hear what he said to that trom fellow he didnt say he did not know who we are every word he said was the truth he does what is right no matter who is hurt by it even himself or me he used to tell on gawyn and me for everything and on himself too if he decides the wrong way we will have whitecloaks lying in ambush for us before we reach the edge of the village a tap sounded at the door and nynaeves breath caught in her throat surely galad would not really elaynes face was set ready to fight hesitantly nynaeve cracked the door it was thom and juilin with that fool hat in his hand my lady wants us thom asked with a touch of servility for anyone who might overhear able to breathe again not caring who was listening she snatched the door the rest of the way open get in here you two she was growing tired of them looking at one another every time she spoke before she had the door shut again elayne said thom we must leave right away the determined look had left her face and anxiety filled her voice galad is here you must remember what a monster he was as a child well he is no better grown and he is a whitecloak besides he could the words seemed to catch in her throat she stared at thom mouth working soundlessly but no more wideeyed than he stared at her he sat down heavily on one of the chests never taking his eyes from elaynes i clearing his throat roughly he went on i thought i saw him watching the inn a whitecloak but he looked the man the boy would grow into i suppose it shouldnt be a surprise he grew into a whitecloak at that nynaeve went to the window elayne and thom hardly seemed to notice her passage between them traffic was beginning to pick up in the street farmers and farm carts and villagers mingling with whitecloaks and soldiers across the way one whitecloak was sitting on an upended barrel that perfect face unmistakable did he elayne swallowed did he recognize you no fifteen years changes a man more than it does a boy elayne i thought you had forgotten i remembered in tanchico thom with a wavering smile elayne reached out and tugged one of his long mustaches thom smiled back almost as unsteadily he looked as if he was contemplating a leap from the window juilin was scratching his head and nynaeve wished she had some idea what they were talking about too but there were more important matters at hand we still have to leave before he brings the entire garrison down on us with him watching it wont be easy i havent seen another patron who looks like they have a coach ours is the only one in the stableyard juilin said thom and elayne were still staring at one another plainly not hearing a word driving off with the curtains down was no protection then nynaeve was willing to bet that galad had already learned exactly how they had come to sienda is there a back way from the stableyard a gate wide enough for one of us at a time juilin said dryly and whats on the other side is little more than an alley anyway there arent more than two or three streets in this village wide enough for the coach he studied that cylindrical hat turning it in his hands i could get close enough to crack his head if you were ready you could drive off during the confusion i could catch you up on the road nynaeve sniffed loudly how gallop after on skulker even if you didnt fall out of the saddle inside a mile do you think you would even reach a horse if you attacked a whitecloak in that street galad was still there across the street and trom had joined him the pair apparently chatting idly she leaned over and yanked thoms nearest mustache do you have anything to add any brilliant plans did all your listening to gossip yield anything that might help he clapped a hand to his face and gave her an offended look not unless you think theres help in ailron laying claim to some border villages in altara a strip the whole length of the border from salidar to so eban to mosra is there any help in that nynaeve is there try to pull a mans mustache out of his face somebody ought to box your ears for once what would ailron want with a strip along the border thom elayne asked perhaps she was interested she seemed interested in every fool twist and turn of politics and diplomacy or perhaps she was just trying to stop an argument she used to try smoothing over things all the time before she became wrapped up in flirting with thom it isnt the king child his voice softened for her its pedron niall ailron does what he is told usually though he and niall make out that it isnt so most of those villages have been empty since the whitecloak war what the children call the troubles niall was the general in the field then and i doubt hes ever given up wanting altara if he controls both banks of the eldar he can squeeze the river trade to ebou dar and if he can crack ebou dar the rest of altara will trickle into his hands like grain flowing from a hole in a sack that is all very well nynaeve said firmly before he or the girl could speak again there had been something in what he had said that tickled her memory but she could not say what or why in any case they had no time for lectures on relations between amadicia and altara not with galad and trom watching the front of the inn she said as much adding what about you juilin you consort with low types the thiefcatcher always sought out the cutpurses and burglars and footpads in a town he claimed they knew more of what was really going on than any official are there smugglers we can bribe to sneak us out or or you know the sort of thing we need man i heard little thieves keep low in amadicia nynaeve first offense is branding second is loss of your right hand and third is hanging whether its the kings crown or a loaf of bread there arent many thieves in a town this size not who do it for a living he was contemptuous of amateur thieves and for the most part they only wanted to talk about two things whether the prophet is really coming to amadicia the way rumor says he is and whether the town fathers might relent and let that traveling menagerie put on a show sienda is too far from the borders for smugglers to she cut him off with peremptory satisfaction that is it the menagerie they all looked at her as if she had gone mad of course thom said much too mildly we can get luca to bring the boarhorses back and make off while they destroy some more of the town i dont know what you gave him nynaeve but he threw a rock at us as we were driving off for once nynaeve forgave him his sarcasm feeble as it was and his lack of wit to see what she saw thats as may be thom merrilin but master luca wants a patron and elayne and i are going to be his patrons we still have to abandon the coach and team that smarted she could have built a snug house in the two rivers for what they had cost and sneak out that back way tossing open the chest with the leafshaped hinges she rooted through clothes and blankets and pots and everything that she had not wanted to leave behind with the wagon full of dyes she had made sure that the men packed everything except the harness until she came to the gilded caskets and the purses thom you and juilin go out by that back gate and find a wagon and team of some sort buy some supplies and meet us on the road back to lucas camp regretfully she filled thoms hand with gold not even bothering to count there was no telling what things would cost and she did not want him wasting time bargaining that is a wonderful idea elayne said grinning galad will be looking for two women not a troupe of animals and jugglers and he will never think we would head for ghealdan nynaeve had not thought of that she had intended making luca head straight for tear a menagerie such as he had put together with tumblers and jugglers in addition to animals could earn its way almost anywhere she was sure but if galad did come looking for them or send someone it would be to the east and he might be smart enough to look even in a menagerie men did show brains sometimes usually when you least expected it that was the first thing i thought of elayne she ignored the sudden faint taste in her mouth the acrid memory of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf thom and juilin protested of course not the idea as such but they seemed to think that one of them remaining behind could protect her and elayne against galad and any number of whitecloaks they did not seem to realize that if it came to that channeling would do more than the pair of them and ten more besides they still seemed troubled but she managed to push them both out with the stern injunction and dont you dare come back here we will meet you on the road if it comes to channeling elayne quietly said once the door was shut we will quickly find ourselves facing the whole whitecloak garrison and probably the army garrison as well the power doesnt make us invincible all it will take is two arrows we will worry about that when it comes nynaeve told her she hoped the men had not thought of that if they had likely one of them would lurk about and probably rouse galads suspicions if he was not careful she was ready to accept their help when it was needed ronde macura had taught her that though having to be rescued like a kitten down a well still galled but it would be when she thought it necessary not they a quick trip downstairs found mistress jharen her lady had changed her mind she did not think she could face the heat and dust of travel again so quickly she intended to nap and did not want to be disturbed until a late supper that she would send down for here was the coin for another nights lodging the innkeeper was very understanding of a noble ladys delicacy and how inconstant their desires nynaeve thought mistress jharen would be understanding of anything short of murder so long as the reckoning was paid leaving the plump woman nynaeve cornered one of the serving girls for a moment a few silver pennies changed hands and the girl darted off in her apron to find two of the deep bonnets that nynaeve said looked so shady and cool not the sort of thing her lady would wear of course but they would do nicely for her when she got back to the room elayne had the gilded caskets on a blanket with the dark polished box holding the recovered terangreal and the washleather purse that held the seal the fat purses of coin lay beside nynaeves scrip on the other bed folding the blanket elayne tied the bundle with some stout cord from one of their chests nynaeve had saved everything she regretted leaving it all behind now it was not just the expense not only that you never knew when something was going to come in handy take the two woolen dresses that elayne had laid out on her bed they were not fine enough for a lady and too fine for a ladys maid but if they had left them in mardecin as elayne had wanted they would be in a fine fix for clothing now kneeling nynaeve rummaged in another chest a few shifts two more wool dresses for changes the pair of castiron frying pans in a canvas bag were perfectly good but too heavy and the men would certainly not forget replacements for those the sewing kit in its neat boneinlaid box they would never think to buy so much as a pin her mind was only partly on her selections though you knew thom before she asked in what she hoped was a casual tone she watched elayne from the corner of her eye while pretending to concentrate on rolling stockings the girl had begun pulling out clothes of her own sighing over the silks before putting them aside she froze with her hands deep in one of the chests and she did not look at nynaeve he was courtbard in caemlyn when i was little she said quietly i see she did not see at all how did a man go from a courtbard entertaining royalty the next thing to a noble to a gleeman wandering from village to village he was mothers lover after father died elayne had gone back to choosing and she said it so matteroffactly that nynaeve gaped your mothers the other woman still was not looking at her though i did not remember him until tanchico i was very small it was his mustaches and standing close enough to look up at his face and hearing him recite part of the great hunt of the horn he thought id forgotten again her face colored slightly i drank too much wine and the next day i made out that i could not remember anything nynaeve could only shake her head she remembered the night the girl had filled her fool self with wine at least she had never done that again her head the next morning had seemed an effective cure now she knew why the girl behaved as she did with thom she had seen the same back in the two rivers a few times a girl just old enough to really think of herself as a woman who else would she measure herself against except her mother and sometimes who better to compete against to prove that she was a woman usually it led to no more than trying to be better at everything from cooking to sewing or maybe some harmless flirting with her father but in the case of one widow nynaeve had seen the womans nearly grown daughter make a complete fool of herself trying to capture the man her mother intended to marry the trouble was nynaeve had no idea what to do about this silliness in elayne despite severe lectures and more from her and the womens circle sari ayellin had not settled down until her mother was married again and she herself had found a husband too i suppose he must have been like a second father to you nynaeve said carefully she pretended to concentrate on her own packing thom had certainly been looking at the girl that way it explained so much i hardly think of him so elayne appeared intent on deciding how many silk shifts to take but her eyes saddened i cannot really remember my father i was only a baby when he died gawyn says he spent all of his time with galad lini tried to make the best of it but i know he never came to see gawyn or me in the nursery he would have i know once we were old enough to teach things like galad but he died nynaeve tried again at least thom is fit for a man of his age wed be in a fine fix if he suffered from stiff joints old men often do he could still do backflips if not for his limp and i dont care if he does limp he is intelligent and knowledgeable about the world he is gentle and yet i feel quite safe with him i dont think i should tell him that he tries to protect me enough as it is with a sigh nynaeve gave up for now at least thom might look on elayne as a daughter but if the girl kept this up he just might remember that she was not and then elayne would find herself in the pickling kettle thom is very fond of you elayne time to shift to some other subject are you sure about galad elayne are you sure galad could turn us in elayne the other woman gave a start wiping a small frown from her face what galad im certain nynaeve and if we refuse to let him take us to caemlyn that will only make the decision for him muttering to herself nynaeve pulled a silk riding dress out of her chest sometimes she thought the creator had only made men to cause trouble for women chapter elephant heading west when the serving girl came with the bonnets elayne was stretched out on one of the beds in a white silk shift a damp cloth over her eyes and nynaeve was pretending to mend the hem of the pale green dress that elayne had been wearing as often as not she stuck her thumb she would never have admitted it to anyone but she was not very good at needlework she wore her dress of course maids did not loll about like ladies but she did have her hair hanging loose clearly she had no intention of leaving the room any time soon she thanked the girl in a whisper so as not to wake her lady and pressed another silver penny on her with the repeated injunction that her lady was not to be disturbed on any account as soon as the door clicked shut elayne bounded to her feet and began pulling their bundles out from under the beds nynaeve tossed the silk gown down and twisted her arms behind her to undo her buttons in no time at all they were ready nynaeve in green wool elayne in blue with the bundles on their backs nynaeve carried the scrip with her herbs and the money elayne the blanketwrapped boxes the deep curving brims of the bonnets hid their faces so well that nynaeve thought they could have walked right by galad without him knowing them especially with her hair down he would remember the braid mistress jharen however might well stop two strange women coming with fat bundles from upstairs the back stairs ran down the outside of the inn narrow stone flights clinging to the wall nynaeve felt a moment of sympathy for thom and juilin hauling the heavy chests up these but mainly her attention was on the stableyard and the slateroofed stone stable a yellow dog lay in the shade beneath the coach sheltering from the already increasing heat but all of the grooms were inside now and again she could see movement beyond the open stable doors but no one came out it was shady in there too they trotted quickly across the stableyard to the alley between the stable and a tall stone fence a full dung cart swarming with flies and scarcely narrower than the alleyway was just rumbling by nynaeve suspected that the glow of saidar surrounded elayne though she could not see it she herself was hoping that the dog did not decide to bark that no one came out of the kitchens or the stable using the power was no way to sneak off quietly and talking their way clear would leave traces for galad to follow the rough wooden gate at the end of the alley had only a liftlatch and the narrow street beyond lined with simple stone houses with more thatched roofs than otherwise was empty except for a handful of boys playing some game that seemed to involve hitting each other with a beanbag the only adult in sight was a man feeding a cote of pigeons on a roof opposite his head and shoulders up through a trapdoor neither he nor the boys more than glanced at them as they shut the gate and started along the winding street as if they had every right to be there they had walked a good five miles west of sienda along the dusty road before thom and juilin caught up thom driving what looked like a tinkers wagon save that it was all one color a drab green with the paint flaked off in large patches nynaeve was grateful to stuff her bundles under the drivers seat and climb up beside him but not so pleased to see juilin riding skulker i told you not to go back to the inn she told him vowing to hit him with something if he looked at thom i did not go back he said unaware that he had saved himself a sore head i told the head stableman that my lady wanted berries fresh from the country and thom and i had to go fetch them its the sort of nonsense that some no he cut off clearing his throat as elayne gave him a cool expressionless look from the other side of thom sometimes he forgot that she really was of royalty we had to have some reason to leave the inn and the stables thom said whipping up the horses i suppose you two said you were taking to your room with fainting spells or the lady morelin was but the grooms would have been wondering why we wanted to wander about in the heat instead of staying in a nice cool hayloft with no work to do and maybe a pitcher of ale perhaps well not be worth talking about now elayne gave thom a level look no doubt for the fainting spells that he pretended not to see or perhaps did not men could be blind when it suited them nynaeve sniffed loudly he could not miss that he certainly cracked his whip over the lead horses sharply enough right after it was all just an excuse so they could take turns riding that was another thing men did made excuses to do exactly what they wanted at least elayne was frowning at him slightly instead of simpering there is something else i learned last night thom went on after a time pedron niall is trying to unite the nations against rand not that i dont believe it thom nynaeve said but how could you learn that i cannot think some whitecloak simply told you too many people were saying the same thing nynaeve theres a false dragon in tear a false dragon and never mind prophecies about the stone of tear falling or callandor this fellow is dangerous and the nations ought to unite the way they did in the aiel war and who better to lead them against this false dragon than pedron niall when so many tongues say the same thing the same thought exists higher up and in amadicia not even ailron expresses a thought without asking niall first the old gleeman always seemed to put together rumors and whispers and come up with right answers far more often than not no not a gleeman she had to remember that whatever he might claim he had been a courtbard and had probably seen court intrigue like that in his stories at close hand perhaps even dabbled in it himself if he had been morgases lover she eyed him sideways that leathery face with bushy white eyebrows those long mustaches as snowy as the hair on his head there was no accounting for some womens taste it isnt as if we should not have expected something like this she never had but she should have mother will support rand elayne said i know she will she knows the prophecies and she has as much influence as pedron niall the slight shake of thoms head denied the last at least morgase ruled a wealthy nation but there were whitecloaks in every land and from every land nynaeve realized she was going to have to start paying more attention to thom perhaps he really did know as much as he pretended so now you think we should have let galad escort us to caemlyn elayne leaned forward to give her a firm look past thom certainly not for one thing there is no way to be sure that that would be his decision and for another she straightened obscuring herself behind the man she seemed to be talking to herself reminding herself for another if mother really has turned against the tower i want to do all my speaking to her by letter for the time being she is quite capable of holding us both in the palace for our own good she may not be able to channel but i do not want to try going against her until i am full aes sedai if then a strong woman thom said pleasantly morgase would teach you manners quickly enough nynaeve she gave him another loud sniff all that loose hair hanging over her shoulders was no good for gripping but the old fool only grinned at her the sun stood high by the time they reached the menagerie still camped exactly where they had left it in the clearing by the road in the still heat even the oaks looked a bit wilted except for the horses and the great gray boarhorses the animals were all back in their cages and the humans were out of sight too no doubt inside the wagons that looked not much different from theirs nynaeve and the others had all climbed down before valan luca appeared still in that ridiculous red silk cape there were no flowery speeches this time no capeswirling bows his eyes widened when he recognized thom and juilin narrowed at the boxlike wagon behind them he bent to peer into the deep bonnets and his smile was not pleasant so come down in the world have we my lady morelin or maybe we were never up at all stole a coach and some clothes did you well i would hate to see such a pretty forehead branded that is what they do here in case you dont know if they do not do worse so since it seems youve been found out else why are you running i would suggest you hurry on as fast as you can if you want your bloody penny back its somewhere up the road i threw it after you and it can lie there till tarmon gaidon for all i care you wanted a patron nynaeve said as he was turning away we can be your patrons you he sneered but he stopped even if a few coins stolen from some lords purse would help i will not accept stolen we will pay your expenses master luca elayne broke in with that coolly arrogant tone of hers and one hundred gold marks besides if we can travel with you to ghealdan and if you agree not to stop until you reach the border luca stared at her running his tongue over his teeth nynaeve groaned softly a hundred marks and gold a hundred silver would cover his expenses easily to ghealdan and further whatever those socalled boarhorses ate you stole that much luca said cautiously who is after you i wont risk whitecloaks or the army theyll throw us all into prison and probably kill the animals my brother elayne replied before nynaeve could angrily deny that they had stolen anything it seems that a marriage has been arranged while i was away and my brother was sent to find me i have no intention of returning to cairhien to marry a man a head shorter three times my weight and thrice my age her cheeks colored in only a fair imitation of anger her throat clearing did it better my father has dreams of claiming the sun throne if he can gain enough support my dreams concern a redhaired andorman whom i shall wed whatever my father says and that master luca is as much as you need know of me and more maybe you are who you say you are luca said slowly and maybe you are not show me some of this money you claim youll give me promises buy small cups of wine angrily nynaeve fumbled in her scrip for the fattest purse and shook it at him then stuffed it out of sight when he reached for it youll get what you need as you need it and the hundred marks after we reach ghealdan a hundred marks gold they would have to find a banker and use those lettersofrights if elayne kept on like this luca gave a sour grunt whether you stole that or not you are still running from somebody i wont risk my show for you whether its the army or some cairhienin lord who might come looking the lord might be worse if he thinks i have stolen his sister you will have to blend in that unpleasant smile came on his face again he was not going to forget that silver penny everybody who travels with me works at something and you must as well if you mean not to stand out if the others know you are paying your way they will talk and you would not want that cleaning the cages will do the horse handlers are always complaining about having to do that ill even find that penny and give it back to you for pay never let it be said valan luca is not generous nynaeve was about to say in no uncertain terms that they would not pay his way to ghealdan and work too when thom laid a hand on her arm wordlessly he bent to scuffle up pebbles from the ground and began juggling them six in a circle i have jugglers luca said the six became eight then ten a dozen you are not bad the circle became two intertwining luca rubbed at his chin maybe i could find a use for you i can also eat fire thom said letting the stones fall perform with knives he fanned his empty hands then seemingly pulled a pebble from lucas ear and do a few other things luca suppressed his quick grin that does for you but what about the rest he seemed angry with himself for showing any enthusiasm or approval what is that elayne asked pointing the two tall poles nynaeve had seen being erected now each had ropes to stay it and a flat platform at its top with a rope stretched taut over the thirty paces between a rope ladder hung from each platform that is sedrins apparatus luca replied then shook his head sedrin the highwalker dazzling with feats ten paces up on a thin rope the fool i can walk on it elayne told him thom reached for her arm as she took off her bonnet and started forward but he subsided at a small shake of her head and a smile luca barred her way though listen morelin or whatever your name is your forehead may be too pretty to brand but your neck is far too pretty to snap sedrin knew what he was doing and we finished burying him not more than an hour ago thats why everyone is in their wagons of course he drank too much last night after we were chased out of sienda but ive seen him highwalk with a bellyful of brandy i will tell you what you do not have to clean cages you move into my wagon and we will tell everyone youre my ladylove just as a tale of course his sly smile said he hoped for more than a tale elaynes smile in return should have raised frost on him i do thank you for the offer master luca but if you will kindly step aside he had to or else have her walk over him juilin crumpled that cylindrical hat in his hands then crammed it back onto his head as she began climbing one of the rope ladders having a little difficulty with her skirts nynaeve knew what the girl was doing the men should have and perhaps thom did at least but he still looked ready to rush over to catch her if she fell luca moved nearer as though the same thought was in his head for a moment elayne stood on the platform smoothing her dress the platform looked much smaller and higher with her on it then delicately holding her skirts up as if to keep them out of mud she stepped out onto the narrow rope she might as well have been walking across a street in a way nynaeve knew she was she could not see the glow of saidar but she knew that elayne had woven a path between the two platforms of air no doubt turned hard as stone abruptly elayne put her hands down and turned two cartwheels ravenblack hair flailing silkstockinged legs flashing in the sun for the merest instant as she righted herself her skirts seemed to brush a flat surface before she snatched them up again two more steps took her to the far platform did master sedrin do that master luca he did somersaults he shouted back in a mutter he added but he did not have legs like that a lady hah i am not the only one with this skill elayne called juilin and nynaeve gave a fierce shake of her head channeling or no channeling her stomach would enjoy that high rope as much as it did a storm at sea and i have done this many times come on juilin show him the thiefcatcher looked as if he would rather clean the cages with his bare hands the lions cages with the lions inside he closed his eyes mouth moving in a silent prayer and went up the rope ladder in the manner of a man mounting the scaffold at the top he stared from elayne to the rope with a fearful concentration abruptly he stepped out walking rapidly arms stretched out to either side eyes fixed on elayne and mouth moving in prayer she climbed partway down the ladder to make room for him on the platform then had to help him find the rungs with his feet and guide him down thom grinned at her proudly as she came back and took her bonnet from nynaeve juilin looked as if he had been soaked in hot water and wrung out that was good luca said rubbing his chin judiciously not as good as sedrin mind but good i especially like the way you make it seem so easy while juilin juilin pretends to be frightened to death that will go over very well juilin gave the man a bleak grin that had something of reaching for knives in it luca actually swirled that red cape as he turned to nynaeve he looked very satisfied indeed and you my dear nana what surprising talent do you have tumbling perhaps swallowing swords i dole out the money she told him slapping the scrip unless you want to offer me your wagon she gave him a smile that wiped his clean away and backed him up two steps besides the shouting had roused people from the wagons and everyone gathered around while luca introduced the troupes new performers he was rather vague about nynaeve merely calling what she did startling she needed to have a talk with him the horse handlers as luca called the men who had no performing talent were a scruffy surly lot in general perhaps because they were paid less there were not very many of them compared to the number of wagons in fact it turned out that everyone helped with the work including driving the wagons there was not much money in a traveling menagerie even one like this the others were a mixed lot petra the strongman was the biggest man nynaeve had ever seen not tall but wide his leather vest showed arms the size of tree trunks he was married to clarine the plump browncheeked woman who trained dogs she looked undersized beside him latelle who performed with the bears was a sternfaced darkeyed woman with short black hair and the beginnings of a sneer permanently on her lips aludra the slender woman who was supposed to be an illuminator might even have been one she did not wear her dark hair in taraboner braids not surprising given the feelings in amadicia but she had the proper accents and who could say what had happened to the guild of illuminators their chapter house in tanchico had certainly closed its doors the acrobats on the other hand claimed to be brothers named chavana but though they were all short compact men they ranged in coloring from greeneyed taeric his high cheekbones and hooked nose proclaiming saldaean blood to barit who was darker than juilin and had sea folk tattoos on his hands though he wore no earrings or noserings all but latelle greeted the newcomers warmly more performers meant more people attracted to the show and more money the two jugglers ban and kin they really were brothers it turned out engaged thom in talk of their trade once they found out that he did not work the same way they did drawing more people was one thing competition another yet it was the palehaired woman who cared for the boarhorses who attracted nynaeves immediate interest cerandin stood stiffly on the fringes and barely spoke luca claimed she had come from shara with the animals but her soft slurred manner of speech made nynaeves ears go to points it took a little time to get their wagon in place thom and juilin seemed more than pleased to have the horse handlers help with the team sullenly as it was given and invitations were given to nynaeve and elayne petra and clarine asked them to have tea once they were settled the chavanas wanted the two women to have supper with them and kin and ban did too all of which made latelles sneer become a scowl those invitations they declined gracefully elayne perhaps a bit more so than nynaeve the memory of herself goggling at galad like a frogeyed girl was too fresh for her to be more than minimally polite to any man luca had his own invitation for elayne alone spoken where nynaeve could not hear it earned him a slapped face and thom ostentatiously flashed knives that seemed to roll across his hands until the man went away growling to himself and rubbing his cheek leaving elayne putting her things away in the wagon throwing them really and muttering to herself furiously nynaeve went off to where the boarhorses were hobbled the huge gray animals seemed placid enough but remembering that hole in the stone wall of the kings lancer she was not too sure about the leather cords connecting their massive front legs cerandin was scratching the big male with her bronzehooked goad what are they really called diffidently nynaeve patted the males long nose or snout or whatever it was those tusks were as big around as her leg and a good three paces long and only a little larger than the females at that the snout snuffled at her skirt and she stepped back hastily sredit the palehaired woman said they are sredit but master luca thought a name more easily said was better that drawling accent was unmistakable are there many sredit in seanchan the goad stopped moving for an instant then resumed scratching seanchan where is that the sredit are from shara as i am i have never heard of perhaps youve seen shara cerandin but i doubt it you are seanchan unless i miss my guess you were part of the invasion on toman head left behind after falme there is no doubt elayne said stepping up beside her we heard seanchan accents in falme cerandin we will not hurt you that was more than nynaeve was willing to promise her memories of the seanchan were not fond ones and yet a seanchan helped you when you needed it they are not all evil only most of them cerandin let out a long sigh and sagged a little it was as if a tension so old that she was no longer aware of it had gone very few people i have met know anything approaching the truth of the return or falme i have heard a hundred tales each more fanciful than the last but never the truth as well for me i was left behind and many of the sredit also these three were all i could gather i do not know what happened to the rest the bull is mer the cow sanit and the calf nerin she is not sanits is that what you did elayne asked train sredit or were you a suldam nynaeve added before the other woman could speak cerandin shook her head i was tested as all girls are but i could do nothing with the adam i was glad to be chosen to work with sredit they are magnificent animals you know a great deal to know of suldam and damane i have encountered no one before who knows of them she showed no fear or perhaps it had been used up since finding herself abandoned in a strange land then again maybe she was lying the seanchan were as bad as amadicians when it came to women who could channel perhaps worse they did not exile or kill they imprisoned and used by means of a device called an adam nynaeve was sure it must be a sort of terangreal a woman who had the ability to wield the one power could be controlled by another woman a suldam who forced the damane to use her talents for whatever the seanchan wanted even as a weapon a damane was no better than an animal if a welltended one and they made damane of every last woman found with the ability to channel or the spark born in her the seanchan had scoured toman head more thoroughly than the tower had ever dreamed of the mere thought of adam and suldam and damane made nynaeves stomach chum we know a little she told cerandin but we want to know more the seanchan were gone driven away by rand but that was not to say they would not return one day it was a distant danger beside everything else they had to face yet just because you had a thorn in your foot did not mean that a briar scratch on your arm would not fester eventually you would do well to answer our questions truthfully there would be time on the journey north i promise that nothing will happen to you elayne added i will protect you if need be the palehaired womans eyes shifted from one of them to the other and suddenly to nynaeves amazement she prostrated herself on the ground in front of elayne you are a high lady of this land just as you told luca i did not realize forgive me high lady i submit myself to you and she kissed the ground in front of elaynes feet elaynes eyes looked ready to leap out of her face nynaeve was sure she was no better get up she hissed looking around frantically to see if anyone was watching luca was curse him and latelle still wearing that scowl but there was nothing to be done get up the woman did not stir stand on your feet cerandin elayne said no one requires people to behave that way in this land not even a ruler as cerandin scrambled erect she added i will teach you the proper way to behave in return for your answers to our questions the woman bowed hands on her knees and head down yes high lady it will be as you say i am yours nynaeve sighed heavily they were going to have a fine time traveling to ghealdan chapter female silhouettes a hound of darkness liandrin guided her horse through the crowded streets of amador the sneer on her rosebud lips hidden by her deep curving bonnet she had hated to give up her multitude of braids and hated even more the ludicrous fashions of this ludicrous land the reddish yellow of hat and riding dress she rather liked but not the large velvet bows on both still the bonnet hid her eyes combined with honeyyellow hair brown eyes would have named her taraboner in an instant not a good thing in amadicia just now and it hid what would have been even worse to show here an aes sedais face safely hidden she could smirk at the whitecloaks who seemed to be every fifth man in the streets not that the soldiers who made another fifth would have been any better none of them ever thought to look inside the bonnet of course aes sedai were outlawed here and that meant there were none even so she felt a little better when she turned in at the elaborate iron gates in front of jorin arenes house another fruitless trip looking for word from the white tower there had been nothing since she had learned that elaida thought she was in control of the tower and that the sanche woman had been disposed of siuan had escaped true but she was a useless rag now the gardens behind the gray stone fence were full of plants going rather brown from lack of rain but trimmed and trained into cubes and balls though one was shaped like a leaping horse only one of course merchants like arene mimicked their betters but they dared not go too far lest someone think their conceit too high elaborate balconies decorated the large wooden house with its redtiled roofs and even a colonnade of carved columns but unlike the lords dwelling it was meant to copy it stood on a stone foundation no more than ten feet tall a childish pretense at a nobles manor the stringy grayhaired man who scurried out deferentially to hold her stirrup while she dismounted and take her reins was clad all in black whatever colors a merchant chose for livery they were sure to be some real lords colors and even a minor lord could cause trouble for the richest seller of goods people in the streets called black merchants livery and snickered when they said it liandrin despised the grooms black coat as much as she did arenes house and arene himself she would have true manors one day palaces they had been promised to her and the power that went with them stripping off her riding gloves she stalked up the ridiculous ramp that slanted along the foundations to the vinecarved front doors the lords fortress manors had ramps so of course a merchant who thought well of himself could not have steps a blackclad young serving girl took gloves and hat in the round entrance hail with its many doors and carved and brightly painted columns and its encircling balcony the ceiling was lacquered in imitation of a mosaic stars within stars in gold and black i will have my bath in one hour she told the woman it will be the proper temperature this time yes the maid went pale as she curtsied stammering agreement before scurrying away amellia arene jorin s wife came through one of the doors deep in conversation with a fat balding man in a spotless white apron liandrin breathed contemptuously the woman had pretensions yet she not only spoke to the cook herself she brought the man out of his kitchens to discuss meals she treated the servant like like a friend fat evon saw her first and gulped his piggy eyes darting away immediately she did not like men looking at her and she had spoken sharply to him on her first day here about the way his gaze sometimes lingered he had tried to deny it but she knew mens vile habits without waiting to be dismissed by his mistress evon all but ran back the way he had come the graying merchants wife had been a sternfaced woman when liandrin and the others came now she licked her lips and smoothed her bowdraped green silk needlessly there is someone upstairs with the others my lady she said diffidently she had thought that she could use liandrins name that first day in the front withdrawing room from tar valon i believe wondering who it could be liandrin started for the nearest of the curving staircases she knew few others of the black ajah of course for safetys sake what others did not know they could not betray in the tower she had known only one of the twelve who went with her when she left two of the twelve were dead and she knew at whose feet to lay the blame egwene alvere nynaeve almeara and elayne trakand everything had gone so badly in tanchico that she would have thought those three upstart accepted had been there except that they were fools who had twice walked tamely into traps she had set that they had escaped each was of no consequence had they been in tanchico they would have fallen into her hands whatever jeaine claimed to have seen the next time she found them they would never escape anything again she would be done with them whatever her orders my lady amellia stammered my husband my lady jorin please will one of you help him he did not mean it my lady he has learned his lesson liandrin paused with one hand on the carved banister looking back over her shoulder he should not have thought that his oaths to the great lord could be conveniently forgotten no he has learned my lady please he lies beneath blankets all day in this heat shivering he weeps when anyone touches him or speaks above a whisper liandrin paused as if considering then nodded graciously i will ask chesmal to see what she can do yet you understand that i make no promises the womans unsteady thanks followed her up but she paid them no mind temaile had let herself be carried away she had been gray ajah before becoming black and she always made a point of spreading the pain evenly when she mediated she had been very successful as a mediator for she liked spreading pain chesmal said he might be able to do small tasks in a few months so long as they were not too hard and no one raised a voice she had been one of the best healers in generations among the yellow so she should know the front withdrawing room startled her when she went in nine of the ten black sisters who had come with her stood around the room against the carved and painted paneling though there were plenty of silkcushioned chairs on the goldfringed carpet the tenth temaile kinderode was handing a delicate porcelain cup of tea to a darkhaired sturdily handsome woman in a bronzecolored gown of unfamiliar cut the seated woman looked vaguely familiar though she was not aes sedai she was plainly approaching her middle years and despite smooth cheeks there was nothing of agelessness about her yet the mood made liandrin cautious temaile was deceptively fragile in appearance with big childlike blue eyes that made people trust her those eyes appeared worried now or uneasy and the teacup rattled on the saucer before the other woman took it every face looked uneasy except that of the oddly familiar woman copperyskinned jeaine caide in one of those disgusting domani garments that she wore inside the house had tears still glistening on her cheeks she had been a green and liked flaunting herself in front of men even more than most greens rianna andomeran once white and always a coldly arrogant killer nervously kept touching the pale streak in her black hair above her left ear her arrogance had been flattened what has happened here liandrin demanded who are you and what suddenly the memory flashed into her head a darkfriend a servant in tanchico who had continually gotten above herself gyldin she snapped this servant had followed them in some fashion and obviously was trying to pass herself off as a black courier with some dire news you have overstepped yourself too far this time she reached to embrace saidar yet even as she did the glow surrounded the other woman and liandrins reach ran into a thick invisible wall shutting her away from the source it hung there like the sun tantalizingly out of reach stop gaping liandrin the woman said calmly you look like a fish it is not gyldin but moghedien this tea needs more honey temaile the slender foxfaced woman darted to take the cup breathing heavily it had to be so who else could have so cowed the others liandrin looked at them standing around the walls roundfaced eldrith jhondar for once not looking vague at all despite an ink smudge on her nose nodded vigorously the others seemed afraid to twitch why one of the forsaken they were not supposed to use that name but usually did among themselves why moghedien would have masqueraded as a servant she could not understand the woman had or could have everything that she herself wanted not just knowledge of the one power beyond her dreams but power power over others power over the world and immortality power for a lifetime that would never end she and her sisters had speculated on dissension among the forsaken there had been orders at odds with each other and orders given to other darkfriends at odds with theirs perhaps moghedien had been hiding from the rest of the forsaken liandrin spread her divided riding skirts as best she could in a deep curtsy we welcome you great mistress with the chosen to lead us we shall surely triumph before the day of the great lords return nicely said moghedien said dryly taking the cup back from temaile yes this is much better temaile looked absurdly grateful and relieved what had moghedien done suddenly a thought came to liandrin an unwelcome one she had treated one of the chosen as a servant great mistress in tanchico i did not know that you of course you did not moghedien said irritably what good to bide my time in the shadows if you and these others knew me abruptly a small smile appeared on her lips it touched nothing else are you worried about those times you sent gyldin to the cook to be beaten sweat beaded suddenly on liandrins face do you truly believe i would allow such a thing the man no doubt reported to you but he remembered what i wanted him to remember he actually felt sorry for gyldin so cruelly treated by her mistress that seemed to amuse her greatly he gave me some of the desserts that he made for you it would not displease me if he still lives liandrin drew a relieved breath she would not die great mistress there is no need to shield me i also serve the great lord i swore my oaths as a darkfriend before ever i went to the white tower i sought the black ajah from the day that i knew that i could channel so you will be the only one in this illordered pack who does not need to learn who her mistress is moghedien quirked an eyebrow i would not have thought it of you the glow around her vanished i have tasks for you for all of you whatever you have been doing you will forget you are an inept lot as you proved in tanchico with my hand on the dog whip perhaps you will hunt more successfully we await orders from the tower great mistress liandrin said inept they had almost found what they were hunting for in tanchico when the city exploded in riots they had barely escaped destruction at the hands of aes sedai who had somehow wandered into the middle of their plan had moghedien revealed herself or even taken part on their behalf they would have triumphed if their failure was anyones fault it was moghediens herself liandrin reached toward the true source not to embrace it but to be certain that the shield had not merely been tied off it was gone we have been given great responsibilities great works to perform and surely we will be commanded to continue moghedien cut her off sharply you serve whichever of the chosen chooses to snap you up whoever sends you orders from the white tower she takes her own from one of us now and very likely grovels on her belly when she does you will serve me liandrin be sure of it moghedien did not know who headed the black ajah it was a revelation moghedien did not know everything liandrin had always imagined the forsaken as close to omnipotent something far beyond ordinary mortals perhaps the woman truly was in flight from the other forsaken to hand her over to them would surely earn her a high place she might even become one of them she had a trick learned in childhood and she could touch the source great mistress we serve the great lord as you do we also were promised eternal life and power when the great lord re do you think that you are my equal little sister moghedien grimaced in disgust did you stand in the pit of doom to dedicate your soul to the great lord did you taste the sweetness of victory at paaran disen or the bitter ashes at the asar don you are a barely trained puppy not the packmistress and you will go where i point until i see fit to give you a better place these others thought themselves more than they are too do you wish to try your strength against me of course not great mistress not when she was forewarned and ready i you will do so sooner or later and i prefer to put it out of the way now in the beginning why do you think your companions look so cheerful i have taught each of them the same lesson already today i will not wonder when you must be taught too i will be done with it now try licking her lips fearfully liandrin looked around at the women standing rigidly against the walls only asne zeramene so much as blinked she shook her head ever so slightly asnes tilted eyes high cheekbones and strong nose marked her saldaean and she had all the vaunted saldaean boldness if she counseled against if her dark eyes held a tinge of fear then it was surely best to grovel however much was needed to make moghedien relent and yet there was her trick she went to her knees head low looking up at the forsaken with a fear that was only partly feigned moghedien lounged in her chair sipping the tea great mistress i beg you to forgive me if i have presumed i know that i am but a worm beneath your foot i beg as one who would be your faithful hound for your mercy on this wretched dog moghediens eyes dropped to her cup and in a flash while the words still tumbled from her mouth liandrin embraced the source and channeled seeking the crack that must be in the forsakens confidence the crack that was in everyones facade of strength even as she lashed out the light of saidar surrounded the other woman and pain enveloped liandrin she crumpled to the carpet trying to howl but agony beyond anything she had ever known silenced her gaping mouth her eyes were going to burst from her head her skin was going to peel away in strips for an eternity she thrashed and when it vanished as suddenly as it had begun all she could do was lie there shuddering and weeping openmouthed do you begin to see moghedien said calmly handing the empty cup to temaile with that was very good but next time a little stronger temaile looked as though she might faint you are not quick enough liandrin you are not strong enough and you do not know enough that pitiful little thing you tried against me would you like to see what it is really like she channeled liandrin gazed up at her adoringly crawling across the floor she pushed words through the sobs she still could not stop forgive me great mistress this magnificent woman like a star in the heavens a comet above all kings and queens in wonder forgive please she begged pressing kisses against the hem of moghediens skirt as she babbled forgive i am a dog a worm it shamed her to her core that she had not meant those things before they were true before this woman they were all true let me serve you great mistress allow me to serve please please i am not graendal moghedien said pushing her away roughly with one velvetslippered foot suddenly the sense of worship was gone lying there in a heap weeping liandrin could remember it clearly though she stared at the forsaken in horror are you convinced yet liandrin yes great mistress she managed she was convinced that she dared not even think of trying again until she was certain of success her trick was only the palest shadow of what moghedien had done could she but learn that we shall see i think you may be one of those who needs a second lesson pray it is not so liandrin i make second lessons exceedingly sharp now take your place with the others you will find that i have taken some of the objects of power that you had in your room but you may keep the trinkets that remain am i not kind the great mistress is kind liandrin agreed around hiccoughs and occasional sobs that she could not stifle limply she staggered to her feet and went to stand beside asne the wall panel against her back helped to hold her upright she saw the flows of air being woven only air but she still flinched as they bound her mouth shut and stopped sound from her ears she certainly did not try to resist she did not even let herself think of saidar who knew what one of the forsaken could do perhaps read her thoughts that almost made her run no if moghedien knew her thoughts she would be dead by now or still screaming on the floor or kissing moghediens feet and begging to serve liandrin shivered uncontrollably if that weave had not bound her mouth her teeth would have been chattering moghedien wove the same around all of them save rianna whom the forsaken beckoned with an imperious finger to kneel before her then rianna left and marillin gemalphin was unbound and summoned from where she stood liandrin could see their faces even if their mouths moved soundlessly for her plainly each woman was receiving orders the others knew nothing of the faces told little though rianna merely listened a touch of relief in her eyes bowed her head in assent and went marillin looked surprised and then eager but she had been a brown and browns could be enthusiastic over anything that allowed them a chance to unearth some moldy bit of lost knowledge jeaine caide donned a slow mask of horror shaking her head at first and trying to cover herself and that disgustingly sheer gown but moghediens face hardened and jeaine nodded hurriedly and fled if not as eagerly as marillin just as quickly berylla naron lean almost to scrawniness and as fine a manipulator and plotter as there was and falion bhoda longfaced and cold despite her obvious fear showed as little expression as rianna had ispan shefar like liandrin from tarabon though darkhaired actually kissed moghediens hem before she rose then the flows were unwoven around liandrin she thought that it was her turn to be sent away on the shadow knew what errand until she saw the bonds dispelled around the others remaining as well moghediens finger beckoned peremptorily and liandrin knelt between asne and chesmal emry a tall handsome woman darkhaired and darkeyed chesmal once yellow could heal or kill with equal ease but the intensity of her gaze on moghedien the way her hands trembled as they clutched her skirts said she intended only to obey she would have to go by such signs liandrin realized approaching one of the others with her belief that rewards could be had for handing moghedien to the rest of the forsaken might well be disastrous if the one she spoke to had decided that it was in her best interests to be moghediens lapdog she almost whimpered at the thought of a second lesson you i keep with me the forsaken said for the most important task what the others do may bear sweet fruit but to me yours will be the most important harvest a personal harvest there is a woman named nynaeve almeara liandrins head came up and moghediens dark eyes sharpened you know of her i despise her liandrin replied truthfully she is a filthy wilder who ought never to have been allowed in the tower she loathed all wilders dreaming of being black ajah she herself had begun learning to channel a full year before going to the tower but she was in no way a wilder very good you five are going to find her for me i want her alive oh yes i do want her alive moghediens smile made liandrin shiver giving nynaeve and the other two to her might be entirely suitable the day before yesterday she was in a village called sienda perhaps sixty miles east of here with another young woman in whom i may be interested but they have vanished you will liandrin listened eagerly for this she could be a faithful hound for the other she would wait patiently chapter rubyhilted dagger memories my queen morgase looked up from the book on her lap sunlight slanted through the window of the sitting room next to her bedchamber the day was already hot with no breeze and sweat dampened her face it would be noon before much longer and she had not stirred from the room that was unlike her she could not remember why she had decided to laze the morning away with a book she seemed unable to concentrate on reading of late by the golden clock on the mantel above the marble fireplace an hour had passed since she last turned a page and she could not recall its words it must be the heat the redcoated young officer of her guards kneeling with one fist pressed to the redandgold carpet looked vaguely familiar once she had known the name of every guard assigned to the palace perhaps it was all the new faces tallanvor she said surprising herself he was a tall wellmade young man but she could not tell why she remembered him in particular had he brought someone to her once long ago guardsman lieutenant martyn tallanvor he glanced at her startlingly rougheyed before putting his gaze back on the carpet my queen forgive me but i am surprised that you remain here given the mornings news what news it would be good to learn something besides alteimas gossip of the tairen court at times she felt that there was something else she wanted to ask the woman but all they ever did was gossip which she could never remember doing before gaebril seemed to enjoy listening to them sitting in that tall chair in front of the fireplace with his ankles crossed smiling contentedly alteima had taken to wearing rather daring dresses morgase would have to say something to her dimly she seemed to remember thinking that before nonsense if i had i would have spoken to her already she shook her head realizing that she had drifted away from the young officer entirely that he had begun speaking and stopped when he saw she was not listening tell me again i was distracted and stand he rose face angry eyes burning on her before they dropped again she looked where he had been staring and blushed her dress was cut extremely low but gaebril liked her to wear them so with that thought she ceased fretting about being nearly naked in front of one of her officers be brief she said curtly how dare he look at me in that manner i should have him flogged what news is so important that you think you can walk into my sitting room as if it were a tavern his face darkened but whether from proper embarrassment or increased anger she could not say how dare he be angry with his queen does the man think all i have to do is listen to him rebellion my queen he said in a flat tone and all thought of anger and stares vanished where the two rivers my queen someone has raised the old banner of manetheren the red eagle a messenger came from whitebridge this morning morgase drummed her fingers on the book her thoughts coming more clearly than it seemed they had in a very long time something about the two rivers some spark she could not quite fan to life tugged at her the region was hardly part of andor at all and had not been for generations she and the last three queens before her had been hard pressed to maintain a modicum of control over the miners and smelters in the mountains of mist and even that modicum would have been lost had there been any way to get the metals out save through the rest of andor a choice between holding the mines gold and iron and other metals and keeping the two rivers wool and tabac had not been difficult but rebellion unchecked even rebellion in a part of her realm that she ruled only on a map could spread like wildfire to places that were hers in fact and manetheren destroyed in the trolloc wars manetheren of legend and story still had a hold on some mens minds besides the two rivers was hers if they had been left to go their own way for far too long they were still a part of her realm has lord gaebril been informed of course he had not he would have come to her with the news and suggestions on how to deal with it his suggestions were always clearly right suggestions somehow it seemed that she could remember him telling her what to do that was impossible of course he has my queen tallanvors voice was still bland unlike his face where slow anger yet smoldered he laughed he said the two rivers seemed to throw up trouble and he would have to do something about it one day he said this minor annoyance would have to wait its turn behind more important matters the book fell as she sprang to her feet and she thought tallanvor smiled in grim satisfaction as she swept by him a serving woman told her where gaebril was to be found and she marched straight to the colonnaded court with its marble fountain the basin full of lily pads and fish it was cooler there and shaded a little gaebril sat on the broad white coping of the fountain lords and ladies gathered around him she recognized fewer than half dark squarefaced jarid of house sarand and his shrewish honeyhaired wife elenia that simpering arymilla of house marne melting brown eyes always so wide in feigned interest and bony goatfaced nasin of house caeren who would tumble any woman he could corner despite his thin white hair naean of house arawn as usual with a sneer marring her pale beauty and lir of house baryn a whip of a man wearing a sword of all things and karind of house anshar with the same flateyed stare that some said had put three husbands under the ground the others she did not know at all which was strange enough but these she never allowed into the palace except on state occasions every one had opposed her during the succession elenia and naean had wanted the lion throne for themselves what could gaebril be thinking to actually bring them here the size of our estates in cairhien my lord arymilla was saying leaning over gaebril as morgase approached none of them more than glanced at her as if she were a servant with the wine i want to speak with you concerning the two rivers gaebril in private it has been dealt with my dear he said idly dabbling his fingers in the water other matters concern me now i thought you were going to read during the heat of the day you should return to your room until the evenings coolness such as it is my dear he had called her my dear in front of these interlopers as much as she thrilled to hear that on his lips when they were alone elenia was hiding her mouth i think not lord gaebril morgase said coldly you will come with me now and these others will be out of the palace before i return or i will exile them from caemlyn completely suddenly he was on his feet a big man towering over her she seemed unable to look at anything but his dark eyes her skin tingled as if an icy wind were blowing through the courtyard you will go and wait for me morgase his voice was a distant roar filling her ears i have dealt with all that needs dealing with i will come to you this evening you will go now you will go she had one hand lifted to open the door of her sitting room before she realized where she was and what had happened he had told her to go and she had gone staring at the door in horror she could see the smirks on the mens faces open laughter on some of the womens what has happened to me how could i become so besotted with any man she still felt the urge to enter and wait for him dazed she forced herself to turn and walk away it was an effort inside she cringed at the idea of gaebrils disappointment in her when he did not find her where he expected and cringed further at recognizing the fawning thought at first she had no notion of where she was going or why only that she would not wait obediently not for gaebril not for any man or woman in the world the fountained courtyard kept repeating in her head him telling her to go and those hateful amused faces watching her mind still seemed fogged she could not comprehend how or why she could have let it happen she had to think of something that she could understand something she could deal with jarid sarand and the others when she assumed the throne she had pardoned them for everything they had done during the succession as she had pardoned everyone who opposed her it had seemed best to bury all animosities before they could fester into the sort of plotting and scheming that infected so many lands the game of houses it was called daes daemar or the great game and it led to endless tangled feuds between houses to the toppling of rulers the game was at the heart of the civil war in cairhien and no doubt had done its part in the turmoil enveloping arad doman and tarabon the pardons had had to go to all to stop daes daemar being born in andor but could she have left any unsigned they would have been the parchments with those sevens names gaebril knew that publicly she had shown no disfavor but in private she had been willing to speak of her distrust they had had to pry their jaws open to swear fealty and she could hear the lie on their tongues any one would leap at a chance to pull her down and all seven together there was only one conclusion she could reach gaebril must be plotting against her it could not be to put elenia or naean on the throne not when he has me already she thought bitterly behaving like his lapdog he must mean to supplant her himself to become the first king that andor had ever had and she still felt the desire to return to her book and wait for him she still ached for his touch it was not until she saw the aged faces in the hallway around her the creased cheeks and often bent backs that she became aware of where she was the pensioners quarters some servants returned to their families when they grew old but others had been so long in the palace that they could think of no other life here they had their own small apartments their own shaded garden and a spacious courtyard like every queen before her she supplemented their pensions by letting them buy food through the palace kitchens for less than its cost and the infirmary treated their ills creaky bows and unsteady curtsies followed her and murmurs of the light shine upon you my queen and the light bless you my queen and the light protect you my queen she acknowledged them absently she knew where she was going now linis door was like all the others along the greentiled corridor unadorned save for a carving of the rearing lion of andor she never thought of knocking before entering she was the queen and this was her palace her old nurse was not there though a teakettle steaming over a small fire in the brick fireplace said she would not be long the two snug rooms were neatly furnished the bed made to perfection the two chairs precisely aligned at the table where a blue vase in the exact center held a small fan of greenery lini had always been a great one for neatness morgase was willing to wager that within the wardrobe in the bedchamber every dress was arranged just so with every other and the same for pots in the cupboard beside the fireplace in the other room six painted ivory miniatures in small wooden stands made a line on the mantelpiece how lini could have afforded them on a nurses stipend was more than morgase had ever been able to imagine she could not ask such a question of course in pairs they showed three young women and the same three as babes elayne was there and herself taking down the portrait of herself at fourteen a slender filly of a girl she could not believe that she had ever looked so innocent she had worn that ivory silk dress the day she had gone to the white tower never dreaming at the time that she would be queen only harboring the vain hope that she might become aes sedai absentmindedly she thumbed the great serpent ring on her left hand she had not earned that precisely women who could not channel were not awarded the ring but short of her sixteenth nameday she had returned to contest the rose crown in the name of house trakand and when she won the throne nearly two years later the ring had been presented to her by tradition the daughterheir of andor always trained in the tower and in recognition of andors long support of the tower was given the ring whether or not she could channel she had only been the heir to house trakand in the tower but they gave it to her anyway once the rose crown was on her head replacing her own portrait she took down her mothers taken at perhaps two years older lini had been nurse to three generations of trakand women maighdin trakand had been beautiful morgase could remember that smile when it had become a mothers loving beam it was maighdin who should have had the lion throne but a fever had carried her away and a young girl had found herself high seat of house trakand in the middle of a struggle for the throne with no more support in the beginning than her house retainers and the house bard i won the lion throne i will not give it up and i will not see a man take it for a thousand years a queen has ruled andor and i will not let that end now meddling in my things again are you child that voice triggered longforgotten reflexes morgase had the miniature hidden behind her back before she knew it with a rueful shake of her head she put the portrait back on its stand i am not a girl in the nursery any longer lini you must remember that or one day you will say something where i must do something about it my neck is scrawny and old lini said setting a net bag of carrots and turnips on the table she looked frail in her neat gray dress her white hair drawn back in a bun from a narrow face with skin like thin parchment but her back was straight her voice clear and steady and her dark eyes as sharp as ever if you want to give it to hangman or headsman i am almost done with it anyway a gnarled old branch dulls the blade that severs a sapling morgase sighed lini would never change she would not curtsy if the entire court were watching you do grow tougher as you grow older i am not certain a headsman could find an axe sharp enough for your neck youve not been to see me in some time so i suppose theres something you need to work out in your mind when you were in the nursery and later you always used to come to me when you couldnt work matters out shall i make a pot of tea some time lini i visit you every week and a wonder i do given how you speak to me i would exile the highest lady in andor if she said half what you do lini gave her a level look you have not darkened my doorway since the spring and i talk as i always have im too old to change now do you want tea no morgase put a hand to her head in confusion she did visit lini every week she could remember she could not remember gaebril had filled her hours so completely that sometimes it was hard to remember anything other than him no i do not want tea i do not know why i came you cannot help me with the problem i have her old nurse snorted though somehow she made it a delicate sound your trouble is with gaebril isnt it only now youre ashamed to tell me girl i changed you in your cradle tended you when you were sick and heaving your stomach up and told you what you needed to know about men you have never been too shamed to discuss anything with me and now is no time to begin gaebril morgases eyes widened you know but how oh child lini said sadly everyone knows though no ones had the courage to tell you i might have if you hadnt stayed away but it is hardly something i could go running to you with now is it it is the kind of thing a woman wont believe until she finds out for herself what are you talking about morgase demanded it was your duty to come to me if you knew lini it was everyones duty light i am the last to know and now it may be too late to stop it too late lini said incredulously why should it be too late you bundle gaebril out of the palace out of andor and alteima and the others with him and it is done with too late indeed for a moment morgase could not speak alteima she said finally and the others lini stared at her then shook her head in disgust i am an old fool my wits are dryrooted well you know now when the honeys out of the comb theres no putting it back her voice became gentler and at the same time brisk the voice she had used for telling morgase that her pony had broken a leg and had to be put down gaebril spends most of his nights with you but alteima has nearly as much of his time he spreads himself thin with the other six five have rooms in the palace one a bigeyed young thing he sneaks in and out for some reason all swathed in a cloak even in this heat perhaps she has a husband im sorry girl but truth is truth better to face the bear than run from it morgases knees sagged and if lini had not hurriedly pulled a chair from the table to shove under her she would have sat down on the floor alteima him watching the two of them as they gossiped took on a new image now a man fondly watching two of his pet cats at play and six others rage boiled up in her a rage that had been lacking when she only thought he was after her throne that she had considered coldly clearly as clearly as she could consider anything recently that was a danger that had to be looked at with cold reason but this the man had ensconced his jades in her palace he had made her just another of his trulls she wanted his head she wanted him flayed alive the light help her she wanted his touch i must be going mad that will be solved along with everything else she said coldly much depended on who was in caemlyn and who on their country estates where is lord pelivar lord abelle lady arathelle they led strong houses and many retainers exiled lini said slowly giving her an odd look you exiled them from the city last spring morgase stared back she remembered none of that except that now dim and distant she did lady ellorien she said slowly lady aemlyn and lord luan more strong houses more houses that had been behind her before she gained the throne exiled lini replied just as slowly you had ellorien flogged for demanding to know why she bent to brush morgases hair back gnarled fingers lingering on her cheek as they had when she checked for fever are you well girl morgase nodded dully but it was because she was remembering in a shadowy way ellorien screaming in outrage as her gown was ripped down the back house traemane had been the very first to throw its support to trakand brought by a plumply pretty woman only a few years older than morgase brought by ellorien now one of her closest friends at least she had been elayne had been named after elloriens grandmother vaguely she could recall others leaving the city distancing themselves from her it seemed obvious now and those who remained houses too weak to be of any use or else sycophants she seemed to recall signing numerous documents gaebril had laid in front of her creating new titles gaebrils toadeaters and her enemies they were all she could count on being strong in caemlyn i do not care what you say lini said firmly you have no fever but theres something wrong you need an aes sedai healer is what you need no aes sedai morgases voice was even harder she fingered her ring again briefly she knew that her animosity toward the tower had grown recently beyond what some might say was reasonable yet she could no longer make herself trust a white tower that seemed to be trying to hide her daughter from her her letter to the new amyrlin demanding elaynes return no one demanded anything of an amyrlin seat but she had that letter was yet unanswered it had barely had time to reach tar valon in any case she knew for cold fact that she would not have an aes sedai near her and yet right alongside that she could not think of elayne without a swell of pride raised accepted after so short a time elayne might well be the first woman to sit on the throne of andor as full aes sedai not just tower trained it made no sense that she could feel both things at once but very little made any sense just now and her daughter would never have the lion throne if morgase did not secure it for her i said no aes sedai lini so you might as well stop looking at me like that this is one time you will not make me take badtasting medicine besides which i doubt there is an aes sedai of any stripe to be found in caemlyn her old supporters gone exiled by her own signature and maybe her enemies for good over what she had done to ellorien new lords and ladies in their places in the palace new faces in the guards what loyalty remained there would you recognize a guardsman lieutenant named tallanvor lini at the other womans quick nod she went on find him for me and bring him here but do not let him know you are bringing him to me in fact tell everyone in the pensioners quarters that should anyone ask i am not here there is more to this than gaebril and his women isnt there just go lini and hurry there is not much time by the shadows she could see in the treefilled garden through the window the sun had passed its height evening would be there all too soon evening when gaebril would be looking for her when lini left morgase remained in the chair sitting rigidly she dared not stand her knees were stronger now but she feared that if she began moving she would not stop until she was back in her sitting room waiting for gaebril the urge was that strong especially now that she was alone and once he looked at her once he touched her she had no doubt that she would forgive him everything forget everything maybe based on how fuzzy and incomplete her memories were had she not known better she could have thought that he had used the one power on her in some way but no man who could channel survived to his age lini had often told her that there was always one man in the world for whom a woman would find herself behaving a brainless fool but she had never believed that she could succumb still her choices in men had never been good however right they seemed at the time taringail damodred she had wed for political reasons he had been married to tigraine the daughterheir whose disappearance had set off the succession when mordrellein died marrying him had made a link with the old queen smoothing the doubts of most of her opponents and more importantly had maintained the alliance that had ended the ceaseless wars with cairhien in such ways did queens choose their husbands taringail had been a cold distant man and there was never love despite two wonderful children it had been almost a relief when he died in a hunting accident thomdril merrilin house bard and then courtbard had been a joy at first intelligent and witty a laughing man who used the tricks of the game of houses to aid her to the throne and help strengthen andor once she had it he had been twice her age then yet she might have married him marriages with commoners were not unheard of in andor but he vanished without a word and her temper got the better of her she never had learned why he had gone but it did not matter when he finally returned she would surely have rescinded the arrest order but for once instead of softly turning her anger aside he had met her harsh word for harsh word saying things she could never forgive her ears still burned to remember being called a spoiled child and a puppet of tar valon he had actually shaken her his queen then there had been gareth bryne strong and capable as bluff as his face and as stubborn as she he had turned out to be a treasonous fool he was well out of her life it seemed years since she had seen him instead of little more than half of one and finally gaebril the crown to her list of bad choices at least the others had not tried to supplant her not so many men for one womans life but in another way too many another thing that lini sometimes said was that men were only good for three things though very good for those she had been on the throne before lini had thought her old enough to tell what the three things were perhaps if id kept just to the dancing she thought wryly id not have so much trouble with them the shadows in the garden beyond the window had shifted an hours worth before lini returned with young tallanvor who went to one knee while she was still shutting the door he didnt want to come with me at first she said fifty years ago i suppose i could have shown what you are displaying to the world and hed have followed quick enough but now i must needs use sweet reason tallanvor turned his head to look up at her sourly you threatened to harry me here with a stick if i did not come you are lucky i wondered what was so important to you instead of having somebody drag you to the infirmary her stern sniff did not faze him his acrid gaze turned angry as it shifted to morgase i see your meeting with gaebril did not go well my queen i had hoped for more he was looking straight at her eyes but linis comment had made her aware of her dress again she felt as though glowing arrows were pointing to her exposed bosom it was an effort to keep her hands calmly in her lap you are a sharp lad tallanvor and loyal i believe else you would not have come to me with the news of the two rivers i am not a boy he snapped jerking upright where he knelt i am a man who has sworn his life in service to his queen she let her temper flare right back at him if you are a man behave as one stand and answer your queens questions truthfully and remember that i am your queen young tallanvor whatever you think may have happened i am queen of andor forgive me my queen i hear and obey the words were properly said if not exactly contrite but he stood head high staring at her as defiantly as ever light the man was as stubborn as gareth bryne had ever been how many loyal men are there among the guards in the palace how many will obey their oaths and follow me i will he said quietly and suddenly all of his anger was gone though he still stared intently at her face for the rest if you wish to find loyal men you must look to the outlying garrisons perhaps as far as whitebridge some who were in caemlyn were sent to cairhien with the levies but the rest in the city are gaebrils to a man their new their new oath is to throne and law not the queen it was worse than she had hoped for but no more than she had expected really whatever he was gaebril was no fool then i must go elsewhere to begin reestablishing my rule the houses would be difficult to rally after the exiles after ellorien but it had to be done gaebril may try to stop me leaving the palace she found a faint memory of trying to leave twice and being halted by gaebril so you will procure two horses and wait in the street behind the south stables i will meet you there dressed for riding too public he said and too close gaebrils men might recognize you however you disguised yourself i know a man could you find an inn called the queens blessing in the western part of the new city the new city was new only in comparison with the inner city it surrounded i can she did not like being opposed even when it made sense bryne had done that too it would be a pleasure to show this young man just how well she could disguise herself it was her habit once a year though she realized that she had not done it so far this year to dress as a commoner and walk the streets to feel the pulse of the people no one had ever recognized her but can this man be trusted young tallanvor basel gill is as loyal to you as i am myself he hesitated anguish crossing his face then being replaced by anger once more why have you waited so long you must have known you must have seen yet you have waited while gaebril tightened his hands around andors neck why have you waited so his anger was honestly come by and it deserved an honest answer only she had no answer certainly not one she could tell him it is not your place to question your queen young man she said with a gentle firmness a loyal man as i know that you are loyal serves without question he let out a long breath i will await you in the stable of the queens blessing my queen and with a bow suitable for a state audience he was gone why do you keep calling him young lini demanded once the door closed it puts his back up a fool puts a burr under the saddle before she rides he is young lini young enough to be my son lini snorted and this time there was nothing delicate about it he has a few years on galad and galad is too old to be yours you were playing with dolls when tallanvor was born and thinking babes came the same way as dolls sighing morgase wondered if the woman had treated her mother like this probably and if lini lived long enough to see elayne on the throne which somehow she did not doubt lini would last forever she would probably treat elayne no differently that was assuming that a throne remained for elayne to inherit the question is is he as loyal as he seems lini one faithful guardsman when every other loyal man in the palace has been sent away suddenly it seems too good to be true he swore the new oath morgase opened her mouth but lini forestalled her i saw him afterwards alone behind the stables thats how i knew who you meant i found out his name he did not see me he was on his knees tears streaming down his face he alternated apologizing to you and repeating the old oath not just to the queen of andor but to queen morgase of andor he swore in the old way on his sword slicing his arm to show he would shed his last drop before breaking it i know a thing or two of men girl that one will follow you against an army with nothing but his bare hands that was good to know if she could not trust him she would have to doubt lini next no never lini he had sworn in the old way that was something for stories now and she was letting her thoughts drift again surely gaebrils clouding of her mind was finished now with all she knew then why did a part of her still want to go back to her sitting room and wait she had to concentrate i will need a simple dress lini one that does not fit too well a little soot from the fireplace and lini insisted on coming too morgase would have had to tie her to a chair to leave her behind and she was not certain that the old woman would have let herself be tied she had always seemed frail and had always been far stronger than she seemed when they slipped out through a small side gate morgase did not look very much like herself a bit of soot had darkened her redgold hair taken its sheen away and made it lank sweat rolling down her face helped as well no one believed that queens sweated a shapeless dress of rough very rough gray wool with divided skirts completed her disguise even her shift and stockings were coarse wool she looked a farm woman who had ridden the cart horse to market and now wanted to see a little of the city lini looked herself straightbacked and nononsense in a green woolen riding dress well cut but ten years out of fashion wishing she could scratch morgase also wished that the other woman had not taken her so to heart about the dress not fitting very well stuffing the lownecked gown away under the bed her old nurse had muttered some saying about displaying wares you did not mean to sell and when morgase claimed she had just made it up her reply was at my age if i make it up its still an old saying morgase more than halfsuspected that her itchy illdraped dress was punishment for that gown the inner city was built on hills streets following the natural curve of the land and planned to give sudden views of parks full of trees and monuments or tilecovered towers glittering a hundred colors in the sun sudden rises hurled the eye across caemlyn entire to the rolling plains and forests beyond morgase saw none of it as she hurried through the crowds thronging the streets usually she would have tried to listen to the people to gauge their mood this time she heard only the hum and babble of a great city she had no thought of trying to rouse them thousands of men armed mainly with stones and rage could overwhelm the guards in the royal palace but if she had not known it before the riots in the spring that had brought gaebril to her attention and the near riots the year before had shown what mobs could do she meant to rule again in caemlyn not see it burned beyond the white walls of the inner city the new city had its own beauties tall slender towers and domes gleaming white and gold huge expanses of redtiled roofs and the great towered outer walls pale gray streaked with silver and white broad boulevards split down the middle by wide expanses of trees and grass were jammed with people and carriages and wagons except to notice in passing that the grass was dying for lack of rain morgase kept her mind on what she was hunting from the experience of her annual forays she chose the people she questioned carefully men mostly she knew how she looked even with soot in her hair and some women would give wrong directions from jealousy men on the other hand racked their brains to be right to impress her none with too smug a face or too rough the first were often offended at being approached as though they were not afoot themselves and the others were likely to think a woman asking directions had something else on her mind one fellow with a chin too big for his face hawking a tray of pins and needles grinned at her and said did anyone ever tell you you look a mite like the queen whatever mess shes made of us shes a pretty one she gave him a raucous laugh that earned a stern look from lini you save your flattery for your wife the second turn to the left you say i thank you and for the compliment too as she pushed on through the crowd a frown settled on her face she had heard too much of that not that she looked like the queen but that morgase had made a mess of things gaebril had raised taxes heavily to pay for his levies it seemed but she took the blame and rightly so the responsibility was the queens other laws had come out of the palace as well laws that made little sense but did make peoples lives more difficult she heard whispers about herself that maybe andor had had queens long enough only murmurs but what one man dared speak in a low voice ten thought perhaps it would not have been as easy as she had thought to rouse mobs against gaebril eventually she found her goal a broad stone inn the sign over the door bearing a man kneeling before a goldenhaired woman in the rose crown one of her hands on his head the queens blessing if it was meant to be her it was not a good likeness the cheeks were too fat not until she stopped in front of the inn did she realize that lini was puffing she had set a quick pace and the woman was far from young lini i am sorry i should not have walked so if i cant keep up with you girl how will i be able to tend elaynes babes do you mean to stand there dragging feet never finish a journey he said he would be in the stable the whitehaired woman stalked off muttering to herself and morgase followed her around the inn before stepping into the stone stable she shaded her eyes to look at the sun no more than two hours until dusk gaebril would be looking by then if he was not already tallanvor was not alone in the stalllined stable when he went to one knee on the strawcovered floor in a green wool coat with his sword belted over it two men and a woman knelt with him if a bit hesitantly unsure of her as she was the stout man pinkfaced and balding must be basel gill the innkeeper an old leather jerkin studded with steel discs strained around his girth and he wore a sword at his hip too my queen gill said ive not carried a sword in years not since the aiel war but id count it an honor if you allowed me to follow you he should have looked ridiculous but he did not morgase studied the other two a hulking fellow in a rough gray coat with heavylidded eyes an oftbroken nose and scars on his face and a short pretty woman approaching her middle years she seemed to be with the street tough but her highnecked blue wool dress appeared too finely woven for one like him to have bought the fellow sensed her doubts for all his lazyeyed appearance i am lamgwin my queen and a good queens man tisnt right whats been done and it has to be put straight i want to follow you too me and breane both rise she told them it may be some days yet before it is safe for you to acknowledge me as your queen i will be glad of your company master gill and yours master lamgwin but it will be safer for your woman if she remains in caemlyn there are hard days ahead brushing straw from her skirts breane gave her a sharp look and lini a sharper i have known hard days she said in a cairhienin accent nobly born unless morgase missed her guess one of the refugees and i never knew a good man until i found lamgwin or until he found me the loyalty and love he bears for you i bear for him tenfold he follows you but i follow him i will not stay behind morgase drew breath then nodded her acceptance the woman seemed to take it for granted in any case a fine seed for the army to retake her throne one young soldier who scowled at her as often as not a balding innkeeper who looked as if he had not been on a horse in twenty years a street tough who appeared more than halfasleep and a refugee cairhienin noblewoman who had made it clear that her loyalties went only as far as the tough and lini of course lini who treated her as though she were still in the nursery oh yes a very fine seed where do we go my queen gill asked as he began leading already saddled horses out of their stalls lamgwin moved with surprising speed to throw another highcantled saddle on a horse for lini morgase realized that she had not considered that light gaebril cant still be fogging my mind she still felt that urge to return to her sitting room though it was not he she had had to concentrate on getting out of the palace and reaching here once she would have gone to ellorien first but pelivar or arathelle would do once she had reasoned out how to explain away their exiles before she could open her mouth tallanvor said it must be to gareth bryne there is hard feeling against you among the great houses my queen but with bryne following you they will reswear allegiance if only because they know he will win every battle she clamped her teeth shut to hold back instant refusal bryne was a traitor but he was also one of the finest generals alive his presence would be a convincing argument when she had to make pelivar and the rest forget that she had exiled them very well no doubt he would leap at the chance to be captaingeneral of the queens guards once more and if not she would manage well enough without him when the sun touched the horizon they were five miles out of caemlyn and riding hard for kore springs night was when padan fain felt most comfortable as he padded through the tapestrybedecked corridors of the white tower it seemed as though the darkness outside made a cloak to hide him from his enemies despite the standlamps gilded and mirrored burning along his way a false feeling he knew his enemies were many and everywhere right that moment as in every waking hour he could feel rand althor not where he was but that he was still alive somewhere still alive it was a gift received at shayol ghul in the pit of doom that awareness of althor his mind skittered away from memories of what had been done to him in the pit he had been distilled there remade but later in aridhol he had been reborn reborn to smite old enemies and new he could feel something else as he stalked the empty night hallways of the tower a thing that was his stolen from him a sharper desire drew him at this moment than his longing for althors death or the towers destruction or even revenge against his ancient foe a hunger to be whole the heavy paneled door had thick hinges and iron straps and a black iron lock set in it as big as his head few doors in the tower were ever locked who would dare steal in the midst of aes sedai yet some things the tower accounted too dangerous to be easily accessible the most dangerous of all they kept behind this door guarded by a stout lock giggling softly he took two thin curved metal rods from his coat pocket inserted them into the keyhole probing and pressing twisting with a slow snap the bolt came back for a moment he sagged against the door laughing hoarsely guarded by a stout lock surrounded by aes sedai power and guarded by simple metal even the servants and novices should be done with their chores at this hour but someone still might be awake might just wander by occasional ripples of mirth still shook him as he replaced the lockpicks in his pocket and took out a fat beeswax candle lighting the wick at a nearby standlamp he held the candle high as he closed the door behind him peering around shelves lined the walls holding plain boxes and inlaid chests of various sizes and shapes small figures in bone or ivory or darker material things of metal and glass and crystal that sparkled in the candlelight nothing that appeared dangerous dust covered everything even the aes sedai came here seldom and they allowed no one else in what he was seeking pulled him to it on a waisthigh shelf stood a dark metal box he opened it revealing lead walls two inches thick with just enough space inside for a curved dagger in a golden sheath a large ruby set in its hilt neither the gold nor the ruby glittering dark as blood interested him hastily he spilled a little wax to hold the candle beside the box and snatched up the dagger he sighed as soon as he touched it stretched languorously he was whole again one with what had bound him so long ago one with what in a very real way had given him life iron hinges creaked faintly and he darted for the door baring the curved blade the pale young woman opening the door had only time to gape to try to leap back before he slashed her cheek in the same motion he dropped the sheath and seized her arm jerked her past him into the storeroom putting his head out he peered up and down the hallway still empty he took his time about pulling his head back and shutting the door again he knew what he would find the young woman lay thrashing on the stone floor trying and failing to scream her hands clawed at a face already black and bloated beyond recognition the dark swelling oozing down onto her shoulders like thick oil her snowy skirts banded in colors at the hem flailed as her feet scrabbled uselessly he licked at a splash of blood on his hand and giggled as he picked up the sheath you are a fool he spun dagger reaching but the air around him seemed to turn solid encasing him from his neck to the sole of his boots he hung there on the balls of his feet dagger extended to stab staring at alviarin as she shut the door behind her and leaned against it to study him there had been no creak this time the soft scraping of the dying girls slippers on the floorstones could never have masked it he blinked away sweat that was suddenly stinging his eyes did you really think the aes sedai went on that there would be no guard on this room no watch kept a ward was set on that lock that young fools task tonight was to monitor it had she done as she was supposed to you would find a dozen warders and as many aes sedai outside this door now she is paying the price of her stupidity the thrashing behind him stilled and his eyes narrowed alviarin was not yellow ajah but even so she could have made an attempt to heal the young woman and she had not raised the alarm the accepted should have either or she would not now be here alone you are black ajah he whispered a dangerous accusation she said calmly it was not clear to which of them it was dangerous siuan sanche tried to claim the black ajah was real when she was under the question she begged to tell us of them elaida would not hear it and will not tales of the black ajah are a vile slander against the tower you are black ajah he said in a louder voice you want to steal that she sounded as though he had not spoken the ruby is not worth it fain or whatever your name is that blade is tainted so none but a fool would touch it except with tongs or be near it for a moment longer than necessary you can see what it did to verine so why did you come here and go straight to what you should not have known was here you cannot have had time for any search i could dispose of elaida for you one touch of this and even healing will not save her he tried to gesture with the dagger but could not budge it a hair if he could have moved it alviarin would be dead by now you could be first in the tower not second she laughed at him cool contemptuous chimes do you think i would not be first if i had wished it second suits me let elaida claim credit for what she calls successes and sweat for her failures too i know where the power lies now answer my questions or two corpses will be found here in the morning instead of one there would be two in any case whether he answered her with suitable lies or not she did not mean to let him live i have seen thakandar saying that hurt the memories it brought were agony he refused to whimper forced the words out the great sea of fog rolling and crashing in silence against the black cliffs the fires of the forges glowing red beneath and lightning stabbing up into a sky fit to drive men mad he did not want to go on but he made himself i have taken the path down to the belly of shayol ghul down the long way with stones like fangs brushing my head to the shore of a lake of fire and molten rock no not again that holds the great lord of the dark in its endless depths the heavens above shayol ghul are black at noon with his breath alviarin was standing upright now eyes wide not fearful but impressed i have heard of she began softly then shook herself and stared at him piercingly who are you why are you here did one of the for the chosen send you why was i not informed he threw back his head and laughed are the tasks given to the likes of me for the likes of you to be knowing the accents of his native lugard were strong again in a way it was his native city do the chosen confide everything in you then something inside seemed to shout that this was not the way but he hated aes sedai and that something inside him did too be careful pretty little aes sedai or theyll be giving you to a myrddraal for its sport her glare was icicles stabbing his eyes we shall see master fain i will clear away this mess you have made and then we shall see which of us stands higher with the chosen eyeing the dagger she backed from the room the air around him did not soften until she had been gone a full minute silently he snarled at himself fool playing the aes sedais game groveling for them then one moment of anger to ruin all sheathing the dagger he nicked himself and licked the wound before sticking the weapon under his coat he was not at all what she thought he had been a darkfriend once but he was beyond that now beyond it above it something different something more if she managed to communicate with one of the forsaken before he could dispose of her better not to try no time to find the horn of valere now there were followers awaiting him outside the city they should still be waiting he had put fear into them he hoped some of the humans were still alive before the sun rose he was out of the tower off the island of tar valon althor was out there somewhere and he was whole again chapter full aes sedai symbol jangai pass under the looming spine of the world rand guided jeadeen up the stony slope from the foothills that began the foot of jangai pass the dragonwall pierced the sky dwarfing all other mountains its snowcapped peaks defying the baking afternoon sun the tallest thrust well above clouds that mocked the waste with promises of rain that had never come rand could not imagine why a man would want to climb a mountain but it was said that men who had tried to scale these heights turned back overcome with fear and unable to breathe he could well believe that a man might grow too afraid to breathe attempting to climb so high yet though the cairhienin are consumed with the game of houses moiraine was saying at his shoulder they will follow you so long as they know that you are strong be firm with them but i would ask you to be fair also a ruler who gives true justice he tried to ignore her as he did the other riders and the creak and rumble of kaderes wagons making heavy going further back the broken gorges and gullies of the waste were behind them but these rugged rising hills nearly as barren were little better for wagons no one had traveled this path in over twenty years moiraine talked at him that way from daybreak to sunset whenever he let her her lectures could be on small things details of court behavior say in cairhien or saldaea or somewhere else or on large the political influence of the whitecloaks or perhaps the effects of trade on rulers decisions to go to war it was as if she meant to see him educated as a noble would be or should be before he reached the other side of the mountains it was surprising how often what she said reflected what anyone back in emonds field would have called simple common sense and also how often it did not occasionally she came out with something startling for instance that he should trust no woman of the tower except herself egwene elayne and nynaeve or the news that elaida was now the amyrlin seat oath to obey or no she would not tell him how she knew that she said it was someone elses place to tell if she chose someone elses secret and she could not usurp it he suspected the wise one dreamwalkers though they had stared him right in the eye and refused to say aye or nay he wished he could make them swear moiraines oath they interfered between him and the chiefs continually as if they wanted him to go through them to reach the chiefs right that minute he did not want to think about elaida or the wise ones or listen to moiraine now he wanted to study the pass ahead a deep gap in the mountains that twisted as though a blunt axe had tried to chop through again and again never quite succeeding a few minutes hard ride and he could be in it on one side of the pass mouth a sheer cliff had been smoothed over a hundredpace width and carved a windweathered snake entwining a staff a good three hundred spans high monument or marker or rulers sigil it surely dated from some lost nation before artur hawkwing perhaps even before the trolloc wars he had seen remnants before from nations long vanished often even moiraine did not know their source high on the other side so far up that he was not sure he was seeing what he thought just below the snow line stood something even stranger something that made the first monument of a few thousand years a commonplace he could have sworn it was the remnants of shattered buildings shining gray against the darker mountain and stranger still what appeared to be a dock of the same material as for ships slanting drunkenly down the mountain if he was not imagining it that had to date from before the breaking the face of the world had been changed utterly in those years this could well have been an oceans floor before he would have to ask asmodean even if he had had the time he did not think he would want to try reaching that altitude to find out for himself at the foot of the huge snake lay taien a highwalled town of moderate size a remnant itself of the time when cairhien had been allowed to send caravans across the threefold land and wealth had flowed from shara along the silk path there appeared to be birds above the town and dark blotches at regular intervals along the gray stone walls mat stood in pips stirrups shading his eyes with that broadbrimmed hat to peer up the pass frowning lans hard face wore no expression at all yet he appeared just as intent a gust of wind a little cooler here whipped his colorshifting cloak around him and for a moment all of him from shoulders to boots seemed to blend into the rocky hills and sparse thornbushes are you listening to me moiraine said suddenly reining her white mare closer you must she took a deep breath please rand there is so much that i must tell you so much that you need to know the hint of pleading in her tone made him glance at her he could remember when he had been overawed by her presence now she seemed quite small for all her regal manner a fool thing that he should feel protective of her there is plenty of time ahead of us moiraine he said gently i dont pretend to think i know as much of the world as you i mean to keep you close from now on he barely realized how great a change that was from when she was keeping him close but i have something else on my mind right now of course she sighed as you wish we have plenty of time yet rand heeled the dappled gray stallion to a trot and the others followed the wagons quickened too though they could not keep up on the slope asmodeans jasin nataels patchcovered gleemans cloak rippled behind him like the banner he carried at his stirrup brilliant red with the whiteandblack symbol of the ancient aes sedai at its center his face wore a sullen glower he had not been best pleased at having to be the bannerman under that sign he would conquer the prophecy of rhuidean said and perhaps it would not frighten the world so much as the dragon banner lews therins banner that he had left flying over the stone of tear few would know this sign the blotches on the walls of taien were bodies contorted in their final agonies bloated in the sun and hanging by their necks in a row that seemed to encircle the town the birds were glossy black ravens and vultures with their heads and necks befouled some ravens perched on corpses gorging unconcerned for the new arrivals the sickly sweet stench of corruption hung in the dry air and the acrid smell of char ironstrapped gates stood gaping open on an expanse of ruin sootstreaked stone houses and collapsed roofs nothing moved except the birds like mar ruois he tried to shake the thought away but in his head he could see that great city after it was retaken immense towers blackened and collapsing the remains of great bonfires at every street crossing where those who had refused to swear to the shadow had been bound and thrown alive to the flames he knew whose memory it had to be though he had not discussed it with moiraine i am rand althor lews therin telamon is dead three thousand years i am myself that was one battle he meant to win if he did have to die at shayol ghul he would die as himself he made himself think of something else half a month since he had left rhuidean half a month though the aiel had set a pace afoot from sunup to sundown that wearied the horses but couladin had been moving this way a week before he learned of it if they had not managed to close any ground he would have that long to ravage cairhien before rand could reach it longer before the shaido could be brought to bay not a much happier thought theres someone watching us from those rocks to the left lan said quietly he seemed to be completely engrossed in studying what remained of taien not aiel or i doubt i would have seen a glimmer rand was glad that he had made egwene and aviendha stay with the wise ones the town gave him a new reason but the watcher fit in with his original plan when he had hoped that taien had escaped egwene still wore the same aiel clothes as aviendha and aiel would not have been very welcome in taien they were even less likely to be welcome among the survivors he looked back at the wagons drawing to a halt a short distance downslope mutters drifted up from the drivers now that they could see the town clearly and the walls decorations kadere his bulk all in white again today mopped at his hawknosed face with a large kerchief he appeared unperturbed merely pursing his lips thoughtfully rand expected that moiraine would have to find new drivers once they were through the pass kadere and his crew would likely flee as soon as they had the chance and he would have to let them go it was not right it was not justice but it was necessary to protect asmodean how long now had he been doing what was necessary instead of what was right in a fair world they would be one and the same that made him laugh a hoarse wheeze he was far from the village boy he had been but sometimes that boy sneaked up on him the others looked at him and he fought the urge to tell them that he was not mad yet long minutes passed before two coatless men and a woman emerged from the rocks all three ragged and dirty and barefoot they approached hesitantly heads tilted uneasily eyes darting from rider to rider to the wagons and back as though they might take flight at a shout gaunt cheeks and wavering steps spoke of hunger thank the light one of the men said finally he was grayhaired none of the three was young his face deeply creased his eyes lingered a moment on asmodean with falls of lace at collar and cuffs but the leader of this train would not be riding a mule and carrying a banner it was rands stirrup that he clutched anxiously the light be praised that you came out of those terrible lands alive my lord that might have been rands blue silk coat embroidered in gold on the shoulders or the banner or simple flattery the man certainly had no reason to think them other than merchants if well dressed for it those murdering savages have risen again it is another aiel war they were over the wall in the night before anybody knew killing everyone who raised a hand stealing everything not mortared in place in the night mat said sharply hat pulled low he was still studying the ruined town were your sentries asleep you did have sentries this close to your enemies even aiel would have a hard time coming at you if you kept a good watch lan gave him an appraising look no my lord the grayhaired man blinked at mat then gave his answer to rand mats green coat was fine enough for a lord but it hung open and looked slept in we we had only a watchman at each gate it has been long since any have even seen one of the savages but this time whatever they did not steal they burned and drove us out to starve filthy animals thank the light you have come to save us my lord or we would all have died here i am tal nethin i am i was a saddlemaker a good one my lord this is my sister aril and her husband ander corl he makes fine boots they stole people too my lord the woman said her voice raw somewhat younger than her brother she might have been handsome once but haggard worry had etched lines in her face that rand suspected would never entirely go away her husband had a lost look in his eyes as if not exactly sure where he was my daughter my lord and my son they took all the young ones everyone above sixteen and some twice that or more said they were guysomething and stripped them naked right in the street and herded them off my lord can you she trailed off eyes squeezing shut as the impossibility overwhelmed her swaying small odds that she would ever see her children again moiraine was out of her saddle in an instant and by arils side the haggard woman gave a loud gasp as soon as the aes sedais hands touched her shivering to her toetips her wondering look turned to moiraine questioningly but moiraine only held her as if supporting her the womans husband suddenly gaped staring at rands gilded belt buckle the gift from aviendha his arms were marked like that like that all twined around like the cliff snake tal looked up at rand uncertainly the savages leader my lord he had markings like that on his arms he wore those strange clothes they all do but he had his coatsleeves cut off and he made sure everybody saw a gift i received in the waste rand said he made sure to keep his hands still on his pommel his coatsleeves hid his own dragons except for the heads they would be visible on the backs of his hands to anyone who looked closely he had forgotten about wondering what moiraine had actually done and all three looked on the point of running how long since they left six days my lord tal said uneasily they did what they did in a night and a day and were gone the next we would have gone too but what if we met them coming back surely they were turned back at selean that was the town at the other end of the pass rand doubted that selean was in any better condition than taien by this time how many survivors are there besides you three maybe a hundred my lord maybe more nobody has counted abruptly anger flared in him though he tried to hold it down a hundred of you his voice was icy iron and six days then why are your dead left for the ravens why do corpses still decorate your town walls those are your people filling your nostrils with their stink huddling together the three backed away from his horse we were afraid my lord tal said hoarsely they went but they could come back and he told us the one with the markings on his arms told us not to touch anything a message ander said in a dull voice he chose them out to hang just pulling them out until he had enough to line the wall men women he did not care his eyes were fixed on rands buckle he said they were a message for some man who would be following him he said he wanted this man to know know what they were going to do on the other side of the spine he said he said he would do worse to this man arils eyes widened suddenly and the three stared beyond rand for a moment gaping then screaming they turned and ran blackveiled aiel rose from the rocks they had come from and they darted off in another direction veiled aiel appeared there too and they collapsed to the ground sobbing and holding each other as they were surrounded moiraines face was cool and composed but her eyes were not serene rand twisted in his saddle rhuarc and dhearic were coming up the slope unveiling themselves and unwrapping the shoufa from around their heads dhearic was thicker than rhuarc with a prominent nose and paler streaks through his golden hair he had brought the reyn aiel as rhuarc had said he would timolan and his miagoma had been paralleling them to the north for three days exchanging occasional messengers but giving no clue to his intentions the codarra and the shiande and the daryne were still somewhere to the east following so amys and the others said from dreamtalking to their wise ones but slowly those wise ones had no more idea of their clan chiefs aims than rand did of timolans was that necessary he said as the two chiefs came up to him he had frightened the people first but for cause and had not made them think that they were going to die rhuarc simply shrugged and dhearic said we put spears in place around this hold unseen as you wished and there seemed no reason to wait since no one remained here to dance spears besides they are only treekillers rand drew a deep breath he had known this might be as large a problem as couladin in its own way nearly five hundred years ago the aiel had presented cairhien with a sapling a cutting from avendesora and with it a right granted to no other nation to trade across the threefold land to shara they had given no reason they did not like wetlanders very much at the best but to the aiel it had been required by jietoh during the long years of journey that had brought them to the waste only one people had not attacked them only one had allowed them water uncontested when the world grew parched and finally they had found the descendants of those people the cairhienin for five hundred years riches had flowed into cairhien with the silk and the ivory five hundred years and avendoraldera grew in cairhien and then king laman had the tree cut down to make a throne the nations knew why the aiel had crossed the spine of the world twenty years ago lamans sin they called it and lamans pride but few knew that to the aiel it had not been a war four clans had come to find an oathbreaker and when they had killed him they returned to the threefold land but their contempt for the treekillers the oathbreakers had never died moiraine being aes sedai offset her being cairhienin but rand was never sure how much these folk broke no oaths he told them find the others the saddlemaker says there are about a hundred and be gentle with them if any of them were watching theyre probably running away into the mountains by now the two aiel started to turn away and he added did you hear what they told me what do you think of what couladin did here they killed more than they had to dhearic said with a disgusted shake of his head like black ferrets falling on rockhens nests in a gully killing was as easy as dying so the aiel said any fool could do either and the other thing taking prisoners gaishain rhuarc and dhearic exchanged looks and dhearics mouth tightened clearly they had heard and it made them uncomfortable it took a great deal to make an aiel uncomfortable it cannot be so rhuarc said at last if it is gaishain is a thing of jietoh no one can be made gaishain who does not follow jietoh else they are only human animals such as the sharans keep couladin has abandoned jietoh dhearic sounded as though he were saying stones had grown wings mat guided pips closer using his knees he had never been more than an indifferent rider but sometimes when he was thinking of something else he rode as though born on a horses back that surprises you he said after everything he has done already the man would cheat at dice with his mother they gave him flateyed stares like blue stones in many ways aiel were jietoh and whatever else couladin was he was still aiel in their eyes sept before clan clan before outsiders but aiel before wetlanders some of the maidens joined them enaila and jolien and adelin and wiry whitehaired sulin who had been chosen roofmistress of the roof of the maidens in rhuidean she had told the maidens who stayed to choose another and now she led the maidens here they sensed the mood and said nothing only grounded their spearpoints patiently an aiel who wanted to could make the rocks look hasty lan broke the silence if couladin expects you to be following him he may have left a surprise somewhere in the pass a hundred men could hold some of those narrows against an army a thousand we will camp here then rand said and send scouts ahead to make sure the way is clear duadhe mahdiin water seekers dhearic agreed sounding pleased that had been his society before he became clan chief sulin and the other maidens gave rand flat stares as the reyn chief walked away downslope he had chosen scouts from other societies for the last three days when he had begun to fear what he might find here and he had the feeling they knew he was not just giving the others their turns he tried to ignore their looks sulins was especially difficult the woman could have driven nails with those pale blue eyes rhuarc once the survivors are found see that theyre fed and well treated we will take them with us his gaze was drawn to the town wall some aiel were already using their curved horn bows to kill ravens sometimes shadowspawn used ravens and other animals that fed on death as spies shadoweyes the aiel called them these barely paused in the frenzied feeding until they fell transfixed with an arrow but a wise man did not take chances with ravens or rats and see that the dead are buried at least in that right and necessity were the same chapter rising sun the gift of a blade the camp began to go up quickly in the mouth of jangai pass if away from taien and spreading over the hills around the approaches among the scattered thornbushes and even onto the slopes of the mountains not that anything was very visible except what was inside the pass aiel tents blended into the stony soil so well that you could miss them even when you knew what you were looking for and where in the hills the aiel camped by clan but those in the pass itself grouped themselves by society they were mostly maidens but the mens societies sent their representatives too some fifty each spreading tents well above the ruins of taien in slightly separated camps everyone understood or thought they did about the maidens carrying rands honor but all societies wanted to guard the caracarn moiraine and lan of course went to get kaderes wagons settled just below the town the aes sedai fussed over what was in those wagons nearly as much as she did over rand the drivers muttered and cursed about the towns smell and avoided watching the aiel cut bodies down from the wall but after their months in the waste they seemed to like being close even to the wreckage of what they saw as civilization gaishain were erecting the wise ones tents those of amys and bair and melaine below the town astride the faded track that led up out of the hills rand was sure they would say they had chosen the spot to be available to him as well as to the countless dozens of wise ones below but he thought it no coincidence that anyone coming up from the hills to him would have to go through or around their camp to reach him he was a little surprised to see melaine directing the whiterobed figures only three nights before she had married bael in a ceremony that made her his wife and firstsister to his other wife dorindha that part had been just as important as the marriage apparently aviendha had been shocked at his surprise or maybe angry when egwene arrived with aviendha up behind her on the gray mare those full skirts pushed above their knees they looked a matched pair despite their different coloring and aviendha being tall enough to look over egwenes shoulder without stretching each with just one ivory bracelet and one necklace the work of removing the hanged corpses had barely begun most of the ravens lay dead bundles of black feathers littering the ground and the rest had flown but vultures too gorged to flap aloft still waddled through the ashes inside the walls rand wished that there was some way he could keep the two women from having to see but to his surprise neither went running to empty her stomach well he had not really expected anything of the sort from aviendha she had seen death often enough and dealt it out too and her face remained expressionless but he had not expected the pure pity in egwenes eyes as she gazed at the bloated dead coming down she drew mist over to jeadeen and leaned to put a hand on his arm i am so sorry rand there was no way you could have stopped this i know he told her he had not even known there was a town here until rhuarc mentioned it casually five days ago his councils with the chiefs had all been on whether they could cover more ground in a day and what couladin would do when he cleared the jangai and by that time the shaido had finished here and gone he had done with cursing himself for a fool then well just you remember it it was not your fault she heeled mist on and began talking to aviendha before she was out of earshot i am glad he is taking it so well he has the habit of feeling guilty over things he cannot control men always believe they are in control of everything around them aviendha replied when they find out they are not they think they have failed instead of learning a simple truth women already know egwene giggled that is the simple truth once i saw those poor people i thought we would find him heaving somewhere is his stomach so tender i their voices faded away as the mare ambled on rand pulled himself back upright in the saddle flushing trying to eavesdrop on them he was behaving like an idiot that did not stop him frowning at their departing backs he only took responsibility for what he was accountable for if only to himself just for things he could do something about and what he should have done something about he did not like them talking about him behind his back or under his nose the light only knew what they were saying dismounting he led jeadeen in search of asmodean who seemed to have wandered off after so many days in the saddle it was good to walk various clusters of tents were springing up along the pass the mountain slopes and cliffs made formidable barriers but the aiel still arranged themselves as if they could expect attack from them he had tried walking with the aiel but half a day was enough to put him back on the horse it was hard enough to keep up with them mounted they could wear out horses when they pressed mat was down too squatting with his reins in one hand and that blackhafted spear across his knees peering at the gaping gates studying the town and muttering to himself while pips tried to nibble at a thornbush mat was studying not just staring where had that remark about sentries come from mat said odd things at times now since their first visit to rhuidean rand wished that he were willing to talk about what had happened but he still denied that anything had despite the foxhead medallion the spear and that scar around his neck melindhra the shaido maiden that mat had taken up with was off to one side watching mat until sulin came and chased her away on some errand rand wondered if mat knew the maidens were laying bets on whether melindhra would give up the spear for him and on whether she would teach him to sing too though they only laughed when rand asked what that meant the sound of music drew him to asmodean seated by himself on a granite outcrop with his harp on his knee the crimson banners staff had been twisted into the rocky soil and the mule tethered to it you see my lord dragon he said cheerfully your bannerman keeps loyally to his duties his voice and expression changed and he said if you must have this thing why not let mat carry it or lan or moiraine for that matter she would be glad to carry your banner and clean your boots be careful of her she is a devious woman when a woman says she will obey you of her own will it is time to sleep lightly and watch your back you carry it because you were chosen master jasin natael asmodean gave a start and looked around though everyone else was too far away and too busy to be listening none but they two would have understood anyway what do you know about those ruins up near the snow line they must come from the age of legends asmodean did not even glance up the mountain this world is very changed from the world i went to sleep in he sounded weary and he shivered slightly what i know of what lies where i have learned since waking the mournful sounds of the march of death rose from his harp that could be what is left of the city where i was born for all i know shorelle was a port the sun had maybe an hour before the spine of the world hid it this close to high mountains night came early i am too tired for one of our discussions tonight that was what they called asmodeans lessons in public even when no one was around added to practice sessions with lan or rhuarc those lessons had left him little time for sleep since leaving rhuidean you take to your tent when youre ready and i will see you in the morning with the banner there was no one else to carry the bloody thing maybe he could find somebody in cairhien as he was turning away asmodean plucked something discordant and said no burning nets woven around my tent tonight do you finally begin to trust me rand looked back over his shoulder i trust you like a brother until the day you betray me you have a parole for what youve done in return for your teaching and a better bargain than you deserve but the day you turn against me i will tear it up and bury it with you asmodean opened his mouth but rand forestalled him that is me talking natael rand althor two rivers folk dont like people who try to stab them in the back irritably he pulled at the dapples reins and went on before the other man could say anything he was not sure whether asmodean had any inkling that a dead man was trying to take him over but he should not let himself give the man hints asmodean was sure enough already that his was a helpless cause if he began to think that rand was not in full control of his own mind perhaps that he was going mad the forsaken would abandon him in a heartbeat and there was too much rand had to learn yet whiterobed gaishain were erecting his tent under aviendhas direction well into the pass mouth with that huge carved snake rearing above the gaishain had their own tents but those would be the last erected of course adelin and a dozen or so maidens squatted nearby watching waiting to guard his sleep even with over a thousand maidens encamped around him every night they still put a guard on his tent before approaching he reached out through the angreal in his coat pocket to seize saidin there was no need to actually touch the carving of the fat little man with a sword of course mingled filth and sweetness filled him that raging river of fire that crushing avalanche of ice channeling as he had done every night since leaving rhuidean he set wards around the entire encampment not only what was in the pass but every tent in the hills below as well and on the slopes of the mountains he needed the angreal to set wardings so large but only just he had thought that he was strong before but asmodeans teachings were making him stronger no human or animal crossing the line of that ward would notice anything but shadowspawn that touched it would sound a warning that everyone in the tents would hear had he done this in rhuidean the darkhounds could never have entered without him knowing the aiel themselves would have to keep watch for human enemies wardings were complex weaves if tenuous and trying to make them do more than one thing could render them useless in practicality he could have made this one to kill shadowspawn instead of merely giving warning but that would have been like a beacon to any male forsaken who might be searching and to myrddraal too no need to bring his enemies down on him when they might not know where he was this even one of the forsaken would not know until he was close and a myrddraal not until it was too late letting go of saidin was an exercise in selfcontrol despite the foulness of the taint despite the way the power tried to scour him away like sand on a riverbed to burn him obliterate him he floated in the vast emptiness of the void yet he could feel the air stirring against each hair on his head see the weave of the gaishains robes smell aviendhas warm scent he wanted more but he could smell the ashes of taien too smell the who had been burned the corruption of those who not even the ones already buried mingled with the soil of their graves that helped for a while after it was gone all he did was take deep breaths of hot arid air compared to before the whiff of death seemed absent and the air itself pure and wonderful look what was here before us aviendha said as he let a meekfaced whiterobed woman take jeadeen she held up a brown snake dead but as thick as his forearm and nearly three paces long the bloodsnake took its name from the effect of its bite turning the blood to jelly in minutes unless he missed his guess the neat wound behind its head had come from her belt knife adelin and the other maidens looked approving did you ever for one minute think that it could have bitten you he said did you ever think of using the power instead of a bloody belt knife why didnt you kiss it first you had to be close enough she drew herself up and her big green eyes should have brought on the nights chill early the wise ones say it is not good to use the power too often the clipped words were as cold as her eyes they say it is possible to draw too much and harm yourself frowning slightly she added more to herself than him though i have not come near what i can hold yet i am sure of it shaking his head he ducked into the tent the woman would not listen to reason no sooner had he settled himself against a silk cushion near the still unlit fire than she followed him without the bloodsnake thankfully but gingerly carrying something long wrapped in thick layers of graystriped blanket you were worried for me she said in a flat voice there was no expression at all on her face of course not he lied fool woman shell get herself killed yet because she doesnt have the sense to be careful when its needed id have been as worried for anyone i would not want anyone bitten by a bloodsnake for a moment she eyed him doubtfully then gave a quick nod good so long as you do not presume toward me tossing the bundled blanket at his feet she sat on her heels across the firepit from him you would not accept the buckle as canceling debt between us aviendha there is no debt he thought that she had forgotten about that she went on as if he had not spoken but perhaps that will cancel it sighing he unwrapped the striped blanket warily since she had held it far more uneasily than she had the snake she had held the bloody snake as if it were a piece of cloth unwrapped it and gasped what lay inside was a sword the scabbard so encrusted with rubies and moonstones that it was hard to see the gold except where a rising sun of many rays had been inset the ivory hilt long enough for two hands had another inlaid rising sun in gold the pommel was thick with rubies and moonstones and still more made a solid mass along the quillons this had never been made to use only to be seen to be stared at this must have cost aviendha how could you pay for it it cost little she said so defensively that she might as well have added that she lied a sword how did you ever come by a sword how did any aiel come by a sword dont tell me kadere had this hidden in his wagons i carried it in a blanket she sounded even more touchy now than she had about the price even bair said that would make it all right so long as i did not actually touch it she shrugged uncomfortably shifting and reshifting her shawl it was the treekillers sword lamans it was taken from his body as proof that he was dead because his head could not be brought back so far since then it has passed from hand to hand young men or fool maidens who wanted to own the proof of his death only each began to think of what it was and soon sold it to another fool the price has come down very far since it first was sold no aiel would lay hand to it even to remove the stones well it is very beautiful he said as tactfully as he could manage only a buffoon would carry something this gaudy and that ivory hilt would twist in a hand slippery with sweat or blood but i cannot let you he trailed off as he bared a few inches of the blade out of habit to examine the edge etched into the shining steel stood a heron symbol of a blademaster he had carried a sword marked like that once suddenly he was ready to bet that this blade was like it like the ravenmarked blade on mats spear metal made with power that would never break and never need sharpening most blademasters swords were only copies of those lan could tell him for certain but he was sure already in his own mind pulling the scabbard off he leaned across the firepit to place it in front of her i will take the blade to cancel the debt aviendha it was long and slightly curved with a single edge just the blade you can have the hilt back too he could have a new hilt and scabbard made in cairhien maybe one of taiens survivors was a decent bladesmith she stared wideeyed from the scabbard to him and back mouth open stunned for the first time that he had ever seen but those gems are worth much much more than i you are trying to put me in your debt again rand althor not so if this blade had lain untouched and untarnished in its scabbard for over twenty years it had to be what he thought i did not accept the scabbard so it has been yours all along tossing one of the silk cushions into the air he executed the seated version of the form called low wind rising feathers rained down as the blade sliced neatly through and i dont accept the hilt either so thats yours too if you have made a profit its your own doing instead of looking happy at her good fortune he suspected she had given everything that she had for the sword and likely gotten back a hundred times as much or more in the scabbard alone instead of seeming glad or thanking him she glared through the feathers as indignantly as any goodwife in the two rivers seeing her floor littered stiffly she clapped and one of the gaishain appeared immediately going to her knees to begin cleaning up the mess it is my tent he said pointedly aviendha sniffed at him in perfect imitation of egwene those two women were definitely spending too much time together supper when it came at full dark consisted of the usual flat pale bread and a spicy stew of dried peppers and beans with chunks of nearly white meat he only grinned at her when he learned that it was the bloodsnake he had eaten snake and worse since coming to the waste gara the poisonous lizard was the worst in his estimation not for the taste which was rather like chicken but because it was lizard it sometimes seemed that there must be more poisonous things snakes lizards spiders plants in the waste than in the rest of the world combined aviendha appeared disappointed that he did not spit the stew out in disgust though sometimes it was difficult to tell what she was feeling at times she seemed to take great pleasure in discomfiting him had he been trying to pretend that he was aiel he would have thought she was trying to prove he was not tired and eager for sleep he only took off his coat and boots before crawling into his blankets and turning his back to aviendha aiel men and women might take sweatbaths together but a short time in shienar where they did something much the same had convinced him that he was not made for that sort of thing not without going so red in the face that he died of it he tried not to listen to the rustle of her undressing beneath her own blankets at least she had that much modesty but he kept his back turned anyway just in case she claimed she was supposed to sleep there to continue his lessons on aiel ways and customs since he spent so much of his days with the chiefs they both knew that was a lie though what the wise ones thought she could find out this way he could not imagine she gave little grunts every now and then as she tugged at something and muttered to herself to cover the sounds and stop himself thinking of what they must mean he said melaines wedding was impressive did bael really know nothing about it until melaine and dorindha told him of course not she replied scornfully pausing for what he thought was a stocking coming off why should he know before melaine laid the bridal wreath at his feet and asked him abruptly she laughed melaine nearly drove herself and dorindha to distraction finding segade blossoms for the wreath few grow so close to the dragonwall does that mean something special segade blossoms that was what he had sent her the flowers she had never acknowledged that she has a prickly nature and means to keep it another pause broken by mutters had she used leaves or flowers from sweetroot it would have meant she claimed a sweet nature morning drop would mean she would be submissive and there are too many to list it would take me days to teach all the combinations to you and you do not need to know them you will not have an aiel wife you belong to elayne he nearly looked at her when she said submissive a word less likely to describe any aiel woman he could not conceive probably means she gives warning before she stabs you there had been more of a muffled sound to her voice at the end pulling her blouse over her head he realized he wished the lamps were out no that would have made it worse but then he had been through this every single night since rhuidean and every single night it was worse he had to put an end to it the woman was going to sleep with the wise ones where she belonged from now on he would learn what he could from her as he could he had thought exactly the same thing for fifteen nights now trying to chase the pictures out of his head he said that bit at the end after the vows were said no sooner had half a dozen wise ones pronounced their blessings than a hundred of melaines blood kin had rushed in to surround her all carrying their spears a hundred of baels kin had rallied to him and he had fought his way to her no one had been veiled of course it was all part of custom but blood had still been shed on both sides a few minutes before melaine was vowing that she loved him but when he reached her she fought like a cornered ridgecat if dorindha had not punched her in the shortribs he did not think bael would ever have gotten her over his shoulder to carry off he still has the limp and the black eye she gave him should she have been a weakling aviendha said sleepily he had to know the worth of her she was not a trinket for him to put in his pouch she yawned and he heard her nestling deeper into her blankets what does teaching a man to sing mean aiel men did not sing not once they were old enough to take up a spear except for battle chants and laments for the dead you are thinking of mat cauthon she actually giggled sometimes a man gives up the spear for a maiden youre making that up i never heard of anything like that well it is not really giving up the spear her voice held a thick muzziness sometimes a man desires a maiden who will not give up the spear for him and he arranges to be taken gaishain by her he is a fool of course no maiden would look at gaishain as he hopes he is worked hard and kept strictly to his place and the first thing that is done is to make him learn to sing to entertain the spearsisters while they eat she is going to teach him to sing that is what maidens say when a man makes a fool of himself over one of the spearsisters a very peculiar people aviendha he had said he was not going to ask her this again lan said it was kandori work a pattern called snowflakes probably loot from some raid up north who gave you that necklace a friend rand althor we came far today and you will start us early tomorrow sleep well and wake rand althor only an aiel would wish you a good night by hoping you did not die in your sleep setting the much smaller if much more intricate ward on his dreams he channeled the lamps out and tried to sleep a friend the reyn came from the north but she had had the necklace in rhuidean why did he care aviendhas slow breathing seemed loud in his ears until he fell asleep and then he dreamed a confused dream of min and elayne helping him throw aviendha wearing nothing but that necklace over his shoulder while she beat him over the head with a wreath of segade blossoms chapter horned skull birdcalls by night lying facedown on his blankets with his eyes closed mat luxuriated in the feel of melindhras thumbs kneading their way down his spine there was nothing quite as good as a massage after a long day in the saddle well some things were but right then he was willing to settle for her thumbs you are well muscled for such a short man matrim cauthon he opened one eye and glanced back at her kneeling astride his hips she had built the fire up twice as high as needed and sweat trickled down her body her fine golden hair closecut except for that aiel tail at the nape of her neck clung to her scalp if im too short you can always find somebody else you are not too short for my taste she laughed ruffling his hair it was longer than hers and you are cute relax this does no good if you tense grunting he closed his eyes again cute light and short only aiel could call him short in every other land he had been in he was taller than most men if not always by much he could remember being tall taller than rand when he rode against artur hawkwing and a hand shorter than he was now when he fought beside maecine against the aelgari he had spoken to lan claiming he had overheard some names the warder said maecine had been a king of eharon one of the ten nations that much mat already knew some four or five hundred years before the trolloc wars lan doubted that even the brown ajah knew more much had been lost in the trolloc wars and more in the war of the hundred years those were the earliest and latest of the memories that had been planted in his skull nothing after artur paendrag tanreall and nothing before maecine of eharon are you cold melindhra said incredulously you shivered she scrambled off him and he heard her add wood to the fire there was enough scrub here for burning she slapped his bottom hard as she climbed back on murmuring good muscle if you keep on like that he muttered ill think you mean to spit me for supper like a trolloc it was not that he did not enjoy melindhra as long as she refrained from pointing out that she was taller anyway but the situation made him uncomfortable no spits for you matrim cauthon her thumbs dug hard into his shoulder that is it relax he supposed that he would marry someday settle down that was what you did a woman a house a family shackled to one spot for the rest of his life i never heard of a wife yet that liked her husband having a drink or a gamble and there was what those folk on the other side of the doorframe terangreal had said that he was fated to marry the daughter of the nine moons a man has to marry sooner or later i suppose but he certainly did not mean to take an aiel wife he wanted to dance with as many women as he could while he could you are not made for spits but for great honor i think melindhra said softly sounds fine to me only now he could not get another woman to look at him not the maidens or the others it was as if melindhra had hung a sign on him saying owned by melindhra of the jumai shaido well she would not have put that last bit on not here then again who knew what an aiel would do especially a maiden of the spear women did not think the same as men and aiel women did not think like anybody else in the world it is strange that you efface yourself so efface myself he mumbled her hands did feel good knots were coming out that he had not known were there how he wondered if it had something to do with that necklace melindhra seemed to set great store by it or by receiving it anyway she never wore the thing of course maidens did not but she carried it in her pouch and showed it to every woman who asked a lot of them seemed to you put yourself in the shadow of rand althor im not in anybodys shadow he said absently it could not be the necklace he had given jewelry to other women maidens and others he liked giving things to pretty women even if all he got in return was a smile he never expected more if a woman did not enjoy a kiss and a cuddle as much as he did what was the point of course there is honor of a sort in being in the shadow of the caracarn to be near the mighty you must stand in their shade shade mat agreed not really hearing sometimes the women accepted and sometimes not but none had decided they owned him that was what rankled really he was not about to be owned by any woman however pretty she was and no matter how good her hands were at loosening knotted muscles your scars should be scars of honor earned in your own name as a chief not this one finger traced along the hanging scar on his neck did you earn this serving the caracarn shrugging her hand away he pushed up on his elbows and twisted to look at her are you sure daughter of the nine moons doesnt mean anything to you i have told you it does not lie down if you are lying to me i swear ill welt your rump hands on hips she looked down at him dangerously do you think that you can welt my rump mat cauthon ill give it my best try she would probably put a spear through his ribs do you swear youve never heard of the daughter of the nine moons i never have she said slowly who is she or what lie down and let me a blackbird called seemingly everywhere in the tent and outside as well and a moment later a redwing good two rivers birds rand had chosen his warnings from what he knew birds not found in the waste melindhra was off him in an instant wrapping her shoufa around her head veiling herself as she snatched up spears and bucklers she darted from the tent like that blood and bloody ashes mat muttered as he struggled into his breeches a redwing meant the south he and melindhra had put up their tent to the south with the chareen as far from rand as they could get and stay in the encampment but he was not going outside in those thornbushes naked the way melindhra had the blackbird meant north where the shaarad were camped they were coming from two sides at once stamping his feet in his boots as best he could in the low tent he looked at the silver foxhead lying beside his blankets shouts were rising outside the clash of metal on metal he had finally figured out that that medallion had somehow kept moiraine from healing him on her first try so long as he had been touching it her channeling had not affected him he had never heard of shadowspawn able to channel but there was always the black ajah so rand said and he believed it and always the chance that one of the forsaken had finally come after rand pulling the leather thong over his head so the medallion hung on his chest he snatched up his ravenmarked spear and ducked out into cold moonlight he had no time to feel the icy chill before he was completely out of the tent he almost lost his head to a scythecurved trolloc sword the blade brushed his hair as he threw himself into a low dive rolling to his feet with the spear ready at first glance in the darkness the trolloc might have been a bulky man though half again as tall as any aielman garbed all in black mail with spikes at elbows and shoulders and a helmet with goats horns attached but these horns grew out of that too human head and below the eyes a goats muzzle thrust out snarling the trolloc lunged at him and howled in a harsh language never meant for a human tongue mat spun his spear like a quarterstaff knocking the heavy curved blade to one side and thrust his long spearpoint into the creatures middle mail parting for that powermade steel as easily as the flesh beneath the goatsnouted trolloc folded over with a harsh cry and mat pulled his weapon free dodging aside as it fell all around him aiel some unclothed or only half but all blackveiled fought trollocs with tusked boars snouts or wolves muzzles or eagles beaks some with heads horned or crested with feathers wielding those oddly curved swords and spiked axes hooked tridents and spears here and there one used a huge bow to shoot barbed arrows the size of small spears men fought alongside the trollocs too in rough coats with swords shouting desperately as they died among the thornbushes sammael sammael and the golden bees the darkfriends were dying most as soon as they engaged an aiel but the trollocs died harder i am no bloody hero mat shouted to no one in particular as he battled a trolloc with a bears muzzle and hairy ears his third the creature carried a longhandled axe with half a dozen sharp spikes and a flaring blade big enough to split a tree throwing it about like a toy in those great hairy hands it was being near rand that got mat into these things all he wanted from life was some good wine a game of dice and a pretty girl or three i dont want to be mixed up in this especially not if sammael was around do you hear me the trolloc went down with a ruined throat and he found himself facing a myrddraal just as it finished killing two aiel who had come at it together the halfman looked like a man pasty pale armored in black overlapping scales like a snakes it moved like a snake too boneless and fluid and quick nightblack cloak hanging still however it darted and it had no eyes just a deadwhite sweep of skin where eyes should be that eyeless gaze turned on him and he shivered fear oozing along his bones the look of the eyeless is fear they said in the borderlands where they should know and even aiel admitted that a myrddraals stare sent chills through the marrow that was the creatures first weapon the halfman came at him in a flowing run with a roar mat rushed to meet it spear spinning like a quarterstaff thrusting ever moving the thing carried a blade as dark as its cloak a sword hammered at the forges of thakandar and if that cut him he was as good as dead unless moiraine appeared quickly with her healing but there was only one sure way to take down a fade allout attack you had to overwhelm it before it overwhelmed you and a thought for defense could be a good way to die he could not even spare a glance for the battle raging around him in the night the myrddraals blade flickered like a serpents tongue darted like black lightning but to counter mats attack when ravenmarked powerwrought steel met thakandarmade metal blue light flashed around them a crackle of sheet lightning suddenly mats slashing attack struck flesh black sword and pale hand flew away and the reverse stroke sliced open the myrddraals throat but mat did not stop thrust through the heart cut to one hamstring then the other all in rapid succession only then did he step away from the thing still thrashing on the ground flailing about with its good hand and severed stump wounds spilling inky blood halfmen took a long time to admit that they were dead they did not die completely except with a setting sun looking around mat realized that the attack was over whatever darkfriends or trollocs were not dead had fled at least he saw none standing except aiel some of them were down too he plucked a kerchief from the neck of a darkfriend corpse to wipe the myrddraals black blood from his spearpoint it would etch the metal if left too long this night assault made no sense by the bodies he could see in the moonlight trolloc and human none had made it much past the first line of tents and without far greater numbers they could not have hoped for more what was that you called out carai something the old tongue he turned to look at melindhra she had unveiled but she still wore not a stitch more than her shoufa there were other maidens about and men wearing as little and showing as little concern though most did seem to be heading back to their tents without lingering they had no modesty that was it no modesty at all she did not even seem to feel the cold though her breath made wisps of mist he was as sweaty as she and freezing now that he had no fight for his life to occupy his mind something i heard once he told her i liked the sound of it carai an caldazar for the honor of the red eagle the battle cry of manetheren most of his memories were from manetheren some of those he had had before the twisted doorway moiraine said it was the old blood coming out just as long as it did not come out of his veins she put an arm around his shoulders as he started back toward their tent i saw you with the nightrunner mat cauthon that was one of the aiel names for myrddraal you are as tall as a man needs to be grinning he slipped his arm around her waist but he could not get the attack out of his head he wanted to his thoughts were too snarled in his borrowed memories but he could not why had anyone launched such a hopeless assault no one but a fool attacked overwhelming force without a reason that was the thought he could not pry out of his head no one attacked without a reason the birdcalls pulled rand awake immediately and he seized saidin as he tossed the blankets aside and ran out coatless in his stocking feet the night was cold and moonlit faint sounds of battle drifting up from the hills below the pass around him aiel stirred like scurrying ants rushing into the night to where an attack might come here in the pass the wards would signal again shadowspawn in the pass would cause a winterfinch to call until he unraveled them in the morning but there was no point in taking foolish chances soon the pass was still again the gaishain in their tents forbidden weapons even now the other aiel off at the places that might need defending even adelin and the other maidens had gone as if they knew he would have held them back if they waited he could hear a few mutters from the wagons near the town walls but neither the drivers nor kadere showed themselves he did not expect them to the faint sounds of battle men shouting screaming dying came from two directions both below well away from him people were out around the wise ones tents too staring toward the fighting it seemed an attack down there made no sense it was not the miagoma not unless timolan had taken shadowspawn into his clan and that was as likely as whitecloaks recruiting trollocs he turned back toward his tent and even enclosed in the void he gave a start aviendha had come out into the moonlight a blanket wrapped around her just beyond her stood a tall man shrouded in a dark cloak moonshadows drifted over a gaunt face that was too pale with eyes too large a crooning rose and the cloak opened into wide leathery wings like those of a bat moving as in a dream aviendha drifted toward the waiting embrace rand channeled and fingerthin balefire burned past her an arrow of solid light to take the draghkar in the head the effect of that narrower stream was slower but no less sure than with the darkhounds the creatures colors reversed black to white white to black and it became sparkling motes that melted in air aviendha shook herself as the crooning ended stared at the last particles as they vanished and turned to rand gathering the blanket closer her hand came up and a stream of fire as thick as his head roared toward him startled even inside the emptiness never thinking of the power he threw himself to the ground beneath the billowing flames they died in an instant what are you doing he barked so angry so shocked that the void cracked and saidin vanished from him he scrambled to his feet stalking toward her this tops any ingratitude i ever heard of he was going to shake her until her teeth rattled i just saved your life in case you failed to notice and if i offended some bloody aiel custom i dont give a the next time she snapped back i will leave the great caracarn to deal with matters by himself awkwardly clutching the blanket close she ducked stiffbacked into the tent for the first time he looked behind him at another draghkar crumpled on the ground in flames he had been so angry that he had not heard the crackling and popping as it burned had not smelled the odor of burning grease he had not even sensed the evil of it a draghkar killed by first sucking the soul away and then life it had to be close touching but this one lay no more than two paces from where he had been standing he was not certain how effective a draghkars crooning embrace was against someone filled with saidin but he was glad he had not found out drawing a deep breath he knelt beside the tent flap aviendha he could not go in a lamp was lit in there and she could be sitting there naked for all he knew mentally ripping him up and down the way he deserved aviendha i am sorry i apologize i was a fool to speak as i did without asking why i should know that you wouldnt harm me and i i im a fool he finished weakly a great deal you know rand althor came a muffled reply you are a fool how did aiel apologize he had never asked her that considering jietoh teaching men to sing and wedding customs he did not think he would yes i am and i apologize there was no answer this time are you in your blankets silence muttering to himself he stood working his stockinged toes on the icy ground he was going to have to remain out here until he was sure she was decently covered without boots or coat he seized hold of saidin taint and all just to be distanced from the bonegrinding cold inside the void the three wise one dreamwalkers came running of course and egwene all staring at the burning draghkar as they skirted it drawing their shawls around them with almost the same motion only one amys said i thank the light but i am surprised there were two rand told her i destroyed the other why should he be hesitant just because moiraine had warned him against balefire it was a weapon like any other if aviendha had not killed this one it might have gotten me the feel of her channeling drew us egwene said looking him up and down at first he thought she was checking for injuries but she paid special attention to his stocking feet then glanced at the tent where a crack in the tent flap showed lamplight youve upset her again havent you she saved your life and you men with a disgusted shake of her head she brushed past him and into the tent he heard faint voices but could not make out what was being said melaine gave a hitch to her shawl if you do not need us then we must see what is happening below she hurried off without waiting for the other two bair cackled as she and amys followed a wager on who she will check on first my amethyst necklace that you like so much against that sapphire bracelet of yours done i choose dorindha the older wise one cackled again her eyes are still full of bael a firstsister is a firstsister but a new husband they moved on out of earshot and he bent toward the tent flap he still could not hear what they were saying not unless he stuck his ear to the crack and he was not about to do that surely aviendha had covered herself with egwene in there then again the way egwene had taken to aiel ways it was just as likely she had peeled out of her clothes instead the soft sound of slippers announced moiraine and lan and rand straightened though he could hear both of them breathing the warders steps still made barely an audible noise moiraines hair hung about her face and she held a dark robe around her the silk shining with the moon lan was fully dressed booted and armed wrapped in that cloak that made him part of the night of course the clamor of fighting was dying down in the hills below i am surprised you were not here sooner moiraine his voice sounded cold but better his voice than him he held onto saidin fought it and the nights icy chill remained something far off he was aware of it aware of each hair on his arms stirring with cold beneath his shirtsleeves but it did not touch him you usually come looking for me as soon as you sense trouble i have never explained all that i do or do not do her voice was as coolly mysterious as it had ever been yet even in the moonlight rand was certain that she was blushing lan looked troubled though with him it was difficult to tell i cannot hold your hand forever eventually you must walk alone i did that tonight didnt i embarrassment slid across the void that sounded as though he had done everything himself and he added aviendha all but took that one off my back the flames on the draghkar were burning low as well she was here then moiraine said calmly you did not need me she had not been afraid of that he was sure he had seen her rush into the midst of shadowspawn wielding the power as skillfully as lan did his sword seen it too often to believe fear in her so why had she not come when she sensed the draghkar she could have and lan as well that was one of the gifts a warder received from the bond between him and an aes sedai he could make her tell catch her between her oath to him and her inability to lie straight out no he could not or would not he would not do that to someone who was trying to help him at least now we know what the attack below was about he said to make me think something important was happening there while the draghkar slipped in on me they tried that at cold rocks hold and it did not work there either only maybe it almost had this time if that had been the intent you would think they would try something different couladin ahead of him the forsaken everywhere it seemed why could he not face one enemy at a time do not make the mistake of thinking the forsaken simple moiraine said that could easily be fatal she shifted her robe as though wishing it were thicker the hour is late if you have no further need of me aiel began to drift back as she and the warder left some exclaimed over the draghkar and roused some of the gaishain to drag it away but most simply looked at it before going to their tents they seemed to expect such things of him now when adelin and the maidens appeared their softbooted feet dragged they stared at the draghkar being hauled away by whiterobed men and exchanged long looks before approaching rand there was nothing here adelin said slowly the attack was all below darkfriends and trollocs shouting sammael and the golden bees i heard another added with her head wrapped in a shoufa rand could not make out who she was she sounded young some of the maidens were no more than sixteen taking a deep breath adelin held out one of her spears horizontally in front of him rocksteady the others did the same one spear each we i failed adelin said we should have been here when the draghkar came instead we ran like children to dance the spears what am i supposed to do with those rand asked and adelin replied without hesitation whatever you wish caracarn we stand ready and will not resist rand shook his head bloody aiel and their bloody jietoh you take those and go back to guarding my tent well go looks passed between them before they began to obey as reluctantly as they had approached him in the first place and one of you tell aviendha that i will be coming in when i return he added he was not going to spend the entire night outside wondering whether it was safe he stalked away the stony ground hard under his feet asmodeans tent was not very far from his there had not been a sound out of it he whipped open the flap and ducked in asmodean was sitting in the dark chewing his lip he flinched when rand appeared and gave him no chance to speak you did not expect me to take a hand did you i felt the draghkar but you could deal with those you did i have never liked draghkar we should never have made them they have fewer brains than a trolloc give them an order and they still sometimes kill whatever is closest if i had come out if i had done something what if someone noticed what if they realized it could not be you channeling i well for you that you didnt rand cut him off sitting crosslegged in the dark if i had felt you full of saidin out there tonight i might have killed you the other mans laugh was shaky i thought of that too it was sammael who sent the attack tonight the trollocs and darkfriends anyway it is not like sammael to throw men away asmodean said slowly but hell see ten thousand dead or ten times that if it gains him what he thinks is worth the cost maybe one of the others wants you to think it was him even if the aiel took prisoners trollocs do not think of much besides killing and darkfriends believe what they are told it was him he tried to bait me into attacking him once in the same way at serendahar oh light the thought drifted across the surface of the void i said me he did not know where serendahar had been or anything but what he had said the words had just come out after a long silence asmodean said quietly i never knew that what i want to know is why rand chose his words carefully hoping that they were all his he remembered sammaels face a man not mine not my memory a compact man with a short yellow beard asmodean had described all the forsaken but he knew this image was not made from that description sammael had always wanted to be taller and resented it that the power could not make him so asmodean had never told him that from what youve told me he is not likely to want to face me unless he is sure of victory and maybe not then you said hed likely leave me to the dark one if he could so why is he sure hell win now if i decide to go after him they discussed it in the dark for hours without coming to any conclusion asmodean held to the opinion that it had been one of the others hoping to send rand against sammael and thus get rid of one or both at least asmodean said that he did rand could feel the mans dark eyes on him wondering that slip had been too big to cover when he finally returned to his own tent adelin and the dozen maidens all sprang to their feet all of them at once telling him that egwene was gone and aviendha long asleep that she was angry with him they both were they gave so many different pieces of advice on handling the two womens anger all at the same time that he could understand none of it finally they fell silent looks passing between them and adelin spoke alone we must speak of tonight of what we did and what we failed to do we it was nothing he told her and if it was something its forgiven and forgotten i would like to have a few hours sleep for once if you want to discuss it go talk to amys or bair i am sure theyll understand what youre after more than i do that shut them up surprisingly and let him get inside aviendha was in her blankets with one slim bare leg sticking out he tried not to look at it or her she had left a lamp lit he climbed into his own blankets gratefully and channeled the lamp out before releasing saidin this time he dreamed of aviendha hurling fire only she was not hurling it at a draghkar and sammael was sitting at her side laughing chapter dragon the fifth i give you reining mist around on a grassy hilltop egwene watched the streams of aiel coming down from the jangai pass the saddle had pushed her skirts above her knees again but she hardly noticed that now she could not spend every minute fussing with them and she had on stockings it was not as though she were barelegged in trotting columns the aiel flowed by below her arranged by clan and sept and society thousands upon thousands with their packhorses and mules the gaishain who would tend the camps while the rest fought spreading a mile wide and more still in the pass or already out of sight ahead even without families it seemed a nation on the march the silk path had been a road here a full fifty paces wide and paved with broad white stones slicing straight through hills carved to make a level only occasionally was it visible through the mass of aiel although they seemed to prefer running on the grass but many of the paving stones had lifted up at a corner or sunk down at one end more than twenty years had gone by since this road had carried more than local farmers carts and a handful of wagons it was startling to see trees again real trees towering oaks and leatherleaf in actual thickets rather than an occasional windtwisted stunted shape and tall grass waving in the breeze across the hills there was real forest to the north and clouds in the sky thin and high yet clouds the air seemed blessedly cool after the waste and moist though brown leaves and large brown swaths through the grass told her that in reality it might be hotter and drier than usual for the time of year still the countryside of cairhien was a lush paradise compared to the other side of the dragonwall a small stream meandered north beneath a nearly flat bridge bordered by the dried clay of a broader bed the river gaelin lay not too many miles away in that direction she wondered what the aiel would make of that river she had seen aiel near a river once before the shrunken band of water marked a definite break in the steady flow of people as men and maidens paused to stare in amazement before leaping across kaderes wagons rumbled by on the road the long mule teams working hard but still losing ground to the aiel it had taken four days to traverse the twists and turns of the pass and rand apparently intended to go as far into cairhien as he could in the few hours of daylight remaining moiraine and lan rode with the wagons not ahead of them or even with kaderes boxlike little white house on wheels but alongside the second wagon where the canvascovered shape of the doorframe terangreal made a hump above the rest of the load some of the load was wrapped carefully or packed in boxes or barrels that kadere had brought into the waste full of his goods and some was simply stuck in wherever it would fit odd shapes of metal and glass a red crystal chair two childsized statues of a nude man and woman rods of bone and ivory and strange black materials in varying lengths and thicknesses all sorts of things including some egwene could hardly begin to describe moiraine had used every inch of space in all of the wagons egwene wished that she knew why the aes sedai was so concerned with that particular wagon perhaps no one else had noticed that moiraine paid it more attention than all the others combined but she had not that she was likely to find out any time soon her newfound equality with moiraine was a tender thing as she had learned when she asked that question in the heart of the pass and was told that her imagination was too vivid and if she had time to spy on the aes sedai perhaps moiraine should speak to the wise ones about intensifying her training she had apologized profusely of course and the soft words seemed to have worked amys and the others were not taking any more of her nights than they had before a hundred or so taardad far dareis mai went trotting by on her side of the road moving easily veils hanging but ready to be donned full quivers at hips some carried their curved horn bows arrows nocked while others had their bows cased on their backs spears and bucklers swinging rhythmically as they ran at their rear a dozen gaishain in their white robes leading pack mules struggled to keep up one wore black not white isendre labored hardest of all egwene could pick adelin out and two or three others who had been guarding rands tent the night of the attack each clutched a doll in addition to her weapons a roughmade doll clothed in full skirts and white blouse they looked even more stonefaced than usual trying to pretend that they held no such thing she was not sure what that was about the maidens who stood that guard had come in a group to see bair and amys when their stint was done and had spent a long time with them the next morning while camp was still breaking in the grayness before dawn they had begun making those dolls she had not been able to ask of course but she had commented on it to one a redhaired tomanelle of the serai sept named maira and the woman said it was to remind her that she was not a child her tone made it clear that she did not want to talk one of the maidens carrying a doll was no more than sixteen yet maira was at least as old as adelin it made little sense and that was frustrating every time egwene thought she understood aiel ways something demonstrated that she did not despite herself her eyes were drawn back to the mouth of the pass the row of stakes was still there just visible stretching from steep mountain slope to steep mountain slope except where aiel had kicked some of them down couladin had left another message men and women impaled across their path standing there seven days dead the tall gray walls of selean clung to the hills at the right of the pass nothing showing above them moiraine said it had held only a shadow of its onetime glory yet it had still been a considerable town much larger than taien no more remained of it however no survivors either except whoever the shaido had carried off although here some had probably run for places they thought safe there had been farms on these hills most of eastern cairhien had been abandoned after the aiel war but a town needed farms for food now sootstreaked chimneys thrust up from blackened stone farmhouse walls here a few charred rafters remained above a stone barn there barn and farmhouse had collapsed from the heat the hill where she sat mists saddle had been sheep pasture near the fence at the foot of the hill flies still buzzed over the refuse of butchering not an animal remained in any pasture not a chicken scratching in a barnyard the crop fields were burned stubble couladin and the shaido were aiel but so were aviendha and bair and amys and melaine and rhuarc who said she reminded him of one of his daughters they had been disgusted at the impalements yet even they seemed to think it little more than the treekillers deserved perhaps the only way to truly know the aiel was to be born aiel casting a last glance at the destroyed town she rode slowly down to the rough stone fence and let herself out at the gate leaning down to refasten the rawhide thong out of habit the irony was that moiraine had said that selean might actually go over to couladin in the shifting currents of daes daemar in balancing an aiel invader against a man who had sent tairens into cairhien for whatever reason the decision could have tipped either way had couladin given them a chance to choose she rode along the broad road until she caught up with rand in his red coat today and joined aviendha and amys and thirty or more wise ones she barely knew besides the other two dreamwalkers all following at a short distance mat with his hat and his blackhafted spear and jasin natael leathercased harp slung on his back and crimson banner rippling in the breeze were riding but hurrying aiel passed the party by on both sides because rand led his dapple stallion talking with the clan chiefs skirts or no skirts the wise ones would have made a good job of keeping up with the passing columns if they were not sticking to rand like pine sap they barely glanced at egwene their eyes and ears focused on him and the six chiefs and whoever comes through after timolan rand was saying in a firm voice has to be told the same thing stone dogs left to watch at taien had returned to report the miagoma entering the pass a day behind ive come to stop couladin despoiling this land not to loot it a hard message bael said for us as well if you mean we cannot take the fifth han and the rest even rhuarc nodded the fifth i give you rand did not raise his voice yet suddenly his words were driven nails but no part of that is to be food we will live on what can be found wild or hunted or bought if there is anyone with food to sell until i can have the tairens increase what theyre bringing up from tear if any man takes a penny more than the fifth or a loaf of bread without payment if he burns so much as a hut because it belongs to a treekiller or kills a man who is not trying to kill him that man will i hang whoever he is dark to tell the clans this dhearic said almost as stony i came to follow he who comes with the dawn not to coddle oathbreakers bael and jheran opened their mouths as if to agree but each saw the other and snapped his teeth shut again mark what i said dhearic rand said i came to save this land not ruin it further what i say stands for every clan including the miagoma and any more who follow every clan you mark me well this time no one spoke and he swung back into jeadeens saddle letting the stallion walk on among the chiefs those aiel faces showed no expression egwene drew breath those men were all old enough to be his father and more leaders of their people as surely as kings for all they disclaimed it hardened leaders in battle it seemed only yesterday that he had been a boy in more than age a youth who asked and hoped rather than commanded and expected to be obeyed he was changing faster than she could keep up with now a good thing if he kept these men from doing to other cities what couladin had done to taien and selean she told herself that she only wished he could do it without showing more arrogance every day how soon before he expected her to obey him as moiraine did or all aes sedai she hoped it was only arrogance wanting to talk she kicked a foot free of its stirrup and held a hand down for aviendha but the aiel woman shook her head she really did not like to ride and maybe all those wise ones striding in a pack made her reluctant too some of them would not have ridden had both their legs been broken with a sigh egwene climbed down leading mist by the reins settling her skirts a little grumpily the soft kneehigh aiel boots she wore looked comfortable and were but not for walking very far on that hard uneven pavement he truly is in command she said aviendha barely shifted her eyes from rands back i do not know him i cannot know him look at the thing he carries she meant the sword of course rand did not precisely carry it it hung at the pommel of his saddle in a plain scabbard of brown boarhide the long hilt covered in the same leather rising as high as his waist he had had hilt and scabbard made by a man from taien on the journey through the pass egwene wondered why when he could channel a sword of fire and do other things that made swords seem toys you did give it to him aviendha her friend scowled he tries to make me accept the hilt too he used it it is his used it in front of me as if to mock me with a sword in his hand you are not angry about the sword she did not think aviendha was she had not said a word about it that night in rands tent you are still upset over how he spoke to you and i do understand i know he is sorry he sometimes speaks without thinking but if you would only let him apologize i do not want his apologies aviendha muttered i do not want i can bear this no more i cannot sleep in his tent any longer suddenly she took egwenes arm and if egwene had not known better she would have thought her on the brink of tears you must speak to them for me to amys and bair and melaine they will listen to you you are aes sedai they must let me return to their tents they must who must do what sorilea said dropping back from the others to walk alongside them the wise one of shende hold had thin white hair and a face like leather drawn tight over her skull and clear green eyes that could knock a horse down at ten paces that was the way she normally looked at anyone when sorilea was angry other wise ones sat quietly and clan chiefs made excuses to leave melaine and another wise one a graying black water nakai started to join them too until sorilea turned those eyes on them if you were not so busy thinking of that new husband melaine you would know amys wants to talk with you you also aerin melaine flushed bright red and scurried back to the others but the older woman got there first sorilea watched them go then put her full attention on aviendha now we can have a quiet talk so you do not want to do something something you were told to do of course and you think this child aes sedai can get you out of doing it sorilea i aviendha got no further in my day girls jumped when a wise one said jump and continued jumping until they were told to stop as i am still alive it is still my day need i make myself clearer aviendha took a deep breath no sorilea she said meekly the old womans eyes came to rest on egwene and you do you think you are going to beg her off no sorilea egwene felt as though she should curtsy good sonlea said not sounding satisfied just as if it was what she had expected it almost certainly was now i can speak to you of what i really want to know i hear the caracarn has given you an interest gift like no other ever heard of rubies and moonstones aviendha jumped as if a mouse had run up her leg well she probably would not but it was the way egwene would have jumped in that circumstance the aiel explained about lamans sword and the scabbard so hastily that her words tripped over one another sorilea shifted her shawl muttering about girls touching swords even wrapped in blankets and about having a sharp word with young bair so he has not captured your eye a pity it would bind him to us he sees too many people as his now for a moment she eyed aviendha up and down i will have feran look at you his greatfather is my sisterson you have other duties to the people than learning to be a wise one those hips were made for babes aviendha stumbled over an upraised paving stone and just caught herself short of falling i i will think on him when there is time she said breathlessly i have much to learn yet of being a wise one and feran is seia doon and the black eyes have vowed not to sleep beneath roof or tent until couladin is dead couladin was seia doon the leatheryfaced wise one nodded as though everything had been settled you young aes sedai you know the caracarn well it is said will he do as he has threatened hang even a clan chief i think maybe that he will more quickly egwene added but i am sure he can be brought to see reason she was not sure of any such thing or even that it was reason what he had said sounded only just but justice would do him no good if he found the others turning against him as well as the shaido sorilea glanced at her in surprise then turned a gaze on the chiefs around rands horse that should have knocked the lot of them flat you mistake me he must show that mangy pack of wolves that he is the chief wolf a chief must be harder than other men young aes sedai and the caracarn harder than other chiefs every day a few more men and even maidens are taken by the bleakness but they are the soft outer bark of the ironwood what remains is the hard inner core and he must be hard to lead them egwene noticed that she did not include herself or the other wise ones among those who would be led muttering to herself about mangy wolves sorilea strode ahead and soon had all the wise ones listening as they walked whatever she was saying it did not carry who is this feran egwene asked ive never heard you speak of him what does he look like frowning at sorileas back more than half hidden by the women clustered around her aviendha spoke absently he looks much like rhuarc only younger taller and more handsome with much redder hair for over a year he has been trying to attract enailas interest but i think she will teach him to sing before she gives up the spear i dont understand do you mean to share him with enaila it still felt odd speaking so casually of that aviendha stumbled again and stared at her share him i want no part of him his face is beautiful but he laughs like a braying mule and picks at his ears but from the way you talked to sorilea i thought you liked him why didnt you tell her what you just told me the other womans low laugh sounded pained egwene if she thought i was trying to balk in this she would make the bridal wreath herself and drag both feran and me by the neck to be wed have you ever seen anyone say no to sorilea could you egwene opened her mouth to say that of course she could and promptly closed it again making nynaeve step back was one thing and trying the same with sorilea quite another it would be like standing in the path of a landslide and telling it to stop to change the subject she said i will speak to amys and the others for you not that she really thought it would do much good now the right time had been before it began at least aviendha saw the impropriety of the situation finally perhaps if we go to them together i am sure they will listen no egwene i must obey the wise ones jietoh requires it just as if she had not been asking for intercession a moment earlier just as if she had not all but begged the wise ones not to make her sleep in rands tent but why is my duty to the people never what i wish why must it be what i would rather die before doing aviendha no one is going to make you marry or have babies not even sorilea egwene wished she had sounded a bit less limp on that last you do not understand the other woman said softly and i cannot explain it to you she gathered her shawl around her and would not speak of it further she was willing to discuss their lessons or whether couladin would turn and give battle or how marriage had affected melaine who seemed to have to work at being prickly now or anything at all except what it was that she could not or would not explain chapter rising sun a message sent the land changed as the sun began to sink the hills grew lower the thickets larger often the toppled stone fences of what had been fields had become mounds sprouting wild hedges or ran through long stands of oak and leatherleaf and hickory pine and paperbark and trees egwene did not know the few farmhouses had no roofs and trees ten or fifteen paces high grew in them here little woods enclosed inside the stone walls complete with twittering birds and blacktailed squirrels the occasional rivulet caused as much talk among the aiel as the small forests did and the grass they had heard tales of the wetlands read of them in books bought from merchants and peddlers like hadnan kadere but few had actually seen them since the hunt for laman they adapted quickly though the graybrown of the tents blended well with dead leaves under the trees and with the dying grass and weeds the camp spread over miles marked by thousands of small cookfires in the golden dusk egwene was more than happy to crawl into her tent once the gaishain had it up inside the lamps were lit and a small fire burned in the firepit unlacing her soft boots she tugged them off and her woolen stockings as well and sprawled on the bright layered rugs wriggling her toes she wished she had a basin of water to soak her feet she could not pretend to be as hardy as the aiel but she was growing soft if a few hours of walking made her feet feel twice their size of course water would be no problem here or it should not be she remembered that shrunken stream but surely she could even have a proper bath again cowinde meek and silent in her white robes brought her supper some of that pale flat bread made from zemai flour and in a redstriped bowl a thick stew that she ate mechanically though she felt more tired than hungry she recognized the dried peppers and beans but did not ask what the dark meat was rabbit she told herself firmly and hoped that it was the aiel ate things that would put more curl in her hair than elayne had she was willing to bet that rand could not even look at what he was eating men were always picky eaters once done with the stew she stretched out near an ornately worked silver lamp that had a polished silver disc to reflect and increase its light she had felt a little guilty once she realized that most of the aiel had no light at night but their fires few had brought lamps or oil except the wise ones and the chiefs of clans and septs but there was no point to sitting in the dim illumination of the firepit when she could have proper light that reminded her the nights here would not be so drastic a contrast with the days as in the waste the tent was already beginning to feel uncomfortably warm she channeled briefly flows of air to smother the fire and dug into her saddlebags for the worn leatherbound book that she had borrowed from aviendha it was a small fat volume with crowded lines of small print hard to read except in good light but easily portable the flame the blade and the heart it was called a collection of tales about birgitte and gaidal cain anselan and barashelle rogosh eagleeye and dunsinin and a dozen more aviendha claimed that she liked it for the adventures and battles and maybe she did but every last story told of the love of a man and a woman too egwene was willing to admit that that was what she liked the sometimes stormy sometimes tender threads of undying love to herself she would admit it anyway it was hardly the sort of enjoyment a woman with any pretensions to sense at all could confess publicly in truth she did not feel like reading any more than she had felt like eating all she really wanted to do was bathe and sleep and she might be willing to forgo bathing but tonight she and amys were to meet nynaeve in telaranrhiod it would not be night yet wherever nynaeve was on her way to ghealdan and that meant remaining awake elayne had made the menagerie sound quite exciting at their last meeting though egwene hardly thought that galads presence was reason enough to go haring off like that nynaeve and elayne had simply grown to like adventure in her opinion it was too bad about siuan they needed a firm hand to settle them down odd that she should think of nynaeve so nynaeve had always been the one with the firm hand but since that episode in the tower of telaranrhiod nynaeve had become less and less someone she had to struggle against guiltily she realized as she turned a page that she was looking forward to seeing nynaeve tonight not because nynaeve was a friend but because she wanted to see if the effects had lingered if nynaeve tugged at her braid she would arch a cool eyebrow at her and light i hope its held if she lets out about that jaunt amys and bair and melaine will take turns skinning me if they dont just tell me to go her eyes kept trying to drift shut as she read fuzzily halfdreaming the stories in the book she could be as strong as any of these women as strong and brave as dunsinin or nerein or melisinde or even birgitte as strong as aviendha would nynaeve have sense enough to hold her tongue in front of amys tonight she had a vague thought of taking nynaeve by the scruff of the neck and shaking her silly nynaeve was years the older arch an eyebrow at her dunsinin birgitte as hardy and strong as a maiden of the spear her head slipped down to the pages and she tried to cradle the small book under her cheek as her breathing slowed and deepened she gave a start at finding herself among the great redstone columns of the heart of the stone in the strange light of telaranrhiod and another at realizing that she wore the cadinsor amys would not be pleased to see her in that not amused at all hastily she changed it and was surprised when her clothes flickered back and forth between the algode blouse and bulky wool skirt and a fine gown of brocaded blue silk before finally settling on the aiel garb complete with her ivory bracelet of flames and her goldandivory necklace that indecision had not happened to her in some time for a moment she thought of stepping out of the world of dreams but she suspected she was soundly asleep back in her tent very likely she would only step into a dream of her own and she did not yet always have awareness in her dreams without that she could not return to telaranrhiod she was not about to leave amys and nynaeve alone together who knew what nynaeve would say if amys got her temper up when the wise one arrived she would simply say that she had just arrived herself the wise ones had always been a bit ahead of her or arrived at the same time before this but surely if amys believed she had only been there a second it would not matter she had almost grown accustomed to the feel of unseen eyes in this vast chamber only the columns and the shadows and all this empty space still she hoped that amys was not too long in coming nor nynaeve but they would be time could be as strange in telaranrhiod as in any dream but it had to be a good hour yet before the arranged meeting perhaps she had time to suddenly she realized that she could hear voices like faint whispers among the columns embracing saidar she moved cautiously toward the sound toward the place where rand had left callandor beneath the great dome the wise ones claimed that control of telaranrhiod was as strong as the one power here but she knew her abilities with the power far better and trusted them more still hidden well back among the thick redstone columns she stopped and stared it was not a pair of black sisters as she had feared and not nynaeve either instead elayne stood near the glittering shaft of callandor rising out of the floorstone deep in quiet conversation with as oddly dressed a woman as egwene had ever seen she wore a short white coat of peculiar cut and wide yellow trousers gathered in folds at her ankles above short boots with raised heels an intricate braid of golden hair hung down her back and she held a bow that gleamed like polished silver the arrows in the quiver shone too egwene squeezed her eyes shut first the difficulty with her dress and now this just because she had been reading about birgitte a silver bow told the name for certain was no reason to imagine that she saw her birgitte waited somewhere for the horn of valere to call her and the other heroes to the last battle but when egwene opened her eyes again elayne and the oddly dressed woman were still there she could not quite make out what they were saying but she believed her eyes this time she was on the point of going out to announce herself when a voice spoke behind her did you decide to come early alone egwene whirled to face amys her sundarkened face too youthful for her white hair and leatherycheeked bair both stood with their arms folded beneath their breasts even the way their shawls were pulled tight spoke of displeasure i fell asleep egwene said it was too much before time for her story to work even as she explained hastily about dozing off and why she had not gone back minus the part about not wanting nynaeve and amys to talk alone she was surprised to feel a tinge of shame that she had intended to lie and relief that she had not not that the truth would necessarily save her amys was not as strict as bair not quite but she was perfectly capable of setting her to piling up rocks the rest of the night many of the wise ones were great believers in useless labor for punishment you could not tell yourself you were doing anything other than being punished while you were burying ashes with a spoon that was provided they did not simply refuse to teach her any more of course the ashes would be much preferable she could not hold back a sigh of relief when amys nodded and said it can happen but next time return and dream your own dreams i could have heard what nynaeve has to say and tell her what we know if melaine was not with bael and dorindha tonight she would be here as well you frightened bair she is proud of your progress and if anything happened to you bair did not look proud if anything she scowled even more deeply as amys paused you are lucky cowinde found you when she returned to clear away your supper and was worried when she could not rouse you to move to your blankets if i thought you had been here more than a few minutes alone the glare sharpened in dire promise for a moment and then her voice turned grumpy now i suppose we have to wait for nynaeve to arrive just to stop you begging if we send you back if we must we must but we will use the time to advantage concentrate your mind on it isnt nynaeve egwene said hastily she did not want to know what a lesson would be like with bair in this mood it is elayne and she trailed off as she turned elayne in elegant green silk suitable for a ball was pacing up and down not far from callandor birgitte was nowhere to be seen i did not imagine her she is here already amys said moving to where she could see too another young fool bair muttered girls today have no more brains or discipline than goats she stalked out ahead of egwene and amys and planted herself across callandors glittering shape from elayne fists on hips you are not my pupil elayne of andor though youve wheedled enough out of us to keep you from killing yourself here if you are careful but if you were i would welt you from your toes up and send you back to your mother until you were grown enough to be let out of her sight which i think might take as many more years as you have lived already i know you have been coming into the world of dreams alone you and nynaeve you are both fools to do it elayne gave a start when they first appeared but as bairs tirade washed over her she drew herself up that chilly tilt to her chin her gown became red and took on a finer sheen and grew embroidery down the sleeves and across the high bodice including rearing lions in white and golden lilies her own sigil a thin golden diadem rested in her redgold curls a single rearing lion set in moonstones above her brows she did not yet have the best control over such things then again maybe she wore exactly what she intended this time i do thank you for your concern she said regally yet it is true that i am not your pupil bair of the haido shaarad i am grateful for your instruction but i must go my own way on the tasks given me by the amyrlin seat a dead woman bair said coldly you claim obedience to a dead woman egwene could all but feel bairs hackles standing erect in anger if she did not do something bair might decide to teach elayne a painful lesson the last thing they needed was that sort of squabble what why are you here instead of nynaeve she had been going to ask what elayne was doing there but that would have given bair an opening and maybe sounded as if she were on the wise ones side what she wanted to ask was what elayne had been doing talking to birgitte i did not imagine it maybe it had been someone dreaming she was birgitte but only those who entered telaranrhiod knowingly remained for more than minutes and elayne surely would not have been speaking with one of them where did birgitte and the others wait nynaeve is nursing a sore head the diadem vanished and elaynes gown became simpler with only a few golden scrolls around the bodice is she ill egwene asked anxiously only with a headache and a bruise or two elayne giggled and winced at the same time oh egwene you would not have believed it all four of the chavanas had come to have supper with us to flirt with nynaeve really they tried flirting with me the first few days but thom had a talk with them and they stopped he did not have any right to do that not that i wanted them to flirt you understand anyway there they were flirting with nynaeve or trying to because she paid them no more mind than buzzing flies when latelle stalked up and began hitting nynaeve with a stick calling her all sorts of terrible names was she hurt egwene was not sure which of them she meant if nynaeves temper was roused not her the chavanas tried to pull her off latelle and taeric will likely limp for days not to mention burghs swollen lip petra had to carry latelle to her wagon and i doubt shell put her nose out for some time elayne shook her head luca did not know who to blame one of his acrobats lamed and his bear trainer weeping on her bed so he blamed everybody and i thought nynaeve was going to box his ears as well at least she did not channel i thought she was going to once or twice until she had latelle down on the ground amys and bair exchanged unreadable glances this certainly was not how they expected aes sedai to behave egwene felt a little confused herself but it was mainly over keeping up with all these people she had only heard of briefly before odd people traveling with lions dogs and bears and an illuminator she did not believe this petra could possibly be as strong as elayne claimed but then thom was eating fire as well as juggling and what elayne and juilin were doing sounded as strange even if she was using the power if nynaeve had come close to channeling elayne must have seen the glow of her embracing saidar whether they had a real reason to be hiding or not they would not remain hidden long if one of them channeled and let people see it the towers eyesandears would certainly hear that sort of news traveled quickly especially if they were not out of amadicia yet you tell nynaeve from me that she had best hold her temper or ill have some words to say to her that she will not like elayne looked startled nynaeve had certainly not told her what had passed between them and egwene added if she channels you can be sure elaida will hear of it as soon as a pigeon can fly to tar valon she could not say more as it was it brought another exchange of glances between amys and bair what they really thought of a tower divided and an amyrlin who as far as they knew had given orders for aes sedai to be drugged they had never let on they could make moiraine look like the village gossip when they wished in fact i wish i had both of you alone if we were in the tower in our old rooms id say a few words to the pair of you elayne stiffened as queenly and cool as she had been with bair you may say them to me whenever you wish had she understood alone away from the wise ones in the tower egwene could only hope best to change the subject and hope the wise ones were not picking over her words as carefully as she hoped that elayne was will this fight with latelle cause problems what had nynaeve been thinking of back home she would have had any woman her age who did the same up before the womens circle so fast that her eyes would pop you must be almost to ghealdan by now three more days luca says if we are lucky the menagerie does not move very fast perhaps you should leave them now perhaps elayne said slowly i really would like to highwalk just once in front of with a shake of her head she glanced at callandor the neckline of her gown dipped precipitously then rose again i do not know egwene we could not travel much faster alone than we are traveling and we dont know where to go exactly yet that meant nynaeve had not remembered where the blues were gathering if elaidas report had been right not to mention that nynaeve might burst if we had to abandon the wagon and buy saddle horses or another coach besides we are both learning a great deal about the seanchan cerandin served as a sredit handler at the court of the nine moons where the seanchan empress sits yesterday she showed us things that she took when she fled falme egwene she had an adam egwene stepped forward her skirts brushing callandor rands traps were not physical whatever nynaeve seemed to think can you be sure she was not a suldam her voice trembled with anger i am certain elayne said soothingly i put the adam on her myself and it had no effect that was a little secret that the seanchan themselves did not know or hid well if they did their damane were women born with the spark women who would channel eventually even if untaught but the suldam who controlled the damane they were the women who needed to be taught the seanchan thought that women who could channel were dangerous animals who had to be controlled and yet unknowingly gave many of them honored positions i do not understand this interest in the seanchan amys said the name awkwardly she had never heard it until elayne spoke it at their last meeting what they do is terrible but they are gone rand althor defeated them and they fled egwene turned her back and stared at the huge polished columns running off into shadow gone is not to say they will never come back she did not want them to see her face not even elayne we must know whatever we can learn in case they ever return they had put an adam on her in falme they had meant to send her over the aryth ocean to seanchan to spend the rest of her life as a dog on a leash fury welled up in her every time she thought of them and fear too the fear that if they did return they would succeed in taking and holding her this time that was what she could not allow them to see the stark terror that she knew was in her eyes elayne put a hand on her arm we will be ready for them if they do come back she said gently they will not find us in surprise and ignorance again egwene patted her hand though she wanted to clutch it elayne understood more than egwene wished yet it was comforting that she did let us finish what we are here for bair said briskly you need to be asleep in truth egwene we had the gaishain undress you and put you in your blankets surprisingly amys sounded as gentle as elayne when you return to your body you can sleep until morning egwenes cheeks colored given aiel ways it was as likely as not that some of those gaishain had been men she would have to speak to them about that delicately of course they would not understand and it was not a thing she could be comfortable explaining the fear was gone she realized apparently im more afraid of being embarrassed than i am of the seanchan it was not true but she held to the thought there was really little to tell elayne that they were in cairhien finally that couladin had devastated selean and ravaged the surrounding land that the shaido were still days ahead and moving west the wise ones knew more than she they had not taken to their tents straightaway there had been skirmishes in the evening small ones and only a few with mounted men who quickly fled and other men on horses who had been sighted ran without fighting there had been no prisoners taken moiraine and lan seemed to think that the riders could have been bandits or supporters of one or another of the houses trying to claim the sun throne all had been equally ragged whoever they were word would soon spread that there were more aiel in cairhien they had to learn sooner or later was elaynes only comment egwene watched elayne as she and the wise ones faded away to her it seemed as though elayne and the heart of the stone became more and more attenuated but her goldenhaired friend gave no sign as to whether she had understood the message chapter dream ring dreams of galad instead of returning to her own body egwene floated in darkness she seemed to be darkness herself without substance whether her body lay up or down or sideways from her she did not know there was no direction here but she knew that it was near that she could step into it easily all around her in the blackness fireflies seemingly twinkled a vast horde fading away into unimaginable distance those were dreams dreams of the aiel in the camp dreams of men and women across cairhien across the world all glittering there she could pick out some among the nearer and name the dreamer now in one way those sparkles were just as alike as fireflies that was what had given her so much trouble in the beginning but in another somehow they now seemed as individual as faces rands dreams and moiraines appeared muted dimmed by the wards they had woven amys and bairs were bright and regular in their pulsing they had taken their own advice apparently had she not seen those she would have been into her body in an instant those two could rove this darkness much more ably than she she would not have known they were there until they pounced on her if she ever learned to recognize elayne and nynaeve in the same way she would be able to find them in that great constellation wherever they were in the world but tonight she did not mean to observe anyones dream carefully she formed a wellremembered image in her mind and she was back in telaranrhiod inside the small windowless room in the tower where she had lived as a novice a narrow bed was built against one whitepainted wall a washstand and a threelegged stool stood opposite the door and the current occupants dresses and shifts of white wool hung with a white cloak on pegs there could as easily have been none the tower had not been able to fill the novices quarters in many years the floor was almost as pale as walls and clothes every day the novice who lived there would scrub that floor on hands and knees egwene had done so herself and elayne in the next room if a queen came to train in the tower she would start in a room like this scrubbing the floor the garments were arranged differently when she glanced at them again but she ignored that ready to embrace saidar in a heartbeat she opened the door just enough to stick her head out and drew a relieved breath when she found elaynes head coming just as slowly out of the next doorway egwene hoped she did not appear as wideeyed and uncertain she motioned hurriedly and elayne scurried across in novice white that became a pale gray silk riding dress as she darted inside egwene hated gray dresses that was what damane wore for an instant more she stayed there scanning the railed galleries of the novices quarters layer on layer they rose and fell as many levels to the novices court below not that she really expected liandrin or worse to be out there but it never hurt to be careful i thought this was what you meant elayne said as she shut the door do you have any idea how difficult it is to remember what i can say in front of whom sometimes i wish we could just tell the wise ones everything let them know we are only accepted and be done with it you would be done with it egwene said firmly i happen to be sleeping not twenty paces from them elayne shivered that bair she reminds me of lini when id broken something i was not supposed to touch you wait until i introduce you to sorilea elayne gave her a doubtful look but then egwene was not sure that she would have believed sorilea herself until she met her there was no way to do this easily she shifted her shawl tell me about meeting birgitte it was birgitte wasnt it elayne staggered as if hit in the stomach her blue eyes closed for a moment and she took a breath that must have filled her to the toes i cannot talk to you about that what do you mean you cant talk you have a tongue was it birgitte i cannot egwene you must believe me i would if i could but i cannot perhaps i can ask if elayne had been the kind of woman to wring her hands she would have been doing it then her mouth opened and closed without any words coming out her eyes darted around the room as if seeking inspiration or aid taking a deep breath she fixed an urgent blue gaze on egwene anything i say violates confidences i promised to hold even that please egwene you must trust me and you must not tell anyone what you think you saw egwene forced the stern frown from her face i will trust you at least she knew now for a fact that she had not been seeing things birgitte light i hope that one day you will trust me enough to tell me i do trust you but shaking her head elayne sat down on the edge of the neatly made bed we keep secrets too often egwene but sometimes there is a reason after a moment egwene nodded and sat next to her when you can was all she said but her friend gave her a relieved hug i told myself i was not going to ask this egwene just once i was not going to have my head full of him the gray riding dress became a shimmering green gown elayne could not possibly have been aware of how deeply the neckline swooped but is rand well he is alive and unharmed if that is what you mean i thought he was hard in tear but today i heard him threaten to hang men if they go against his commands not that they are bad orders he wont let anyone take food without paying or murder people but still they were the first to hail him as he who comes with the dawn they followed him out of the waste without hesitation and he threatened them as hard as cold steel not a threat egwene he is a king whatever you or he or anyone else says and a king or queen must dispense justice without fear of enemies or favor for friends anyone who does that has to be hard mother can make the city walls seem soft sometimes he doesnt have to be so arrogant about it egwene said levelly nynaeve said i should remind him hes only a man but ive not figured out how yet he does have to remember he is only a man but he has a right to expect to be obeyed there was something of a haughty tone to elaynes voice until she glanced down at herself then her face went crimson and the green gown suddenly had a lace neck under her chin are you sure you are not mistaking that for arrogance she finished in a strangled voice hes as overweening as a pig in a pea field egwene shifted herself on the bed she remembered it as hard but the thin mattress felt softer than what she slept on in the tent she did not want to talk about rand are you certain this fight will not cause more trouble a feud with this latelle could not make their traveling easier i do not think so latelles grievance against nynaeve was that all the unattached men were no longer hers to pick and choose from some women do think that way i suppose aludra keeps to herself and cerandin wouldnt have said boo to a goose until i started teaching her to stand up for herself and clarine is married to petra but nynaeve has made it clear that shell box the ears of any man who even thinks he can flirt with her and she apologized to latelle so i hope that may settle it she apologized the other woman nodded her face as bemused as egwene knew her own must be i thought she would thump luca when he told her she must he doesnt seem to think her injunction holds to him by the way but she did it after grumping about for an hour muttering about you actually she hesitated giving egwene a sidelong look did you say something to her at your last meeting she has been different since then and sometimes she talks to herself argues really about you from the little ive heard i said nothing that did not have to be said so it was holding whatever it was that had happened between them either that or nynaeve was storing up her anger for the next time they met she was not going to put up with the womans temper anymore not now that she knew she did not have to you tell her from me that she is too old to be rolling about on the ground fighting if she gets into another ill have worse to say to her you tell her that exactly it will be worse let nynaeve chew on that until next time either she would be mild as a lamb or else egwene would just have to carry through on her threat nynaeve might be stronger in the power when she could channel but here egwene was one way or another she was finished with nynaeves tantrumsi will tell her elayne said you have changed too there seems to be something of rands attitude about you it took egwene a moment to realize what she meant helped by that amused little smile dont be silly elayne laughed aloud and gave her another hug oh egwene you will be amyrlin seat one day when i am queen of andor if there is a tower then egwene said soberly and elaynes laughter faded elaida cannot destroy the white tower egwene whatever she does the tower will remain perhaps she will not stay amyrlin once nynaeve remembers the name of that town i will wager that we find a tower in exile with every ajah but the red i hope so egwene knew she sounded sad she wanted aes sedai to support rand and oppose elaida but that meant the white tower broken for sure maybe never to be made whole again i must get back elayne said nynaeve insists that whichever of us does not enter telaranrhiod remain awake and with her headache she needs to drink one of her herb teas and sleep i do not know why she is so insistent whoever is watching can do nothing to help and we both know enough to be perfectly safe here now her green dress flickered to birgittes white coat and voluminous yellow trousers for an instant then snapped back she said i wasnt to tell you this but she thinks that moghedien is trying to find us her and me egwene did not ask the obvious question clearly it was something that birgitte had told them why did elayne persist in trying to keep that secret because she promised to elayne never broke a promise in her life you tell her to be careful small chance that nynaeve was sitting and waiting if she thought one of the forsaken was after her she would be remembering that she had defeated the woman once and she had always had more courage than sense the forsaken are nothing to take lightly and neither are seanchan even if they are supposedly just animal trainers you tell her that i do not suppose you would listen if i told you to be careful too she gave elayne a startled look i am always careful you know that of course the last thing egwene saw as the other woman faded away was a very amused smile egwene herself did not go if nynaeve could not remember where that gathering of blues was perhaps she could discover it here it was hardly a new idea this was not her first trip to the tower since her last meeting with nynaeve she put on a copy of enailas face with flamecolored hair to her shoulders and an accepteds dress with its banded hem then formed the image of elaidas ornately furnished study it was as it had been before though on every visit fewer of the vinecarved stools stood in that arc in front of the wide writing table the paintings still hung above the fireplace egwene strode straight to the table pushing aside that thronelike chair with its inlaid ivory flame of tar valon so she could reach the lacquered letterbox lifting the lid all fighting hawks and clouds she began scanning parchments as fast as she could even so some melted away halfread or changed there was no way to tell what was important and what insignificant beforehand most seemed reports of failure still no word of where the lord of bashere had taken his army and a note of frustration and worry tingeing the words that name tickled the back of her mind but with no time to waste she pushed it firmly away and snatched up another sheet no word on rands whereabouts either said a cringing report filled with near panic that was good to know and worth the trip by itself more than a month had passed since the last news from tanchico by any ajahs eyesandears and others in tarabon had also gone silent the writer blamed the anarchy there rumors that someone had taken tanchico could not be confirmed but the writer suggested that rand himself was involved even better if elaida was looking in the wrong place by a thousand leagues a confused report said that a red sister in caemlyn claimed to have seen morgase at a public audience but various ajahs agents in caemlyn said the queen had been in seclusion for days fighting in the borderlands possibly minor rebellions in shienar and arafel the parchment was gone before she reached the reason pedron niall calling in whitecloaks to amadicia possibly to move against altara a good thing that elayne and nynaeve had only another three days there the next parchment was about elayne and nynaeve first the writer advised against punishing the agent who had allowed them to escape elaida had scratched that out in bold strokes and written make an example in the margin and then just when the woman began to detail the search for the pair in amadicia the single sheet became a fistful a sheaf of what seemed to be builders and masons estimates for constructing a private residence for the amyrlin seat on the tower grounds more like a palace by the number of pages she let the pages fall and they vanished before they finished scattering across the tabletop the lacquered box was closed again she could spend the rest of her life here she knew there would always be more documents in the box and they would always be changing the more ephemeral something was in the waking world a letter a piece of clothing a bowl that might be frequently moved the less firm its reflection in telaranrhiod she could not remain here too long sleep while in the world of dreams was not as restful as sleep undisturbed hurrying out to the antechamber she was about to reach for the neat piles of scrolls and parchments some with seals on the keepers writing table when the room seemed to flicker before she had time to even consider what that meant the door opened and galad stepped in smiling his brocaded blue coat fitting his shoulders perfectly snug breeches showing the shape of his calves she took a deep breath her stomach fluttering it just was not fair for a man to have a face so beautiful he stepped closer dark eyes twinkling and brushed her cheek with his fingers will you walk with me in the water garden he said softly if you two wish to canoodle a brisk womans voice said you will not do so here egwene spun wideeyed staring at leane seated behind the table with the keepers stole on her shoulders and a fond smile on her coppercheeked face the door to the amyrlins study was open and inside siuan stood beside her simple wellpolished writing table reading a long parchment the striped stole of office on her shoulders this was madness she fled without thinking of what image she was forming and found herself gulping for breath on the green in emonds field with the thatchroofed houses all around and the winespring gushing from the stone outcrop on the broad expanse of grass near the swift rapidly widening stream stood her fathers small inn its lower floor stone the overhanging upper whitewashed the only roof like it in the two rivers bran alvere had often said of his red tiles the large stone foundation near the winespring inn a huge spreading oak rising from its center was far older than the inn but some said an inn of some sort had stood there beside the winespring water for more than two thousand years fool after warning nynaeve so firmly about dreams in telaranrhiod she had nearly let herself be caught in one of her own though it was odd that it had been galad she did dream of him sometimes her face heated she certainly did not love him or even like him very much but he was beautiful and in those dreams he had been much more what she could have wished him it was his brother gawyn that she dreamed of more often but that was just as silly whatever elayne said he had never made any feelings known to her it was that fool book with all those tales of lovers as soon as she woke in the morning she was going to give the thing back to aviendha and tell her that she did not think that she read it for the adventures at all she was reluctant to leave though home emonds field the last place that she had really felt safe more than a year and a half had passed since she last saw it yet everything seemed as she remembered not quite everything on the green stood two tall poles with large banners one a red eagle the other an equally red wolfs head had perrin anything to do with those she could not imagine how yet he had come home so rand said and she had dreamed of him with wolves more than once enough idle standing about it was time to flicker her mother stepped out of the inn graying braid pulled over one shoulder mann alvere was a slim woman still handsome and the best cook in the two rivers egwene could hear her father laughing inside the common room where he was meeting with the rest of the village council are you still out here child her mother said gently chiding and amused youve certainly been married long enough to know you shouldnt let your husband know you mope about waiting on him with a shake of her head she laughed too late here he comes egwene turned eagerly eyes darting past the children playing on the green the timbers of the low wagon bridge thrummed as gawyn galloped across and swung down from his saddle in front of her tall and straight in his goldembroidered red coat he had his sisters redgold curls and marvelous deep blue eyes he was not so handsome as his halfbrother of course but her heart beat faster for him than it had for galad for galad what and she had to press her hands to her stomach in a vain attempt to still gigantic butterflies did you miss me he said smiling a little why did i think of galad as if id just seen him a moment ago now and then when there was nothing interesting to occupy my time did you miss me for answer he pulled her off her feet and kissed her she was not aware of very much else until he set her back down on unsteady legs the banners were gone what banners here he is her mother said approaching with a babe wrapped in swaddling heres your son he is a fine boy he never cries at all gawyn laughed as he took the child held him aloft he does have your eyes egwene he will be a fine one with the girls one day egwene backed away from them shaking her head there had been banners red eagle and red wolfs head she had seen galad in the tower n she fled leaping from telaranrhiod to her own body awareness remained only long enough for her to wonder how she could possibly have been fool enough to let her own fancies nearly trap her and then she was deep in her own safe dream gawyn galloped across the wagon bridge swinging down stepping out from behind a thatchroofed house moghedien wondered idly where this little village was not the sort of place she would expect to see banners flying the girl had been stronger than she had thought to escape her weaving of telaranrhiod even lanfear could not improve on her abilities here whatever she claimed still the girl had just been of interest because she was speaking to elayne trakand who might lead her to nynaeve almeara the only reason to trap her had simply been to rid telaranrhiod of one who could walk it freely it was bad enough that she must share it with lanfear but nynaeve almeara that woman she meant to make beg to be bound in her service she would take her in the flesh perhaps ask the great lord to grant her immortality so nynaeve could have forever to regret opposing moghedien she and elayne were scheming with birgitte were they that was another she had reason to punish birgitte had not even known who moghedien was so long ago in the age of legends when she foiled moghediens finely wrought plan to lay lews therin by his heels but moghedien had known her only birgitte teadra she had been then had died before she could deal with her death was no punishment no end not when it meant living on here nynaeve almeara elayne trakand and birgitte those three she would find and deal with from the shadows so that they would not know until too late all three without exception she vanished and the banners waved on in the breeze of telaranrhiod chapter serpent and wheel sallie daera the halo of greatness blue and gold flickered fitfully around logains head though he rode slumped in his saddle min did not understand why it had appeared more often of late he no longer even bothered to lift his eyes from the weeds in front of his black stallion to the low wooded hills rolling by all around them the other two women rode together a little ahead siuan as awkward on shaggy bela as she had ever been leane guiding her gray mare deftly with knees more than reins only an unnaturally straight ribbon of ferns poking through the leafcovered forest floor hinted that there had ever been a road here the lacy ferns were withering and the leaf mold rustled and crackled dryly under the horses hooves thickly woven branches gave a little shelter from the noonday sun but it was hardly cool sweat rolled down mins face despite an occasional breeze that stirred from behind them fifteen days now they had ridden west and south from lugard guided only by siuans insistence that she knew exactly where they were heading not that she shared her destination of course siuan and leane were as closemouthed as sprung bear traps min was not even sure that leane actually knew fifteen days while towns and villages grew fewer and farther between until finally there were none day by day logains shoulders had sagged a little more and day by day the halo appeared more often at first he had only begun muttering that they were chasing jak o the mists but siuan had regained her leadership without opposition as he turned more and more inward for the past six days he had not seemed to have the energy to care where they were going or whether they would ever get there siuan and leane talked quietly up ahead now all min could hear was a barely audible murmur that might as well have been the wind in the leaves and if she tried to ride closer they would tell her to keep an eye on logain or simply stare at her until only a stoneblind fool could keep her nose where it did not belong they had done both often enough from time to time though leane twisted in her saddle to look at logain finally leane let moonflower fall back beside his black stallion the heat did not seem to be bothering her not so much as a sheen of perspiration marred her coppery face min reined wildrose aside to give her room it wont be long now leane told him in a sultry voice he did not look up from the weeds in front of his horse she leaned closer holding his arm for balance pressing against it really a little while longer dalyn you will have your revenge his eyes stayed dully on the road a dead man would pay more notice min said and meant it she had been taking notes in her head of everything leane did and talking with her of an evening though trying not to let on why she would never be able to behave the way that leane did not unless i had enough wine in me that i couldnt think at all yet a few pointers might come in handy maybe if you kissed him leane shot her a glare that could have frozen a rushing stream but min merely looked back she had never had the problems with leane that she did with siuan well not as many anyway and the few difficulties had grown less since the other woman had left the tower much fewer since they had begun discussing men how could you be intimidated by a woman who had told you in dead seriousness that there were one hundred and seven different kisses and ninetythree ways to touch a mans face with your hand leane actually seemed to believe these things min had not meant it as a jibe really the suggestion of a kiss leane had been cooing at him giving him smiles that should have made steam rise from his ears since the day he had had to be hauled out of his blankets instead of rising first to chivvy the rest of them min did not know whether leane actually felt something for the man though she did find it hard to credit even the possibility or was just trying to keep him from giving up and dying to keep him alive for whatever siuan had planned leane certainly had not given up flirting with others besides him she and siuan had apparently worked out that siuan would deal with women leane with men and so it had been ever since lugard her smiles and glances had twice gotten them rooms where the innkeeper had said there were none lowered the bill at those and three more and on two nights earned barns instead of bushes for sleeping they had also gotten the four of them chased off by one farmwife with a pitchfork and a breakfast of cold porridge thrown at them by another but leane had thought the incidents funny if no one else did the last few days however logain had stopped reacting like every other man who saw her for more than two minutes he had stopped reacting to her or anything else siuan pulled bela back stiffly elbows out and managing to look on the point of falling off any moment the heat was not touching her either have you viewed him today she hardly glanced at logain it is still the same min said patiently siuan refused to understand or believe however many times she told her and so did leane it would not have mattered if she had not seen the aura since her first viewing of it in tar valon had logain been lying in the road rasping his death tattle she would have wagered all she had and more on a miraculous recovery somehow the appearance of an aes sedai to heal him something what she saw was always true it always happened she knew the same way that she had known the first time she saw rand althor that she would fall desperately helplessly in love with him the same way she had known she would have to share him with two other women logain was destined for glory such as few men had dreamed of dont you take that tone with me siuan said that blueeyed gaze sharpening it is bad enough we have to spoonfeed this great hairy carp to make him eat without you going sulky as a fisherbird in winter i may have to put up with him girl but if you start giving me trouble too you will regret it in short order do make myself clear yes mara at least you could have put a touch of sarcasm in it she thought scornfully you dont have to be meek as a goose youve told leane off to her face the domani woman had suggested that she practice what they had been discussing on a farrier in the last village a tall handsome man with stronglooking hands and a slow smile but still i will try not to be sulky the worst part was that she realized she had tried to sound sincere siuan had that effect min could not even begin to imagine siuan discussing how to smile at a man siuan would look a man in the eye tell him what to do and expect to see it done promptly just the way she did with everyone else if she did anything else as she had with logain it would only be because the point did not matter enough to press it is not much farther is it leane said briskly she saved the other voice for men i do not like the look of him and if we have to stop for another night well if he helps any less than he did this morning i dont know that we will be able to get him into his saddle again not much if those last directions i had are right siuan sounded irritated she had asked questions at that last village two days ago not letting min hear of course logain had showed no interest and she did not like to be reminded of them min could not understand why siuan could hardly expect elaida to be behind them she herself hoped it was not much farther it was hard to be sure how far south they had drifted since leaving the highway to jehannah most villagers had only vague notions of where their village actually was in relation to anything except the nearest towns but when they crossed the manetherendrelle into altara just before siuan took them away from the welltraveled road the grizzled old ferryman had been studying a tattered map for some reason a map that stretched as far as the mountains of mist unless her estimate was off they were going to reach another wide river in not many miles either the boern which meant they were already into ghealdan where the prophet and his mobs were or else the eldar with amadicia and whitecloaks on the far side she was betting on ghealdan prophet or no prophet and even that was a surprise if they really were close only a fool would think to find a gathering of aes sedai any nearer to amadicia than they had to be and siuan was anything but that whether they were in ghealdan or altara amadicia had to be not many miles distant gentling would have to catch up to him now siuan muttered if he can only hang on a few more days min kept her mouth shut if the woman would not listen there was no use in speaking shaking her head siuan heeled bela back into the lead gripping her reins as though expecting the stout mare to bolt and leane returned to silkenvoiced cajoling of logain maybe she did have feelings for him it would be no odder a choice than mins own forested hills slid on by with never a sign of change all trees and tangles of weeds and brambles the ferns that marked the old road ran on arrowstraight leane had said the soil was different where the road had been as if min should have known that squirrels with tufted ears sometimes chattered at them from a branch and occasionally birds called which birds min could not begin to guess baerlon might not be a city when compared to caemlyn or illian or tear but she thought of herself as a city woman a bird was a bird and she did not care what kind of dirt a fern grew in her doubts began to surface again they had oozed up more than once after kore springs but back then it had been easier to push them down since lugard they had bubbled to the top more often and she found herself considering siuan in ways she would never have dared once not that she had the nerve to actually confront siuan with any of them of course it galled her to admit that even to herself but maybe siuan did not know where she was going she could lie since stilling broke her away from the three oaths maybe she was still just hoping that if she continued searching she would find some trace of what she needed desperately to find in a small way a peculiar way surely leane had begun making a life for herself apart from concerns of power and the power and rand not that she had abandoned them entirely but min did not think there was anything else for siuan the white tower and the dragon reborn were the whole of her life and she would hold to them even if she had to lie to herself woodland gave way to a large village so quickly that min stared sweetgum and oak and scrubby pine those were trees she could recognize running to within fifty paces of thatchroofed houses made of rounded river stones and clinging to low hills she was willing to wager that not so long ago the forest had grown right through a good many trees actually stood in narrow little thickets among some of the houses crowding against the walls and here and there unweathered stumps stood close by the front of a house the streets still had a look of newturned earth not the hardpacked surface that came from generations of feet men in their shirtsleeves were up laying new thatch atop three large stone cubes that had to have been inns one actually had the remains of a faded weathered sign dangling above the door yet no old thatch lay anywhere that she could see there were far too many women out and about for the number of men in sight and far too few children playing for the number of women the smells of midday cooking in the air were the only normal things about the place if the first glimpse startled min when she really saw what lay in front of her she nearly fell out of her saddle the younger women shaking blankets from a window or hurrying on some errand wore plain woolen dresses but no village of any size had ever contained so many women in riding dresses of silk or fine wool in every color and cut around those women and around most of the men auras and images floated before her eyes changing and flickering most people rarely had anything for her viewing but aes sedai and warders seldom lacked an aura for as much as an hour the children must have belonged to tower servants aes sedai who married were few and far between but knowing them they would have made every effort to bring their servants with their families out of any place they felt that they must flee themselves siuan had found her gathering there was an eerie stillness as they rode into the village no one spoke aes sedai stood without moving watching them and so did younger women and girls who must be accepted or even novices men who a moment before had been moving with wolfish grace were frozen one hand hidden in thatch or reaching into a doorway doubtless where weapons were hidden the children vanished hurriedly herded away by the adults who had to be servants under all those unwinking stares the hair on the back of mins neck tried to stand up leane appeared uneasy casting sidelong glances at the people they rode past but siuan stayed smoothfaced and calm as she led the way straight to the largest inn the one with the unreadable sign and scrambled down to tie bela to the iron ring of one of the stone hitching posts that appeared to have been only recently set upright helping leane help logain to the ground siuan never offered a hand in getting him up or down min found her eyes darting around everyone staring no one moving i never expected to be greeted like a longlost daughter she murmured to the other woman but why isnt anyone at least saying hello before leane could answer if she meant to siuan said well dont stop pulling oar with the shore in reach bring him on in she disappeared inside while min and leane were still guiding logain to the door he went easily but when they ceased to urge him he took only one step before stopping the common room looked like none min had ever seen before the wide fireplaces were cold of course and had gaps where stones had fallen out the plaster ceiling looked rotten with holes in it as big as her head where the lathing showed mismatched tables of every size and shape stood about on an ageroughened floor that several girls were sweeping women with ageless faces sat examining parchments giving orders to warders a few of whom wore their colorshifting cloaks or to other women some of whom had to be accepted or novices others were too old for that perhaps half of them graying and clearly showing their years and there were men who were not warders too most either darting off as though carrying messages or else fetching parchments or cups of wine to the aes sedai the bustle had a satisfying air of something being done auras and images danced around the room wreathing heads so many that she had to try to ignore them before they overwhelmed her it was not easy but it was a trick she had had to learn when around more than a handful of aes sedai at once four aes sedai glided forward to meet the newcomers all grace and cool serenity in their divided skirts for min seeing their familiar features was like reaching home after being lost sheriams tilted green eyes fixed immediately on mins face rays of silver and blue flashed about her fiery hair and a soft golden light min could not say what it meant slightly plump in her dark blue silk at the moment she was sternness itself i would be happier to see you child if i knew how you discovered our presence here and if i had some inkling of why you conceived the crackbrained idea of bringing him half a dozen warders had drifted near hands resting on swords eyes sharp on logain he did not seem to see them at all min gaped why were they asking her my crackbr she had no chance to say more it would be far better palecheeked carlinya cut in icily if he had died as the rumors say it was not the ice of anger but of cold reason she was white ajah her ivorycolored dress looked as if it had had hard wear for an instant min saw an image of a raven floating beside her dark hair more a drawing of the bird than the bird itself she thought it was a tattoo but she did not know its meaning she concentrated on faces tried not to see anything else he looks nearly dead in any event carlinya continued hardly taking breath whatever you thought you have wasted your effort but i too would like to know how you came to salidar siuan and leane stood there exchanging smugly amused glances while the onslaught went on no one even looked at them myrelle darkly beautiful in green silk embroidered on the bodice with slanting lines of gold her face a perfect oval usually wore a knowing smile that at times could rival leanes new tricks she was not smiling now as she jumped in right behind the white sister speak up min dont stand there gaping like a dolt she was noted for her fiery temper even among the greens you must tell us anaiya added in a more kindly voice exasperation tinged it though a bluntfeatured woman and motherly despite aes sedai smoothness to her face at the moment stroking her pale gray skirts she looked like a mother who was trying not to reach for a switch we will find a place for you and these other two girls but you must tell us how you came here min shook herself and closed her mouth of course these other two girls she had grown so used to them as they were that she no longer thought of how much they had changed she doubted whether any of these women had seen either since they were hauled off to the dungeons beneath the white tower leane looked ready to laugh and siuan all but shook her head in disgust at the aes sedai i am not the one you want to talk to min told sheriam let these other two girls have those stares on them for a change ask siuan or leane they stared at her as if she were mad until she nodded to her two companions four sets of aes sedai eyes shifted to the others but there was no instant recognition they studied and frowned and passed glances between them none of the warders took their eyes from logain or their hands from their swords stilling might produce this effect myrelle murmured finally i have read accounts that imply as much the faces are close in many ways sheriam said slowly someone could have found women who look much like them but why siuan and leane did not look smug any longer we are who we are leane said crisply question us no impostor could know what we know siuan did not wait for questions my face may be changed yet at least i know what i am doing and why that is more than i can say for you ill wager min groaned at her steely tone but myrelle nodded saying that is siuan sanches voice it is she voices can be trained carlinya said still coolly calm but how far can memories be taught anaiya frowned sternly siuan if that is who you are on your twentysecond nameday we had an argument you and i where did it occur and what was the outcome siuan smiled confidently at the motherly woman during your lecture to the accepted on why so many of the nations carved out of artur hawkwings empire after his death failed to survive i still disagree with you on some points by the way the outcome was that i spent two months working three hours a day in the kitchens in the hope that the heat will overpower and diminish your ardor i think you said if she had thought that one answer would be sufficient she was wrong anaiya had more questions for both women and so did carlinya and sheriam who apparently had been novices and accepted with the pair they were all about the sort of thing no impostor would be able to learn scrapes gotten into pranks successful and not opinions generally held of various aes sedai teachers min could not believe that the women who would become the amyrlin seat and the keeper of the chronicles could have dropped themselves into the soup so often but she had the impression that this was only the tip of a buried mountain and it appeared that sheriam herself might not have been far behind them myrelle the youngest by years confined herself to amused comments until siuan said something about a trout put into saroiya sedais bath and a novice taught to mind her ways for half a year not that siuan had much room to talk of anyone minding her ways washing a disliked accepteds shifts with itchweed when she was a novice sneaking out of the tower to go fishing even accepted needed permission to leave the tower grounds except during certain hours siuan and leane together had even chilled a bucket of water to near freezing and set it so it would douse an aes sedai who had had them switched unfairly as they saw it from the glint in anaiyas eyes it was a good thing for them that they had not been found out that time from what min knew of novice training and accepted for that matter these women were lucky that they had been allowed to remain long enough to become aes sedai much less that they still had whole hides i am satisfied the motherly woman said at last glancing at the others myrelle nodded after sheriam did but carlinya said there is still the question of what to do with her she stared right at siuan unblinking and the others suddenly seemed uneasy myrelle pursed her lips and anaiya studied the floor smoothing her dress sheriam seemed to avoid looking at the newcomers at all we still know everything we knew before leane told them her sudden frown at least halfworry we can be of use siuan was darkfaced leane had seemed amused if anything at her recounted girlhood misdeeds and penalties but siuan had not liked the telling one bit yet in contrast to her nearglare her voice was only a little tight you wanted to know how we found you i made contact with one of my agents who also works for the blue and she told me of sallie daera min did not understand that about sallie daera at all who was she but sheriam and the others nodded at one another siuan had done something other than tell them how min realized she had let them know that she still had access to the eyesandears who had served her as amyrlin you sit over there min sheriam told min pointing to the one table not in use in a corner or are you still elmindreda and keep logain with you she and the other three gathered siuan and leane herding them toward the back of the common room two more women in riding dresses joined them before they vanished through a newmade door of uncured boards sighing min took logains arm and led him to the table sat him down on a rough bench and took a shaky ladderback chair herself two of the warders positioned themselves nearby leaning against the wall they did not appear to be watching logain but min knew the gaidin they saw everything and they could have their swords out in less than a heartbeat while sleeping so there were to be no open arms in welcome even with siuan and leane recognized well what did she expect siuan and leane had been the two most powerful women in the white tower now they were not even aes sedai the others very likely did not know how to behave toward them and appearing with a gentled false dragon siuan had better not be lying or wishing about having a plan for him min did not think sheriam and the others would be as patient as logain had been and sheriam at least had recognized her she stood again long enough to peer through a crackpaned window into the street their horses were still at the hitching posts but one of those warders who were not watching would have her before she had wildroses reins untied this last time in the tower siuan had gone to great lengths to disguise her to no end it seemed she did not think any of them knew about her viewings though siuan and leane had held that tightly to themselves min would be just as glad if it remained that way if these aes sedai learned of it they would entangle her just as siuan had and she would never reach rand she was not going to be able to show off what she had learned from leane if they kept her on a leash here helping siuan find this gathering helping bring aes sedai to rands aiel was all very well and important but she still had a personal goal making a man who had never looked at her twice fall in love with her before he went mad maybe she was as mad as he was fated to be then well make a matched pair she muttered to herself a freckled greeneyed girl who had to be a novice stopped at her table would you like something to eat or drink there is venison stew and wild pears there might be some cheese too she put so much effort into not looking at logain that she might as well have stared popeyed pears and cheese sound very good min told her the last two days had been hungry siuan had managed to catch some fish in a stream but logain had done all the hunting when they had not eaten at an inn or a farm dried beans did not make a meal in her opinion and some wine if you have it but first i would like some information where are we if it isnt a secret here too this village is called salidar in altara the eldar is about a mile to the west amadicia is on the other side the girl put on a poor imitation of aes sedai mystery where better to hide aes sedai than where they would never be looked for we should not have to hide a dark curlyhaired young woman snapped stopping min recognized her an accepted named faolain she would have expected her to be in the tower still faolain had never liked anyone or anything as far as min knew and had often spoken of choosing the red ajah when she was raised a perfect follower for elaida why did you come here with him why did she come there was no doubt in mins mind who she meant it is her fault we have to hide i did not believe she helped mazrim taim escape but if she appears here with him maybe she did that will be enough faolain a slender woman with black hair spilling down her back to her waist told the roundfaced accepted min thought she knew the woman in the dark golden silk riding dress edesina a yellow she believed go about your duties edesina said and if you mean to bring food tabiya do it edesina did not watch faolains sullen curtsy the novice gave a better and scurried away but put a hand on logains head instead eyes on the table he did not seem to notice to mins eyes a silvery collar suddenly appeared snug around the womans neck and as suddenly seemed to shatter min shivered she did not like viewings connected to the seanchan at least edesina would escape somehow even if min had been willing to expose herself there was no point in warning the woman it would not change anything it is the gentling the aes sedai said after a moment he has given up on wanting to live i suppose there is nothing i can do for him not that i am sure i should if i could the look she gave min before leaving was far from friendly an elegant statuesque woman in russet silk paused a few feet away coolly examining min and logain with expressionless eyes kiruna was a green and regal in her manner she was a sister of the king of arafel so min had heard but she had been friendly to min in the tower min smiled but those large dark eyes swept over her without recognition and kiruna glided out of the inn four warders disparate men but all with that deadlyseeming way of moving suddenly heeling her waiting for her food min hoped that siuan and leane were finding a warmer reception chapter flame of tar valon the practice of diffidence you are rudderless siuan told the six women facing her in six different sorts of chair the room itself was a muddle two large kitchen tables against the walls held pens and ink jars and sand bottles in neat arrays mismatched lamps some glazed pottery and some gilded and candles in every thickness and length stood ready to provide light at nightfall a scrap of illianer silk carpet rich in blues and reds and gold lay on a floor of rough weathered planks she and leane had been seated across the piece of carpet from the others in such a way that they were the focus of every eye open casement windows with panes cracked or replaced by oiled silk let a breath of air stir in but not enough to cut the heat siuan told herself that she did not envy these women their ability to channel she was past that surely but she did envy the way none of them perspired her own face was quite damp all that activity out there is play and show you might be fooling each other and maybe even the gaidin though id not count on that were i you but you cant fool me she wished that morvrin and beonin had not been added to the group morvrin was skeptical of everything despite her placid sometimes vaguely absent look a stout brown with graystreaked hair who demanded six pieces of evidence before she would believe fish had scales and beonin a pretty gray with dark honey hair and bluegray eyes so big they constantly made her appear slightly startled beonin made morvrin seem gullible elaida has the tower in her fist and you know she will mishandle rand althor siuan said scornfully it will be pure luck if she doesnt panic and have him gentled before tarmon gaidon you know that whatever you feel about a man channeling reds feel ten times more the white tower is at its weakest when it should be at its strongest in the hands of a fool when it must have skilled command she wrinkled her nose staring them in the eye one by one and you sit here drifting with your sails down or can you convince me that you are doing more than twiddling your thumbs and blowing bubbles do you agree with siuan leane anaiya asked mildly siuan had never been able to understand why moiraine liked the woman trying to get her to do anything she did not want to was like hitting a sack of feathers she did not stand up to you or argue she just silently refused to move even the way she sat with her hands folded looked more like a woman waiting to knead dough than an aes sedai in part i do leane replied siuan gave her a sharp look that she ignored about elaida certainly elaida will misuse rand althor as surely as she is misusing the tower for the rest i know that you have worked hard to gather as many sisters here as you have and i expect that you are working just as hard to do something about elaida siuan sniffed loudly on her way through the common room she had snatched glimpses of some of those parchments being examined so assiduously lists of provisions allotments of timber for rebuilding assignments for woodcutting and repairing houses and cleaning out wells nothing more nothing that looked the least like a report on elaidas activities they were planning to winter here all it took was one blue being captured after she had learned of salidar one woman being put to the question she would not hold back much if alviarin had charge of it and elaida would know exactly where to net them while they worried about planting vegetable gardens and having enough firewood cut before the first freeze then that is out of the way carlinya said coolly you do not seem to understand that you are not amyrlin and keeper any longer you are not even aes sedai some had the grace to look embarrassed not morvrin or beonin but the others no aes sedai liked to speak of stilling or be reminded of it they would think it especially harsh in front of the two of them i do not say this to be cruel we do not believe the charges against you despite your traveling companion or we would not be here but you cannot assume your old places among us and that is a simple fact siuan remembered carlinya well as novice and accepted once a month she had committed some minor offense a small thing that earned her an extra hour or two of chores exactly once each month she had not wanted the others to think her a prig those had been her only offenses she never broke another rule or put a foot wrong it would not have been logical yet she had never understood why the other girls had considered her an aes sedai pet anyway a great deal of logic and not much common sense that was carlinya while what was done to you followed the letter of the law narrowly sheriam said gently we agree that it was malignantly unjust an extreme distortion of the laws spirit the chairback behind her firered head was incongruously carved with what seemed to be a mass of snakes fighting whatever rumor might say most of the charges laid against you were so thin that they should have been laughed away not the charge that she knew of rand althor and conspired to hide him from the tower carlinya broke in sharply sheriam nodded but be that as it may even that was not sufficient for the penalty given nor should you have been tried in secret without even a chance to defend yourself never fear that we will turn our backs on you we will see that you both are cared for i thank you leane said her voice soft and almost trembling siuan grimaced at them you havent even asked me about the eyesandears i can use she had liked sheriam when they were students together though years and position had opened water between them cared for indeed is aeldene here anaiya started to shake her head before stopping herself i suspected not or you would know more of what is going on youve left them sending their reports to the tower slow realization dawned on their faces they had not known aeldenes office i headed the blue ajahs net of eyesandears before i was raised amyrlin more surprise with a little effort every blue agent and those who served me as amyrlin too can be sending her reports to you by routes that keep her ignorant of their final destination it would take considerably more than a little work but she had already sketched most of it out in her head and there was no need for them to know more at the moment and they can continue sending reports to the tower reports containing what you want elaida to believe she had almost said we she had to watch her tongue they did not like it of course the women who tended the networks might be unknown to all but a few but they were every one aes sedai they had always been aes sedai but that was her only lever with which to pry her way into the circles where decisions were made otherwise they would likely stuff her and leane into a cottage with a servant to look after them and maybe a rare visit from aes sedai who wanted to examine women who had been stilled until they died they would die soon in those circumstances light they might even marry us off some thought that a husband and children could occupy a woman enough to replace the one power in her life more than one woman stilled by drawing too much of saidar to herself or in testing terangreal for their uses had found herself being matched with potential husbands since those who did marry always put as much distance as possible between themselves and the tower and its memories the theory remained unproven it should not be difficult leane said diffidently to put myself in touch with those who were my eyesandears before i was keeper more importantly as keeper of the chronicles i had agents in tar valon itself startlement widened a few eyes though carlinyas narrowed leane blinked shifted uneasily smiled weakly i always thought it foolish that we paid more attention to the mood of ebou dar or bandar eban than to the mood of our own city they had to see the value of eyesandears in tar valon siuan leaning forward in her thickarmed chair morvrin said the name firmly as though to emphasize that she had not said mother that round face looked more stubborn than placid now her stoutness a threatening mass when siuan had been a novice morvrin rarely seemed to notice the mischief of the girls around her but when she did she had taken care of matters herself in ways that had everyone sitting straight and walking small for days why should we allow you to do as you want you have been stilled woman whatever you were you are no longer aes sedai if we want these agents names you will both give them to us there was a flat certainty to that last they would give them one way or another they would if these women wanted them enough leane shivered visibly but siuans chair creaked as she stiffened her back i know that i am not amyrlin anymore do you think i dont know i was stilled my face is changed but not what is inside everything i ever knew is still in my head use it for the love of the light use me she took a deep breath to calm herself burn me if i let them shove me aside to rot and myrelle spoke into the pause a young womans temper to go with a young womans face smiling she sat on the edge of a stiffbacked armchair that could have stood in front of a farmers fireplace if the farmer had not cared that the varnish was flaking the smile was not her usual one though languid and knowing at the same time and her dark eyes nearly as large as beonins were full of sympathy i am sure that no one wants you to feel useless siuan and i am sure that we all want to employ your knowledge fully what you know will be of great use to us siuan did not want her sympathy you seem to have forgotten logain and why i dragged him all the way here from tar valon she had not meant to bring this up herself but if they were going to let it lie wallowing my crackbrained idea very well siuan sheriam said why because the first step to pulling elaida down is for logain to reveal to the tower to the world if need be that the red ajah set him up as a false dragon so that he could be pulled down she certainly had their attention now he was found by reds in ghealdan at least a year before he proclaimed himself but instead of bringing him to tar valon to be gentled they planted the idea in his head of claiming to be the dragon reborn you are certain of this beonin asked quietly in a heavy taraboner accent she sat very still in her tall canebottomed chair watching carefully he does not know who leane and i are he talked with us sometimes on the journey here late at night when min was sleeping and he could not rest he said nothing before because he thinks the entire tower was behind it but he knows that it was red sisters who shielded him and talked to him of the dragon reborn why morvrin demanded and sheriam nodded yes why any of us would go out of our way to see a man like that gentled but the red ajah lives for nothing else why would they create a false dragon logain did not know she told them perhaps they think they gain more by capturing a false dragon than gentling a poor fool who might terrorize one village perhaps they have some reason to want more turmoil we do not suggest theyve had anything to do with mazrim taim or any of the others leane added quickly elaida will no doubt be able to tell you what you want to know siuan watched them mull it over in silence they never considered the possibility that she was lying an advantage to having been stilled it did not seem to occur to them that being stilled might have broken all ties to the three oaths some aes sedai studied stilled women true but gingerly and reluctantly no one wanted to be reminded of what might happen to herself for logain siuan had no worry not as long as min continued to see whatever it was that she saw he would live long enough to reveal what siuan wanted him to once she had talked to him she had not dared risk his deciding to go his own way which he might well have done had she told him before but it was his one chance for revenge now against those who had gentled him surrounded by aes sedai again as he was revenge only against the red ajah true but he would have to settle for that a fish in the boat was worth a school in the water she glanced at leane who smiled the faintest possible smile that was good leane had disliked being kept in the dark about her plan for the man until this morning but siuan had lived too long wrapped in secrecy to be easy revealing more than she had to even to a friend she thought that the idea of red ajah involvement with other false dragons had been neatly planted reds had been the leaders in overthrowing her there might not be a red ajah once this was done with this changes a great deal sheriam said after a time we cannot possibly follow an amyrlin who would do such a thing follow her siuan exclaimed for the first time truly startled you were actually considering going back to kiss elaidas ring knowing what she has done and will do leane quivered in her seat as if she wanted to say a few choice words herself but they had agreed that siuan was to be the one to lose her temper sheriam looked a trifle embarrassed and spots of color floated in myrelles olive cheeks but the others took it as calmly as sunshine the tower must be strong carlinya said in a voice as hard as winter stone the dragon has been reborn the last battle is coming and the tower must be whole anaiya nodded we understand your reasons for disliking elaida even hating her we do understand but we must think of the tower and the world i confess i do not like elaida myself but then i have never liked siuan either it is not necessary to like the amyrlin seat there is no need to glare so siuan you have had a file for a tongue since you were a novice and it has only roughened with the years and as amyrlin you pushed sisters where you wanted and only seldom explained why the two do not make a likable combination i will try to smooth my tongue siuan said dryly did the woman expect the amyrlin seat to treat every sister like a childhood friend but i hope what ive told you changes your desire to kneel at elaidas feet if that is your smoother tongue myrelle said idly i may have to smooth it myself if we do allow you to run the eyesandears for us we cannot go back to the tower now of course sheriam said not knowing this not until we are in position to see elaida deposed whatever she has done the reds they will continue to support her beonin stated it as fact not objection it was no secret that the reds resented the fact that there had not been an amyrlin from their ajah since bonwhin morvrin nodded heavily others will as well those who have thrown themselves too much behind elaida to believe they have any other choice those who will support authority however vile and some who will believe we are dividing the tower when it must be whole at any cost all but the red sisters can be approached beonin said judiciously negotiated with mediation and negotiation were her ajahs reason for existence it seems we will have a use for your agents siuan sheriam looked around at the others unless anyone still thinks we should take them away from her morvrin was the last to shake her head but she did it finally after a long study that made siuan feel she had been stripped weighed and measured she could not stop a sigh of relief not a short life drying up in a cottage but a life of purpose it might still be a short life no one knew how long a stilled woman could live given something to replace the one power in her life but with purpose it would be long enough so myrelle was going to smooth her tongue for her was she ill show that foxeyed green i will hold my tongue and be glad she isnt doing more than look at me is what ill do i knew how this would go burn me but i did thank you aes sedai she said in the meekest tone she could find to call them that pained her it was another break another reminder of what she was not any longer i will try to give good service myrelle did not have to nod in such a satisfied way siuan ignored a small voice that said she would have done as much or more in myrelles place if i may suggest leane said it is not enough to wait until you have enough support in the hall of the tower to depose elaida siuan put on an interested look as though hearing this for the first time elaida sits in tar valon in the white tower and to the world she is amyrlin at the moment you are only a flock of dissidents she can call you rebels and agitators and coming from the amyrlin seat the world will believe it we can hardly stop her being amyrlin before she is deposed carlinya said shifting on her chair in icy contempt had she been wearing her whitefringed shawl she would have snapped it around her you can give the world a true amyrlin leane spoke not to the white sister but to all of them eyeing each in turn sure of what she was saying yet at the same time offering a suggestion that she merely hoped they would take it had been siuan who pointed out that the techniques she employed on men could be adapted for women i saw aes sedai from every ajah save the red in the common room and in the streets have them elect a hall of the tower here and let that hall select a new amyrlin then you can present yourselves to the world as the true white tower in exile and elaida as a usurper with logains revelations added in can you doubt who the nations will accept as the real amyrlin seat the idea took hold siuan could see them turning it over in their minds whatever the others thought only sheriam voiced a word against it will mean that the tower truly is broken the greeneyed woman said sadly it already is broken siuan told her tartly and instantly wished she had not when they all looked at her this was supposed to be purely leanes notion she herself had a reputation as a deft manipulator and they could well be suspicious of anything she proposed that was why she had begun by scathing them they would not have believed her if she had begun with mild words she would come at them as if she still thought herself amyrlin and let them put her in her place by comparison leane would seem more cooperative only offering the little she could and they would be more likely to listen to her doing her own part had not been difficult until it came to pleading then she had wanted to hang them all in the sun to dry sitting here doing nothing you didnt have to worry about them being suspicious they think you are a broken reed if everything went properly they would not learn differently a useful reed but a weak one not to be thought of twice it was a painful accommodation to make but duranda tharne had shown her the necessity in lugard they would accept her only on their terms and she would have to make the best of it i wish i had thought of this myself she went on now that i hear it leanes idea gives you a way to build the tower again without having to tear it down completely first i still cannot like it sheriams voice firmed but what must be must be the wheel weaves as the wheel wills and the light willing it will weave elaida out of the stole we will need to negotiate with those sisters who remain in the tower beonin mused only half to herself the amyrlin we choose she must be a skilled negotiator yes clear thinking will be needed carlinya put in the new amyrlin must be a woman of cool reason and logic morvrins snort was loud enough to make everyone jump in their chairs sheriam is the highest among us and she has kept us together when wed have been running in ten different directions sheriam shook her head vigorously but myrelle gave her no chance to speak sheriam is an excellent choice i can promise every green sister here behind her i know anaiya opened her mouth agreement plain on her face it was time to put a stop to this before it got out of hand if i may suggest siuan thought she managed diffidence much better than she had meekness it was a strain but she thought she had better learn to maintain it myrelle isnt the only one who will try to stuff me in the bilges if they think ive overstepped my place whatever it is only they would not try they would do aes sedai expected no required respect from those who were not it seems to me that whoever you choose should be someone who was not in the tower when i was deposed would it not be best if the woman who unites the tower again was one whom no one could accuse of choosing a side on that day if she had to keep this up she was going to burst a seam in her head someone very strong in the power leane added the stronger she is the more she can stand for all that the tower means or will again once elaida is gone siuan could have kicked her that thought was supposed to wait a full day to be tossed in once they actually began considering names between them she and leane knew enough of every sister to find some weakness some doubt to be dangled subtly as to her fitness for stole and staff she would rather wade naked through a school of silverpike than have these women realize that she was trying to manipulate them a sister who was out of the tower sheriam said nodding that makes excellent sense siuan very good how easily they slipped into patting her on the head morvrin pursed her lips it will not be easy finding whoever we choose strength narrows the possibilities anaiya looked around at the others it will not only make her a better symbol to the other sisters at least but strength in the power often goes with strength of will and whoever we choose will surely need that carlinya and beonin were the last to join in agreement siuan kept her face smooth her smile on the inside the breaking of the tower had changed many things many ways of thinking besides her own these women had led the sisters gathered here and now they were discussing who should be presented to their new hall of the tower as if that should not be the halls choice it would not be difficult to bring them around ever so gently to the belief that the new amyrlin should be one who could be guided by them and unknowing they and the amyrlin she chose for her replacement would be guided by herself she and moiraine had worked too long to find rand althor and prepare him given too much of their lives for her to risk the rest of it being bungled by someone else if i may make another suggestion diffidence was simply not in her nature she was going to have to find something else she waited trying not to grit her teeth for sheriam to nod before going on elaida will be attempting to discover where rand althor is the farther south i came the more rumors i heard that he has left tear i think that he has and i think that i have reasoned out where he went there was no need for her to say that they had to find him before tar valon did they all understood not only would elaida mishandle him certainly but should she put her hands on him display him shielded and in her control any hope of toppling her would be gone rulers knew the prophecies if their people usually did not they would forgive her a dozen false dragons out of necessity where morvrin barked a hair ahead of sheriam anaiya and myrelle all together the aiel waste there was a moment of silence before carlinya said that is ridiculous siuan bit back an angry reply and smiled what she hoped was an apologetic smile perhaps but i read something of the aiel when i was accepted gitara moroso thought that some of the aiel wise ones might be able to channel gitara had been keeper then one of the books she had me read an old thing from the dustiest corner of the library claimed that the aiel call themselves the people of the dragon i did not remember it until i tried puzzling out where rand could have vanished to the prophecies say the stone of tear shall never fall till the people of the dragon come and there were aiel in the taking of the stone that every rumor and tale agrees on morvrins eyes suddenly seemed to look elsewhere i remember speculation about the wise ones when i was newly raised to the shawl it would be fascinating if true but aiel are little more welcoming to aes sedai than to anyone else who enters the waste and their wise ones apparently have some law or custom against speaking to strangers so i understand which makes it extremely hard to come close enough to one to feel if she suddenly she gave herself a shake staring at siuan and leane as though her wandering had been their fault a thin straw to weave a basket something you remember from a book likely written by someone who never saw an aiel a very thin straw carlinya said but worth sending someone to the waste it took effort to make that a question instead of a demand siuan thought she might sweat down to nothing if she could not find another way she still had enough control of herself to ignore the heat usually but not while trying to drag these women along without letting them notice her fist in their hair i do not think the aiel would try to harm an aes sedai not if she was quick enough to show that she was aes sedai siuan did not think they would it had to be risked and if he is in the waste the aiel will know of it remember those aiel at the stone perhaps beonin said slowly the waste is large how many would we need to send if the dragon reborn is in the waste anaiya said the first aiel met will know of it events follow this rand althor by all accounts he could not slip into the ocean without making a splash heard in every corner of the world myrelle smiled she should be green none of the rest of you will bond more than one warder and two or three gaidin might be very useful in the waste until the aiel know her for aes sedai i have always wanted to see an aiel she had been a novice during the aiel war and not allowed out of the tower not that any aes sedai had taken part beyond healing of course the three oaths had bound them unless tar valon or maybe even the tower itself were attacked and that war had never crossed the rivers not you sheriam told her or any other member of this council you agreed to see this through myrelle when you agreed to sit with us and that does not include gallivanting off because you are bored i fear there will be more excitement than any of us could wish before we finish she would have made an excellent amyrlin in other circumstances in these she was simply too strong and sure of herself but greens yes i think so two her green eyes swept along the others to be certain kiruna nachiman anaiya offered and beonin added bera harkin the others nodded except for myrelle who shifted her shoulders irritably aes sedai did not pout but she came close siuan took her second relieved breath she was certain her reasoning was correct he had vanished to somewhere and if he was anywhere between the spine of the world and the aryth ocean rumors would have been flying and wherever he was moiraine would be there with a hand on his collar kiruna and bera would surely be willing to carry a letter to moiraine and they had seven warders between them to keep the aiel from killing them we do not want to tire you and leane sheriam went oh i will ask one of the yellow sisters to look at both of you perhaps she can do something to help to ease you in some way i will have rooms found for you where you can rest if you are to be our mistress of eyesandears myrelle added solicitously you must maintain your strength i am not so frail as you seem to think siuan protested if i were could i have followed you nearly two thousand miles whatever weakness i had after being stilled is gone believe me the truth was that she had found a center of power again and she did not want to leave it but she could hardly say that all those concerned eyes on her and leane well not carlinyas particularly but the rest light theyre going to have a novice tuck us into bed for a nap a knock at the door was followed immediately by arinvar sheriams warder cairhienin he was not tall and slender besides but in spite of gray at his temples he was hard of face and he moved like a stalking leopard there are twentyodd riders to the east he said without preamble not whitecloaks carlinya said or i presume you would have reported as much sheriam gave her a look many sisters could be prickly when it came to another stepping between them and their gaidin we cannot allow them to get away and perhaps carry word of our presence can they be captured arinvar i would prefer that to killing them either may be difficult he replied machan says they are armed and have the look of veterans worth ten times their number of younger men morvrin made a vexed sound we must do one or the other forgive me sheriam arinvar can the gaidin sneak some of the more agile sisters close enough to weave air around them he shook his head fractionally machan says they may have seen some of the warders keeping watch they would certainly see if we tried to bring more than one or two of you near they are still coming though siuan and leane were not the only ones to exchange startled glances few men saw a warder who did not want to be seen even without the gaidin cloak then you must do as you think best sheriam said capture them if possible but none must escape to betray us before arinvar could complete his bow hand to sword hilt another man was beside him a dark bear of a man tall and wide with hair to his shoulders and a short beard that left his upper lip bare that flowing warder movement seemed odd on him he winked at myrelle his aes sedai even as he said in a thick illianer accent most of the riders do be stopped but one does come on by himself if my aged mother did say different i would still name him gareth bryne from the glimpse i did get siuan stared at him her hands and feet suddenly felt cold strong rumor said that myrelle had actually married this nuhel and her other two warders in defiance of convention and law in every land siuan had ever heard of it was the sort of incongruous thought that drifted through a stunned mind and right then she felt as if a mast had fallen on her head bryne here its impossible it is mad surely the man could not have followed them all this way for oh yes he could and would that one would as they journeyed she had told herself that it was only sensible caution to leave no trace behind that elaida knew they were not dead whatever the rumors said and she would not stop hunting until they were found or she was pulled down siuan had been irritated at having to ask directions finally yet the thought that had snapped at her like a shark had not been that elaida might somehow find a blacksmith in one small altaran village but that the blacksmith would be like a painted sign for bryne told yourself it was foolish didnt you and now here he is she well remembered her confrontation with him when she had had to bend him to her will on that matter of murandy it had been like bending a thick iron bar or some huge spring that would leap back if she let up for an instant she had had to bring all of her force to bear had had to humiliate him publicly in order to make certain he would remain bent for as long as she needed he could hardly go against what he had agreed to on his knees begging her pardon with fifty nobles watching morgase had been difficult enough herself and siuan had not been willing to risk bryne giving morgase an excuse to go against her instructions strange to think that she and elaida had worked together then bringing morgase to heel she had to take hold of herself she was in a daze thinking of everything except what she needed to concentrate this is no time to panic you must send him away or kill him she knew it for a mistake while the words were still leaving her mouth all too full of urgency even the warders looked at her and the aes sedai she had never before known what it felt like for someone who lacked the power to have those eyes turned on them at full strength she felt naked her very mind laid bare even knowing that aes sedai could not read thoughts she still wanted to confess before they listed her lies and crimes she hoped that her face was not like leanes redcheeked and wideeyed you know why he is here sheriams voice was calmly certain both of you do and you do not want to confront him enough so that you would have us kill him for you there do be few great captains living nuhel marked them off on gauntleted fingers agelmar jagad and davram bashere will no leave the blight i think and pedron niall will surely no be of use to you if rodel ituralde do be alive he do be mired somewhere in what do remain of arad doman he raised his thick thumb and that do leave gareth bryne do you think that we will need a great captain then sheriam asked quietly nuhel and arinvar did not look at one another but siuan still had the feeling that they had exchanged glances it is your decision sheriam arinvar replied just as quietly yours and the other sisters but if you mean to return to the tower we could use him if you intend to remain here until elaida sends for you then not myrelle gazed at nuhel questioningly and he nodded it seems that you were right siuan anaiya said wryly we have not fooled the gaidin the question is whether he will agree to serve us carlinya said and morvrin nodded adding we must make him see our cause in such a way that he wishes to serve it will not help us if it becomes known that we killed or imprisoned so notable a man before we have even begun yes beonin said and we must offer him the rewards that will bind him to us firmly sheriam turned her eyes on the two men when lord bryne reaches the village tell him nothing but bring him to us as soon as the door closed behind the warders her gaze firmed siuan recognized it the same clear green stare that had novices knees knocking before a word was said now you will tell us exactly why gareth bryne is here there was no choice if they caught her in even the tiniest lie they would begin to question everything siuan took a deep breath we took shelter for the night in a barn near kore springs in andor bryne is the lord there and chapter bull trapped a warder in a graygreen coat approached bryne as soon as he rode traveler past the first stone houses of the village bryne would have known the man for a warder after watching him walk two strides even without all the aes sedai faces staring at him in the street what in the name of the light were so many aes sedai doing this close to amadicia rumor in villages behind said ailron meant to claim this bank of the river eldar which meant the whitecloaks did aes sedai could defend themselves well but if niall sent a legion across the eldar a good many of these women would die unless he could no longer tell how long a stump had been exposed to air this place had been buried in the forest two months ago what had mara gotten herself into he was sure he would find her here village men remembered three pretty young women traveling together especially when one of them asked directions to a town abandoned since the whitecloak war the warder a big man with a broad face an illianer by his beard planted himself in the street in front of brynes bignosed bay gelding and bowed lord bryne i am nuhel dromand if you will come with me there are those who do wish to speak with you bryne dismounted slowly pulling off his gauntlets and tucking them behind his sword belt as he studied the town the plain buffcolored coat he wore now was much better for a journey of this sort than the gray silk he had started in that he had given away aes sedai and warders and others watched him silently but even those who had to be servants did not look surprised and dromand knew his name his face was not unknown but he suspected more than that if mara was if they were aes sedai agents it did not alter the oath they had taken lead on nuhel gaidin if nuhel was surprised at the address he did not show it the inn that dromand took him to or what had been an inn once had the look of headquarters for a campaign all bustle and scurry that is if aes sedai had ever commanded a campaign he spotted serenla before she did him seated in the corner with a big man who was very likely dalyn when she did see him her chin dropped almost to the table and then she squinted at him as if not believing her eyes dalyn appeared to be asleep with his eyes open staring at nothing none of the aes sedai or warders seemed to notice as dromand led him through but bryne would have wagered his manor and lands that any one of them had seen ten times as much as all the staring servants combined he should have turned and ridden away as soon as he realized who was in this village he took careful note as he made his bows while the warder introduced him to the six seated aes sedai only a fool was careless around aes sedai but his mind was on the two young women standing against the wall beside the freshswept fireplace and looking chastened the willowy domani minx was offering him a smile more tremulous than seductive for a change mara was frightened too terrified out of her skin he would say but those blue eyes still met his full of defiance the girl had courage to suit a lion we are pleased to greet you lord bryne the flamehaired aes sedai said just slightly plump and with those tilted eyes she was pretty enough to make any man look twice despite the great serpent ring on her finger will you tell us what brings you here of course sheriam sedai nuhel stood at his shoulder but if any women needed less guarding from one old soldier bryne could not imagine who he was sure that they knew already and watching their faces while he told the tale confirmed it aes sedai let nothing be seen that they did not want seen but at least one of them would have blinked when he spoke of the oath if they had not known beforehand a dreadful story to relate lord bryne that was the one called anaiya ageless face or not she looked more like a happy prosperous farmwife than an aes sedai yet i am surprised that you followed so far even after oathbreakers maras fair cheeks flushed a furious red still a strong oath one that should not be broken unfortunately sheriam said we cannot let you take them quite yet so they were aes sedai agents a strong oath that should not be broken yet you mean to keep them from honoring it they will honor it myrelle said with a glance at the pair by the fireplace that made them both stand straighter and you may rest assured that they already regret running away after giving it this time it was amaena who reddened mara looked ready to chew rocks but we cannot allow it yet no ajahs had been mentioned yet he thought the darkly pretty woman was green and the stout roundfaced one called morvrin was brown perhaps it was the smile that myrelle had given dromand when the man brought him in and morvrins air of thinking of something else in truth they did not say when they would serve and we have a use for them this was foolish he should apologize for disturbing them and leave and that was foolish too he had known before dromand reached him in the street that he was unlikely to leave salidar alive there were probably fifty warders in the forest around where he had left his men if not a hundred joni and the others would give a good account of themselves but he had not brought them all this way to die yet if he was a fool to have let a pair of eyes lure him into this trap he might as well go the last mile for it arson theft and assault aes sedai those were the crimes they were tried sentenced and sworn but i have no objection to remaining here until you are done with them mara can act as my dog robber when you do not need her i will mark the hours she works for me and count them against her service mara opened her mouth angrily but almost as if the women had known that she would try to speak six pairs of aes sedai eyes swiveled to her in unison she shifted her shoulders snapped her mouth shut and then glared at him fists rigidly at her sides he was glad she did not have a knife in her hand myrelle appeared close to laughter better to choose the other lord bryne from the way she is looking at you you would find her far more congenial he halfexpected amaena to go crimson but she did not and she was eyeing him appraisingly she even shared a smile with myrelle well she was domani after all and considerably more so than when he saw her last it seemed carlinya cold enough to make the others seem warm leaned forward he was wary of her and of the bigeyed one named beonin he was not sure why except that if he were in the game of houses here he would say both women reeked of ambition maybe he was involved in exactly that you should be aware carlinya said coolly that the woman you know as mara is in reality siuan sanche formerly the amyrlin seat amaena is really leane sharif who was keeper of the chronicles it was all he could do not to gape like a country lout now that he knew he could see it in maras face in siuans the face that had made him back down softened into youth how was all he said it was almost all he could have managed to say there are some things men are better off not knowing sheriam replied coolly and most women mara no he might as well think of her by her right name siuan had been stilled he knew that it must be something to do with stilling if that swannecked domani had been keeper he was ready to wager she had been stilled too but talking about stilling around aes sedai was a good way to find out how tough you were besides when they began going mysterious with you aes sedai would not give a straight answer if you asked whether the sky was blue they were very good these aes sedai they had lulled him then hit hard when his guard was down he had a sinking feeling that he knew what they were softening him for it would be interesting to learn whether he was right it does not change the oath they took if they were still amyrlin and keeper they could be held to that oath by any law including that of tar valon since you have no objection to remaining here sheriam said you may have siuan as your bodyservant when we do not need her you may have all three of them if you wish including min whom you apparently know as serenla all the time for some reason that seemed to irritate siuan as much as what had been said about her she muttered to herself not loud enough to be heard and since you have no objections lord bryne while you remain with us there is a service that you can give us the gratitude of aes sedai is not inconsiderable morvrin said you will be serving the light and justice in serving us carlinya added beonin nodded speaking in serious tones you served morgase and andor faithfully serve us as well and you will not find exile at its end nothing we ask of you will go against your honor nothing we ask will harm andor bryne grimaced he was in the game all right he sometimes thought that aes sedai must have invented daes daemar they seemed to play it in their sleep battle was surely more bloody but it was more honest too if they meant to pull his strings then his strings would be pulled they would manage it one way or another but it was time to show them he was not a brainless puppet the white tower is broken he said flatly those aes sedai eyes widened but he gave them no chance to speak the ajahs have split that is the only reason you can all be here you certainly dont need an extra sword or two he eyed dromand and got a nod in return so the only service you can want out of me is to lead an army to build one first unless you have other camps with a good many more men than i saw here and that means you intend to oppose elaida sheriam looked vexed anaiya worried and carlinya on the point of speaking but he went on let them listen he expected he would be doing a great deal of listening to them in the months to come very well ive never liked elaida and i cannot believe she makes a good amyrlin more importantly i can make an army to take tar valon so long as you know the taking will be bloody and long but these are my conditions they stiffened to a woman at that even siuan and leane men did not make conditions for aes sedai first the command is mine you tell me what to do but i decide how you give commands to me and i give them to the soldiers under me not you not unless i have agreed to it first several mouths opened carlinyas and beonins first but he continued i assign men i promote them and i discipline them not you second if i tell you it cant be done you will consider what i say i dont ask to usurp your authority small chance they would allow that yet do not want to waste men because you do not understand war it would happen but no more than once if he was lucky third if you begin this you will stay the course i will be putting my head in a noose and every man who follows along with me and should you decide half a year from now that elaida as amyrlin is preferable to war you will pull that noose tight for every one of us who can be hunted down the nations may stay out of a civil war in the tower but theyll not let us live if you abandon us elaida will see to that if you will not agree to these then i do not know that i can serve you whether you bind me with the power for dromand here to slit my throat or i end attainted and hung death is still the end the aes sedai did not speak for a long moment they stared at him until the itch between his shoulder blades made him wonder if nuhel was ready to plunge a dagger in then sheriam rose and the others followed her to the windows he could see their lips moving but he heard nothing if they wanted to hide their deliberations behind the one power so be it he was not certain how much of what he wanted he could wring out of them all if they were sensible but aes sedai could decide that strange things were sensible whatever they decided he would have to accede with as good a grace as he could muster it was a perfect trap that he had made for himself leane gave him a look and a smile that said as plain as words that he would never know what he had missed he thought it would have been a fine chase with him being led by the nose domani women never promised half what you thought they did and they gave only as much as they chose and changed their minds either way in a blink the bait in his trap stared at him levelly strode across the floor until she stood so close that she had to crane her neck to stare up at him and spoke in a low furious voice why did you do this why did you follow us for a barn for an oath for a pair of blue eyes siuan sanche could not be more than ten years younger than he but it was hard to remember that she was siuan sanche while looking at a face nearer thirty years younger the eyes were the same though deep blue and strong an oath you gave to me and broke i should double your time for that dropping her gaze from his she folded her arms beneath her breasts growling that has already been taken care of you mean they punished you for oathbreaking if youve had your bottom switched for it it doesnt count unless i do it dromands chuckle sounded more than half scandalized the man had to be still struggling with who siuan had been bryne was not certain that he was not too and her face darkened until he thought she might have apoplexy my time has already been doubled if not more you pile of rancid fish guts you and your marking hours not an hour will count until you have all three of us back at your manor not if i must be your your dog robber whatever that is for twenty years so they had planned for this too sheriam and the others he glanced to their conference by the windows they seemed to have divided into two opposing groups sheriam anaiya and myrelle on one side morvrin and carlinya on the other with beonin standing between they had been ready to give him siuan and leane and min as bribe or sop before he ever walked in they were desperate which meant he was on the weaker side but maybe they were desperate enough to give him what he needed for a chance of victory you are taking pleasure from this arent you siuan said fiercely the moment his eyes moved you buzzard burn you for a carpbrained fool now that you know who i am it pleases you that ill have to bow and scrape to you she did not seem to be doing much of that yet why is it because i made you back down over murandy are you so small gareth bryne she was trying to make him angry she realized that she had said too much and did not want to give him time to think on it maybe she was no longer aes sedai but manipulation was in her blood you were the amyrlin seat he said calmly and even a king kisses the amyrlins ring i cant say that i liked how you went about it and we may have a quiet talk sometime on whether it was necessary to do what you did with half the court looking on but you will remember that i followed mara tomanes here and it was mara tomanes i asked for not siuan sanche since you keep asking why let me ask it why was it so important for me to allow the murandians to raid across the border because your interference then could have ruined important plans she said driving each word home in a tight voice just as your interference with me now can the tower had identified a young border lord named dulain as a man who could one day truly unify murandy with our help i could hardly allow the chance your soldiers might kill him i have work to do here lord bryne leave me to do it and you may see victory meddle out of spite and you ruin everything whatever your work is i am sure sheriam and the others will see you do it dulain ive never heard of him he cannot be succeeding yet it was his opinion that murandy would remain a patchwork of all but independent lords and ladies until the wheel turned and a new age came murandians called themselves lugarder or mindeans or whatever before they named a nation if they even bothered to name one a lord who could unite them and who had siuans leash around his throat could bring a considerable number of men he died scarlet spots appeared in her cheeks and she seemed to struggle with herself a month after i left caemlyn she muttered some andoran farmer put an arrow through him on a sheep raid he could not help laughing it was the farmers you should have made kneel not me well you no longer need concern yourself with such things that was certainly true whatever use the aes sedai had for her they would never let her near power or decisions again now he felt pity for her he could not imagine this woman giving up and dying but she had lost about as much as it was possible to lose short of dying on the other hand he had not liked being called a buzzard or a pile of reeking fish guts what was the other thing a carpbrained fool from now on you can concern yourself with keeping my boots clean and my bed made her eyes narrowed to slits if that is what you want lord gareth bryne you should choose leane she might be fool enough only barely did he stop himself from goggling the way womens minds worked never ceased to amaze him you vowed to serve me however i choose he managed to chuckle why was he doing this he knew who she was and what she was but those eyes still haunted him staring a challenge even when she thought there was no hope just as they were now you will discover the kind of man i am siuan he meant it to soothe her after his jest but from the way her shoulders stiffened she seemed to take it as a threat suddenly he realized that he could hear the aes sedai a soft murmur of voices that went silent immediately they stood together staring at him with unreadable expressions no at siuan their eyes followed her as she started back to where leane still stood as if she could feel the pressure of them each step came a little quicker than the one before when she turned again beside the fireplace her face told no more than theirs a remarkable woman he was not sure he could have done as well in her place the aes sedai were waiting for him to approach when he did sheriam said we accept your conditions without reservation lord bryne and pledge ourselves to hold to them they are most reasonable carlinya at least did not look as though she thought they were reasonable at all but he did not care he had been prepared to give up all but the last that they stay the course if need be he knelt where he was right fist pressed to the scrap of carpet and they encircled him each laying a hand on his bowed head he did not care whether they used the power to bind him to his oath or search for truth he was not sure they could do either but who really knew what aes sedai could do and if they meant something else there was nothing he could do about it trapped by a pair of eyes like a bullgoose fool country boy he was carpbrained i do pledge and vow that i will serve you faithfully until the white tower is yours already he was planning thad and maybe a warder or two across the river to see what the whitecloaks were up to joni barim and a few others down to ebou dar it would keep joni from swallowing his tongue every time he looked at mara and amaena and every man he sent would know how to recruit building and directing your army to the best of my ability when the low buzz of talk in the common room died min looked up from the patterns she had been idly sketching on the table with a finger dipped in wine logain stirred too for a wonder but only to stare at the people in the room or maybe through them it was hard to tell gareth bryne and that big illianer warder came out of the back room first in the watchful silence she heard bryne say tell them an ebou dar tavern maid sent you or theyll put your head on a stake the illianer roared with laughter a dangerous city ebou dar pulling leather gauntlets from behind his sword belt he stalked out into the street drawing them on the talk began to pick up again as siuan appeared min could not hear what bryne said to her but she strode after the warder snarling to herself min had a sinking feeling that the aes sedai had decided that they were going to honor that fool oath siuan had been so proud of honor it right now if she could convince herself that the pair of warders lounging against the wall would not notice she would be out of the door and into wildroses saddle in a flash sheriam and the other aes sedai came out last with leane myrelle sat leane down at one of the tables and began discussing something while the rest circulated through the room stopping to speak to each aes sedai whatever they said it produced reactions from outright shock to pleased grins despite that fabled aes sedai serenity stay here min told logain scraping back her rickety chair she hoped he was not going to start trouble he was staring at aes sedai faces one by one and appearing to see more than he had in days just stay at this table till i get back dalyn she was out of the habit of being around people who knew his real name please she sold me to aes sedai it was a shock to hear him speak after being so long silent he shivered then nodded i will wait min hesitated but if two warders could not stop him from doing anything stupid a roomful of aes sedai certainly could when she reached the door a chunky bay gelding was being led away by a man with the look of a groom brynes horse she supposed their own mounts were nowhere in sight so much for any dash for freedom ill honor the bloody thing i will but they cant keep me from rand now ive done what siuan wanted they have to let me go to him the only problem was that aes sedai decided for themselves what they had to do and usually what other people had to do as well siuan nearly knocked her down bustling back in with a scowl on her face a blanket roll under her arm and saddlebags over her shoulder watch logain she hissed under her breath without slowing let no one talk to him she marched to the foot of the stairs where a grayhaired woman a servant was starting to lead bryne up and fell in behind from the stare she fixed on the mans back he should have been praying she did not reach for her belt knife min smiled at the tall slender warder who had followed her to the door he stood ten feet away barely glancing at her but she had no illusions were guests now friends he did not return the smile bloody stonefaced men why could they not at least give you a hint what they were thinking logain was still studying the aes sedai when she got back to the table a fine time for siuan to want him kept silent just when he was beginning to show life again she needed to talk to siuan logain she said softly hoping neither of the warders lounging against the wall could hear they had hardly seemed to breathe since taking their positions except when one had followed her i dont think you should say anything until mara tells you what she has planned not to anyone mara he gave her a dark sneer you mean siuan sanche so he remembered what he had heard in his daze does anyone here look as if they want to talk to me he returned to his frowning study no one did look as if they wanted to talk with a gentled false dragon except for the two warders no one seemed to be paying them any mind at all if she had not known better she would have said the aes sedai in the room were excited they had hardly appeared lethargic before but they certainly seemed to have more energy now talking in small groups issuing brisk orders to warders the papers they had been so intent on largely lay abandoned sheriam and the others who had taken siuan away had returned to the room at the back but leane had two clerks at her table now both women writing as fast as they could and a steady stream of aes sedai were coming into the inn disappearing through that rough plank door and not coming out whatever had happened in there siuan had surely stirred them up min wished she had siuan at the table or better yet somewhere alone for five minutes doubtless at that moment she was beating bryne over the head with his saddlebags no siuan would not resort to that for all of her glares bryne was not like logain larger than life in every dimension every emotion logain had managed to overpower siuan for a time with sheer hugeness bryne was quiet reserved not a small man certainly but hardly overbearing she would not want the man she remembered from kore springs as an enemy but she did not think that he would hold out long against siuan he might think she was going to meekly serve out her time as his servant but min had no doubts who would end doing what who wanted she just had to talk to the woman about him as if mins thoughts had brought her siuan came stumping down the stairs a bundle of white under her arm stalked down was nearer truth if she had had a tail she would have been lashing it she paused for one instant staring at min and logain then marched toward the door that led to the kitchens stay here min cautioned logain and please say nothing until siuan can talk to you she was going to have to get used to calling people by their right names again he did not even look at her she caught up with siuan in a hallway short of the kitchen the rattle and splash of pots being scrubbed and dishes washed drifted through gaps where boards had dried in the kitchen door siuans eyes widened in alarm why did you leave him is he still alive hell live forever for all i can see siuan no one wants to talk to him but i have to talk with you siuan stuffed the white bundle into her arms shirts what is this gareth bloody brynes bloody laundry the other woman snarled since you are one of his serving girls too you can wash them i must speak with logain before anyone else min caught her arm as she tried to brush past you can spare one minute to listen when bryne came in i had a viewing an aura and a bull ripping roses from around its neck and none of it matters except the aura i didnt even really understand that but more than anything else how much did you understand if you want to stay alive you had better stay close to him despite the heat min shivered she had only ever had one other viewing with an if in it and both had been potentially deadly it was bad enough sometimes knowing what would happen if she started knowing what might all i know is this if he stays close to you you live if he gets too far away for too long you are going to die both of you i dont know why i should have seen anything about you in his aura but you seemed like part of it siuans smile would have done to peel a pear id as soon sail in a rotting hull full of last months eels i never thought hed follow us are they really going to make us go with him oh no min he is going to lead our armies to victory and make my life the pit of doom so hes going to save my life is he i dont know that it is worth it taking a deep breath she smoothed her skirts when you have those washed and ironed bring them to me i will take them up to him you can clean his boots before you go to sleep tonight we have a room a cubbyhole near him so we will be close if he calls to have his bloody pillows plumped she was gone before min could protest staring down at the wadded shirts min was sure that she knew who was going to be doing all of gareth brynes laundry and it was not siuan sanche rand bloody althor fall in love with a man and you ended up doing laundry even if it did belong to another man when she marched into the kitchen to demand a washtub and hot water she was snarling every bit as much as siuan chapter ravens memories of saldaea lying on his bed in the dark in his shirtsleeves kadere idly twirled one of his large kerchiefs between his hands the wagons open windows let in moonlight but not much breeze at least cairhien was cooler than the waste someday he hoped to return to saldaea to walk in the garden where his sister teodora had taught him his first letters and numbers he missed her as much as he did saldaea the deep winters when trees burst from their sap freezing and the only way to travel was by snowshoes or skis in these southlands spring felt like summer and summer like the pit of doom sweat rolled out of him in streams with a heavy sigh he pushed his fingers into a small gap where the bed was built into the wagon the folded scrap of parchment rustled he left it there he knew the words on it by heart you are not alone among strangers a way has been chosen just that without signature of course he had found it slipped under his door when he retired for the night there was a town not a quarter of a mile away eianrod but even if a soft bed remained empty there he doubted whether the aiel would allow him to spend a night away from the wagons or that the aes sedai would for the moment his plans fit in well enough with moiraines perhaps he would get to see tar valon again a dangerous place for his sort but the work there was always important and invigorating he put his mind back on the note though he wished he could afford to ignore it the word chosen made him sure it came from another darkfriend the first surprise had been receiving it now after crossing most of cairhien nearly two months ago right after jasin natael attached himself to rand althor for reasons the man had never deigned to explain and his new partner keille shaogi had disappeared he suspected she was buried in the waste with a thrust from nataels knife through her heart and small riddance soon after that he had been visited by one of the chosen by lanfear herself she had given him his instructions automatically his hand went to his chest feeling through his shirt the scars branded there he mopped his face with the kerchief part of his mind thought coldly as it had at least once a day since that they were an effective way to prove to him that it had not been an ordinary dream an ordinary nightmare another part of him almost gibbered with relief that she had not returned the second surprise of the note had been the hand a womans hand unless he missed his guess by a mile and some of the letters formed in what he now knew for an aiel way natael had told him that there must be darkfriends among the aiel there were darkfriends in every land among every people but he had never wanted to find brothers in the waste aiel would kill you as soon as look at you and you could put a foot wrong with them by breathing taken all in all the note spelled disaster possibly natael had told some aiel darkfriend who he was angrily twirling the kerchief to a long thin cord he snapped it tight between his hands if the gleeman and keille had not had proofs that they stood high in darkfriend councils he would have killed them both before going near the waste the only other possibility made his stomach leaden a way has been chosen maybe that had only been to put the word chosen down and maybe it was meant to tell him that one of the chosen had decided to use him the note had not come from lanfear she would simply have spoken to him in his dreams once more in spite of the heat he shivered yet he had to wipe his face again too he had the feeling that lanfear was a jealous mistress to serve but if another of the chosen wanted him he would have no choice despite all the promises made when he had given his oaths as a boy he was a man of few illusions caught between two of the chosen he could be flattened like a kitten beneath a wagon wheel and they would notice as much as the wagon did he wished he were home in saldaea he wished he could see teodora again a scraping at the door brought him to his feet for all his bulk he was more agile than he let anyone see mopping his face and neck he made his way past the brick stove that he certainly had no need for here and the cabinets with their ornately carved and painted uprights when he pulled the door open a slender figure swathed in black robes scurried in past him he took one quick look around the moonlit darkness to make certain no one was watching the drivers were all snoring beneath the other wagons and the aiel guards never came among the wagons themselves and quickly shut the door again you must be hot isendre he chuckled take off that robe and make yourself comfortable thank you no she said bitterly from the shadowed depths of her cowl she stood stiffly but every now and then she twitched the wool must be even itchier than usual tonight he chuckled again as you wish beneath those robes he suspected the maidens of the spear still allowed her to wear nothing but the stolen jewelry if that she had become prudish in ways since the maidens had her why the woman had been stupid enough to steal he could not understand he had certainly made no objections when they dragged her screaming from the wagon by her hair he was only glad that they had not thought he was involved her greediness had certainly made his task more difficult have you anything to report on althor or natael a major part of lanfears instruction had been to keep a close eye on those two and he knew no better way to keep an eye on a man than to put a woman in his bed any man told his bedmate things he had vowed to keep secret boasted of his plans revealed his weaknesses even if he was the dragon reborn and this dawn fellow the aiel called him she shuddered visibly at least i can come near natael come near him once the maidens had caught her sneaking to the mans tent they had practically begun stuffing her into it every night she always put the best face on matters not that he tells me anything wait be patient keep silent make accommodation with fate whatever that means he says that every time i try to ask a question for the most part all he wants to do is play music ive never heard before and make love she never had anything more to say about the gleeman for the hundredth time he wondered why lanfear wanted natael watched the man was supposed to be as high as a darkfriend could reach only a step below the chosen themselves i take it that means you still have not managed to wriggle into althors bed he asked brushing past her to sit down on the bed no she writhed uncomfortably then you will have to try harder wont you i am growing tired of failure isendre and our masters are not as patient as i hes only a man whatever his titles she had often boasted to him that she could have any man she wanted and make him do whatever she wanted she had shown him the truth of her boasts she had not needed to steal jewelry he would have bought her anything she wanted he had bought her more than he could afford the bloody maidens cant watch him every second and once you are in his bed hell not let them harm you one taste of her would be enough for that i have full faith and confidence in your abilities no if anything the word was shorter this time he rolled and unrolled the kerchief irritably no is not a word our masters like to hear isendre that meant their lords among the darkfriends not all lords or ladies by any means a groom might give orders to lady a beggar to a magistrate but their commands were at least as strictly enforced as any nobles and usually more so not a word our mistress will like to hear isendre shuddered she had not believed his tale until he showed her the burns on his chest but since then one mention of lanfear had been enough to quell any rebellion on her part this time she began to weep i cannot hadnan when we stopped tonight i thought i might have a chance in a town instead of tents but they caught me before i got within ten paces of him she pushed back her hood and he gaped as moonlight played over her bare scalp even her eyebrows were gone they shaved me hadnan adelin and enaila and jolien they held me down and shaved every hair they beat me with with nettles hadnan she shook like sapling in high wind sobbing slackmouthed and mumbling the words i itch from shoulders to knees and burn too much to scratch they said theyd make me wear nettles the next time i so much as looked in his direction they meant it hadnan they did they said theyd give me to aviendha and they told me what she would do i cannot hadnan not again i cannot stunned he stared at her she had had such lovely dark hair yet she was beautiful enough that even being bald as an egg only made her seem exotic her tears and sagging face detracted only a little if she could put herself into althors bed for just one night it was not going to happen the maidens had broken her he had broken people himself and he knew the signs eagerness to avoid more punishment became eagerness to obey the mind never wanted to admit it was running from something so she would soon convince herself that she really wanted to obey that she really wanted nothing more than to please the maidens what does aviendha have to do with it he muttered how soon before isendre felt the need to confess her sins as well althor has been bedding her since rhuidean you fool she spends every night with him the maidens think she will marry him even through her sobs he could detect resentful fury she would not like it that another had succeeded where she failed doubtless that was why she had not told him before aviendha was a beautiful woman despite her fierce eyes fullbreasted compared to most of the maidens yet he would stack isendre against her if only isendre slumped in the moonlight coming through the windows quivering from head to toe sobbing openmouthed tears rolling down her cheeks that she did not even bother to wipe away she would grovel on the ground if aviendha frowned at her very well he said gently if you cannot then you cannot you can still pry something out of natael i know you can rising he took her shoulders to turn her toward the door she flinched away from his touch but she did turn natael will not want to look at me for days she said petulantly around hiccoughs and sniffs sobs threatened to break out again any moment but his tone seemed to have soothed her im red hadnan as red as if i had laid naked in the sun for a day and my hair it will take forever to grow ba as she reached for the door her eyes going to the handle he had the kerchief spun to a cord in an instant and around her neck he tried to ignore her rasping gurgles the frantic scraping of her feet on the floor her fingers clawed at his hands but he stared straight ahead even keeping his eyes open he saw teodora he always did when he killed a woman he had loved his sister but she had discovered what he was and she would not have kept silent isendres heels drummed violently but after what seemed an eternity they slowed went still and she became a dead weight dragging at his hands he held the cord tight for a count of sixty before unwinding it and letting her fall she would have been confessing next confessing to being a darkfriend pointing a finger at him rummaging in the cabinets by touch he pulled out butchering knife disposing of a whole corpse would be difficult but luckily the dead did not bleed much the robe would absorb what little there was maybe he could find the woman who had left the note under his door if she was not pretty enough she must have friends who were also darkfriends natael would not care if it was an aiel woman who visited him kadere would rather have bedded a viper himself aiel were dangerous and maybe an aiel would have a better chance than isendre against aviendha kneeling he hummed quietly to himself as he worked a lullaby that teodora had taught him chapter dragon a wager a soft night breeze stirred across the small town of eianrod then faded sitting on the stone rail of the wide flat bridge in the heart of the town rand supposed the breeze was hot yet it hardly felt so after the waste warm for nighttime perhaps but not enough to make him unbutton his red coat the river below him had never been large and was half its normal width now yet he still enjoyed watching the water flow north moonshadows cast by scudding clouds playing across the darkly glittering surface that was why he was out here in the night really to look at running water for a time his wards were set surrounding the aiel encampment that itself surrounded the town the aiel themselves kept a watch a sparrow could not pierce unseen he could waste an hour being soothed by the flow of a river it was surely better than another night where he had to order moiraine to leave so he could study with asmodean she had even taken to bringing his meals to him and talking while he ate as if she meant to cram everything she knew into his head before they reached the city of cairhien he could not face her begging to remain actually begging as she had the previous night for a woman like moiraine that behavior was so unnatural that he had wanted to agree simply to stop it which was very likely why she had done it much better an hour listening to the quiet liquid ripplings of the river with luck she would have given up on him for tonight the eight or ten paces of clay between water and weeds on both sides below him was dried and cracked he peered up at the clouds crossing the moon he could try to make those clouds give rain the towns two fountains were both dry and dust lay in a third of the wells not fouled beyond cleaning try was the word though he had made it rain once remembering how was the trick if he managed that then he could try not to make it a drowning deluge and a treesnapping windstorm this time asmodean would be no help he did not know much about weather it seemed for every thing the man taught him there were two more that made asmodean either throw up his hands or give a lick and a promise once he had thought that the forsaken knew everything that they were all but omnipotent but if the others were like asmodean they had ignorances as well as weaknesses it might actually be that he already knew more of some things than they than some of them at least the problem would be finding out who semirhage was almost as poor at handling weather as asmodean he shivered as if this were night in the threefold land asmodean had never told him that better to listen to the water and not think if he meant to sleep at all tonight sulin approached him the shoufa around her shoulders so it uncovered her short white hair and leaned on the railing the wiry maiden was armed for battle bow and arrows spears and knife and buckler she had taken command of his bodyguard tonight two dozen more far dareis mai squatted easily on the bridge ten paces away an odd night she said we were gambling but suddenly everyone was throwing nothing but sixes i am sorry he told her without thinking and she gave him a peculiar look she did not know of course he had not spread it about the ripples he gave off as taveren spread out in odd random ways even the aiel would not want to be within ten miles of him if they knew the ground had given way beneath three stone dogs today dropping them into a viper pit but none of the dozens of bites had found anything but cloth he knew that had been him bending chance tal nethin the saddlemaker had survived taien to trip on a stone this very noon and break his neck falling on flat grassy ground rand was afraid that had been him too on the other hand bael and jheran had mended the blood feud between shaarad and goshien while he was with them eating a midday meal of dried meat on the move they still did not like each other and hardly seemed to understand what they had done but it was done with pledges and water oaths given each man holding the cup for the other to drink to aiel water oaths were stronger than any other it might be generations before shaarad and goshien so much as raided each other for sheep or goats or cattle he had wondered if those random effects would ever work in his favor maybe this was as close as it came what else had happened today that might be laid at his feet he did not know he never asked and would as soon not hear the baels and jherans could only partly make up for the tal nethins ive not seen enaila or adelin for days he said it was as good a change of subject as any that pair in particular had seemed to be jealous of their places guarding him are they ill if anything the look sulin gave him was even more peculiar they will return when they learn to stop playing with dolls rand althor he opened his mouth then closed it again aiel were strange aviendhas lessons often made them more so not less but this was ridiculous well tell them they are grown women and they ought to act it even by moonlight he could tell that her smile was pleased it shall be as the caracarn wishes what did that mean she eyed him a moment lips pursed thoughtfully you have not eaten yet tonight there is still enough food for everyone and you will not fill one belly by going hungry yourself if you do not eat people will worry that you are ill you will become ill he laughed softly a hoarse wheeze the caracarn one minute and the next if he did not fetch something to eat sulin would probably go get it for him and try to feed him to boot i will eat moiraine must be in her blankets by now this time her odd look was satisfying for a change he had said something that she did not understand as he swung his feet down he heard the ring of horses hooves walking down the stonepaved street toward the bridge every maiden was upright in an instant face veiled half nocked arrows his hand went to his waist by instinct but the sword was not there the aiel felt strange enough about him riding a horse and carrying the thing at his saddle he had not seen any need to offend their customs more by wearing it besides there were not many horses and they were coming at a walk when they appeared surrounded by an escort of fifty aiel the riders numbered fewer than twenty slumping in their saddles dejectedly most wore rimmed helmets and tairen coats with puffy striped sleeves beneath their breastplates the pair in the lead had ornately gilded cuirasses and large white plumes attached to the front of their helmets and the stripes on their sleeves had the glisten of satin in the moonlight halfadozen men at the rear though shorter and slighter than the tairens two with small banners called con on short staffs harnessed to their backs wore dark coats and helmets shaped like bells cut away to expose their faces cairhienin used the banners to pick out officers in battle and also to mark a lords personal retainers the tairens with plumes stared when they saw him exchanged startled glances then scrambled down to come kneel before him helmets under their arms they were young little older than he both with dark beards trimmed to neat points in the fashion of tairen nobility dents marred their breastplates and the gilding was chipped they had been crossing swords somewhere neither as much as glanced at the aiel surrounding them as if when ignored they would disappear the maidens unveiled though they looked no less ready to put spear or arrow through the kneeling men rhuarc followed the tairens with a grayeyed aiel younger and slightly taller than he and stood behind mangin was of the jindo taardad and one of those who had gone to the stone of tear jindo had brought in the riders my lord dragon the plump pinkcheeked lordling said burn my soul but have they taken you prisoner his companion jug ears and potato nose making him look a farmer despite his beard kept sweeping lanky hair from his forehead nervously they said they were taking us to some dawn fellow the caracarn means something about chiefs if i remember what my tutor said forgive me my lord dragon i am edorion of house selorna and this is estean of house andiama i am he who comes with the dawn rand told them quietly and the caracarn he had them placed now young lords who had spent their time drinking gambling and chasing women when he was in the stone esteans eyes nearly popped out of his face edorion looked as surprised for a moment then nodded slowly as if he suddenly saw how it made sense stand who are your cairhienin companions it would be interesting to meet cairhienin who were not running for their lives from the shaido and any other aiel they saw for that matter if they were with edorion and estean they might be the first supporters he had met in this land if the two tairens fathers had followed his orders bring them forward estean blinked in surprise as he rose but edorion barely paused in turning to shout meresin daricain come here much like calling dogs the cairhienins banners bobbed as they dismounted slowly my lord dragon estean hesitated licking his lips as though thirsty did you did you send the aiel against cairhien theyve attacked the city then rhuarc nodded and mangin said if these are to be believed cairhien still holds or did three days ago there was little doubt that he did not think it still did and less that he cared about a city of treekillers i did not send them estean rand said as they were joined by the two cairhienin who knelt doffing their helmets to reveal men of an age with edorion and estean their hair shaved back in line with their ears and their dark eyes wary those who attack the city are my enemies the shaido i mean to save cairhien if it can be saved he had to go through the business of telling the cairhienin to rise his time with the aiel had almost made him forget the habit this side of the spine of the world bowing and kneeling right and left he had to ask for introductions too and the cairhienin gave them themselves lieutenant lord meresin of house daganred his con was all wavy vertical lines of red and white and lieutenant lord daricain of house annallin his con covered with small squares of red and black it was a surprise that they were lords though lords commanded and led soldiers in cairhien they did not shave their heads and become soldiers or had not much had changed apparently my lord dragon meresin stumbled a bit saying that he and daricain were both pale slender men with narrow faces and long noses but he was a bit the heavier neither looked as if he had had much to eat lately meresin rushed on as if afraid of being interrupted my lord dragon cairhien can hold for days yet perhaps as many as ten or twelve but you must come quickly if you are to save it that is why we came out estean said shooting meresin a dark look both cairhienin returned it but their defiance was tinged with resignation estean raked stringy hair from his forehead to find help parties have been sent in every direction my lord dragon he shivered despite the sweat on his brow and his voice turned distant and hollow there were more of us when we started i saw baran go down screaming with a spear through his guts hell never turn a card at chop again i could use a mug of strong brandy edorion turned his helmet in gauntleted hands frowning my lord dragon the city can hold a while longer but even if these aiel will fight those the question is can you bring them there in time i think ten or twelve days is a more than generous estimate myself in truth i only came because i thought dying with a spear through me would be better than being taken alive when they made it over the walls the city is packed with refugees who fled ahead of the aiel there isnt a dog or a pigeon left in the city and i doubt there will be a rat left soon the one good thing is that no one seems to be worrying very much about who will take the sun throne not with this couladin outside he called on us to surrender to he who comes with the dawn on the second day daricain put in earning a sharp look from edorion for the interruption couladin has some sport with prisoners estean said out of bowshot but where anyone on the walls can see you can hear them screaming too the light burn my soul i dont know whether he is trying to break our will or simply likes it sometimes they let peasants make a run for the city then shoot them full of arrows when theyre almost safe however safe cairhien is only peasants but he trailed off and swallowed hard as if he had just remembered what rands opinions were of only peasants rand just looked at him but he seemed to shrivel and muttered under his breath about brandy edorion leaped into the momentary silence my lord dragon the point is that the city can hold until you come if you can come quickly we only beat back the first assault because the foregate caught fire flames nearly took the city estean interjected the foregate a city in itself outside the walls of cairhien had been mostly wood as rand remembered would have been disaster if the river was not right there the other tairen went on right over him but lord meilan has the defense well planned and the cairhienin appear to be keeping their backbones for the time that earned him frowns from meresin and daricain that he either did not see or pretended not to seven days with luck perhaps eight at most if you can a heavy sigh abruptly seemed to deflate edorions plumpness i did not see one horse he said as if to himself the aiel do not ride you will never be able to move men afoot so far in time how long rand asked rhuarc seven days was the reply mangin nodded and estean laughed burn my soul it took us as long to reach here on horses if you think you can make the return in the same afoot you must be becoming aware of the aiel eyes on him estean scrubbed the hair from his face is there any brandy in this town he muttered it isnt how fast we can make it rand said quietly but how fast you can if you dismount some of your men and use their horses for spares i want to let meilan and cairhien know that help is on the way but whoever goes will have to be sure he can keep his mouth shut if the shaido take him i do not intend to let couladin know any more than he can learn on his own estean went whiter in the face than the cairhienin meresin and daricain were on their knees together each seizing one of rands hands to kiss he let them with as much patience as he could find one bit of moiraines advice that had the ring of common sense was not to offend peoples customs however strange or even repulsive unless you absolutely had to and even then think twice we will go my lord dragon meresin said breathlessly thank you my lord dragon thank you under the light i vow i will die before revealing a word to any but my father or the high lord meilan grace favor you my lord dragon the other added grace favor you and the light illumine you forever i am your man to the death rand let meresin say that he also was rands man before taking his hands back firmly and telling them to stand he did not like the way they were looking at him edorion had called them like hounds but men should not look at anyone as if they were dogs gazing at a master edorion drew a deep breath puffing his pink cheeks and let it out slowly i suppose if i made it out in one piece i can make it back in my lord dragon forgive me if i offend but would you care to wager say a thousand gold crowns that you can really come in seven days rand stared at him the man was as bad as mat i dont have a hundred crowns silver much less a thousand in sulin broke in he has it tairen she said firmly he will meet your wager if you make it ten thousand by weight edorion laughed done aiel and worth every copper if i lose come to think ill not live to collect if i win come meresin daricain it sounded as if he were summoning dogs to heel we ride rand waited until the three had made their bows and were halfway back to the horses before rounding on the whitehaired maiden what do you mean i have a thousand gold crowns ive never seen a thousand crowns much less ten thousand the maidens exchanged glances as if he were demented so did rhuarc and mangin a fifth of the treasure that was in the stone of tear belongs to those who took the stone and will be claimed when they can carry it away sulin spoke as to a child instructing it in the simple facts of everyday life as chief and battle leader there one tenth of that fifth is yours tear submitted to you as chief by right of triumph so one tenth of tear is yours as well and you have said we can take the fifth in these lands a tax you called it she fumbled the word the aiel did not have taxes the tenth part of that is yours also as caracarn rand shook his head in all of his talks with aviendha he had never thought to ask whether the fifth applied to him he was not aiel caracarn or no and it had not seemed anything to do with him well it might not be a tax but he could use it as kings did taxes unfortunately he had only the vaguest idea how that was he would have to ask moiraine that was one thing she had missed in her lectures perhaps she thought it so obvious that he should know elayne would have known what taxes were used for it had certainly been more fun taking advice from her than from moiraine he wished he knew where she was still in tanchico probably egwene told him little more than a constant string of wellwishings he wished he could sit elayne down and make her explain those two letters maiden of the spear or daughterheir of andor women were strange except maybe min she had laughed at him but she had never made him think she was speaking some strange language she would not laugh now if he ever saw her again she would run a hundred miles to get away from the dragon reborn edorion dismounted all his men taking one of their horses and stringing the others together by their reins along with esteans no doubt he was saving his own for the final sprint through the shaido merisin and daricain did the same with their men though it meant that the cairhienin had only two spare mounts apiece no one seemed to think they should have any of the tairen horses they clattered off together westward at a trot with a jindo escort carefully not looking at anyone estean started to drift toward the soldiers standing uneasily in a circle of aiel at the foot of the bridge mangin caught his redstriped sleeve you can tell us conditions inside cairhien wetlander the lumpyfaced man looked ready to faint i am certain he will answer any questions you ask rand said sharply emphasizing the final word they will only be asked rhuarc said taking the tairens other arm he and mangin seemed to be holding the much shorter man up between them warning the citys defenders is well and good rand althor rhuarc went on but we should send scouts running they can reach cairhien as soon as those men on horses and meet us coming back with word of how couladin has disposed the shaido rand could feel the maidens eyes on him but he looked straight at rhuarc thunder walkers he suggested shamad conde rhuarc agreed he and mangin turned estean they were holding him up and started toward the other soldiers ask rand called after them he is your ally and my liege man he had no idea whether estean was that last or not it was another thing to ask moiraine or even how much of an ally he really was his father the high lord torean had plotted against rand enough but he would allow nothing close to couladins ways rhuarc turned his head and nodded you tend your people well rand althor sulins voice was flat as a planed plank i try he told her he was not about to rise to the bait whoever went to scout the shaido some would not return and that was that i think i will have something to eat now and get some sleep it could not be much more than two hours to midnight and sunrise still came early this time of year the maidens followed him watching the shadows warily as if they expected attack handtalk flickering among them but then aiel always seemed to expect attack chapter spears and shield the far snows the streets of eianrod ran straight and met at right angles where necessary slicing through hills that were otherwise neatly terraced with stone the slateroofed stone buildings had an angular look as if they were all vertical lines eianrod had not fallen to couladin no people had been there when the shaido swept through a good many of the houses were only charred beams and hollow ruined shells however including most of the wide threestory marble buildings with balconies that moiraine said had belonged to merchants broken furniture and clothes littered the streets along with shattered dishes and shards of glass from windows single boots and tools and toys the burning had come at different times rand could tell that much himself from the weathering of blackened timbers and how much smell of char lingered where but lan had been able to chart the flow of battles by which the town had been taken and retaken by different houses contending for the sun throne most likely though from the look of the streets the last to hold eianrod had been brigands a good many of the bands roaming cairhien held allegiance to no one and to nothing except gold it was to one of the merchants houses that rand went on the largest of the towns two squares three square stories of gray marble with heavy balconies and wide steps with thick angular stone siderails overlooking a silent fountain with a dusty round basin a chance to sleep in a bed again had been too good to pass up and he had hopes that aviendha would choose to remain in a tent whether his or with the wise ones he did not care so long as he did not have to try going to sleep while listening to her breathe a few paces away recently he had begun imagining he could hear her heart beat even when he had not taken hold of saidin but if she did not stay away he had taken precautions the maidens stopped at the steps some trotting around the building to take positions on all sides he had feared that they would try declaring this a roof of the maidens even for the one night and so as soon as he had chosen the building one of the few in town with a sound roof and most of the windows unbroken he had told sulin that he was declaring it the roof of the winespring brothers no one could enter who had not drunk from the winespring in emonds field from the look she had given him she knew very well what he was up to but none of them followed him beyond the wide doors that seemed to be all narrow vertical panels inside the large rooms were bare though whiterobed gaishain had spread a few blankets for themselves in the broad entry hall its high plaster ceiling worked in a pattern of severe squares keeping gaishain out was beyond him even had he wanted to as much so as keeping moiraine out if she was not asleep elsewhere whatever orders he gave about not being disturbed she always found a way to make the maidens let her by and it always took a direct command for her to go before she would leave the gaishain rose smoothly men and women before he had the door closed they would not sleep until he did and some would take turns remaining awake in case he wanted something in the night he had tried ordering them not to but telling a gaishain not to serve according to custom was like kicking a bale of wool whatever impression you made was gone as soon as your toes were he waved them away and climbed the marble stairs some of those gaishain had salvaged a few bits of furniture including a bed and two feather mattresses and he was looking forward to washing and he froze as soon as he opened the door to his bedchamber aviendha had not chosen to remain with the tents she stood before the washstand with its mismatched cracked bowl and pitcher a cloth in one hand and a bar of yellow soap in the other she had no clothes on she seemed as stunned as he as incapable of moving i she stopped to swallow big green eyes locked on his face i could not make a sweat tent here in this town so i thought i would try your way of she was hard muscle and soft curves she glistened damply from head to feet he had never imagined that her legs were so long i thought you would remain longer at the bridge i her voice rose in pitch her eyes widened in panic i did not arrange for you to see me i must get away from you as far away as i can i must suddenly a shimmering vertical line appeared in the air near her it widened as if rotating into a gateway icy wind rushed through it into the room carrying thick curtains of snow i must get away she wailed and darted through into the blizzard immediately the gateway began to narrow again turning but without thought rand channeled blocking it at half its former width he did not know what he had done or how but he was sure this was a gateway for traveling such as asmodean had told him of and been unable to teach him there was no time for thinking wherever aviendha had gone she had gone naked into the heart of a winter storm rand tied off the flows he had woven as he ripped all the blankets from the bed and tossed them onto her clothes and pallet seizing blankets clothes and rugs all together he plunged through only moments behind her icy wind screamed through night air filled with swirling white even wrapped in the void he could feel his body shivering dimly he could make out scattered shapes in the darkness trees he thought there was nothing for him to smell but cold ahead of him a form moved obscured by darkness and the snowstorm he might have missed it but for the sharpness of his eyes in the void aviendha running as hard as she could he lumbered after her through snow to his knees clutching the thick bundle to his chest aviendha stop he was afraid that the howling wind would sweep his shout away but she heard and if anything ran faster he forced himself to more speed staggering and tripping as the deepening snow tugged at his boots the prints left by her bare feet were filling fast if he lost sight of her in this stop you fool woman are you trying to kill yourself the sound of his voice seemed to flog her to run harder grimly he pushed himself halffalling and scrambling back up knocked down by the hurtling wind as often as stumbling in the snow blundering into trees he had to keep his eyes on her he was only thankful this forest or whatever it was had trees so far apart plans skittered across the void and were discarded he could try quelling the storm and maybe the result would turn the air to ice a shelter of air to keep the falling snow away would do nothing for that underfoot he could melt a path for himself with fire and slog through mud instead unless he channeled and the snow ahead of him melted in a band a span wide a band that ran ahead of him as he did steam rose and falling snow vanished a foot above the sandy soil he could feel the heat of it through his boots down almost to his ankles his body shook with the bonechilling cold his feet sweated and flinched away from the heated ground but he was catching up now another five minutes and suddenly the vague shape he had been following vanished as if she had fallen into a hole keeping his eyes fixed on the spot where he had last seen her he ran as hard as he could abruptly he was splashing in icy flowing water to his ankles halfway to his knees ahead of him the melting snow revealed more and an edge of ice inching slowly back no steam rose from the black water stream or river it was too big for the amount of his channeling to warm the swiftmoving flow even a hair she must have run out onto the ice and fallen through but he would not save her by trying to wade into this filled with saidin he was barely aware of the cold but his teeth chattered uncontrollably retreating to the bank gaze locked on where he thought aviendha had gone down he channeled flows of fire into ground still bare well back from the stream until the sand melted and fused and glowed white even in this storm that would stay hot for a time he set the bundle down in the snow beside it her life would depend on finding the blankets and rugs again then waded through the deep white to one side of the melted path and lay flat slowly he crawled out onto the snowcovered ice the wind shrieked across him his coat might as well not have existed his hands were numb now and his feet going he had stopped shivering except for an occasional shudder coldly calm inside the void he knew what was happening there were blizzards in the two rivers perhaps even as bad as this his body was being overwhelmed if he did not find warmth soon he would be able to calmly watch from the void as he died but if he died aviendha would too if she had not already he felt rather than heard the ice cracking beneath his weight his probing hands fell into water this was the place but with snow whirling about he could barely see he flailed searching numb hands splashing one hit something at the edge of the ice and he commanded his fingers to close felt frozen hair crackling got to pull her out he crawled backward hauling at her she was a dead weight sliding slowly out of the water dont care if the ice scrapes her better that than freezing or drowning back keep moving if you quit she dies keep moving burn you crawling pulling with his legs pushing with one hand the other locked in aviendhas hair no time to get a better grip she could not feel it anyway youve had it easy for too long lords kneeling and gaishain running to fetch your wine and moiraine doing as shes told back time to do something yourself if you still can move you flaming fatherless son of a spavined goat keep moving suddenly his feet hurt the pain began creeping up his legs it took him a moment to look back and then he rolled off the steaming patch of melted sand tendrils of smoke where his breeches had begun smoldering were whisked away by the wind fumbling for the bundle he had left he swathed aviendha from head to foot in all of it the blankets the rugs of her pallet her clothes every bit of protection was vital her eyes were closed and she did not move he parted the blankets enough to put an ear to her chest her heart beat so slowly that he was not sure he was really hearing it even four blankets and half a dozen rugs were not enough and he could not channel heat into her as he had the ground even fining the flow as much as possible he was more likely to kill than warm he could feel the weave he had used to block open her gateway a mile or perhaps two away through the storm if he tried to carry her that far neither of them would survive they needed shelter and they needed it here he channeled flows of air and snow began to move across the ground against the wind building into thick square walls three paces on a side with one gap for a door building higher compacting the snow till it glistened like ice roofing it over high enough to stand scooping aviendha into his arms he stumbled into the dark interior weaving and tying flames dancing in the corners for light channeling to scoop more snow to close the doorway just with the wind shut away it felt warmer but that would not be enough using the trick asmodean had shown him he wove air and fire and the air around them grew warmer he did not dare tie that weave off if he feel asleep it could grow and melt the hut for that matter the flames were almost as dangerous to leave but he was too boneweary and chilled to maintain more than one weave the ground inside had been cleared as he built bare sandy soil with only a few brown leaves he did not recognize and some scruffy low dead weeds that were equally strange to him releasing the weave that warmed the air he heated the ground enough to take away the iciness then took up the other weave again it was all he could do to lay aviendha down gently rather than drop her he pushed a hand inside the blankets to feel her cheek her shoulder trickles of water ran across her face as her hair melted he was cold but she was ice she needed every scrap of warmth he could find for her and he did not dare warm the air more already the insides of the walls shone with a faint layer of melt however frozen he felt he had more heat in him than she did stripping off his clothes he climbed into the coverings with her arranging his own damp garments on the outside they could help hold in the body heat his sense of touch enhanced by the void and saidin soaked in the feel of her her skin made silk feel rough compared to her skin satin was dont think he smoothed damp hair away from her face he should have dried it but the water no longer felt so cold and there was nothing but the blankets or their clothes to use anyway her eyes were closed her chest stirred against him slowly her head lay on his arm snuggled against his chest if she had not felt like winter itself she could have been sleeping so peaceful not angry at all so beautiful stop thinking it was a sharp command outside the emptiness surrounding him talk he tried talking of the first thing that came to mind elayne and the confusion her two letters brought but that soon had thoughts of goldenhaired elayne drifting across the void of kissing her in secluded spots in the stone dont think of kissing fool he shifted to min he had never thought about min that way well a few dreams could not count min would have slapped his face if he had ever tried to kiss her or else laughed and called him a woolhead only it seemed that speaking of any woman reminded him that he had his arms around a woman who had no clothes on filled with the power he could smell the scent of her feel every inch of her as clearly as if he were running his hands the void trembled light youre only trying to warm her keep your mind out of the pigsty man trying to drive thought away he talked of his hopes for cairhien to bring peace and an end to the famine to bring the nations behind him without any more bloodshed but that had its own life too its own inevitable path to shayol ghul where he must face the dark one and die if the prophecies were true it seemed cowardly to say that he hoped he might live through that somehow aiel did not know cowardice the worst of them was brave as a lion the breaking of the world killed the weak he had heard bad say and the threefold land killed the cowards he began speaking of where they might be where she had brought them with her wild senseless flight somewhere far and strange to have snow at this time of year it had been worse than a senseless flight mad yet he knew that she had fled from him fled from him how she must hate him if she had to flee as far as she could rather than just tell him to leave her to her bath in privacy i should have knocked at his own bedroom door i know you do not want to be around me you dont have to be whatever the wise ones want whatever they say you are going back to their tents you will not have to come near me again in fact if you do i ill send you away why hesitate on that she gave him anger coldness bitterness when she was awake and asleep it was a crazy thing to do you could have killed yourself he was stroking her hair again he could not seem to stop if you ever do anything half so crazy again ill break your neck do you have any idea how i will miss hearing you breathe at night miss it she drove him crazy with it he was the one who was mad he had to stop this you are going away and thats that if i have to send you back to rhuidean the wise ones cant stop me if i speak as caracarn you wont have to run away from me again the hand that he could not stop from stroking her hair froze as she stirred she was warm he realized very warm he should be wrapping one of the blankets about himself decently and moving away her eyes opened clear and deep green staring at him seriously from not a foot away she did not seem surprised to see him and she did not pull back he took his arms from around her started to slither away and she seized a handful of his hair in a painful grip if he moved he would have a bald patch she gave him no chance to explain anything i promised my nearsister to watch you she seemed to be speaking to herself as much as to him in a low almost expressionless voice i ran from you as hard as i could to shield my honor and you followed me even here the rings do not lie and i can run no more her tone firmed decisively i will run no more rand tried to ask her what she meant while attempting to untangle her fingers from his hair but she clutched another handful on the other side and pulled his mouth to hers that was the end of rational thought the void shattered and saidin fled he did not think he could have stopped himself had he wanted to only he could not think of wanting to and she certainly did not seem to want him to in fact the last thought he had of any coherency for a very long time was that he did not think he could have stopped her some considerable time later two hours maybe three he could hardly be sure he lay atop the rugs with the blankets over him and his hands behind his head watching aviendha examine the slick white walls they had held a surprising amount of the warmth there was no need to latch on to saidin again either to shut out cold or to try warming the air she had done no more than rake her fingers through her hair on rising and she moved completely unashamed at her nakedness of course it was a bit late to be ashamed of something as small as having no clothes on he had been worried about hurting her when dragging her out of the water but she showed fewer scrapes than he did and somehow they did not seem to mar her beauty at all what is this she asked snow he explained what snow was as best he could but she only shook her head partly in wonderment partly disbelief for someone who had grown up in the waste frozen water falling from the sky must seem as impossible as flying according to the records the only time it had ever even rained in the waste was the time he had made it he could not stop a sigh of regret when she began pulling her shift over her head the wise ones can marry us as soon as we get back he could still feel his weave holding her gateway open aviendhas dark reddish head popped through the neck of the shift and she stared at him flatly not unfriendly but not friendly either determined though what makes you think a man has the right to ask me that besides you belong to elayne after a moment he managed to close his mouth aviendha we just the two of us light we have to marry now not that im doing it because i have to he added hastily i want to he was not sure of that at all really he thought he might love her but he thought he might love elayne too and for some reason min kept creeping in youre as big a lecher as mat but for once he could do what was right because it was right she sniffed at him and felt her stockings to be sure they were dry then sat down to don them egwene has spoken to me of your two rivers marriage customs you want to wait a year he asked incredulously the year yes that is what i meant he had never realized before how much leg a woman showed pulling on a stocking odd that that could seem so thrilling after he had seen her naked and sweating and he concentrated on listening to her egwene said she thought of asking her mothers permission for you but before she mentioned it her mother told her she had to wait another year even if she did have her hair in a braid aviendha frowned one knee almost under her chin is that right she said a girl was not allowed to braid her hair until she was old enough to marry do you understand what i am saying you look like that fish moiraine caught in the river there were no fish in the waste aiel knew them only from books of course i do be said he might as well have been deaf and blind for all he understood shifting under the blankets he made himself sound as sure as he could manage at least well the customs are complicated and i am not certain which part you are talking about she looked at him suspiciously for a moment but aiel customs were so intricate that she believed him in the two rivers you walked out for a year and if you suited then you became betrothed and finally married that was as far as custom went she went on as she dressed i meant about a girl asking her mothers permission during the year and the wisdoms i cannot say i understand that the white blouse going over her head muffled her words for a moment if she wants him and she is old enough to marry why should she need permission but you see by my customs her tone of voice said they were the only ones that mattered it is my place to choose whether to ask you and i will not by your customs fastening her belt she shook her head dismissively i did not have my mothers permission and you would need your fathers i suppose or your fatherbrothers since your father is dead we did not have them so we cannot marry she began folding the scarf to wrap around her forehead i see he said weakly any boy in the two rivers who asked his father for that kind of permission was asking to have his ears soundly boxed when he thought of the lads who had sweated themselves silly worrying that someone anyone would find out what they were doing with the girl they meant to marry for that matter he remembered when nynaeve caught kimry lewin and bar dowtry in bars fathers hayloft kimry had had her hair braided for five years but when nynaeve was through with her mistress lewin had taken over the womens circle had nearly skinned poor bar alive and that was nothing to what they had done to kimry over the month they thought was the shortest decent time to wait for a wedding the joke told quietly where it would not get to the womens circle had been that neither bar nor kimry had been able to sit down the whole first week they were married rand supposed kimry had failed to ask permission but i guess egwene wouldnt know all the mens customs after all he continued women dont know everything you see since i started it we have to marry it doesnt matter about permissions you started it her sniff was pointed and meaning aiel andoran or anything else women used those noises like sticks to prod or thump it does not matter anyway since we are going by aiel customs this will not happen again rand althor he was surprised and pleased to hear regret in her voice you belong to the nearsister of my nearsister i have toh to elayne now but that is none of your concern are you going to lie there forever i have heard that men turn lazy after but it cannot be long until the clans are ready to begin the mornings march you must be there suddenly a stricken look crossed her face and she sagged to her knees if we can return i am not certain that i remember what i did to make the hole rand althor you must find our way back he told her how he had blocked her gateway and could still feel it holding she looked relieved and even smiled at him but it became increasingly clear as she folded her legs and arranged her skirts that she did not mean to turn her back while he dressed fairs fair he muttered after a long moment and scrambled out of the blankets he tried to be as nonchalant as she had been but it was not easy he could feel her eyes like a touch even when he turned away from her she had no call to tell him he had a pretty behind he had not said anything about how pretty hers was she only said it to make him blush anyway women did not look at men that way and they dont ask their mothers permission to he had an idea that life with aviendha had not become one bit easier chapter insectlike horned helmet a short spear there was little discussion even if the storm still raged outside they could make it back to the gateway using the blankets and rugs for cloaks aviendha began dividing them while he seized saidin filling himself with life and death molten fire and liquid ice split them equally he told her he knew his voice was cold and emotionless asmodean had said he could go beyond that but he had not managed to so far she gave him a surprised look but all she said was there is more of you to cover and went on as she was there was no point in arguing in his experience from emonds field to the maidens if a woman wanted to do something for you the only way to stop her was to tie her up especially if it involved sacrifice on her part the surprise was that she had not sounded acid had not said anything about him being a soft wetlander maybe something good besides a memory had come out of this she cant really mean never again he suspected that she meant exactly that though weaving a fingerthin flow of fire he sliced the outline of a door in one wall widening the gap at the top startlingly daylight shone through releasing saidin he exchanged surprised looks with aviendha he knew he had lost track of time you lost track of the year but they could not have been inside that long wherever they were it was a great distance from cairhien he pushed against the block but it did not budge until he put his back to it dug in his heels and shoved with all of his might just as it occurred to him that he very probably could have done this more easily with the power the block toppled outward taking him with it into cold crisp pale daylight not all the way though it stopped at an angle propped against snow that had built up around the hut lying on his back with only a bit of his head sticking out he could see other mounds some smooth drifts around sparse stunted trees that he did not recognize others maybe burying bushes or boulders he opened his mouth and forgot what he was going to say as something swept through the air not fifty feet above him a leathery gray shape far bigger than a horse on slowbeating widespread wings a horny snout thrust out before and clawed feet and thin lizardlike tail trailing behind his head twisted on its own to follow the things flight over the trees there were two people on its back despite what seemed to be some sort of hooded garments it was plain that they were scanning the around below if he had had more than his head showing if he had not been directly under the creature they would surely have seen himleave the blankets he said as he ducked back inside he told her what he had seen maybe theyd be friendly and maybe not but id as soon not find out he was not sure he wanted to meet people who rode something like that in any case if they were people we are going to sneak back to the gateway as quickly as we can but sneaking for a wonder she did not argue when he commented on it as he was helping her climb over the ice block that was a wonder too she accepted his hand without so much as a glare she said i do not argue when you make sense rand althor that was hardly the way he remembered it the land around them lay flat beneath its deep blanket of snow but to the west sharp whitetipped mountains rose peaks wreathed in cloud he had no difficulty knowing they lay west for the sun was rising less than half its golden ball stuck above the ocean he stared at that the land slanted down enough for him to see waves crashing in violent spray on a rocky boulderstrewn shore maybe half a mile away an ocean to the east stretching endlessly to horizon and sun if the snow had not been enough that told him they were in no land he knew aviendha stared at the rolling breakers and pounding waves in amazement then frowned at him as it hit home she might never have seen an ocean but she had seen maps in her skirts the snow gave her even more trouble than it did him and he floundered digging his way through as much as walking sometimes sinking to his waist she gasped as he scooped her up in his arms and her green eyes glared we have to move faster than you can dragging those skirts he told her the glare faded but she did not put an arm around his neck as he had halfhoped instead she folded her hands and put on a patient face a bit touched with sullenness whatever changes what they had done might have wrought in her she was not completely different he could not understand why that should be a relief he could have melted a path through the snow as he had in the storm but if another of those flying things came that cleared path would lead straight to them a fox trotted by across the snow well to his right pure white except for a black tip to its bushy tail occasionally eyeing him and aviendha warily rabbit tracks marred the snow in places blurred where they had leapt and once he saw the prints of a cat that had to be as large as a leopard maybe there were larger animals still maybe some flightless relative of that leathery creature not something he wanted to encounter but there was always the chance the fliers might take the plowed furrow he was leaving now as the track of some animal he still made his way from tree to tree wishing there were more of them and closer together of course if there had been he might not have found aviendha in the storm she grunted frowning up at him and he loosened his hold on her again but it would surely have helped now it was because he was creeping in that way though that he saw the others first less than fifty paces away between him and the gateway right at the gateway he could feel his weave holding it were four people on horseback and more than twenty afoot the mounted were all women shrouded in long thick furlined cloaks two of them each wore a silvery bracelet on her left wrist connected by a long leash of the same shining stuff to a bright collar tight around the neck of a grayclad cloakless woman standing in the snow the others afoot were men in dark leather and armor painted green and gold overlapping plates down their chests and the outsides of their arms and fronts of their thighs their spears bore greenandgold tassels their long shields were painted in the same colors and their helmets seemed to be the heads of huge insects faces peering out through the mandibles one was clearly an officer lacking spear or shield but with a curved twohanded sword on his back silver outlined the plates of his lacquered armor and thin green plumes like feelers heightened the illusion of his painted helmet rand knew where he and aviendha were now he had seen armor like that before and women collared like that setting her down behind something that looked a little like a windtwisted pine except that its trunk was smooth and gray streaked with black he pointed and she nodded silently the two women on leashes can channel he whispered can you block them hurriedly he added dont embrace the source yet theyre prisoners but they still might warn the others and even if they dont the women with the bracelets might be able to feel them sense you she looked at him oddly but wasted no time on foolish questions such as how he knew they would come later he knew the women with the bracelets can channel also she replied just as softly it feels very strange though weak as if they had never practiced it i cannot see how that can be rand could damane were the ones who were supposed to be able to channel if two women had somehow slipped through the seanchan net to become suldam instead and from the little he knew of them that would not be easy for the seanchan tested every last woman during the years that she might first show signs of channeling they would surely never dare to betray themselves can you shield all four she gave him a very smug look of course egwene taught me to handle several flows at once i can block them tie those off and wrap them up in flows of air before they know what is happening that selfsatisfied little smile faded i am fast enough to handle them and their horses but that leaves the rest to you until i can bring help if any get away they can surely cast those spears this far and if one of them pins you to the ground for a moment she muttered under her breath as if angry that she could not complete a sentence finally she looked at him her gaze as furious as he had ever seen it egwene has told me of healing but she knows little and i less what could she be angry about now better to try understanding the sun than a woman he thought wryly thom merrilin had told him that and it was simple truth you take care of shielding those women he told her i will do the rest not until i touch your arm though he could tell she thought he was boasting but he would not have to split flows only weave one intricate flow of air that would bind arms to sides and hold horses feet as well as human taking a deep breath he grabbed hold of saidin touched her arm and channeled shocked cries rose from the seanchan he should have thought of gags too but they could be through the gateway before they attracted anyone else holding on to the source he seized aviendhas arm and halfdragged her through the snow ignoring her snarls that she could walk at least this way he broke a trail for her and they had to hurry the seanchan quieted staring as he and aviendha made their way around in front of them the two women who were not suldam had thrown back their hoods struggling against his weave he held it rather than tying he would have to release it when he went anyway for the simple reason that he could not leave even seanchan bound in the snow if they did not freeze to death there was always the big cat whose tracks he had seen where there was one there must be more the gateway was there all right but instead of looking into his room in eianrod it was a gray blank it seemed narrower than he remembered too worse he could see the weave of that grayness it had been woven from saidin furious thought slid across the void he could not tell what it was meant to do yet it could easily be a trap for whoever stepped through woven by one of the male forsaken by asmodean most likely if the man could hand him over to the others he might be able to regain his place among them yet there could be no question of staying here if aviendha only remembered how she had woven the gateway in the first place she could open another but as it was they were going to have to use this trap or no one of the mounted women a black raven in front of a stark tower on the gray breast of her cloak had a severe face and dark eyes that seemed to want to drill into his skull another younger and paler and shorter yet more regal wore a silver stags head on her green cloak the little fingers of her riding gloves were too long rand knew from the shaven sides of her scalp that those long fingers covered nails grown long and no doubt lacquered both signs of seanchan nobility the soldiers were stifffaced and stiffbacked but the officers blue eyes glittered behind the jaws of the insectlike helmet and his gauntleted fingers writhed as he struggled futilely to reach his sword rand did not care very much about them but he did not want to leave the damane behind at the least he could give them a chance to escape they might be staring at him as they would a wild animal with bared fangs but they had not chosen to be prisoners treated little better than domestic animals themselves he put a hand to the collar of the nearest and felt a jolt that nearly numbed his arm for an instant the void shifted and saidin raged through him like the snowstorm a thousandfold the damanes short yellow hair flailed as she convulsed at his touch screaming and the suldam connected to her gasped face going white both would have fallen if not held by bonds of air you try it he told aviendha working his hand a woman must be able to touch the thing safely i dont know how it unfastens it looked of a piece linked somehow just like bracelet and leash but it went on so it must be able to come off a few moments could not make any difference to whatever had happened to the gateway was it asmodean aviendha shook her head but began fumbling at the other womans collar hold still she growled as the damane a palefaced girl of sixteen or seventeen tried to flinch back if the leashed women had looked on rand as a wild beast they stared at aviendha like a nightmare made flesh she is marathdamane the pale girl wailed save seri mistress please mistress save seri the other damane older almost motherly began weeping uncontrollably aviendha glared at rand as hard as she did the girl for some reason muttering angrily under her breath as she worked at the collar it is he lady morsa the other damanes suldam said suddenly in a soft drawl that rand could barely understand i have borne the bracelet long and i could tell if the marathdamane had done more than block jini morsa did not look surprised in fact there seemed to be a light of horrified recognition in her blue eyes as she gazed at rand there was only one way that could be you were at falme he said if he went through first it meant leaving aviendha behind although only for a moment i was the noblewoman looked faint but her slow slurring voice was coolly imperious i saw you and what you did take a care i dont do the same here give me no trouble and i will leave you in peace he could not send aviendha first into the light knew what if emotion had not been so distant he would have grimaced the way she was grimacing over that collar they had to go through together and be ready to face anything much has been kept secret about what happened in the lands of the great hawkwing lady morsa the severefaced woman said her dark eyes were as hard on morsa as they had been on him rumors fly that the ever victorious army has tasted defeat do you now seek truth in rumor jalindin morsa asked in a cutting tone a seeker above all should know when to keep silent the empress herself has forbidden speech of the corenne until she calls it again if you or i speak so much as the name of the city where that expedition landed our tongues will be removed perhaps you would enjoy being tongueless in the tower of ravens not even the listeners would hear you scream for mercy or pay heed rand understood no more than two words in three and it was not the odd accents he wished he had time to listen corenne the return that was what the seanchan in falme had called their attempt to seize the lands beyond the aryth ocean the lands where he lived that they considered their birthright the rest seeker listeners the tower of ravens were a mystery but apparently the return had been called off for the time being at least that was worth knowing the gateway was narrower maybe as much as a finger width narrower than moments before only his block held it open it had tried to close as soon as aviendha released her weave and it was still trying to hurry he told aviendha and she gave him a look so patient it could as well have been a stone between his eyes i am trying rand althor she said still working at the collar tears trickled down seris cheeks a continuous low moan came from her throat as if the aiel woman intended to slit it you nearly killed the other two and maybe yourself i could feel the power rushing into both of them wildly when you touched the other collar so leave me to it and if i can do it i will muttering a curse she tried at the side rand thought about making the suldam remove the collars if anyone knew how the things came off they would but from the set frowns on their faces he knew he would have to force them to it if he could not kill a woman he could not very well torture one with a sigh he glanced at the gray blankness filling the gateway again the flows appeared to be woven into his he could not slice one without the other passing through might trigger the trap but cutting away the grayness even if that act did not trip it would allow the gateway to snap shut before they had a chance to leap through it would have to be a blind jump into the light knew what morsa had listened carefully to every word he and aviendha said and now she was gazing thoughtfully at the two suldam but jalindin had never taken her eyes from the noblewomans face much has been kept secret that should not be held from the seekers lady morsa the stern woman said the seekers must know all you forget yourself jalindin morsa snapped her gloved hands jerking had her arms not been bound to her sides she would have sawed the reins as it was she tilted hen head to stare down her nose at the other woman you were sent to me because sarek looks above himself and has designs on serengada dai and tuel not to ask of what the empress has jalindin broke in harshly it is you who forgets herself lady morsa if you think that you are proof against the seekers for truth i myself have put both a daughter and a son of the empress may the light bless her to the question and in gratitude for the confessions i wrenched from them she allowed me to gaze upon her think you that your minor house stands higher than the empress own children morsa remained upright not that she had much choice but her face went gray and she licked her lips the empress may the light illumine her forever already knows far more than i can tell i did not mean to imply the seeker cut her off again twisting her head to speak to the soldiers as if morsa did not exist the woman morsa is in the custody of the seekers for truth she will be put to the question as soon as we return to merinloe and the suldam and damane as well it seems they too have hidden what they should not horror painted the faces of the named women but morsa could have stood for any of them eyes wide and suddenly haggard she slumped as much as her invisible bonds would allow voicing not a word of protest she looked as if she wanted to scream yet she accepted jalindins gaze turned to rand she named you rand althor you will be well treated if you surrender to me rand althor however you came here you cannot think to escape even if you kill us there is a wide search for a marathdamane who channeled in the night her eyes flickered to aviendha it will find you as well inevitably and you might be slain by accident there is sedition in this district i do not know how men like you are treated in your lands but in seanchan your sufferings can be eased here you can find great honor in the use of your power he laughed at her and she looked offended i cannot kill you but i vow i should stripe your hide at least for that he certainly would not have to worry about being gentled in seanchan hands in seanchan men who could channel were killed not executed hunted and shot down on sight the grayfilled gateway was another finger narrower barely wide enough now for both of them to pass through together leave her aviendha we have to go now she released seris collar and gave him an exasperated look but her eyes went past him to the gateway and she hoisted her skirts to stump through the snow to him muttering to herself about frozen water be ready for anything he told her putting an arm around her shoulders he told himself they had to be close together to fit not because she felt good i dont know what but be ready she nodded and he said jump together they leaped into the grayness rand releasing the weave that had held the seanchan in order to fill himself to bursting with saidin and landed stumbling in his bedchamber in eianrod lamplit with darkness outside the windows asmodean sat against the wall beside the door with his legs crossed he was not embracing the source but rand slammed a block between the man and saidin anyway whirling with his arm still around aviendha he found the gateway gone no not gone he could still see his weaving and what he knew must be asmodeans but there seemed to be nothing there at all without pause he slashed his weave and suddenly the gateway appeared a rapidly narrowing view of seanchan the lady morsa slumped in her saddle jalindin shouting orders a greenandwhite tasseled spear lanced through the opening just before it snapped shut instinctively rand channeled air to snatch the suddenly wobbling twofoot length of spear the shaft ended as smoothly as any craftsman could have worked it shivering he was glad that he had not tried removing the gray barrier whatever it had been before jumping through a good thing neither of the suldam recovered in time he said taking the severed spear in his hand or wed have had worse than this coming after us he watched asmodean from the corner of his eye but the man only sat there looking slightly ill he could not know whether rand meant to stuff that spear down his throat aviendhas sniff was her most pointed yet do you think i released them she said heatedly she removed his arm firmly but he did not think her temper was for him or not for his arm anyway i tied their shields as tightly as i could they are your enemies rand althor even the ones you called damane are faithful dogs who would have killed you rather than be free you must be hard with your enemies not soft she was right he thought hefting the spear he had left enemies behind that he might well have to face one day he had to become harder or else he would be ground to flour before he ever reached shayol ghul abruptly she began smoothing her skirts and her voice became almost conversational i notice that you did not save that wheyfaced morsa from her fate from the way you looked at her i thought big eyes and a round bosom had caught your eye rand stared at her in amazement that oozed across the emptiness surrounding him like syrup she could have been saying the soup was ready he wondered how he was supposed to have noticed morsas bosom hidden as it was in a furlined cloak i should have brought her he said to question her about the seanchan i will be troubled by them again i am afraid the glint that had appeared in her eye vanished she opened her mouth but stopped glancing at asmodean when he raised a hand he could all but see the questions about seanchan piled up behind her eyes if he knew her once begun she would not stop digging until she had uncovered scraps he did not even remember he knew which might not be a bad thing another time after he had wrung a few answers out of asmodean she was right he had to be hard that was a smart thing you did she said hiding the hole i made if a gaishain had come in here a thousand of the spearsisters might have marched through seeking you asmodean cleared his throat one of the gaishain did come someone named sulin had told her she must see you eat my lord dragon and to stop her from bringing the tray in here and finding you gone i took the liberty of telling her that you and the young woman did not want to be disturbed a slight tightening of his eyes caught rands attention what just that she took it strangely she laughed out loud and went running off a few minutes later there must have been twenty far dareis mar beneath the window shouting and beating their spears on their bucklers for a good hour or more i must say my lord dragon some of the suggestions they called up startled even me rand felt his cheeks burning it had happened on the other side of the bloody world and still the maidens knew but aviendha only narrowed her eyes did she have hair and eyes like mine she did not wait for asmodeans nod it must have been my firstsister niella she saw the startled question on rands face and answered it before he could speak niella is a weaver not a maiden and she was taken half a year ago by chareen maidens during a raid on sulara hold she tried to talk me out of taking the spear and she has always wanted me wed i am going to send her back to the chareen with a welt on her bottom for every one she told rand caught her arm as she started to stalk out of the room i want to talk with natael i dont suppose there is much time left until dawn two hours maybe asmodean put in so there will be little sleeping now if you want to try would you mind making your bed elsewhere for whats left of the night you need new blankets anyway she nodded curtly before pulling loose and slammed the door behind her surely she was not angry at being tossed out of his bedchamber how could she be she had said nothing more would happen between them but he was glad he was not niella bouncing the shortened spear in his hand he turned to asmodean a strange scepter my lord dragon it will do for one to remind him that the seanchan were still out there for once he wished his voice was even colder than the void and saidin made it he had to be hard before i decide whether to skewer you with it like a lamb why did you never mention this trick of making something invisible if i hadnt been able to see the flows id never have known the gateway was still there asmodean swallowed shifting as though he did not know whether rand meant his threat rand was not sure himself my lord dragon you never asked a matter of bending light you always have so many questions it is hard to find a moment to speak of anything else you must realize by now that ive thrown my lot in with yours completely licking his lips he got up as far as his knees and began to babble i felt your weave anybody within a mile could have felt it i never saw anything like it i didnt know that anyone but demandred could block a gateway that was closing and maybe semirhage and lews therin i felt it and came and a hard time i had getting past those maidens i used the same trick you must know i am your man now my lord dragon i am your man it was the repetition of what the cairhienin had said that got through as much as anything else gesturing with the halfspear he said roughly stand you arent a dog but as asmodean slowly rose he laid the long spearpoint alongside the mans throat he had to be hard from now on you will tell me two things i dont ask about every time we talk every time mind if i think you are trying to hide anything from me you will be glad to let semirhage have you as you say my lord dragon asmodean stammered he looked ready to bow and kiss rands hand to avoid the chance rand moved to the blanketless bed and sat on the linen sheet the feather mattresses yielding under him as he studied the spear a good idea to keep it for remembrance if not as a scepter even with everything else he had best not forget the seanchan those damane if aviendha had not been there to block them from the source you have tried showing me how to shield a woman and failed try showing me how to avoid flows i cannot see how to counter them once lanfear had sliced his weavings as neatly as with a knife not easy my lord dragon without a woman to practice against we have two hours rand said coldly letting the mans shield unravel try try very hard chapter elephant a question of crimson the knife brushed nynaeves hair as it thunked into the board she was leaning against and she flinched behind her blindfold she wished she had a decent braid instead of locks hanging loose about her shoulders if that blade had cut even one strand fool woman she thought bitterly fool fool woman with the scarf folded over her eyes she could just see a narrow line of light at the bottom it seemed bright from the darkness behind the thick folds there had to be enough light yet even if it was late afternoon surely the man would not throw when he could not see properly the next blade struck on the other side of her head she could feel it vibrating she thought it almost touched her ear she was going to kill thom merrilin and valan luca and maybe any other man she could get her hands on on sheer principle the pears luca shouted as if he were not just thirty paces from her he must think the blindfold made her deaf as well as blind fumbling in the pouch at her belt she brought out a pear and carefully balanced it atop her head she was blind a pure blind fool two more pears and she gingerly extended her arms to either side between the knives that outlined her holding one in either hand by the stems there was a pause she opened her mouth to tell thom merrilin that if he so much as nicked her she would tchunktchunktchunk the blades came so fast she would have yelped if her throat had not contracted like a fist she held only the stem in her left hand the other pear trembled faintly with the knife through it and the pear on her head leaked juice into her hair snatching the scarf off she stalked toward thom and luca both of them grinning like maniacs before she could speak one of the words boiling up in her luca said admiringly you are magnificent nana your bravery is magnificent but you are more so he swirled that ridiculous red silk cloak in a bow one hand over his heart i shall call this rose among thorns though truly you are more beautiful than any mere rose it doesnt take much bravery to stand like a stump a rose was she she would show him thorns she would show both of them you listen to me valan luca such courage you never even flinch i tell you i would not have the stomach to do what you are doing that was the simple truth she told herself i am no braver than i have to be she said in a milder tone it was hard to shout at a man who insisted on telling you how brave you were certainly better to hear than all that blather about roses thom knuckled his long white mustaches as if he saw something funny the dress luca said showing all of his teeth in a smile you will look wonderful in no she snapped whatever he had gained he had just lost by bringing this up again clarine had made the dress luca wanted her to wear in silk more crimson than his cloak it was her opinion that the color was to hide blood if thoms hand slipped but nana beauty in danger is a great draw lucas voice crooned as if whispering sweetness in her ear you will have every eye on you every heart pounding for your beauty and courage if you like it so much she said firmly you wear it aside from the color she was not about to show that much bosom in public whether or not clarine thought it was proper she had seen latelles performing dress all black spangles with a high neck to her chin she could wear something like what was she thinking she had no intention of actually going through with this she had only agreed to this practice to stop luca scratching at the wagon door every night to try convincing her the man was nothing if not deft at knowing when to change the subject what happened here he asked suddenly all smooth solicitude she flinched as he touched her puffy eye it was his bad luck to choose that he would have done better to continue trying to stuff her into that red dress i did not like the way it looked at me in the mirror this morning so i bit it her flat tone and bared teeth made luca snatch his hand back from the wary gleam in his dark eyes he suspected she might bite again thom was stroking his mustaches furiously red in the face from the effort of not laughing he knew what had happened of course he would and as soon as she left he would no doubt regale luca with his version of events men could not avoid gossiping it was in them at birth and nothing women could do ever got it out of them the daylight was dimmer than she had thought the sun sat red on the treetops to the west if you ever try this again without better light she growled shaking a fist at thom its almost dusk i suppose the man said bushy eyebrow lifting this means you want to leave out the bit where i am blindfolded he was joking of course he had to be joking as you wish nana from now on only in the most perfect light it was not until she stalked away swishing her skirts angrily that she realized that she had agreed to actually do this fool thing by implication at least they would try to hold her to it as surely as the sun would set tonight fool fool fool woman the clearing where they or thom at least burn him and luca both had been practicing stood some little distance from the camp over beside the road north doubtless luca had not wanted to upset the animals should thom put one of his knives through her heart the man would likely have fed her corpse to the lions the only reason he wanted her to wear that dress was so he could ogle what she had no intention of showing to anyone but lan and burn him too for a stubborn fool man she wished she had him there so she could tell him so she wished she had him there so she could be sure he was safe she broke a dead dogfennel and used its feathery brown length like a whip to snap the heads off weeds that poked through the leaves on the ground last night elayne had said egwene reported fighting in cairhien skirmishes with brigands with cairhienin who saw any aiel as an enemy with andoran soldiers trying to claim the sun throne for morgase lan had been involved in them whenever moiraine let him out of her sight he apparently managed to take himself to the fighting as if he could sense where it would be nynaeve had never thought that she would want the aes sedai to keep lan on a short leash at her side this morning elayne had still been disturbed about her mothers soldiers being in cairhien fighting rands aiel but what worried nynaeve was the brigands according to egwene if anyone could identify stolen property in a brigands possession if anyone could swear to seeing him kill anyone or burn so much as a shed rand was hanging him he did not put his hands on the rope but it was the same thing and egwene said he watched every execution with a face cold and hard as the mountains that was not like him he had been a gentle boy whatever had happened to him in the waste had been very much for the worse well rand was far away and her own problems hers and elaynes were no nearer solution the river eldar lay less than a mile north spanned by a single lofty stone bridge built between tall metal pillars that glistened without a speck of rust remnants of an earlier time certainly perhaps even an earlier age she had gone up to it at midday right after they arrived but there had not been a boat in the river worthy of the name rowboats small fishing boats working along the reedlined banks some strange narrow little things that skittered over the water propelled by kneeling men with paddles even a squat barge that looked to be moored in mud there seemed to be a lot of mud showing on both sides some of it dried hard and cracked yet that was no wonder with the heat holding on so unseasonably but nothing that could carry them swiftly away downriver as she wanted not that she knew where it was to take them yet rack her brains as she would she could not remember the name of the town where the blue sisters were supposed to be she swiped savagely at a scatterhead and it burst in little white feathers that floated to the ground they probably were not there anymore in any case if they ever had been but it was the only clue they had to a safe place short of tear if she could only remember it the only good thing on the entire journey north was that elayne had stopped flirting with thom there had not been an incident since joining the show at least it would have been good if elayne had not apparently decided to pretend nothing had ever happened yesterday nynaeve had congratulated the girl on coming to her senses and elayne had coolly replied are you trying to find out if i will stand in your way with thom nynaeve hes rather old for you and i did think you had planted your affections elsewhere but you are old enough to make your own decisions i am fond of thom as i think he is of me i look on him like a second father if you want to flirt with him you have my permission but i really did think you were more constant luca meant to cross the river in the morning and samara the town on the other side in ghealdan was no fit place to be luca had spent most of the day since their arrival over in samara securing a place to set up his show he was only concerned that a number of other menageries had beaten him there and he was not the only one to have more than animals that was why he had grown particularly insistent about her letting thom throw knives at her she was lucky he did not want it done high walking with elayne the man seemed to think the most important thing in the world was that his show should be bigger and better than any other for herself the worrisome thing was that the prophet was in samara his followers crowding the town and spilling out into tents huts and shanties around it a city that overwhelmed samaras own not inconsiderable size it had a high stone wall and most of the buildings were stone as well many as much as three stories and there were more roofs of slate or tile than thatch this side of the eldar was no better they had passed three whitecloak encampments before reaching their stopping place hundreds of white tents in neat rows and there had to be more they had not seen whitecloaks on this side of the river the prophet and maybe a riot waiting to happen on the other and she had no idea where to go and no way to get there except in a lumbering wagon that moved no faster than she could walk she wished she had never let elayne talk her into abandoning the coach not seeing a weed close enough to snap without stepping aside she broke the dogfennel in half then again until the pieces were no longer than her hand and tossed them to the ground she wished she could do the same with luca and galad damodred for sending them running here and allan mandragoran for not being here not that she needed him of course but his presence would have been a comfort the camp was quiet with evening meals cooking over small fires beside the wagons petra was feeding the blackmaned lion thrusting huge pieces of meat through the bars on a stick the female lions were already hunkered down over theirs companionably letting out an occasional growl if someone came too close to their cage nynaeve stopped near aludras wagon the illuminator was working with wooden mortar and pestle on a table let down from the side of her wagon muttering to herself over whatever she was compounding three of the chavanas smiled at nynaeve enticingly motioning her to join them not brugh who still glowered over his lip though she had given him a salve to make the swelling go down maybe if she hit the rest of them as hard they would listen to luca and more importantly to her and realize that she did not want their smiles too bad master valan luca could not follow his own instructions latelle turned from the bear cage and gave her a tight smile more of a smirk really mainly though nynaeve stared at cerandin who was filing the blunt toenails of one of the huge gray sredit with what looked like a tool suitable for metal that one aludra said she uses the hands and the feet with remarkable ability no do not glare at me so nana she added dusting her hands i am not your enemy here you must try these new firesticks nynaeve took the wooden box from the darkhaired woman gingerly it was a cube she could have held easily with one hand but she used both i thought you called them strikers maybe yes maybe no firesticks it says what they are much better than strikers yes i have smoothed the little holes that hold the sticks so they can no longer ignite on the wood a good idea no and the heads they are a new formulation you will try them and tell me what you think yes of course thank you nynaeve hurried on before the woman could press another box on her she held the thing as if it might explode which she was not certain it would not aludra had everyone trying out her strikers or firesticks or whatever she would decide to call them next they certainly would light a fire or a lamp they could also burst into flame if the bluegray heads rubbed against each other or anything else rough for herself she would stick with flint and steel or a coal kept properly banked in a box of sand much safer juilin caught her before she could set foot on the steps of the wagon she shared with elayne his gaze going straight to her swollen eye she glared at him so hard that he stepped back and snatched that ridiculous conical cap from his head ive been over the river he said there are a hundred or so whitecloaks in samara just watching and being watched as hard themselves by ghealdanin soldiers but i recognized one the young fellow who was sitting across from the light of truth in sienda she smiled at him and he took another hasty step back eyeing her wanly galad in samara that was all they needed you always bring such wonderful news juilin we should have left you in tanchico or better on the dock in tear that was hardly fair better he told her of galad than that she walked around a corner into the man thank you juilin at least we know to keep an eye out for him now his nod was hardly a proper response to graciously offered thanks and he hurried away clapping his hat on as if he expected her to hit him men had no manners the interior of the wagon was far cleaner than it had been when thom and juilin purchased it the flaking paint had all been scraped off the men had grumbled about doing that and the cabinets and the tiny table that was fastened to the floor oiled until they shone the small brick stove with its metal chimney was never used the nights were warm enough and if they began cooking in here thom and juilin would never take another turn but it made a good place to keep their valuables the purses and the jewelry boxes the washleather pouch holding the seal that she had stuffed in as far as it would go and had not touched since elayne seated on one of the narrow beds stuffed something under the blankets when nynaeve climbed inside but before she could ask what it was elayne exclaimed your eye what happened to you they needed to wash her hair in henpepper again faint hints of gold were showing at the roots of those black tresses it had to be done every few days cerandin hit me when i wasnt looking nynaeve muttered the remembered taste of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf made her tongue curl that was not why she had let elayne go to the last meeting in telaranrhiod too she was not avoiding egwene it was just that she made most of the journeys into the world of dreams between meetings and it was only fair to give elayne her chances to go that was it carefully she put the box of firesticks into one of the cabinets next to two more the one that had actually caught fire was long since discarded she did not know why she was hiding the truth elayne had obviously not been outside the wagon or she would know already she and juilin were probably the only people in camp who did not know now that thom had surely revealed every disgusting detail to luca taking a deep breath she sat down on the other bed and made herself meet elaynes eyes something in the quiet of the other woman said she knew that more was coming i asked cerandin about damane and suldam i am certain she knows more than she lets on she paused for elayne to voice doubts that she had asked rather than demanded to say that the seanchan woman had already told them all she knew that she had not had much contact with damane or suldam but elayne kept silent and nynaeve realized that she was only hoping to postpone the moment with an argument she got quite heated about not knowing any more so i shook her youve really gone too far with her she waggled her finger under my nose still elayne only watched her those cool blue eyes barely blinking it was all nynaeve could do not to look away as she went on she threw me somehow over her shoulder i got up and slapped her and she knocked me down with her fist that is how i got the eye she might as well tell the rest elayne would hear soon enough better it came from her she would rather have pulled out her tongue i wasnt about to put up with that certainly we scuffled a little more not much of a scuffle on her part for all that she had refused to quit the bitterest truth was that cerandin had only stopped flipping her about and tripping her in sneaky ways because it had been like manhandling a child nynaeve had had as much chance as that child if only no one had been watching so she could have channeled she had certainly been angry enough if only no one had been watching period she wished cerandin had pounded her with her fists until she bled then latelle gave her a stick you know how that woman wants to get back at me there was certainly no need to say that cerandin had been holding her head down over a wagon tongue at the time no one had manhandled her like that since she threw a pitcher of water at neysa ayellin when she was sixteen anyway petra broke it up just in time too the huge man had taken the pair of them by the scruff of the neck like kittens cerandin apologized and that was that petra had made the seanchan woman apologize true but he had made nynaeve do so as well refusing to loose that gentle yet ironhard grip on her neck until she did she had hit him as hard as she could right in the stomach and he had not even blinked her hand felt as if it might swell too nothing much to it really i suppose latelle will try to spread some story of her own making about it that is the woman i ought to shake i didnt hit her half hard enough she felt better for telling the truth but elayne had doubt on her face that made her want to change the subject what is that youre hiding she reached over and pulled the blanket back revealing the silvery length of the adam they had gotten from cerandin why under the light do you want to look at that and if you do why hide it it is a filthy thing and i cannot understand how you can touch it but if you want to that is entirely up to you dont sound so prim elayne told her a slow smile broke across her face a flush of excitement i think i could make one make one nynaeve lowered her voice hoping no one came running to see who was killing whom but she did not soften it any light why make an open cesspit first a midden heap at least theres some decent use for those i do not mean to actually make an adam elayne held herself erect chin tilted in that cool way of hers she sounded offended and icily calm but it is a terangreal and i have puzzled out how it works i saw you attend at least one lecture on linking the adam links the two women that is why the suldam must be a woman who can channel too she frowned slightly it is a strange link though different instead of two or more sharing with one guiding it is one taking full control really i think that is the reason a damane cannot do anything the suldam doesnt want her to i dont really believe there is any need for the leash the collar and bracelet would work as well without it and in just the same ways work as well nynaeve said dryly youve studied the matter a great deal for someone who has no intention of making one the woman did not even have the grace to blush what use would you put it to i cannot say i would take it amiss if you put one around elaidas neck but that doesnt make it any less disgus dont you understand elayne broke in haughtiness all gone in excitement and fervor she leaned forward to put a hand on nynaeves knee and her eyes shone she was so delighted with herself it is a terangreal nynaeve and i think i can make one she said each word slowly and deliberately then laughed and rushed on if i can make this one i can make others maybe i can even make angreal and saangreal no one in the tower has been able to do that in thousands of years straightening she shivered and laid fingers across her mouth i never really thought of making anything myself before not anything useful i remember seeing a craftsman once a man who had made some chairs for the palace they were not gilded or elaborately carved they were meant for the servants hall but i could see the pride in his eyes pride in what he had made a thing well crafted i would love to feel that i think oh if we only knew a fraction of what the forsaken do the knowledge of the age of legends inside their heads and they use it to serve the shadow think what we could do with it think what we could make she took a deep breath dropping her hands in her lap her enthusiasm barely diminished well be that as it may ill wager i could puzzle out how whitebridge was made too buildings like spun glass but stronger than steel and cuendillar and slow down nynaeve said whitebridge is five or six hundred miles from here at least and if you think youre going to go channeling at the seal you can think again who knows what could happen it stays in its pouch in the stove until we find somewhere safe for it elaynes eagerness was very odd nynaeve would not have minded a little of the forsakens knowledge herself far from it but if she wanted a chair she paid a carpenter she had never wanted to make anything aside from poultices and salves when she was twelve her mother had stopped going through the motions of teaching her to sew after it became apparent that she did not care whether she sewed a straight seam and could not be made to care as for cooking she thought she was a good cook actually but the point was that she knew what was significant healing was important any man could build a bridge and leave him to it was what she said with you and your adam she went on i nearly forgot to tell you juilin saw galad on the other side of the river blood and bloody ashes elayne muttered and when nynaeve raised her eyebrows she added very firmly i will not listen to a lecture on my language nynaeve what are we going to do as i see it we can remain on this side of the river and have whitecloaks looking us over wondering why we left the menagerie or we can cross the bridge and hope the prophet doesnt spark a riot and galad doesnt denounce us or we can try to buy a rowboat and flee downriver not very good choices and luca will want his hundred marks gold she tried not to scowl but that still rankled you promised it to him and i suppose it would not be honest to sneak away without paying him she would have done it in a minute if there was anywhere to go it certainly would not be elayne said sounding shocked but we do not have to worry about galad at least not as long as we stay close to the menagerie galad wont go near one he thinks putting animals in cages is cruel he doesnt mind hunting them mind or eating them only caging them nynaeve shook her head the truth was that elayne would have found some way to delay if only for one day had there been any way to leave the woman really wanted to highwalk in front of people other than the rest of the performers and she herself was probably going to have to let thom throw knives at her again i am not wearing that bloody dress though the first boat that comes large enough to take four people she said we are hiring it trade on the river cant have stopped altogether it would help if we knew where we were going the other womans tone was much too gentle we could simply head for tear you know we do not have to stay fixed to this just because you she trailed off but nynaeve knew what she had been going to say just because she was stubborn just because she was so furious that she could not remember a simple name that she intended to remember it and go there if it killed her well none of that was true she intended to find these aes sedai who might just support rand and bring them to him not trail into tear like a pitiful refugee fleeing for safety i will remember she said in a level tone it ended with bar or was it dar lar before you are tired of flaunting yourself highwalking i will i will not wear that dress chapter dream ring a silver arrow elayne had the cooking that evening which meant that none of the food was simple despite the fact that they were eating on stools around a cookfire with crickets chirping in the surrounding woods and now and again some nightbirds thin sad cry in the deepening darkness the soup was served cold and jellied with chopped green ferris sprinkled on top the light knew where she had found ferris or the tiny onions she put in with the peas the beef was sliced nearly thin enough to see through and wrapped around something made from carrots sweetbeans chives and goatcheese and there was even a small honeycake for dessert it was all tasty though elayne fretted that nothing was exactly the way it should be as if she thought she could duplicate the cooks work in the royal palace in caemlyn nynaeve was fairly sure the girl was not fishing for compliments elayne would always brush away compliments and tell you exactly what was not right thom and juilin grumbled about there being so little beef but nynaeve noticed that they not only ate every scrap but looked disappointed when the last pea was gone when she cooked for some reason they always seemed to eat at one of the other wagons when one of them made supper it was always stew or else meat and beans so full of dried peppers that your tongue blistered they did not eat alone of course luca saw to that bringing his own stool and placing it right next to her his red cloak spread to best effect and his long legs stretched out so that his calves showed well above his turneddown boots he was there almost every night oddly the only nights he missed were when she cooked it was interesting really having his eyes on her when a woman as pretty as elayne was there but he did have his motives he sat altogether too close tonight she moved her stool three times but he followed without missing a word or seeming to notice and he alternated comparing her with various flowers to the blossoms detriment ignoring the black eye he could not miss without being blind and musing over how beautiful she would be in that red dress with compliments on her courage thrown in twice he slipped in suggestions that they take a stroll by moonlight hints so veiled that she was not entirely sure that was what they were until she thought about it that gown will frame your unfolding bravery to perfection he murmured in her ear yet not a quarter so well as you display yourself for nightblooming dara lilies would weep with envy to see you stroll beside the moonlit water as i would do and make myself a bard to sing your praises by this very moon she blinked at him working that out luca seemed to believe she was fluttering her lashes she accidentally hit him in the ribs with her elbow before he could nibble her ear at least that seemed to be his intention even if he was coughing now and claiming he had swallowed a cake crumb the wrong way the man was certainly handsome stop that and he did have a shapely calf what are you doing looking at his legs but he must think her a brainless ninny it was all in aid of his bloody show she moved her stool again while he was trying to get his breath back she could not move it far without making it clear that she was running from him though she held her fork ready in case he followed again thom studied his plate as though more than a smear remained on the white glaze juilin whistled tunelessly and nearly silently peering into the dying fire with false intensity elayne looked at her and shook her head it was so pleasant of you to join us nynaeve said and stood up luca stood when she did a hopeful look in his eye along with the shine of the firelight she set her plate atop the one in his hand thom and juilin will be grateful for your help with the dishes i am sure before his mouth finished falling open she turned to elayne it is late and i expect well be moving across the river early of course elayne murmured with just the hint of a smile and she put her plate atop nynaeves before following her into the wagon nynaeve wanted to hug her until she said really you should not encourage him lamps mounted in wall brackets sprang alight nynaeve planted her fists on her hips encourage him the only way i could encourage him less would be to stab him sniffing for emphasis she frowned at the lamps next time use one of aludras firesticks strikers you are going to forget one day and channel where you shouldnt and then where will we be running for our lives with a hundred whitecloaks after us stubborn to a fault the other woman refused to be diverted i may be younger than you but sometimes i think i know more of men than you ever will for a man like valan luca that coy little flight of yours tonight was only asking him to keep pursuing you if you would snap his nose off the way you did the first day he might give up you dont tell him to stop you do not even ask you kept smiling at him nynaeve what is the man supposed to think you havent smiled at anyone in days i am trying to hold my temper nynaeve muttered everybody complained about her temper and now that she was trying to control it elayne complained about that it was not that she was fool enough to be taken in by his compliments she certainly was not so big a fool as that elayne laughed at her and she scowled oh nynaeve you cannot hold the sun down at dawn lini could have been thinking of you with an effort nynaeve smoothed her face she could too hold her temper didnt i just prove it out there she held out her hand let me have the ring he will want to cross the river early tomorrow and i want at least some real sleep after im done i thought i would go tonight concern touched elaynes voice nynaeve youve been entering telaranrhiod practically every night except the meetings with egwene that bair intends to pick a bone with you by the way i had to tell them why you werent there yet again and she says you should not need rest however often you enter unless you are doing something wrong concern became firmness and the younger woman planted her fists on her hips i had to listen to a lecture that was meant for you and it was not pleasant with egwene standing there nodding her head to every word now i really think that tonight i should please elayne nynaeve did not lower her outstretched hand i have questions for birgitte and her answers might make me think of more she did have sort of she could always think of questions for birgitte it had nothing to do with avoiding egwene and the wise ones if she visited telaranrhiod so often that elayne always went to the meetings with egwene that was simply how it fell out elayne sighed but fished the twisted stone ring from the neck of her dress ask her again nynaeve it is very difficult facing egwene she saw birgitte she doesnt say anything but she looks at me it is worse when we meet again after the wise ones have gone she could ask then and she still doesnt and that makes it far worse she frowned as nynaeve transferred the small terangreal to the leather cord around her own neck with lans heavy ring and her great serpent why do you suppose none of the wise ones ever come with her then we dont learn very much in elaidas study but you would think they would at least want to see the tower egwene doesnt even want to talk about it in front of them if i seem to come close she gives me such a look that youd think she meant to hit me i think they want to avoid the tower as much as possible and wise they were indeed for that if not for healing she would avoid it and aes sedai too she was not becoming aes sedai she was just hoping to learn more of healing and to help rand certainly they are free women elayne even if the tower was not in the mess it is would they really want aes sedai traipsing through the waste scooping them up to carry back to tar valon i suppose that is it elaynes tone said she could not understand it though she thought the tower wonderful and could not see why any woman would want to evade aes sedai sealed to the white tower forever they said when they put that ring on your finger and they meant it yet the fool girl did not see it as onerous at all elayne helped her undress and she stretched out on her narrow bed in her shift yawning it had been a long day and it was surprising how tiring standing still could be when someone unseen was hurling knives at you idle thoughts drifted through her head as she closed her eyes elayne had claimed she was practicing when she had acted the fool with thom not that the fondfatherandfavoritedaughter they tried on now was much less foolish to watch maybe she could practice herself just a bit with valan now that was foolish mens eyes might wander lans had better not but she knew how to be constant she was simply not going to wear that dress far too much bosom vaguely she heard elayne say remember to ask her again sleep took her she stood outside the wagon in the night the moon was high and drifting clouds cast shadows over the camp crickets chirruped and the nightbirds called the lions eyes shone as they watched her from their cages the whitefaced bears were dark sleeping mounds behind the iron bars the long picket line stood empty of horses clarines dogs were not on their leashes beneath her and petras wagon and the space where the sredit stood in the waking world was bare she had come to understand that only wild creatures had reflections here but whatever the seanchan woman claimed it was hard to think that those huge gray animals had been domesticated so long that they were no longer wild abruptly she realized that she was wearing the dress blazing red far too snug around the hips for decency and a square neck cut so low she thought she might pop out she could not imagine any woman but berelain donning it for lan she might if they were alone she had been thinking of lan when she drifted off i was wasnt i in any case she was not about to let birgitte see her in the thing the woman claimed to be a soldier and the more time nynaeve spent with her the more she realized that some of her attitudes and comments were as bad as any mans worse a combination of berelain and a tavern brawler the comments did not come out all the time but they certainly did whenever nynaeve allowed idle thoughts to put her in anything like this dress she changed to good stout two rivers wool dark with a plain shawl she did not need her hair decently braided again and opened her mouth to call birgitte why did you change the woman said stepping out from the shadows to lean on her silver bow her intricate golden braid hung over her shoulder and moonlight shone on her bow and arrows i remember wearing a gown that could have been twin to that once it was only to attract attention so gaidal could sneak by the guards eyes bulged like frogs but it was fun especially when i wore it dancing with him later he always hates dancing but he was so intent on keeping any other man from getting close that he danced every dance birgitte laughed fondly i won fifty gold solids from him that night at spin because he stared so much he never looked at his tiles men are peculiar it was not as if he had never seen me thats as may be nynaeve cut in primly wrapping the shawl firmly around her shoulders before she could add her question birgitte said i have found her and all thought of the question fled where did she see you can you take me to her without her seeing fear fluttered in nynaeves belly a fat lot valan luca would say about her courage if he could see her now but she was sure it would turn to anger as soon as she saw moghedien if you can bring me close she trailed off as birgitte raised a hand i cannot think she saw me or i doubt i would be here now she was all seriousness now nynaeve found it much easier to be around her when she showed this side of being a soldier i can take you close for a moment if you want to go but she is not alone at least you will see you must be silent and you must take no action against moghedien there are other forsaken perhaps you could destroy her but can you destroy five of them the fluttering in nynaeves middle spread to her chest and her knees five she should ask what birgitte had seen or heard and let it go at that then she could return to her bed and but birgitte was looking at her not questioning her courage only looking ready to do this thing if she said i will be silent and i wont even think of channeling not with five forsaken together not that she could have channeled a spark at that moment she stiffened her knees to keep them from knocking whenever you are ready birgitte hefted her bow and put a hand on nynaeves arm and nynaeves breath caught in her throat they were standing on nothing infinite blackness all around no way to tell up from down and in every direction a fall that would last forever head spinning she made herself look where birgitte pointed below them moghedien also stood on darkness garbed nearly as black as what surrounded her bent and listening intently and as far below her four huge highbacked chairs each different sat on an expanse of glistening whitetiled floor floating in the blackness strangely nynaeve could hear what those in the chairs said as well as if she had been among them never been a coward a plumply pretty sunhaired woman was saying so why begin seemingly attired in silverygray mist and sparkling gems she lounged in a chair of ivory worked so it appeared made of naked acrobats four carved men held it aloft and her arms rested along the backs of kneeling women two men and two women held a white silk cushion behind her head while above more were contorted into shapes nynaeve did not believe a human body could attain she blushed when she realized that some were performing more than acrobatic tricks a compact man of middling height with a livid scar across his face and a square golden beard leaned forward angrily his chair was heavy wood carved with columns of armored men and horses a steelgauntleted fist clasping lighting at the backs peak his red coat made up for the lack of gilding on the chair for golden scrollwork rolled across his shoulders and down his arms no one names me coward he said harshly but if we continue as we are he will come straight for my throat that has been the plan from the beginning said a womans melodious voice nynaeve could not see the speaker hidden behind the towering back of a chair that seemed all snowwhite stone and silver the second man was large and darkly handsome with white wings streaking his temples he toyed with an ornate golden goblet leaning back in a throne that was the only possible word for the gemencrusted thing a mere hint of gold showed here and there but nynaeve would not have doubted that it was solid gold beneath all those glittering rubies and emeralds and moonstones it had an air of weight quite apart from its massive size he will concentrate on you the big man said in a deep voice if need be one close to him will die plainly at your order he will come for you and while he is fixed on you alone the three of us linked will take him what has changed to alter any of that nothing has changed the scarred man growled least of all my trust for you i will be part of the link or it ends now the goldenhaired woman threw back her head and laughed poor man she said mockingly waving a beringed hand at him do you think he would not notice that you were linked he has a teacher remember a poor one but not a complete fool next you will ask to include enough of those black ajah children to take the circle beyond thirteen so you or rahvin must have control if rahvin trusts us enough to link when he must allow one of us to guide the melodious voice said you can display an equal trust the big man looked into his goblet and the mistclad woman smiled faintly if you cannot trust us not to turn on you the unseen woman continued then trust that we will be watching each other too closely to turn you agreed to all of this sammael why do you begin to quibble now nynaeve gave a start as birgitte touched her arm and they were back among the wagons with the moon shining through the clouds it seemed almost normal compared to where they had been why nynaeve began and had to swallow why did you bring us away her heart leaped into her throat did moghedien see us she had been so intent on the other forsaken on the mingled strangeness and commonplaceness of them that she had forgotten to keep an eye on moghedien she heaved a fervent sigh when birgitte shook her head i never took my gaze from her for more than a moment and she never moved a muscle but i do not like being so exposed if she had looked up or one of the others nynaeve wrapped her shawl tightly around her shoulders and still shivered rahvin and sammael she wished she did not sound hoarse did you recognize the others of course birgitte had it was a foolish way to phrase it but she was shaken lanfear was the one hidden by her chair the other was graendal do not think her a fool because she was in a chair that would make a senje noroom keeper blush she is devious and she uses her pets in rites to cause the roughest soldier i ever knew to swear celibacy graendal is devious moghediens voice said but not devious enough birgitte whirled silver bow coming up silver arrow almost flying to nock and abruptly hurtled thirty paces through the moonlight to crash against nynaeves wagon so hard that she bounced back five and lay in a crumpled heap desperately nynaeve reached for saidar fear streaked through her anger but there was anger enough and it ran into an invisible wall between her and the warm glow of the true source she almost howled something seized her feet jerking them backward and up off the ground her hands flew up and back until wrists met ankles above her head her clothes became powder that slid from her skin and her braid dragged her head back until the braid rested on her bottom frantic she tried to step out of the dream nothing happened she hung doubled in midair like some netted creature every muscle strained to its limit tremors ran through her her fingers twitched feebly brushing her feet she thought if she tried to move anything else her back would break strangely her fear was gone now that it was too late she was certain that she could have been quick enough if not for the terror that had laced through her when she needed to act all she wanted was a chance to put her hands around moghediens throat much good that does now every breath came in strained panting moghedien moved to where nynaeve could see her between the quivering triangle of her arms the glow of saidar surrounded the woman mockingly a detail from graendals chair the forsaken said her dress was mist like graendals sliding from black fog to nearly transparent and back to gleaming silver the fabric changed almost constantly nynaeve had seen her wear it before in tanchico not something i would have thought of on my own but graendal can be edifying nynaeve glared at her but moghedien did not appear to notice i can hardly believe that you actually came hunting me did you really believe that because once you were lucky enough to catch me off guard you might be my equal the womans laugh was cutting if you only knew the effort i have put into finding you and you came to me she glanced around at the wagons studying the lions and bears for a moment before turning back to nynaeve a menagerie that would make you easy enough to find if i needed to now do your worst burn you nynaeve snarled as best she could doubled up as she was she had to force the words out one by one she did not dare look straight toward birgitte not that she could have shifted her head enough to but rolling her eyes as if caught between fury and fear she caught a glimpse her stomach went hollow even stretched tight as a sheepskin for drying birgitte lay sprawled on the ground silver arrows spilling from the quiver at her waist her silver bow a span from her unmoving hand lucky you say if you hadnt managed to sneak up on me id have striped you till you wailed id have wrung your neck like a chicken she had only one chance if birgitte was dead and a bleak one to make moghedien so angry that she killed her quickly in a rage if only there was some way to warn elayne her dying would have to do it remember how you said youd use me for a mounting block and later when i said id do the same for you that was after i had beaten you when you were whimpering and pleading for your life offering me anything you are a gutless coward the leavings from a nightjar you piece of something thick crawled into her mouth flattening her tongue and forcing her jaws wide you are so simple moghedien murmured believe me i am quite angry enough with you already i do not think i will use you for a mounting block her smile made nynaeves skin crawl i think i will turn you into a horse it is quite possible here a horse a mouse a frog she paused listening a cricket and every time you come to telaranrhiod youll be a horse until i change it or some other with the knowledge does so she paused again looking almost sympathetic no id not want to give you false hope there are only nine of us now who know that binding and you would not want any of the others to have you any more than myself you will be a horse every time i bring you here you will have your own saddle and bridle i will even braid your mane nynaeves braid jerked almost out of her scalp you will remember who you are even then of course i think i will enjoy our rides though you may not moghedien took a deep breath and her dress darkened to something that glistened in the pale light nynaeve could not be sure but she thought it might be the color of wet blood you make me approach semirhage it will be well to be done with you so i can turn my full attention to matters of importance is the little yellowhaired chit with you in this menagerie the thickness vanished from nynaeves mouth i am alone you stupid pain as if she had been beaten from ankles to shoulders every stroke landing at once she bellowed shrilly again she tried to clamp her teeth shut but her own endless shriek filled her ears tears rolled shamingly down her cheeks as she sobbed waiting hopelessly for the next is she with you moghedien said patiently do not waste time trying to make me kill you i wont you will live many years serving me your rather pitiful abilities might be of some use once i train them once i train you but i can make you think that what you just felt was a lovers caress now answer my question nynaeve managed to gather breath no she wept she ran off with a man after we left tanchico a man old enough to be her grandfather but he had money we heard what happened in the tower she was sure moghedien must know of that and she was afraid to go back the other woman laughed a delightful tale i can almost see what fascinates semirhage about breaking the spirit oh you are going to provide me with a great deal of entertainment nynaeve almeara but first you are going to bring the girl elayne to me you will shield her and bind her and bring her to lie at my feet do you know why because some things are actually stronger in telaranrhiod than in the waking world that is why you will be a glossy white mare whenever i bring you here and it is not only hurts taken here that last into waking compulsion is another i want you to think of it for a moment or two before you begin believing it your own idea i suspect that the girl is your friend but you are going to bring her to me like a pet moghedien screamed as a silver arrow suddenly stuck its head out from below her right breast nynaeve fell to the ground like a dropped sack the fall knocked every speck of breath from her lungs as surely as a hammer in the belly straining to breathe she struggled to make racked muscles move to fight through pain to saidar staggering on her feet birgitte fumbled another arrow from her quiver go nynaeve it was a mumbling shout get away birgittes head wavered and the silver bow wobbled as she raised it the glow around moghedien increased until it seemed as if the blinding sun surrounded her the night folded in over birgitte like an ocean wave enveloping her in blackness when it passed the bow dropped atop empty clothes as they collapsed the clothes faded like fog burning off and only the bow and arrows remained shining in the moonlight moghedien sank to her knees panting clutching the protruding arrow shaft with both hands as the glow around her faded and died then she vanished and the silver arrow fell where she had been stained dark with blood after what seemed an eternity nynaeve managed to push up to hands and knees weeping she crawled to birgittes bow this time it was not pain that made tears come kneeling naked and not caring she clutched the bow im sorry she sobbed oh birgitte forgive me birgitte there was no answer except the mournful cry of a nightbird liandrin leaped to her feet as the door to moghediens bedchamber crashed open and the chosen staggered into the sitting room blood soaking her silk shift chesmal and temaile rushed to her side each taking an arm to keep the woman on her feet but liandrin remained by her chair the others were out perhaps out of amador for all liandrin knew moghedien told only what she wanted the hearer to know and punished questions she did not like what happened temaile gasped moghediens brief look should have fried her where she stood you have some small ability with healing the chosen told chesmal thickly blood stained her lips trickled from the corner of her mouth in an increasing stream do it now fool the darkhaired ghealdanin woman did not hesitate in laying hands to moghediens head liandrin sneered to herself as the glow surrounded chesmal concern painted chesmals handsome face and temailes delicate foxlike features were contorted with pure fright and worry so faithful they were such obedient lapdogs moghedien lifted up onto her toes head flung back eyes wide she shook breath rushing from her gaping mouth as if she had been plunged into ice in moments it was done the glow around chesmal disappeared and moghediens heels settled to the blueandgreen patterned carpet without temailes support she might have fallen only a part of the strength for healing came from the power the rest came from the person being healed whatever wound had caused all that bleeding would be gone but moghedien was surely as weak as if she had lain in bed an invalid for weeks she pulled the fine goldandivory silk scarf from temailes belt to wipe her mouth as the woman helped her turn toward the bedchamber door weak and her back turned liandrin struck as hard as she ever had with everything she had puzzled out of what the woman had done to her even as she did saidar seemed to fill moghedien like a flood liandrins probe died as the source was shielded from her flows of air picked her up and slammed her against the paneled wall hard enough to make her teeth rattle spreadeagled helpless she hung there chesmal and temaile exchanged confused glances as if they did not understand what had occurred they continued to support moghedien as she came to stand in front of liandrin still calmly wiping her mouth on temailes scarf moghedien channeled and the blood on her shift turned black and flaked away falling to the carpet yyou do not understand great mmistress liandrin said frantically i only wished to help you to have the good sleep for once in her life slipping back into the accents of a commoner did not concern her in the least i only she cut off with a strangled gagging as a flow of air seized her tongue stretching it out between her teeth her brown eyes bulged a hair more pressure and shall i pull it out moghedien studied her face but spoke as if to herself i think not a pity for you that the almeara woman makes me think like semirhage otherwise i might only kill you suddenly she was tying off the shield the knot growing ever more intricate until liandrin lost the twists and turns completely and still it went on there moghedien said finally in tones of satisfaction you will search a very long time to find anyone who can unravel that but you will have no opportunity to search liandrin searched chesmals face and temailes for some sign of sympathy pity anything chesmals eyes were cold and stern temailes shone and she touched her lips with the tip of her tongue and smiled not a friendly smile you thought you had learned something of compulsion moghedien went on i will teach you a bit more for an instant liandrin shivered moghediens eyes filling her vision as the womans voice filled her ears her entire head live the instant passed and sweat beaded on liandrins face as the chosen smiled at her compulsion has many limits but a command to do what someone wants to do in their inmost depths will hold for a lifetime you will live however much you think you want to take your life and you will think of it you will lie weeping many nights wishing for it the flow holding liandrins tongue vanished and she barely paused to swallow please great mistress i swear i did not mean her head rang and silvery black spots danced before her eyes from moghediens slap there are attractions to doing a thing physically the woman breathed do you wish to beg more please great mistress the second slap sent her hair flying more please a third nearly unhinged her jaw her cheek burned if you cannot be more inventive than that i will not listen you will listen instead i think what i have planned for you would delight semirhage herself moghediens smile was almost as dark as temailes you will live not stilled but knowing that you could channel again if only you found someone to untie your shield yet that is only the beginning evon will be glad of a new scullery girl and i am sure the arene woman will want to have long talks with you about her husband why they will enjoy your company so much that i doubt you will see the outside of this house during the years to come long years in which to wish that you had served me faithfully liandrin shook her head mouthing no and please she was crying too hard to force the words out turning her head to temaile moghedien said prepare her for them and tell them they are not to kill or maim her i want her always to believe she might escape even futile hope will keep her alive to suffer she turned away on chesmals arm and the flows holding liandrin to the wall vanished her legs gave way like straw crumpling her to the carpet only the shield remained she hammered at it futilely as she crawled after moghedien trying to catch the hem of her shift sobbing brokenly please great mistress they are with a menagerie moghedien told chesmal all of your searching and i had to find them myself a menagerie should not be too difficult to locate i will serve faithfully liandrin wept fear turned her limbs to water she could not crawl fast enough to catch up they did not even look back at her scrabbling across the carpet after them bind me great mistress anything i will be the faithful dog there are many menageries traveling north chesmal said eagerness to negate her failure filling her voice to ghealdan great mistress then i must to ghealdan moghedien said you will procure fast horses and follow the bedchamber door closed on her words i will be the faithful dog liandrin sobbed in a heap on the carpet lifting her head she blinked tears away to see temaile watching her rubbing her arms and smiling we could overwhelm her temaile we three together could we three temaile laughed you could not overwhelm fat evon her eyes narrowed as she studied the shield fastened to liandrin you might as well be stilled listen please liandrin swallowed hard trying to clear her voice but it was still thick if burning with urgency when she went on at frantic speed we have spoken of the dissension that must rule among the chosen if moghedien hides herself so she must hide from the other chosen if we take her and give her to them think of the places we could have we could be exalted above kings and queens we could be chosen ourselves for a moment one blessed wonderful moment the childfaced woman hesitated then she shook her head you have never known how high to lift your eyes who reaches for the sun will be burned no i think that i will not be burned for reaching too high i think that i will do as i am told and soften you for evon suddenly she smiled showing teeth that made her even more vulpine how surprised he will be when you crawl to kiss his feet liandrin started screaming before temaile even began chapter serpent and wheel ripped away yawning elayne watched nynaeve from her bed her head propped up on one elbow and black hair spilling down her arm it was really quite ridiculous this insistence that whoever did not go to telaranrhiod remain awake she did not know how long an interval nynaeve had experienced in the world of dreams but elayne had been lying here for a good two hours with no book to read no needlework to do nothing at all to occupy her except staring at the other woman stretched out on her own narrow bed studying the adam was no good she thought she had wrung everything out of it that she could she had even tried a slight touch of healing on the sleeping woman perhaps all the healing she knew nynaeve would never have consented to it awake she did not think much of elaynes abilities in that direction or maybe she would have in this case but her black eye was gone in truth that was the most complicated healing elayne had ever done and it really had exhausted her skill nothing to do if she had some silver she might have tried making an adam silver was not the only metal but she would have to melt coins to get enough the other woman would be less pleased at that than at finding a second adam if nynaeve had been willing to tell thom and juilin about this at least she could have invited thom in for conversation they really did have the most delightful talks like a father passing on his knowledge to his daughter she had never realized that the game of houses was so deeply embedded in andor if thankfully not so deeply as it was in some other lands only the borderlands escaped it entirely according to thom with the blight right to the north and trolloc raids a daily fact they had no time for maneuvering and scheming she and thom had wonderful talks now that he was sure she was not going to try snuggling into his lap her face burned at the memory she had actually thought of that once or twice and mercifully had not quite brought herself to it even a queen stubs her toe but a wise woman watches the path she quoted softly lini was a wise woman elayne did not think she would make that particular mistake again she knew she made many but seldom the same twice one day perhaps she would make few enough to be worthy to follow her mother on the throne suddenly she sat up tears were leaking from nynaeves closed eyes trickling down the sides of her face what elayne had taken for a faint snore nynaeve did snore whatever she said was a tiny whimpering sob deep in her throat that should not be if she had been injured the hurt would have appeared although she would not feel it here until she woke perhaps i should wake her but she hesitated even as her hand stretched toward the other woman waking someone out of telaranrhiod was far from easy shaking even icy water in the face would not always do and nynaeve would not appreciate being pummeled awake after the bruising cerandin had given her i wonder what really happened i will have to ask cerandin whatever was going on nynaeve should be able to step out of the dream whenever she wished unless egwene said that the wise ones could hold someone in telaranrhiod against their will though if they had taught her the trick she had not passed it on to elayne or nynaeve if someone was holding nynaeve now hurting her it could not be birgitte or the wise ones well the wise ones might if they caught her wandering where they thought she should not but if not them that left only she took hold of nynaeves shoulders to shake her if that did not work she would freeze the pitcher of water on the table or slap her face silly and nynaeves eyes popped open immediately nynaeve began to weep aloud the most despairing sound elayne had ever heard i killed her oh elayne i killed her with my foolish pride thinking i could the words trailed off in openmouthed sobs you killed who it could not be moghedien that womans death would surely not bring this grief she was about to take nynaeve in her arms to comfort her when a pounding came at the door send them away nynaeve mumbled curbing herself into a trembling ball in the middle of the bed sighing elayne made her way to the door and pulled it open but before she could say a word thom pushed past her out of the night rumpled shirt bagging out of his breeches carrying someone shrouded in his cloak in his arms only a womans bare feet showed she was just there juilin said behind him as if he did not believe the words coming out of his own mouth both men were barefoot and juilin was stripped to the waist lean and hairlesschested i woke for a moment and suddenly she was standing there naked as the day she was born collapsing like a cut net shes alive thom said laying the cloakwrapped figure on elaynes bed but only barely i could hardly hear her heart frowning elayne pulled aside the cloaks hood and found herself staring at birgittes face pale and wan nynaeve scrambled stiffly from the other bed to kneel beside the unconscious woman her face glistened with tears but her weeping had stopped she is alive she breathed she is alive abruptly she seemed to realize that she was in her shift in front of the men but she barely spared them a glance and all she said was get them out of here elayne i can do nothing with them gawking like sheep thom and juilin rolled their eyes toward each other when elayne made a herding motion at them and shook their heads slightly but they backed toward the door without complaint she is a friend elayne told them she felt as if she were moving in a dream floating without feeling how could this be we will take care of her how could it possibly have happened now dont say a word to anyone the looks they gave her as she closed the door nearly made her blush of course they knew better than to talk but men did have to be reminded of the simplest things sometimes even thom nynaeve how under the light she began turning and cut off as the glow of saidar surrounded the kneeling woman burn her nynaeve growled channeling fiercely burn her forever for doing this elayne recognized the flows being woven for healing but recognition was as far as she could go i will find her birgitte nynaeve muttered strands of spirit predominated but water and air were in there and even earth and fire it looked as complicated as embroidering one dress with either hand and two more with your feet blindfolded i will make her pay the glow shining about nynaeve grew and grew until it overwhelmed the lamps until it hurt to book at her except through slitted eyes i swear it by the light and my hope of salvation and rebirth i will the anger in her voice changed becoming deeper if anything it isnt working there is nothing wrong with her to heal she is as perfect as anyone can be but she is dying oh light i can feel her slipping away burn moghedien burn her and burn me along with her she was not giving up though the weaving continued complex flows weaving into birgitte and the woman lay there golden braid flung over the side of the bed the rise and fall of her chest slowing i can do something that might help elayne said slowly you were supposed to have permission but it had not always been so once it had been done almost as often without as with there was no reason it should not work on a woman except that she had never heard of it being done to any but men linking nynaeve did not look away from the woman on the bed or stop her efforts with the power yes you will have to do it i dont know how but let me guide i do not know half what i am doing right this minute but i know that i can do it you could not heal a bruise elaynes mouth tightened but she let the remark lie not linking the amount of saidar that nynaeve had drawn into herself was amazing if she could not heal birgitte with that what elayne could add would not make a difference together they would be stronger than either apart but not as strong as if their two strengths were simply added besides she was not certain that she could link she had only been linked once and an aes sedai had done it to show her what it was like more than how stop nynaeve you said yourself it is not working stop and let me try if it doesnt work you can she could what if healing worked it worked if it did not there was no point in trying again if it failed try what nynaeve snapped yet she moved away awkwardly letting elayne come close the weave of healing faded but not the shining nimbus instead of answering elayne put one hand on birgittes forehead physical contact was as necessary for this as for healing and the two times she had watched it done in the tower the aes sedai had touched the mans forehead the flows of spirit she wove were complex if not so intricate as nynaeves of a moment before she barely understood some of what she was doing and none at all of other parts yet she had paid close attention from her hiding place to how the weave was shaped watched closely because she had built up a stock of stories in her head made silly romances where there so seldom were any after a moment she sat down on the other bed and let saidar go nynaeve frowned at her then bent to examine birgitte the unconscious womans color was perhaps a little better her breathing a little stronger what did you do elayne nynaeve did not take her eyes from birgitte but the glow around her faded away slowly it wasnt healing i think i could do it myself now but it was not healing will she live elayne asked faintly there was no visible link between her and birgitte no flows but she could sense the womans weakness a terrible weakness she would know the moment birgitte died even if she was sleeping or hundreds of miles away i do not know she isnt fading anymore but i do not know weariness made nynaeves voice soft and pain touched it strongly as if she shared birgittes injury wincing she rose and unfolded a redstriped blanket to spread over the woman lying there what did you do silence held elayne long enough for nynaeve to join her lowering herself awkwardly onto the bed bonding elayne said finally i bonded her as a warder the incredulous stare on the other womans face made her rush on healing was doing no good i had to do something you know the gifts a warder gets from being bonded one is strength energy he can keep going when other men would collapse and die survive wounds that would kill anyone else it was the only thing i could think of nynaeve drew a deep breath well it is working better than what i did at least a woman warder i wonder what lan will think of that no reason why she shouldnt be if any woman can it would be her wincing she curled her legs up beneath her her gaze kept returning to birgitte you will have to keep this secret if anyone learns that an accepted has bonded a warder whatever the circumstances elayne shivered i know she said simply and quite fervently it was not quite a stilling offense but any aes sedai would very likely make her wish she had been stilled nynaeve what happened for a long moment she thought the other woman was going to start crying again as her chin quivered and her lips worked when she began speaking her voice was iron her face a blend of fury and too many tears ever to shed she told the tale starkly almost sketchily until she came to moghediens appearance among the wagons that she rendered in painful detail i should be welted from the neck down she said bitterly at last touching a smooth unmarked arm unmarked or not she flinched i dont understand why i am not i feel it but i deserve the welts for stupid foolish pride for being too afraid to do what i should i deserved being hung up like a ham in a smokehouse if there was any justice i would still be dangling there and birgitte would not be lying on that bed with us wondering whether shell live or not if only i knew more if only i could have moghediens knowledge for five minutes i could heal her i am sure of it if you were still hanging elayne said practically in a very short while you would be waking up and shielding me i dont doubt moghedien would have seen to it that you were angry enough to channel she knows us all too well remember and i do doubt very much that i would have suspected anything until you had done it i do not fancy being carted off to moghedien and i cannot believe you do either the other woman did not look at her it must have been a link nynaeve like an adam that is how she made you feel pain without marking you nynaeve still sat there in a glowering sulk nynaeve birgitte is still alive you did everything you could for her and the light willing she will live it was moghedien who did this to her not you a soldier who takes blame for his comrades who fall in battle is a fool you and i are soldiers in a battle but you are not a fool so stop behaving like one nynaeve did look at her then a scowl that lasted only a moment before she turned her face completely away you dont understand her voice sank almost to a whisper she was one of the heroes bound to the wheel of time destined to be born again and again to make legends she wasnt born this time elayne she was ripped out of telaranrhiod as she stood is she still bound to the wheel or has she been ripped away from that too ripped away from what her own courage earned her because i was so proud so manstubborn stupid that i made her hunt for moghedien elayne had hoped that those questions had not occurred to nynaeve yet would not until she had had a little time to recover first do you know how badly moghedien was hurt maybe she is dead i hope not the other woman almost snarled i want to make her pay she took a deep breath but instead of invigorating her it seemed to make her sag i would not count on her dying birgittes shot missed her heart a wonder she managed to hit the woman at all staggering as she was i could not have stood up if i were thrown that far hard enough to bounce like that i couldnt even stand up after what moghedien did to me no she is alive and we had best believe that she can have her wound healed and be after us by morning she would still need time to rest nynaeve you know that can she even know where we are from what you said she had no time to do more than see that this is a menagerie what if she did see more nynaeve rubbed her temples as if it were difficult to think what if she knows exactly where we are she could send darkfriends after us or send word to darkfriends in samara luca is livid because eleven menageries are already around the city and three more are waiting to cross the bridge nynaeve it will take her days to regain strength after a wound like that even if she does find some black sister to heal her or one of the other forsaken and more days to search through fifteen menageries that is if there are not more on the road behind us or coming from altara if she does come after us or send darkfriends either one we are forwarned and we have days to find a boat that can carry us downriver she paused a moment thinking do you have anything to dye your hair in that bag of herbs ill wager anything that you had your hair braided in telaranrhiod mine is always its natural color there if yours is loose as it is now and another color it will make us that much harder to find whitecloaks everywhere nynaeve sighed galad the prophet no boats it is as if everything is conspiring to hold us here for moghedien i am so tired elayne tired of being afraid of who might be around the next corner tired of being afraid of moghedien i cannot seem to think of what to do next my hair nothing that would make it any color id have you need to sleep elayne said firmly without the ring give it to me the other woman hesitated but elayne merely waited with her hand outstretched until nynaeve fished the flecked stone ring from the cord around her neck stuffing it into her pouch elayne went on now you lie down here and i will watch birgitte nynaeve stared at the woman stretched out on the other bed for a moment then shook her head i cant sleep i need to be alone to walk getting to her feet as stiffly as if she really had been beaten she took her dark cloak from its peg and swung it over her shift at the door she paused if she wants to kill me she said bleakly i do not know that i could make myself stop her she went into the night barefoot and sadfaced elayne hesitated unsure which woman needed her more before settling back where she sat nothing she said could make things better for nynaeve but she had faith in the womans resilience time alone to work it all over in her mind and she would see that blame lay at moghediens door not hers she had to chapter elephant a new name for a long time elayne sat there watching birgitte sleep it did seem to be sleep once she stirred muttering in a desperate voice wait for me gaidal wait im coming gaidal wait for words trailed off into slow breath again was it stronger the woman still looked deathly ill better than she had but pale and drawn after perhaps an hour nynaeve returned her feet dirty fresh tears shone on her cheeks i could not stay away she said hanging her cloak back on its peg you sleep i will watch her i have to watch her elayne rose slowly smoothing her skirts perhaps watching over birgitte for a time would help nynaeve work matters out i dont feel like sleeping yet either she was exhausted but not sleepy any longer i think i will stroll outside myself nynaeve only nodded as she took elaynes place on the bed her dusty feet dangling over the side her eyes fastened to birgitte to elaynes surprise thom and juilin were not asleep either they had built a small fire beside the wagon and sat on either side of it crosslegged on the ground smoking their longstemmed pipes thom had tucked his shirt in and juilin had donned his coat though no shirt and turned the cuffs back she took a look around before joining them no one stirred in the camp dark except for the light of this one fire and the glow of the lamps from their wagons windows neither man said anything while she settled her skirts then juilin looked at thom who nodded and the thiefcatcher took something from the ground and held it out to her i found it where she was lying the dark man said as if it had dropped from her hand elayne took the silver arrow slowly even the fletching feathers appeared to be silver distinctive thom said conversationally around his pipe and added to the braid every story mentions the braid for some reason though ive found some i think might be her under other names without it and some under other names with i do not care about stories juilin put in he sounded no more agitated than thom but then it took a great deal to agitate either one of them is it her bad enough if it isnt a woman appearing naked out of nothing like that but what have you gotten us into you and n nana he was troubled juilin did not make mistakes and his tongue never slipped thom merely bubbled at his pipe waiting elayne turned the arrow in her hands pretending to study it she is a friend she said finally until unless birgitte released her her promise held she is not aes sedai but she has been helping us they looked at her waiting for her to say more why didnt you give this to nynaeve one of those glances passed between them men seemed to carry on entire conversations through glances around women at least saying as clearly as spoken words what they thought of her keeping secrets especially when they all but knew for certain already but she had given her word she seemed upset juilin said sucking at his pipe judiciously and thom took his from between his teeth and blew out his white mustaches upset the woman came out in her shift looking lost and when i asked if i could help her she didnt snap my head off she cried on my shoulder he plucked at his linen shirt muttering something about dampness elayne she apologized for every cross word she has ever said to me which is very nearly every other word out of her mouth said she ought to be switched or maybe that she had been she was incoherent half the time she said she was a coward and a stubborn fool i dont know what is the matter with her but she isnt herself by a mile i knew a woman who behaved like this once juilin said peering into the fire she woke to find a burglar in her bedchamber and stabbed the man through the heart only when she lit a lamp it was her husband his boat had come back to the docks early she walked around like nynaeve for half a month his mouth tightened then she hanged herself i hate to lay this burden on you child thom added gently but if she can be helped you are the only one of us who can do it i know how to take a man out of his miseries give him a swift kick or else get him drunk and find him a pr he harrumphed loudly trying to make it seem a cough and knuckled his mustaches the one bad thing about him seeing her as a daughter was that now sometimes he seemed to think she was perhaps twelve anyway the point is that i do not know how to do this and while juilin might be willing to dandle her on his knee i doubt shed thank him for it i would sooner dandle a fangfish the thiefcatcher muttered but not as roughly as he would have yesterday he was as concerned as thom though less willing to admit it i will do what i can she assured them turning the arrow again they were good men and she did not like lying to them or hiding things from them not unless it was absolutely necessary anyway nynaeve claimed that you had to manage men for their own good but there was such a thing as taking it too far it was not right to lead a man into dangers he knew nothing of so she told them about telaranrhiod and the forsaken being loose about moghedien not quite everything of course some events in tanchico had been too shaming for her to want to think of them her promise held her concerning birgittes identity and there was certainly no need to go into detail about what moghedien had done to nynaeve it made explaining this nights happenings a little difficult yet she managed she did tell them everything she thought they should know enough to make them aware for the first time what they were really up against not just the black ajah that had certainly made them stare crosseyed when they learned it but the forsaken and one of them very likely hunting her and nynaeve and she made it quite plain that they two would be hunting moghedien as well and that anyone close to them was in danger of being caught between hunter and prey either way now that you know she finished the choice to stay or go is yours she left it at that and was careful not to look at thom she hoped almost desperately that he would stay but she would not let him think that she was asking not by so much as a glance i havent taught you half what you need to know if youre to be as good a queen as your mother he said trying to sound gruff and spoiling it by brushing a strand of blackdyed hair from her cheek with a gnarled finger youll not rid yourself of me this easily child i mean to see you mistress of daes daemar if i must drone in your ear until you go deaf i havent even taught you to handle a knife i tried to teach your mother but she always said she could tell a man to use a knife if one needed using fool way to look at it she leaned forward and kissed his leathery cheek and he blinked bushy eyebrows shooting up then smiled and stuck his pipe back into his mouth you can kiss me too juilin said dryly rand althor will have my guts for fish bait if i dont hand you back to him in the same health he last saw you elayne lifted her chin i will not have you stay for rand althor juilin hand her back indeed you will stay only if you want to and i do not release you or you thom he had grinned at the thiefcatchers comment from your promise to do as you are told thoms startled look was quite satisfying she turned back to juilin you will follow me and nynaeve of course knowing full well the enemies we face or you may pack your belongings and ride skulker where you wish i will give him to you juilin sat up straight as a post his dark face going darker i have never abandoned a woman in danger in my life he pointed his pipestem at her like a weapon you send me away and i will be on your heels like a soarer on a sternchase not exactly what she wanted but it would do very well then rising she held herself erect the silver arrow at her side and kept her slightly frosty manner she thought they had finally realized who was in charge morning is not far off had rand actually had the nerve to tell juilin to hand her back thom would just have to suffer along with the other man for a time and it served him right for that grin you will put out this fire and go to sleep now no excuses thom youll be no good at all tomorrow without sleep obediently they began scuffing dirt over the flames with their boots but when she reached the plain wooden steps of the wagon she heard thom say sounds like her mother sometimes then i am glad i have never met the woman juilin grumbled in reply flip for first guard thom murmured an assent she almost went back but found herself smiling instead men it was a fond thought her good mood lasted until she was inside nynaeve sat on the very edge of the bed holding herself up with both hands eyes trying to drift shut as she watched birgitte her feet were still dirty elayne put birgittes arrow into one of the cupboards behind some rough sacks of dried peas luckily the other woman never so much as glanced at her she did not think the sight of the silver arrow was what nynaeve needed right at that moment but what was nynaeve it is past time for you to wash your feet and go to sleep nynaeve swayed in her direction blinking sleepily feet what i must watch her it would have to be one step at a time your feet nynaeve they are dirty wash them frowning nynaeve peered down at her dusty feet then nodded she spilled water tipping the big white pitcher over the washbasin and sloshed more out before she was washed and ready to towel dry but even then she resumed her seat i must watch in case in case she cried out once for gaidal elayne pressed her back on the mattress you need sleep nynaeve you cant keep your eyes open i can nynaeve muttered sullenly trying to sit up against elaynes pressure on her shoulders i must watch her elayne i must nynaeve made the two men outside look sensible and biddable even if elayne had had a mind to there was no way to get her drunk and find her a a pretty young man she supposed it would have to be that left a swift kick sympathy and common sense had surely made no impression i have had enough of this sulking and selfpity nynaeve she said firmly you are going to sleep now and in the morning you are not going to say one word about what a miserable wretch you are if you cannot behave like the clearheaded woman you are i will ask cerandin to give you two black eyes for the one i took away you did not even thank me for that now go to sleep nynaeves eyes widened indignantly at least she did not look on the point of tears but elayne slid them shut with her fingers they closed easily and despite softly murmured protests the deep slow breath of sleep followed quickly elayne patted nynaeves shoulder before straightening she hoped it was a peaceful sleep with dreams of lan but any sort of sleep was better for her now than none fighting a yawn she bent to check birgitte she could not tell whether the womans color or breathing was any better there was nothing to do but wait and hope the lamps did not seem to be bothering either of the women so she left them alight and sat on the floor between the beds they should help keep her awake not that she knew why she should remain awake really she had done what she could as much as nynaeve had unthinkingly she leaned back against the front wall and her chin sank slowly to her chest the dream was a pleasant one if odd rand knelt before her and she put a hand on his head and bonded him as her warder one of her warders she would have to choose green now with birgitte there were other women there faces changing between one glance and the next nynaeve min moiraine aviendha berelain amathera liandrin others she did not know whoever they were she knew that she had to share him with them because in the dream she was certain that that was what min had viewed she was not sure how she felt about that some of those faces she wanted to claw to shreds but if it was fated by the pattern it would have to be yet she would have one thing of him the others could never have the bond between warder and aes sedai where is this place berelain said ravenhaired and so beautiful that elayne wanted to bare her teeth the woman wore the lowcut red dress that luca wanted nynaeve to wear she always dressed revealingly wake up this is not telaranrhiod elayne started awake to find birgitte leaning over the side of the bed gripping her arm weakly her face was too pale and damp with sweat as if a fever had broken but her blue eyes were sharp and intent on elaynes face this is not telaranrhiod it was not a question but elayne nodded and birgitte sank back with a long sigh i remember everything she whispered i am here as i am and i remember all is changed gaidal is out there somewhere an infant or even a young boy but even if i find him what will he think of a woman more than old enough to be his mother she scrubbed angrily at her eyes muttering i do not cry i never cry i remember that the light help me i never cry elayne got up on her knees beside the womans bed you will find him birgitte she kept her voice low nynaeve still seemed sound asleep a small rasping snore rose from her regularly but she needed rest not to confront this all over again now somehow you will and he will love you i know he will do you think that is what matters i could stand him not loving me her glistening eyes gave her the lie he will need me elayne and i will not be there he always has more courage than is good for him i always must supply him with caution worse he will wander searching for me not knowing what he is looking for not knowing why he feels incomplete we are always together elayne two halves of a whole the tears welled up flowing across her face moghedien said she would make me cry forever and she suddenly her features contorted low ragged sobs came as if ripped from her throat elayne gathered the taller woman into her arms murmuring words of comfort she knew were useless how would she feel if rand were taken away from her the thought was nearly enough to make her put her head down atop birgittes and join her weeping she was not sure how long it took birgitte to cry herself out but eventually she pushed elayne away and settled back wiping her cheeks with her fingers i have never done that except as a small child never twisting her neck she frowned at nynaeve still asleep on the other bed did moghedien hurt her badly i have not seen anyone trussed like that since the tourag took mareesh elayne must have looked confused because she added in another age is she hurt not badly her spirit mainly what you did allowed her to escape but only after elayne could not make herself say it too many wounds were too fresh she blames herself she thinks that everything is her fault for asking you to help if she had not asked me moghedien would be teaching her to beg right now she has as little caution as gaidal birgittes dry tone sounded odd with her wet cheeks she did not drag me into this by my hair if she claims responsibility for the consequences then she claims responsibility for my actions if anything she sounded angry i am a free woman and i made my own choices she did not decide for me i must say you are taking this better than i would she could not say better than nynaeve that was true but the other was as well i always say if you must mount the gallows give a jest to the crowd a coin to the hangman and make the drop with a smile on your lips birgittes smile was grim moghedien sprang the trap but my neck is not yet snapped perhaps i will surprise her before it is done the smile faded into a frown as she studied elayne i can feel you i think i could close my eyes and point to you a mile away elayne took a very deep breath i bonded you as a warder she said in a rush you were dying and healing did no good and the woman was looking at her not frowning anymore but her eyes were disconcertingly sharp there was no other choice birgitte you would have died else a warder birgitte said slowly i think i remember hearing a tale of a female warder but it was in a life so long ago that i cannot remember more than that it was time for another deep breath and this time she had to force the words there is something you should know you will discover it sooner or later and ive decided not to keep things from people who have a right to know not unless i absolutely must a third breath i am not aes sedai i am only accepted for a long moment the goldenbraided woman stared up at her then slowly shook her head an accepted in the trolloc wars i knew an accepted who bonded a fellow barashelle was due to be tested the next day for raising to full aes sedai and certain to be given the shawl but she was afraid that a woman testing that same day would take him in the trolloc wars the tower tried to raise women as quickly as possible from necessity what happened elayne could not stop herself from asking barashelle that name sounded familiar lacing her fingers over the blanket atop her bosom birgitte shifted her head on the pillow and put on a look of mock sympathy needless to say she was not allowed to take the tests once it was discovered necessity did not outweigh such an offense they made her pass the poor fellows bond to another and to teach her patience put her into the kitchens among the scullions and spitgirls i heard that she stayed there three years and when she did receive her shawl the amyrlin seat herself chose her warder a leatherfaced stonestubborn man named anselan i saw them a few years after and i could not tell which of them gave the commands i do not think barashelle was certain either not pleasant elayne muttered three years in the wait barashelle and anselan it could not be the same pair that story said nothing about barashelle being aes sedai but she had read two versions and heard thom tell another and all had barashelle doing some long arduous service to earn anselans love two thousand years could change a great deal in a story not pleasant birgitte agreed and suddenly her eyes were much too large and innocent in her pale face i suppose since you wish me to keep your dreadful secret you will not ride me as hard as some aes sedai ride their warders it would not do to push me to tell just to escape you elaynes chin came up instinctively that sounds very like a threat i do not take well to threats from you or anyone else if you think the reclining woman caught her arm and cut her off apologetically her grip was noticeably stronger please i did not intend it that way gaidal claims i have a sense of humor like a rock tossed into a shojacircle a cloud swept across her face at gaidals name and was gone you saved my life elayne i will keep your secret and serve you as warder and be your friend if you will have me i will be proud to have you for friend shojacircle she would ask another time birgitte might be stronger but she needed rest not questions and for warder it seemed that she really was going to choose the green ajah aside from everything else that was the only way she could bond rand the dream was still clear in her mind and she intended to convince him to accept it one way or another perhaps you could try to moderate your sense of humor i will try birgitte sounded as if she were saying she would try to pick up a mountain but if i am to be your warder even in secret then i will be warder to you you can barely hold your eyes open it is time for you to sleep elaynes eyebrows and chin shot up together but the woman gave her no opportunity to speak among many other things it is a warders place to tell his her aes sedai when she pushes herself too hard also to provide a dose of caution when she thinks she can walk into the pit of doom and to keep her alive so she can do what she must i will do these things for you never fear for your back when i am near elayne she did need sleep she supposed but birgitte needed it more elayne dimmed the lamps and got the woman settled and asleep though not until birgitte had seen her put a pillow and blankets on the floor between the beds for herself there was some slight argument over who would sleep on the floor but birgitte was still weak enough that elayne had no trouble making her stay in the bed well not very much anyway at least nynaeves soft snore never broke she herself did not go to sleep immediately whatever she had told birgitte the woman could not put her nose outside the wagon until she had something to wear and she was taller than elayne or nynaeve sitting down between the beds elayne began letting out the hem on her dark gray silk riding dress there would hardly be time in the morning for more than a quick fitting and stitching the new hem sleep overtook her with her ripping no more than half done she had the dream of bonding rand again more than once sometimes he knelt voluntarily and sometimes she had to do what she had done with birgitte even sneaking into his bedchamber while he slept birgitte was one of the other women now elayne did not mind that too much not her or min or egwene or aviendha or nynaeve though she could not imagine what lan would say to that last others though she had just ordered birgitte in a warders colorshifting cloak to drag berelain and elaida to the kitchens for three years when suddenly the two women began pummeling her she awakened to find nynaeve trampling her to reach birgitte and check on the woman the gray light just before dawn showed in the small windows birgitte woke claiming she was as strong as ever and ravenous besides elayne was not certain whether nynaeve had finished her bout of selfblame she did not wring her hands or speak of it but while elayne washed her face and hands and explained about the menagerie and why they had to remain with it a while longer nynaeve hastily peeled and cored red pears and yellow apples sliced cheese and handed it all to birgitte on a plate with a cup of watered wine with honey and spices she would have fed the woman had birgitte let her nynaeve washed birgittes hair in white henpepper herself until it was as black as elaynes elayne did her own of course donated her best stockings and shift and looked disappointed when a pair of elaynes slippers fit better she insisted on helping birgitte into the gray silk as soon as her hair had been toweled dry and braided again the hips and bosom needed letting out too but that would have to wait and even wanted to stitch the hem herself until elaynes incredulous stare made her retreat to her own ablutions muttering as she scrubbed her face that she could sew as well as anyone when she wanted to when they went outside at last the first sharp golden edge of the sun was peeking above the trees to the east for this little while the day felt deceptively comfortable there was not a cloud to be seen in the sky and by noon the air would be hot and gritty thom and juilin were hitching the team to the wagon and the whole camp bustled in preparation for moving skulker was already saddled and elayne made a note to herself to speak up about riding today herself before one of the men took possession of the saddle even if thom or juilin got there first though she would not be too disappointed this very afternoon she would highwalk in front of people for the first time the costume luca had shown her made her a little nervous but at least she was not moaning about it as nynaeve did luca himself came striding rapidly through the camp red cloak fluttering behind chivvying and shouting unneeded instructions latelle wake those bloody bears i want them on their feet snarling when we drive through samara clarine you watch those dogs this time if one of them goes chasing after a cat again brugh you and your brothers do your tumbling just ahead of my wagon mind just ahead this is supposed to be a stately procession not a race to see which of you can backflip the fastest cerandin keep those boarhorses in hand i want people to gasp in amazement not run in terror he stopped at their wagon glowering at nynaeve and herself equally with a bit left over for birgitte kind of you to decide to come with the rest of us mistress nana my lady morelin i thought you meant to sleep until midday he nodded toward birgitte having a chat with someone from across the river are you well weve no time for visitors i mean to be set up and performing by noon nynaeve looked taken aback by the onslaught but by the end of his second sentence she was meeting him glare for glare whatever her awkwardness toward birgitte it apparently did not hinder her temper where others were concerned we will be ready as soon as anyone and you know it valan luca besides an hour or two will make no difference anyway there are enough people gathered on the other side of the river that if one in a hundred comes to your show it will be more than you ever dreamed if we decide to make a leisurely breakfast you can just twiddle your thumbs and wait youll not get what you want if you leave us behind that was her bluntest reminder yet of the promised hundred gold marks but for once it did not slow him enough people enough people people must be attracted woman chin akima has been in place three days and he has a fellow who juggles swords and axes and nine acrobats nine some woman ive never heard of has two women acrobats who do things on a hanging rope that would make the chavanas eyes pop you would not believe the crowds sillia cerano has men with their faces painted like court fools splashing each other with water and hitting each other over the head with bladders and people are paying an extra silver penny just to watch suddenly his eyes narrowed focusing on birgitte would you be willing to paint your face sillia doesnt have a woman among her fools some of the horse handlers would be willing it doesnt hurt getting hit with an inflated bladder and i will pay you he trailed off musing he did not like parting with money any more than nynaeve did and birgitte spoke into his momentary silence i am not a fool and will not be a fool i am an archer an archer he muttered eyeing the intricate glossy black braid pulled over her left shoulder and i suppose you call yourself birgitte what are you one of those idiots hunting the horn of valere even if the thing exists what chance any one of you will find it more than another i was in illian when the hunters oaths were given and there were thousands in the great square of tammaz but for glory that you can attain nothing can outshine the applause of i am an archer pretty man birgitte broke in firmly fetch a bow and i will outshoot you or anyone you name a hundred crowns gold to your one elayne expected nynaeve to yelp it was they who would have to cover the wager if birgitte lost and whatever she claimed elayne did not think birgitte could be fully recovered already yet all nynaeve did was close her eyes briefly and draw a deep long breath women luca growled thom and juilin did not have to look as if they agreed you are a fine match for the lady morelin and nana or whatever their names are he swept his silk cloak in a wide gesture at the surrounding hustle of men and horses it may have escaped your keen eye brigitte but i have a show to get under way and my rivals are already draining samara of coin like the cutpurses they are birgitte smiled a slight curving of her lips are you afraid pretty man we can make your side a silver penny elayne thought luca might have apoplexy from the color that crept into his face his neck suddenly looked too big for his collar i will fetch my bow he almost hissed you can work off the hundred marks with your face painted or cleaning cages for all i care are you sure that you are well enough elayne asked birgitte as he stalked off muttering to himself the only word she caught was a repeat of women nynaeve was looking at the woman with the braid as if she wanted the ground to open and swallow her herself not birgitte a number of the horse handlers had gathered around thom and juilin for some reason he has nice legs birgitte said but i have never liked tall men add a pretty face and they are always insufferable petra had joined the group of men twice as wide as any other he said something then shook hands with thom the chavanas were there as well and latelle talking earnestly with thom while darting dark looks at nynaeve and the two women with her by the time luca returned with an unstrung bow and a quiver of arrows no one was making preparations any longer the wagons and horses and cages even the tethered boarhorses stood abandoned the people all clustered around thom and the thiefcatcher they followed as luca led the way a short distance out of the camp i am accounted a fair shot he said carving a white cross chesthigh to himself on the trunk of a tail oak he had some of his jauntiness back and he swaggered as he strode off fifty paces i will take the first shot so you can see what you face birgitte plucked the bow from his hand and walked off another fifty as he stared after her she shook her head over the bow but braced it on her slippered foot and strung it in one smooth motion before luca joined her and elayne and nynaeve birgitte pulled an arrow from the quiver he held examined it a moment then tossed it aside like rubbish luca frowned and opened his mouth but she was already discarding a second shaft the next three went to the leafcovered ground as well before she stuck one pointdown in the soil beside her of twentyone she kept only four she can do it elayne whispered trying to sound certain nynaeve nodded bleakly if they had to pay out a hundred gold crowns they would soon be selling the jewelry amathera had given them the lettersofrights were all but useless as she had explained to nynaeve their use would eventually point a finger to where they had been for elaida if not where they were if i had just spoken up in time i could have stopped this as my warder she has to do as i say doesnt she from the evidence so far obedience was no part of the bond had those aes sedai she had spied on made the men give oaths as well now that she thought of it she believed one of them had birgitte nocked an arrow raised the bow and loosed seemingly without pausing to aim elayne winced but the steel point struck dead center in the middle of the carved white cross before it stopped quivering the second brushed in beside it birgitte did wait a moment then but only for the two arrows to still a gasp rose from the onlookers as the third shaft split the first but that was nothing to the absolute silence as the last split the other just as neatly once could have been chance twice luca looked as if his eyes were coming out of his head mouth hanging open he stared at the tree then at birgitte at the tree then birgitte she proffered the bow and he shook his head weakly suddenly he flung the quiver away spreading his arms wide with a glad cry not knives arrows from a hundred paces nynaeve sagged against elayne as the man explained what he wanted but she made not one sound of protest thom and juilin were collecting money most handed over coins with a sigh or a laugh but juilin had to snag latelles arm as she tried to slip away and speak some angry words before she dug coins from her pouch so that was what they had been up to she would have to speak to them firmly but later nana you dont have to go through with this the woman only stared at birgitte eyes haggard our wager birgitte said when luca ran out of wind he grimaced then fished slowly into his pouch and tossed her a coin elayne caught the glint of gold in the sun as birgitte examined it then tossed it right back the bet was a silver penny on your part lucas eyes widened in startlement but the next moment he was laughing and pressing the gold crown into her hand you are worth every copper of it what do you say why the queen of ghealdan herself might come to see a performance such as yours birgitte and her arrows we will paint them silver and the bow desperately elayne wanted birgitte to look at her they might as well put up a sign for moghedien as do what the man suggested but birgitte only bounced the coin on her hand grinning paint will ruin an already shabby bow she said finally and call me maerion i was called that once leaning on the bow she let her smile widen can i have a red dress too elayne heaved a sigh of fervent relief nynaeve looked as if she were going to sick up chapter lion rampant performances in samara for what seemed the hundredth time nynaeve held a lock of her hair up to look at it and sighed thick murmurs of talk and laughter from hundreds if not thousands of throats distant music that was nearly drowned out drifted in through the wagon walls she had not minded spending the parade through the streets of samara in the wagon with elayne occasional peeks through the windows had convinced her that she would just as soon not be put in those packed crowds yelling and barely making way for the wagons but every time she looked at the brassy red of her hair she wished she had been doing somersaults with the chavanas rather than dyeing it carefully not looking at herself she wrapped up completely in her plain dark gray shawl turned and gave a start to find birgitte standing in the doorway the woman had ridden in clarine and petras wagon during the parade with clarine altering a spare red dress she had been making for nynaeve at lucas direction he had given clarine her instructions before nynaeve ever agreed birgitte wore it now her blackdyed braid pulled over her shoulder so it nestled between her breasts totally unconscious of the low square neck just looking at her made nynaeve fold her shawl tighter birgitte could not show a fingernail more of pale bosom and retain the slightest claim to decency as it was such a claim would be feeble really quite laughable looking at her made nynaeves stomach knot up but not for reasons of clothes or skin if you are going to wear the dress why cover up birgitte came inside and closed the door behind her you are a woman why not be proud of it if you think i shouldnt nynaeve replied hesitantly and slowly let the shawl slide down to her elbows revealing the twin of the other womans garment she felt all but naked i only thought i thought gripping her silk skirts hard to keep her hands at her sides she held her gaze on the other woman even knowing she wore exactly the same herself it was easier that way birgitte grimaced and if i wanted you to lower the neck another inch nynaeve opened her mouth face going as scarlet as the gown but for a moment nothing came out when it did she sounded as if she were being strangled there isnt an inch to lower it look at your own there isnt a tenth three quick frowning strides and birgitte bent slightly to put her face right in nynaeves and if i said i wanted you to rid yourself of that inch she snarled showing teeth what if i wanted to paint your face so luca could have his fool what if i stripped you out of it altogether and painted you from head to toe a fine target you would make then every man inside fifty miles would come to see nynaeves mouth worked but this time no sound emerged at all she wanted very much to close her eyes maybe when she opened them none of this would be happening with a disgusted shake of her head birgitte took a seat on one of the beds one elbow on her knee and her blue eyes sharp this must stop when i look at you you flinch you run about waiting on me hand and foot if i glance for a stool you fetch one if i lick my lips you have a cup of wine in my hands before i know i am thirsty you would wash my back and put the slippers on my feet if i let you i am neither monster nor invalid nor child nynaeve i am only trying to make up for she began timidly and jumped when the other woman roared make up you are trying to make me less no no it is not that truly i am to blame you take responsibility for my actions birgitte broke in fiercely i chose to speak to you in telaranrhiod i chose to help you i chose to track moghedien and i chose to take you to see her me not you nynaeve me i was not your puppet your pack hound then and i will not be now nynaeve swallowed hard and gripped her skirts more tightly she had no right to be angry with this woman no right at all but birgitte had every right you did what i asked it is my fault that you that you are here it is all my fault have i mentioned fault i see none only men and dimwitted girls take blame where there is none and you are neither it was my foolish pride that made me think i could best her again and my cowardice that let her that let her if i had not been so afraid i could not spit i might have done something in time a coward birgittes eyes widened openly incredulous and scorn touched her voice you i thought you had more sense than to confuse fear with cowardice you could have fled telaranrhiod when moghedien released you but you stayed to fight no fault or blame to you that you could not drawing a deep breath she rubbed her forehead for a moment then leaned forward intently again listen to me close nynaeve i take no blame for what was done to you i saw but i could not twitch had moghedien tied you into a knot or cored you like an apple still i would take no blame i did what i could when i could and you did the same it was not the same nynaeve tried to take the heat out of her voice it was my fault that you were there my fault that you are here if you she stopped to swallow again if you miss when you shoot at me today i want you to know that i will understand i do not miss where i aim birgitte said dryly and where i aim will not be at you she began taking things from one of the cabinets and laying them on the small table halffinished arrows scraped shafts steel arrow points stone glue pot fine cord gray goose feathers for fletchings she had said she would make her own bow too as soon as she could lucas she called a knotriddled branch broken from a crossgrained tree by a blind idiot in the middle of the night i liked you nynaeve she said as she laid everything out thorns warts and all i no longer do as you are now you have no reason to like me now nynaeve said miserably but the other woman spoke right over her without looking up and i will not allow you to make me less to make my decisions less by claiming responsibility for them i have had few women friends but most have had tempers like snowghosts i wish you could be my friend once more what under the light was a snowghost something from another age no doubt i would never try to make you less birgitte i only birgitte paid her no mind except to raise her voice her attention seemed all on her arrow shafts i would like to like you again whether you return the liking or not but i cannot until you are yourself again i could live with you a milktongued sniveling wretch if that was what you were i take people as they are not as i would like them to be or else i leave them but that is not what you are and i will not accept your reasons for playing at it so clarine told me of your encounter with cerandin now i know what to do the next time you claim my decisions as your own she swished a length of ashwood vigorously i am sure latelle will be happy to provide the switch nynaeve forced her jaws to unclench forced her tone as smooth as she could make it you have a perfect right to do whatever you wish to me her fists in her skirts quivered more than her voice a touch of temper showing just at the edges birgitte grinned at her at once amused and startlingly feral how long before it bursts into flame i am willing to wear out any number of switches if need be the grin faded into seriousness i will make you see the right of this or i will drive you away there is no other course i cannot will not leave elayne that bond honors me and i will honor it and her and i will not allow you to think that you make my decisions or made them i am myself not an appendage to you now go away i must finish these arrows if i am to have even a few shafts that will fly true i do not mean to kill you and i would not have it happen by accident unstopping the glue pot she bent over the table do not forget to curtsy like a good girl on your way out nynaeve made it as far as the foot of the steps before pounding her fist on her thigh in a fury how dare the woman did she think that she could just did she think that nynaeve would put up with i thought she could do anything she wanted to you a small voice whispered in her head i said she could kill me she snarled at it not humiliate me before much longer everybody would be threatening her with that bloody seanchan woman the wagons stood abandoned except for a few roughcoated horse handlers for guards near the tall sprawling canvas fence erected to contain lucas show from this large browngrass meadow half a mile from samara the gray stone walls of the city were clearly visible with squat towers at the gates and a few of the taller buildings showing roofs of thatch or tile outside the walls villages of huts and rude shanties sprouted like mushrooms in every direction full of the prophets followers and they had stripped every tree for miles either for building or for firewood the shows entrance for patrons was on the other side but two of the horse handlers with stout cudgels stood on this side to discourage any who did not want to pay from entering as the performers did nynaeve was almost upon them striding as hard as she could and muttering angrily to herself when their idiotic grins made her realize that the shawl was still looped over her elbows her stare wiped their faces blank only then did she cover herself properly and slowly she was not about to have these louts think they could make her yelp and leap the skinny one with a nose that took up half of his face held the canvas flap aside and she ducked through into pandemonium everywhere people thronged in noisy milling clusters of men and women and children in chattering streams flowing from one attraction to the next all but the sredit performed on raised wooden stages luca had had built cerandins boarhorses had the largest crowd the huge gray animals actually balancing on their forelegs even the baby long snouts curved up sinuously while clarines dogs had the smallest for all they did backsprings and flips over each others backs a good many people paused to stare at the lions and the hairy boarlike capars in their cages the strangely horned deer from arafel and saldaea and arad doman and the bright birds from the light knew where and some waddling brownfurred creatures with big eyes and round ears that sat placidly eating leaves from branches gripped in their forepaws lucas tale on where they came from varied she supposed he did not know and he had not been able to make up a name for them that pleased him a huge snake from the marshes of illian four times as long as a man earned nearly as many gasps as the sredit although simply lying there apparently asleep but she was pleased to see that latelles bears at the moment standing atop huge red wooden balls that they rolled in circles with their feet attracted few more than the dogs bears these people could see in their own forests even if these did have white faces latelle sparkled in the afternoon sunlight in her black spangles cerandin glittered almost as much in blue and clarine in green though neither had quite as many sequins sewn on as latelle but every last one of the dresses had a collar right up under the chin of course petra and the chavanas were performing attired only in bright blue breeches but that was to show off their muscles only understandable the acrobats were standing one atop the others shoulders four high not far from them the strongman took a long bar with a large iron ball at each end two men were needed to hand the thing up to him and immediately began twirling it in his thick hands even spinning the bar around his neck and across his back thom was juggling fire and eating it as well eight flaming batons made a perfect circle then suddenly he had four in each hand one sticking up from each cluster deftly popping each upraised flaming end into his mouth in turn he appeared to swallow and took them out extinguished looking as if he had just had something tasty nynaeve could not fathom how he did not scorch his mustaches off much less burn his throat a twist of his wrists and the unlit batons folded into the lit like fans a moment later they were making two interlinked circles above his head he wore the same brown coat he always did though luca had given him a red one sewn with sequins from the way thoms bushy eyebrows rose as she stalked past he did not understand why she glared at him his own coat indeed she hurried on toward the thick impatiently buzzing crowd circled around the two tall poles with the rope stretched tightly between she had to use her elbows to reach the front row though two women did glare and snatch their men out of her way when the shawl slipped she would have glared back had she not been so busy blushing and covering herself luca was there frowning as anxiously as a husband outside a birthing room next to a thick fellow with his head shaved except for a grizzled topknot she slipped in on the other side of luca the shavenheaded man had a villainous look a long scar sliced down his left cheek and a patch over that eye was painted with a scowling red replacement few of the men she had seen here were armed with more than a belt knife but he wore a sword strapped to his back the long hilt rising above his right shoulder he looked vaguely familiar for some reason but her mind was all on the highrope luca frowned at the shawl smiled at her and tried to put an arm around her waist while he was still trying to catch his breath from her elbow and she was still getting her shawl decently back in place juilin came staggering out of the crowd on the other side conical red hat tilted jauntily coat half off one shoulder and a wooden mug in his fist slopping over the rim with the overcareful steps of a man whose head contains more wine than brains he approached the rope ladder leading up to one of the high platforms and stared at it go on someone shouted break your fool neck wait friend luca called starting forward with smiles and flourishes of his cloak that is no place for a man with a belly full of setting the mug on the ground juilin scampered up the ladder and stood swaying on the platform nynaeve held her breath the man had a head for heights and well he should after a life of chasing thieves across the rooftops of tear but still juilin turned as if lost he appeared too drunk to see or remember the ladder his eyes fixed on the rope tentatively he put one foot onto the narrow span then drew it back pushing the hat back to scratch his head he studied the taut rope and abruptly brightened visibly slowly he got down on hands and knees and crawled wobbling out onto the rope luca shouted for him to come down and the crowd roared with laughter halfway across juilin stopped swaying awkwardly and peered back his eyes latching onto the mug he had left on the ground plainly he was considering how to get back to it slowly with exceeding care he stood facing the way he had come and wavering from side to side a gasp rose from the crowd as his foot slipped and he fell somehow catching himself with one hand and a knee hooked around the rope luca caught the taraboner hat as it fell shouting to everyone that the man was mad and whatever happened was no responsibility of his nynaeve pressed both hands tight against her middle she could imagine being up there and even that was enough to make her feel ill the man was a fool a pure bullgoose fool with an obvious effort juilin managed to catch the rope with his other hand and pulled himself along it handoverhand to the far platform swaying from side to side he brushed his coat tried to pull it straight and succeeded only in changing which shoulder hung down and spotted his mug at the floor of the other pole pointing to it gleefully he stepped out onto the rope again this time at least half the onlookers shouted for him to go back shouted that there was a ladder behind him the others only laughed uproariously no doubt waiting for him to break his neck he walked across smoothly slid down the rope ladder with his hands and feet on the outside and snatched up the wooden mug to take a deep drink not until luca clapped the red hat on juilins head and they both bowed luca flourishing his cloak in such a way that juilin was behind it half the time did the watchers realize that it had all been part of the show a moment of silence and then they exploded with applause and cheers and laughter nynaeve had half thought they might turn ugly after being duped the fellow with the topknot looked villainous even while laughing leaving juilin standing beside the ladder luca came back to stand between nynaeve and the man with the topknot i thought that would go well he sounded incredibly selfsatisfied and he made little bows to the crowd as if he had been the one up on the rope giving him a sour frown she had no time to speak the acid comment on her tongue because elayne came bounding through the crowd to stand beside juilin with her arms upraised and one knee bent nynaeves mouth tightened and she shifted her shawl irritably whatever she thought of the red dress that she had found herself wearing without really knowing how she was not sure that elaynes costume was not worse the daughterheir of andor was all in snow white with a scattering of white sequins sparkling on her short coat and snug breeches nynaeve had not really believed that elayne would actually appear in the clothes in public but she had been too concerned over her own attire to give her opinion the coat and breeches made her think of min she had never approved of min wearing boys clothes but the color and spangles made these even more flagrant juilin held the rope ladder for elayne to climb though there was no need she went up as adeptly as he could have he vanished into the crowd as soon as she reached the top where she posed again beaming at the thunderous applause as if at the adulation of her subjects as she stepped out onto the rope somehow it seemed even thinner than when juilin had been on it nynaeve all but ceased breathing and she stopped thinking of elaynes clothes or her own at all elayne made her way out onto the rope arms outstretched to either side and she was not channeling a platform of air slowly she stepped her way across one foot in front of the other never wavering supported only by the rope channeling would be far too dangerous if moghedien had even a clue to where they were the forsaken or black sisters could be in samara and they would be able to feel the weave and if they were not in samara now they might be soon on the far platform elayne paused to considerably more applause than juilin had received nynaeve could not understand that and started back almost to the end she pivoted smoothly walked back halfway pivoted again and wobbled just catching herself nynaeve felt as though a hand had her by the throat at a slow steady pace elayne highwalked to the platform once more posing to thunderous shouts and clapping nynaeve swallowed her heart and breathed again raggedly but she knew it was not over raising her hands above her head elayne suddenly cartwheeled herself along the rope black tresses whipping whitesheathed legs flashing in the sun nynaeve yelped and clutched lucas arm as the girl reached the far platform stumbled in landing and caught herself just short of going over the edge whats the matter he murmured beneath the gasp rising from the crowd youve seen her do this every evening since sienda and a good many other places too i would think of course she said weakly eyes fixed on elayne she barely noticed the arm he slipped around her shoulders certainly not enough to do anything about it she had tried to talk the girl into feigning a sprained ankle but elayne insisted that after all of that practice with the power she did not need it now maybe juilin did not apparently he did not but elayne had never gone scrambling over rooftops in the night the return cartwheels went perfectly and the landing but nynaeve did not look away or loose her hold on lucas sleeve after what now seemed the inevitable pause for applause elayne returned to the rope for more pivots one leg raised and whipping down and up so quickly that it seemed she kept it outstretched the whole while and for a slow handstand that lifted her straight as a dagger whiteslippered toes pointed to the sky and a backflip that had the crowd gasping and her swaying from side to side only just catching her balance thom merrilin had taught her that and the handstand from the corner of her eye nynaeve caught thom two places down from her eyes riveted to elayne poised on the balls of his feet he looked as proud as a peacock he looked ready to rush forward and catch her if she fell if she did fall it would be at least partly his fault he should never have taught her those things one last passage of cartwheels white legs flashing and glittering in the sun faster than before a passage that had never been mentioned to nynaeve she would have eviscerated luca with her tongue had he not muttered angrily that elayne adding to the act just for applause was a good way to break her neck one last pause to pose for more of that applause and elayne at last climbed down shouting the crowd rushed in on her luca and four horse handlers with cudgels appeared around her as if by the power but even so thom beat them to her limp and all nynaeve jumped as high as she could just managing to see over enough heads to make out elayne the girl did not seem frightened or even taken aback by all the waving hands trying to touch her stretching between her encircling guards head high face flushed from effort she still managed a cool and regal grace as she was escorted away how she could do that garbed as she was nynaeve simply could not imagine face like a bloody queen the oneeyed man muttered to himself he had not gone running with the others but merely let them stream past roughly dressed in a plain coat of dark gray wool he certainly looked solid enough to have no fears of being knocked down and trampled he appeared as if he could use that sword burn me for a sheepgutted farmer but shes flaming well brave enough for a bloody queen nynaeve gaped at him as he strode away through the crowd and it was not his language or rather it was partly now she remembered where she had seen him a oneeyed man with a topknot who could not say two sentences without the vilest curses forgetting about elayne she was certainly safe enough nynaeve began pushing her way through the throng after him chapter serpent and wheel an old acquaintance with the crowds it took nynaeve some little time to catch up muttering every time she was jostled by a man gaping at everything in sight or a woman dragging a child with either hand children usually trying to drag her to two different attractions at once the oneeyed man barely paused to look at anything except the big snake and the lions until he reached the boarhorses he had to have seen them earlier situated as they were near the patrons entrance every time the sredit stood on their hind legs as they were doing now the great tusked heads of the adults could be seen by those outside the canvas fence and the press to enter intensified a little more beneath a wide red sign that said valan luca in ornate gold script on both sides two of the horse handlers collected admission from people funneled between two thick ropes taking the money in clear blownglass pitchers both thick and flawed luca would never lay out coin for better so they could see that the coins were right without touching them they dumped the money straight from the pitchers through a hole in the top of an ironstrapped box so wrapped about with chain that petra had to have put it in place before the first silver penny went in another pair of horse handlers thickshouldered brokennosed men with the sunken knuckles of brawlers stood nearby with cudgels to make sure that the crowd remained orderly and to keep an eye on the men taking the money nynaeve suspected luca was not a trusting man especially when it came to coin in fact he was as tight as the skin on an apple she had never met anyone so stingy slowly she elbowed close to the man with the graystreaked topknot he had had no trouble reaching the front rank before the sredit of course his scar and painted eyepatch would have seen to that even without the sword on his back at the moment he was watching the big gray animals with a grin and what she supposed was wonder on that stony face uno she thought that was the right name his head turned to stare at her once she had the shawl back in place he raised the stare to her face but no recognition lit in his dark eye the other the painted red glaring one made her a little queasy cerandin waved her goad shouting something slurred beyond intelligibility and the sredit turned sanit the cow placing her feet on mers broad rounded back while he remained upright nerin the calf put her feet low on sanits back i saw you in fal dara nynaeve said and again on toman head briefly after falme you were with she did not know how much she could say with people cheekbyjowl around her rumors of the dragon reborn had circulated all through amadicia and some even had his name right with rand unos real eye narrowed she tried not to see the other and after a moment he nodded i remember the face i never forget a flaming pretty face but the hair was bloody well different nyna nynaeve she told him sharply he shook his head eyeing her up and down and before she could say another word he had seized her arm and was all but dragging her out through the entrance the horse handlers there recognized her of course and the brokennosed fellows started forward hefting their cudgels she waved them away furiously even as she was yanking her arm free it took three tries and still it was more a matter of his letting go the man had a grip like iron the men with the clubs hesitated then drifted back to their places when they saw uno drop his grip apparently they knew what valan luca would prefer them to be guarding what do you think you are doing she demanded but uno only motioned her to follow watching to see that she did so without more than slowing his stride through the crowd waiting to get in he had slightly bowed legs and moved like a man more used to the back of a horse than his own feet growling to herself she picked up her skirts and stalked after him toward the town two other menageries were set up behind brown canvas walls not far off and beyond them more lay scattered among the crowded shanty villages none too close to the city walls though apparently the governor as they called the woman nynaeve could have named mayor though she had never heard of a woman mayor had decreed half a mile as the distance to protect the town in case any of the animals got loose the sign over the entrance to the nearest show said mairin gome in florid green and gold two women were clearly visible above the sign clinging to a rope hanging from a tall framework of poles that had not been there when lucas walls went up apparently the boarhorses rearing high enough to be seen was having an effect the women contorted themselves into positions that made nynaeve think uncomfortably of what moghedien had done and somehow even managed to hold themselves out in horizontal handstands to either side of the rope the crowd waiting impatiently in front of mistress gomes sign was almost as large as the one in front of lucas none of the other shows had anything visible that she could see and their crowds were much smaller uno refused to answer her questions or say a word or do more than give her dire frowns until they were out of the jam of people and onto a cart path of hardpacked dirt what i am flaming trying to do he growled then is to take you where we can flaming well talk without you being torn to flaming bits by flaming folk trying to kiss your flaming hem when they find out you flaming know the lord dragon there was no one within thirty paces of them but he still stared around for anyone who might hear blood and bloody ashes woman dont you know what these flaming goatheads are like half of them think the creator talks to him over bloody supper every night and the other half think he is the bloody creator i will thank you to moderate your language master uno and i will thank you to slow down too we are not running a footrace where are you going and why should i stir another step with you he rolled his eye toward her chuckling wryly oh i do remember you the one with the fla the mouth ragan thought you could skin and butcher a blo a bull at ten paces with your tongue chaena and nangu thought fifty at least he did shorten his stride nynaeve stopped dead where and why into the town he did not stop he strode right on flipping a hand for her to follow i dont know what youre flam what youre doing here but i remember you were mixed up with that blue woman snarling under her breath she gathered her skirts and hurried after him again it was the only way to hear he continued as if she had been beside him the whole time this is no blood no place for you to be i can scrape together enough blo aagh enough coin to get you to tear i think rumor says thats where the lord dragon is again he looked around warily unless you want to go to the island instead he must have meant tar valon theres blo theres odd rumors floating around about that too peace if there arent he came from a land that had not known peace in three thousand years shienarans used the word as talisman and oath both they say the old amyrlins been deposed executed maybe some say they fought and burned the whole he paused taking a deep breath and grimacing horribly the whole city walking along she studied him in amazement she had not seen him in nearly a year had never spoken more than two words together to him and yet he why did men always think a woman needed a man to look after her men could not lace up their own shirts without a woman to help we are doing quite well as we are thank you unless you know when a river trader will dock on his way downriver we is the blue woman with you or the brown that had to be moiraine and verin he was certainly being cautious no do you remember elayne he gave a blunt nod and a mischievous impulse seized her nothing seemed to faze the man and he obviously expected to just take charge of her welfare you saw her again just now you said she had a she made her voice gruff in imitation of his face like a bloody queen he stumbled in a quite satisfactory way and glared around him so fiercely that even two whitecloaks riding by skirted wide around him though they tried to pretend he had nothing to do with it of course her he growled incredulously but her bloody hair was black as a ravens he glanced at hers and the next minute he was pacing up the cart path again muttering half to himself the flaming woman is daughter to a queen a bloody queen showing her bloody legs that way nynaeve nodded in agreement until he added you bloody southlanders are bloody strange no flaming decency at all he had fine room to talk shienarans might dress properly but she still blushed to remember that in shienar men and women bathed together as often as not and thought no more of it than of eating together did your mother never teach you to talk decently man his real eye frowned at her almost as darkly as the painted one and he rolled his shoulders in fal dara he and everyone else had treated her as nobly born or the next thing to of course it was hard to pass herself off as a lady in that dress and with her hair a shade that nature never made she arranged her shawl more snugly and folded her arms to hold it in place the gray wool was terribly uncomfortable in that dry heat and she herself was not feeling very dry at all she had never heard of anyone who died of sweating but she thought she might well be the first what are you doing here uno he looked around before answering not that he had need there was little traffic on the path an occasional oxdrawn cart a few folk in farm clothes or rougher here and there a man on a horse and no one seemed willing to come any closer to him than they had to he appeared a man who might cut somebodys throat on a whim the blue woman gave us a name in jehannah and said we were to wait there until she sent instructions but the woman in jehannah was dead and buried when we arrived an old woman died in her sleep and none of her relatives had ever heard the blue womans name then masema started talking to people and well there was no point staying there for orders wed never hear if they did come we stay close to masema because he slips us enough to live on though none except bartu and nengar listen to his trash the grizzled topknot swung as he shook his head in irritation suddenly nynaeve realized that there had not been a single obscene word in that he looked about to swallow his tongue perhaps if you cursed only occasionally she sighed maybe once every other sentence the man smiled at her so gratefully that she wanted to throw up her hands in exasperation how is it that masema has money when the rest of you do not she remembered masema a dark sour man who liked no one and nothing why hes the bloody prophet theyve all come to hear would you like to meet him he gave the impression of counting his sentences nynaeve breathed deeply the man was going to take her literally he might find you a flaming boat if you want one in ghealdan what the prophet wants the prophet usually gets no he always flaming gets it in the end one way or another the man was a good soldier but whod have ever thought he would turn out like this his frown took in all the rude villages and the people even the shows and the city ahead nynaeve hesitated the dreaded prophet rousing mobs and riots was masema but he did preach the coming of the dragon reborn they were almost to the town gate and there was time yet before she must stand up and let birgitte shoot arrows at her luca had been more than disappointed that the woman insisted on being called maerion if masema could find a boat heading downriver today maybe on the other hand there were the riots if rumor inflated them tenfold then only hundreds had died in towns and cities farther north only hundreds just dont remind him that you have anything to do with that bloody island uno went on eyeing her thoughtfully now that she thought of it she realized that he very likely did not know what her connection to tar valon actually was women did go there without becoming aes sedai after all to seek help or answers he was aware that she was involved in some way but no more than that he isnt much friendlier to women from there than the whitecloaks are if you just keep your mouth bloody well shut about it hell likely pass it over for somebody who comes from the same village as the lord dragon masema will probably have a flaming boat built the crowds were thicker at the city gates flanked by squat gray towers men and women streaming in and out afoot and mounted in every sort of garb from rags to embroidered silk coats and dresses the gates themselves thick and ironbound stood open under the guard of a dozen spearmen in scaled tunics and round steel caps with flat rims actually the guards paid more attention to half their number of whitecloaks lounging nearby than to anything else it was the men in snowy cloaks and burnished mail who watched the flow of people do the whitecloaks cause much trouble she asked quietly uno pursed his lips as if to spit glanced at her and did not where do they bloody not there was a woman with one of these traveling shows who did tricks sleight of hand four days ago a flaming mob of pigeongutted sheepheads tore the show apart valan luca had certainly never mentioned that peace what they wanted was the woman claimed she was he glowered at the folk hurrying by and lowered his voice aes sedai and a darkfriend broke her bloody neck getting her to a rope so i hear but they hung her corpse anyway masema had the ringleaders beheaded but it was whitecloaks whipped up the bloody mob his scowl matched thered eye painted on his patch theres been too many flaming hangings and beheadings if you bloody well ask me bloody masemas as bad as the bloody whitecloaks when it comes to finding a darkfriend under every flaming rock once every other sentence she murmured and the man actually blushed dont know what im thinking he grumped coming to a stop cant take you in there its half festival and half riot with a cutpurse every third step and a woman not safe outofdoors after dark he sounded more scandalized about the last than the rest in shienar a woman was safe anywhere any time except from trollocs and myrddraal of course and any man would die to see it so not safe ill take you back when i find a way ill come for you that settled it for her pulling her arm loose before he could get a grip on it she quickened her pace toward the gates come along uno and do not dawdle if you dawdle i will leave you behind he caught up to her grumbling under his breath about the stubbornness of women once she understood that that was his subject and that apparently he did not think her injunction against cursing held when talking to himself she stopped listening chapter dragon encounters in samara the whitecloaks at the gates gave uno and nynaeve no more mind than they gave anyone else in the steady throng which was to say a cold suspicious stare searching yet quick too many people made anything else impossible and maybe the scalearmored guards did too not that there was any reason for more except in her mind her great serpent ring and lans heavy gold ring both nestled in her pouch the dresss low neckline meant she could not wear them on the thong but somehow she almost expected children of the light to pick out a towertrained woman by instinct her relief was palpable when those icy unfeeling eyes swept past her the soldiers paid the two of them as little attention once she rearranged her shawl yet again unos scowl might have helped send their eyes back to the whitecloaks but the man had no right to scowl in the first place it was her business rewrapping the folded length of gray wool one more time she tied the ends around her waist the shawl defined her bosom more than she wished and still exposed a bit of cleavage yet it was a considerable improvement on the dress alone at least she would not have to worry about the shawl slipping again if only the thing were not so hot the weather really should be turning soon they were not that far south of the two rivers uno patiently waited on her for a change she was of two minds as to whether this was simple courtesy his scarred face looked a deal too patient but finally they walked together into samara into chaos a babble of noise hung over everything no one sound distinguishable people jammed the rough stonepaved streets all but shoulder to shoulder from slateroofed taverns to thatchroofed stables from raucous inns with simple painted signs like the blue bull or the dancing goose to shops where the signs had no words only a knifeandscissors here a bolt of cloth there a goldsmiths scales or a barbers razor a pot or a lamp or a boot nynaeve saw faces as pale as that of any andorman and as dark as that of any of the sea folk some clean some dirty and coats with high collars low collars no collars drably colored and bright plain and embroidered shabby and near newmade in styles strange as often as familiar one fellow with a dark forked beard wore silver chains across the chest of his plain blue coat and two with their hair in braids men with a black braid over each ear below their shoulders had tiny brass bells sewn to their red coatsleeves and the turneddown tops of thighhigh boots whatever land they hailed from those two were not fools their dark eyes were hard and searching as unos and they carried curved swords on their backs a barechested man in a bright yellow sash skin a deeper brown than aged wood and hands intricately tattooed had to be one of the sea folk though he wore neither earrings nor nose ring the women were equally as diverse hair ranging from raven black to yellow so pale it was nearly white braided or gathered or hanging loose cut short to the shoulders to the waist dresses in worn wool or neat linen or shimmering silk collars brushing chins with lace or embroidery and necklines every bit as low as the one she hid she even saw a coppercomplexioned domani woman in a barely opaque red gown that covered her to the neck and hid next to nothing she wondered how safe that woman would be after dark or in this broad daylight for that matter the occasional whitecloaks and soldiers in that milling mass seemed overwhelmed struggling to make ground as hard as anyone else oxcarts and horsedrawn wagons inched along the haphazardly crisscrossing streets bearers jostled sedanchairs through the crowds and now and then a lacquered coach with a plumed team of four or six made its laborious way liveried footman and steelcapped guards vainly trying to clear a path musicians with flute or zither or bittern played at every corner where there was not a juggler or an acrobat their skill certainly nothing to make thom or the chavanas worry always with another man or woman holding out a cap for coins ragged beggars wove through it all plucking at sleeves and proffering grimy hands and hawkers bustled with trays of everything from pins to ribbons to pears their cries lost in the din her head spun by the time uno drew her into a narrower street where the throng seemed thinner if only by comparison she paused to straighten her clothes disarrayed from plunging through the crowd before following him it was a trifle quieter here too no street entertainers and fewer hawkers and beggars beggars kept clear of uno even after he tossed a few coppers to a wary pack of urchins for which she did not blame them the man just did not look charitable the towns buildings loomed over these narrow ways despite being only two or three stories putting the streets themselves in shadow but there was good light in the sky hours yet till dusk still plenty of time to get back to the show if she had to with luck they could all be boarding a riverboat by sunset she gave a start when another shienaran suddenly joined them sword on his back and head shaven but for that topknot a darkhaired man only a few years older than she uno gave curt introductions and explanation without slowing peace favor you nynaeve ragan said the skin of his dark cheek dimpling around a triangular white scar even smiling his face was hard she had never met a soft shienaran soft men did not survive along the blight nor soft women either i remember you your hair was different was it not no matter never fear we will see you safely to masema and to wherever you would go after just be sure not to mention tar valon to him no one was sparing them a second glance but he lowered his voice anyway masema thinks the tower will try to control the lord dragon nynaeve shook her head another fool man who was going to take care of her at least he did not try to engage her in conversation the mood she was in she would have given him the rough side of her tongue if he so much as commented on the heat her own face felt a trifle damp and no wonder having to wear a shawl in this weather abruptly she remembered what the oneeyed man had said concerning ragans opinion of her tongue she did not think she more than glanced at him but ragan moved to the other side of uno as if for shelter and eyed her warily men the streets grew still narrower and though the stone buildings lining them did not grow smaller it was more often than not the backs of the buildings they saw and rough gray walls that could hide only small yards eventually they turned down an alley barely wide enough for all three of them abreast at the far end a lacquered and gilded coach stood surrounded by scalearmored men more immediately halfway between her and the coach fellows lounged thickly along both sides of the alley in a motley of coats most clutched clubs or spears or swords as different as their garb they could have been a pack of street toughs but neither of the shienarans slowed so she did not either the street out front will be full of bloody fools hoping to catch a glimpse of masema at a bloody window unos voice was pitched for her ears alone the only way to get in is by the back he fell silent as they came close enough for the waiting men to hear two of those were soldiers with rimmed steel helmets and scaled tunics swords at hip and spears in hand but it was the others who studied the three newcomers and fingered their weapons they had disturbing eyes too intent almost feverish for once she would have been pleased to see an honest leer these men did not care whether she was a woman or a horse without a word uno and ragan unfastened the scabbarded blades from their backs and handed them and their daggers to a plumpfaced man who might have been a shopkeeper once from the look of his blue woolen coat and breeches the clothing had been good it was clean but heavily worn and wrinkled as if it had been slept in for a month plainly he recognized the shienarans and though he frowned at her for a moment especially at her belt knife he silently nodded to a narrow wooden gate in the stone wall that was perhaps the most offputting fact of all none of them made a sound on the other side of wall was a small yard where weeds stuck up between cobblestones the tall stone house three broad palegray stories with wide windows and scrollworked eaves and gables roofed in dark red tiles must have been one of the finest in samara once the gate was closed behind them ragan spoke softly there have been attempts to kill the prophet it took nynaeve a moment to realize that he was explaining why their weapons had been taken but you are his friends she protested you all followed rand to falme together she was not about to start calling him the lord dragon thats why were bloody let in at all uno said dryly i told you we dont see everything the way the prophet does the slight pause and the quick halfglance back at the gate to see if anyone was listening spoke volumes it had been masema before and uno was clearly a man who did not temper his tongue easily just watch what you say for once ragan told her and likely you will get the help you want she nodded as agreeably as anyone could wish she knew sense when she heard it even if he had no right to offer it and he and uno exchanged doubtful glances she was going to stuff these two into a sack with thom and juilin and switch anything that stuck up fine house as it might be the kitchen was dusty and empty except for one bony grayhaired woman her drab gray dress and white apron the only clean things in sight as they walked through sucking her teeth the old woman hardly glanced up from stirring a small kettle of soup over a tiny blaze in one of the wide stone fireplaces two battered pots hung on hooks where twenty could have and a cracked pottery bowl on a bluelacquered tray stood on the broad table beyond the kitchen moderately fine hangings decorated the walls nynaeve had developed something of an eye in the last year and these scenes of feasts and hunts for deer and bear and boar were only good not excellent chairs and tables and chests lined the halls dark lacquer streaked with red inlaid with motherofpearl hangings and furniture alike were also dusty and the redandwhite tiled floor had had only a halfhearted lick with a broom cobwebs decorated the corners and cornices of the high plaster ceiling there were no other servants or anyone else in sight until they came to a weedy fellow sitting on the floor beside an open door his grimy red silk coat much too large for him and at odds with a filthy shirt and worn woolen breeches one of his cracked boots had a large hole in the sole a toe poked through another in the other one he held up a hand whispering the light shine on you and praise the name of the lord dragon he made it sound a question querulously twisting a narrow face as unwashed as his shirt but then he did the same with everything the prophet cant be disturbed now hes busy youll have to wait a bit uno nodded patiently and ragan leaned against the wall they had been through this before nynaeve did not know what she had expected of the prophet not even now that she was aware who he was but certainly not filth that soup had smelled like cabbage and potatoes hardly the fare for a man who had an entire city dancing for him and only two servants both of whom could well have come from the rudest huts outside the city the skinny guard if such he was he had no weapon perhaps he was not trusted either seemed to have no objection when she moved to where she could see through the doorway the man and woman inside could not have been more different masema had shaved even his topknot and his coat was plain brown wool heavily wrinkled but clean although his kneehigh boots were scuffed deepset eyes turned his permanently sour look to a scowl and a scar made a pale triangle on his dark cheek a near mirror image of ragans only more faded with age and a hair nearer the eye the woman in elegantly goldembroidered blue silk was short of her middle years and quite lovely despite a nose perhaps too long for beauty a simple blue net cap gathered dark hair spilling almost to her waist but she wore a broad necklace of gold and firedrops with a matching bracelet and gemmed rings decorated nearly every finger where masema seemed poised to rush at something teeth bared she bore herself with stately reserve and grace so many follow wherever you go she was saying that order flies over the wall when you arrive people are not safe in themselves or their property the lord dragon has broken all bonds of law all bonds made by mortal men and women masemas voice was heated but intense not angry the prophecies say that the lord dragon will break all chains that bind and it is so the lord dragons radiance will protect us against the shadow it is not the shadow that threatens here but cutpurses and slipfingers and headcrackers some who follow you many believe that they can take what they wish from whoever has it without payment or leave there is justice in the hereafter when we are born again concern with things of this world is useless but very well if you wish earthly justice his lip curled contemptuously let it be this henceforth a man who steals will have his right hand cut off a man who interferes with a woman or insults her honor or commits murder will be hung a woman who steals or commits murder will be flogged if any accuses and finds twelve who will agree it will be done let it be so as you say of course the woman murmured aloof elegance remained on her face but she sounded shaken nynaeve did not know how ghealdanin law ran but she did not think it could be so casual as that the woman took a deep breath there is still the matter of food it becomes difficult to feed so many every man woman and child who has come to the lord dragon must have a full belly it must be so where gold can be found food can be found and there is too much gold in the world too much concern with gold masemas head swung angrily not angry with her but in general he looked to be searching for those who concerned themselves with gold so he could unleash fury on their heads the lord dragon has been reborn the shadow hangs over the world and only the lord dragon can save us only belief in the lord dragon submission and obedience to the word of the lord dragon all else is useless even where it is not blasphemy blessed be the name of the lord dragon in the light it had the sound of a rote reply it is no longer simply a matter of gold my lord prophet finding and transporting food in sufficient i am not a lord he broke in again and now he was angry he leaned toward the woman spittle on his lips and though her face did not change her hands twitched as if they wanted to clutch her dress there is no lord but the lord dragon in whom the light dwells and i am but one humble voice of the lord dragon remember that high or low blasphemers earn the scourge forgive me the begemmed woman murmured spreading her skirts in a curtsy fit for a queens court it is as you say of course there is no lord save the lord dragon and i am but a humble follower of the lord dragon blessed be the name of the lord dragon who comes to hear the wisdom and guidance of the prophet wiping his mouth with the back of his hand masema was suddenly cold you wear too much gold do not let earthly possession seduce you gold is dross the lord dragon is all immediately she began plucking rings from her fingers and before the second was off the weedy fellow scurried to her side pulling a pouch from his coat pocket and holding it for her to drop them in the bracelet and necklace followed as well nynaeve looked at uno and raised an eyebrow every penny goes to the poor he told her in a low voice that barely reached her ear or somebody who needs it if some merchant hadnt bloody given him her house hed be in a bloody stable or one of those huts outside the city even his food comes as a gift ragan said just as quietly they used to bring him dishes fit for a king until they learned he just gave away everything but a little bread and soup or stew he hardly drinks wine now nynaeve shook her head she supposed it was one way to find money for the poor simply rob anyone who was not poor of course that would just make everyone poor in the end but it might work for a time she wondered if uno and ragan knew the whole of it people who claimed they were collecting money to help others often had a way of letting a good bit stick in their own pockets or else they liked the power that spreading it about gave them liked it far too much she had better feeling for the man who freely gave one copper from his own purse than for the fellow who wrested a gold crown from someone elses and less for fools who abandoned their farms and shops to follow this this prophet with no idea where their next meal would come from inside the room the woman curtsied to masema even more deeply than before spreading her skirts wide and bowing her head until i once again have the honor of the prophets words and counsel the name of the lord dragon be blessed in the light masema waved her away absently already half forgotten he had seen them in the hall and was looking at them with as close to pleasure as his dour face could come it was not very close the woman swept out not even appearing to see nynaeve or the two men nynaeve sniffed as the weedy fellow in the red coat waved anxiously for them to come in for someone who had just given up her jewelry on demand that woman managed a fine queenly air the skinny man scampered back to his place by the door as the other three men shook hands in the borderlands fashion gripping forearms peace favor your sword uno said echoed by ragan peace favor the lord dragon was the reply and his light illumine us all nynaeves breath caught there was no doubt to his meaning the lord dragon was the source of the light and he had the nerve to speak of blasphemy from others have you come to the light at last we walk in the light ragan said carefully as always uno kept silent his face blank weary patience made an odd play on masemas sour features there is no way to the light save through the lord dragon you will see the way and the truth in the end for you have seen the lord dragon and only those whose souls are swallowed in the shadow can see and not believe you are not such you will believe in spite of the heat and the wool shawl goose bumps crawled along nynaeves arms total conviction filled the mans voice and this close she could see a glint in his nearly black eyes that bordered on madness he swept those eyes over her and she stiffened her knees he made the most rabid whitecloak she had ever seen appear mild those fellows in the alley were only a pale imitation of their master you woman are you ready to come to the light of the lord dragon abandoning sin and flesh i walk in the light as best i can she was irritated to find herself speaking as carefully as ragan sin who did he think he was you are too concerned with the flesh masemas gaze was withering as it swept over her red dress and the shawl wrapped tightly around her and what do you mean by that unos eye widened in startlement and ragan made small shushing motions yet she could as soon have flown as stopped do you think you have a right to tell me how to dress before she quite realized what she was doing she had untied the shawl and looped it over her elbows it really was much too hot anyway no man has that right for me or any other woman if i chose to go naked it would be none of your concern masema contemplated her bosom for a moment not so much as a hint of admiration lit his deep eyes only acid contempt then raised that stare to her face unos real eye and painted made a perfect match scowling at nothing and ragan winced surely muttering to himself inside his head nynaeve swallowed hard so much for guarding her tongue for perhaps the first time in her life she truly regretted speaking her mind without thinking first if this man could order mens hands cut off order men hung with only a jackfool excuse of a trial what was he not capable of she thought she was angry enough to channel but if she did if moghedien or any black sisters were in samara but if i dont she wanted very much to wrap the shawl back around her up to her chin but not with him staring at her something in the back of her mind shouted at her not to be a complete woolhead only men let pride overcome sense but she met masemas gaze defiantly even if she did have to stop herself from swallowing again his lip curled such garments are worn to entice men and for no other reason she could not understand how his voice could be so fervent and so icy at the same time thoughts of the flesh distract the mind from the lord dragon and the light i have considered banning dresses that distract mens eyes and minds let women who would waste time in attracting men and men who would attract women be scourged until they know that only in perfect contemplation of the lord dragon and the light can joy be found he was not really looking at her any longer that dark burning stare looked through her to something distant let taverns and places that sell strong drink and all places that would take the minds of people from that perfect contemplation be closed and burned to the ground i frequented such places in my days of sin but now i heartily regret as all should regret their transgressions there is only the lord dragon and the light all else is illusion a snare set by the shadow this is nynaeve almeara uno said quickly into the first pause for breath from emonds field in the two rivers whence the lord dragon comes masemas head turned slowly to the oneeyed man and she hastily took the opportunity to redo the shawl as she had had it she was at fal dara with the lord dragon and at falme the lord dragon rescued her at falme the lord dragon cares for her as for a mother another time she would have given him a few choice words and maybe a wellboxed ear rand had not rescued her or not exactly anyway and she was only a handful of years older than he a mother indeed masema turned back to her the zealous light that had burned in his eyes before was nothing to what was there now they almost glowed nynaeve yes his voice quickened yes i remember your name and your face blessed are you among women nynaeve almeara none more so save the blessed mother of the lord dragon herself for you watched the lord dragon grow you attended the lord dragon as a child he seized her arms hard fingers biting in painfully but he seemed unaware of it you will speak to the crowds of the lord dragons boyhood of his first words of wisdom of the miracles that accompanied him the light has sent you here to serve the lord dragon she was not exactly sure what to say there had never been any miracles around rand that she had seen she had heard of things in tear but you could hardly call what a taveren caused miracles not really even what had occurred at falme had a rational explanation sort of and as for words of wisdom the first she had heard out of him had been a fervent promise never to throw a rock at anyone again offered after she had paddled his young backside for it she did not believe she had heard another word since that she could call wise in any case if rand had given sage advice from his cradle if there had been comets by night and apparitions in the sky by day she still would not have stayed with this madman i must travel downriver she said guardedly to join him the lord dragon that name curdled on her tongue so soon after her promise to herself but rand was apparently never anything as simple as he around the prophet i am just being sensible thats all it is a man is an oak a woman a willow the saying ran the oak fought the wind and was broken while the willow bent when it must and survived that did not mean she had to like bending he the lord dragon is in tear the lord dragon has summoned me there tear masema took his hands away and she surreptitiously rubbed her arms she did not have to try hiding it though he was staring at something beyond sight again yes i have heard speaking to something beyond sight too or to himself when amadicia has come to the lord dragon as ghealdan has i will lead the people to tear to bask in the radiance of the lord dragon i will send disciples to spread the word of the lord dragon throughout tarabon and arad doman to saldaea and kandor and the borderlands to andor and i will lead the people to kneel at the lord dragons feet a wise plan uh o prophet of the lord dragon a fool plan if she had ever heard one that was not to say it would not work fool plans often did for some reason when men made them rand might even enjoy having all those people kneel to him if he was half as arrogant as egwene claimed but we i cannot wait i have been summoned and when the lord dragon summons mere mortals must obey some day she was going to get a chance to box rands head for her need to do this i have to find a boat going downriver masema stared at her for so long that she began to grow nervous sweat trickled down her back and between her breasts and it was only partly the heat that stare would have made moghedien sweat finally he nodded fiery zealotry fading to leave only his usual dour scowl yes he sighed if you have been summoned you must go go with the light and in the light dress more appropriately those who have been close to the lord dragon must be virtuous above all others and meditate on the lord dragon and his light a riverboat nynaeve insisted you must know whenever a boat reaches samara or any village along the river if you could just tell me where i might find one it would make my journey much swifter she had been going to say easier but she did not think ease mattered much to masema i do not concern myself with such things he said testily but you are right when the lord dragon commands you must come on the hour i will ask if a vessel can be found someone will tell me of it eventually his eyes shifted to the other two men you must see that she is safe until then if she persists in clothing herself in this manner she will attract men with vile thoughts she must be protected like a wayward child until she is reunited with the lord dragon nynaeve bit her tongue a willow not an oak when a willow was needed she managed to mask her irritation behind a smile that had to carry all the gratitude the idiot man could wish a dangerous idiot however she had to remember that uno and ragan made their goodbyes quickly with more forearm clasping and hustled her out one on either arm as if they thought it necessary to hurry her away from masema for some reason masema appeared to have forgotten them before they reached the door he was already frowning at the weedy man waiting next to a bluff fellow in a farmers coat who was crumpling his cap in thick hands awe painted across his broad face she did not say a word as they retraced their steps through the kitchen where the grayhaired woman was sucking her teeth and stirring the soup as if she had not moved in the interval nynaeve held her tongue while they retrieved their weapons held it until they were out of the alleyway into something approaching the width of a street then she rounded on them shaking her finger under each nose alternately how dare you drag me out like that people passing by grinned men ruefully women appreciatively though none could have had an idea what she was berating them over another five minutes and i would have had him finding a boat today if you ever lay hands on me again uno snorted so loudly that she cut off with a start another five bloody minutes and masema would have bloody well laid hands on you or rather hed have said that someone should and then someone flaming well would have when he says something should be done there are always fifty flaming hands or a hundred or a flaming thousand if need be to do it he stalked off down the street ragan at his side and she had to go with them or be left uno paced on as if he knew she would trail after she almost went the other way just to prove him wrong following had nothing to do with fear of getting lost in that rabbit warren of streets she could have found her way out eventually he had a flaming lord of the crown high council flogged flogged for half the heat in his voice that you had the oneeyed man growled contempt for the word of the lord dragon he called it peace demanding what bloody right he had to comment on your flaming clothes for a few minutes you did well enough but i saw your face there at the end you were ready to flaming lace into him again the only thing worse you could have done would be to bloody name the lord dragon he calls that blasphemy as well name the flaming dark one ragans topknot bobbed as he nodded remember the lady baelome uno right after the first rumors came from tear naming the lord dragon nynaeve she said something about this rand althor in masemas hearing and he called for an axe and a chopping block without pause for breath he had someone beheaded for that she said incredulously no uno muttered in disgust but only because she bloody well groveled when she realized he flaming meant it she was dragged out and hung up by her flaming wrists from the back of her own coach then strapped the bloody length of whatever village it was we were in then her own flaming retainers stood like a bunch of sheepgutted farmers and watched it when it was done ragan added she thanked masema for his mercy the same as lord aleshin did his tone had too much pointedness to suit her he was delivering a moral and intended her to take it in they had reason nynaeve theirs would not have been the first heads he has put on a stake yours could have been the latest and ours with it if we tried to give aid masema plays no favorites she drew breath how could masema have all this power and not only among his own followers apparently but then there was no reason lords or ladies could be not as great fools as any farmer a good many were greater in her estimation that idiot woman with her rings had surely been a lady no merchant ever wore firedrops yet surely ghealdan had laws and courts and judges where was the queen or the king she could not remember which ghealdan had no one in the two rivers had ever had much truck with kings or queens yet that was what they were for them and lords and ladies seeing justice fairly done but whatever masema did here was no concern of hers she had more important problems than worrying over a flock of imbeciles who let a madman trample them still curiosity made her say does he mean that about trying to stop men and women looking at one another what does he think will happen if there are no marriages no children will he stop people farming next or weaving or making shoes so they can think about rand althor she enunciated the name deliberately these two went around calling him the lord dragon at the drop of a pin almost as much as masema did i will tell you this if he tries telling women how to dress he will start a riot against him samara must have something like a womens circle most places did even if they called it something else even when it was not a formal arrangement at all there were some things men just did not have the sense to see to and they surely could and did call women down for wearing inappropriate clothes but that was not the same as a man putting his finger into it women did not meddle in mens affairs well no more than was necessary and men should not meddle in womens and i expect the men will react no better if he tries closing taverns and the like i never knew a man yet who wouldnt cry himself to sleep if he could not put his nose in a mug now and then maybe he will ragan said and maybe he wont sometimes he orders things and sometimes he forgets or puts it off anyway because something more important comes along you would be surprised he added dryly at what his followers will accept from him without a whimper he and uno were flanking her she realized and watching the other folk in the street warily even to her the pair of them appeared ready to draw swords in a heartbeat if they actually thought to carry out masemas instructions they had another think coming he isnt against bloody marriage uno growled staring so hard at a peddler with meat pies on a tray that the man turned and ran without taking the coins from two women holding pies in their hands youre lucky he did not remember you have no husband or he might have sent you to the lord dragon with one sometimes he picks out three or four hundred unmarried men and as many women and flaming well marries them most have never seen each other before that day if the pigeongutted dirtgrubbers dont bloody complain about that do you think theyll open their flaming mouths about ale ragan muttered something under his breath but she caught enough to narrow her eyes some man doesnt know how bloody lucky he is that was what he had said he did not even notice her glare he was too busy scanning the street watching against someone who might try to abscond with her like a pig in a sack she was half tempted to take off the shawl and throw it away he did not seem to hear her sniff either men could be insufferably blind and deaf when they wished to at least he didnt try to steal my jewelry she said who was that fool woman who gave him hers she could not have much sense if she had become one of masemas followers that uno said was alliandre blessed of the light queen of bloody ghealdan and a dozen more titles the way you southlanders like to pile them up nynaeve stubbed her toe on a cobblestone and almost fell so that is how he does it she exclaimed shaking off their helping hands if the queen is fool enough to listen to him no wonder he can do whatever he wants not a fool uno said sharply flashing a frown at her before returning to watching the street a wise woman when you bloody find yourself straddling a wild horse you bloody well ride it the way its bloody going if youre smart enough to pour water out of a bloody boot you think shes a fool because masema took her rings shes flaming smart enough to know he might demand more if she stopped wearing jewelry when she comes to him the first time he went to her been the other way round since and he did take the rings right off her flaming fingers she had strands of pearls in her hair and he broke the strings pulling them out all of her ladiesinwaiting were down on their knees gathering the bloody things off the floor alliandre even picked up a few herself that doesnt sound so wise to me she said stoutly it sounds like cowardice whose knees were shaking because he looked at her a voice in her head asked who was sweating herself silly at least she had managed to face up to himi did bending like a willow isnt the same as cowering like a mouse is she the queen or isnt she the two men exchanged those irritating looks and ragan said quietly you dont understand nynaeve alliandre is the fourth to sit on the light blessed throne since we came to ghealdan and thats barely half a year johanin wore the crown when masema began attracting a few crowds but he thought masema a harmless madman and did nothing even when the crowds grew and his nobles told him he had to put an end to it johanin died in a hunting accident hunting accident uno interjected sneering a hawker who happened to be looking at him dropped his tray of pins and needles not unless he didnt know one bloody end of a flaming boar spear from the other flaming southlanders and their flaming game of houses and ellizelle succeeded ragan took up she had the army dispersing the crowds until finally there was a pitched battle and it was the army that was chased off bloody poor excuse for soldiers uno muttered she was going to have to speak to him about his language again ragan nodded agreement but went on with what he had been saying they say ellizelle took poison after that but however she died she was replaced by teresia who lasted a full ten days after her coronation just until she had a chance to send two thousand soldiers against ten thousand folk who had gathered to hear masema outside jehannah after her soldiers were routed she abdicated to marry a rich merchant nynaeve stared at him incredulously and uno snorted that is what they say the younger man maintained of course in this land marrying a commoner means giving up any claim to the throne forever and whatever beron goraed feels about having a pretty young wife with royal blood i hear he was dragged from his bed by a score of alliandres retainers and hauled to jheda palace for a wedding in the small hours of the morning teresia went off to live on her husbands new country estate while alliandre was being crowned all before sunrise and the new queen summoned masema to the palace to tell him he would not be troubled again inside two weeks she was calling on him i do not know whether she really believes what he preaches but i know she took the throne of a land on the edge of civil war with whitecloaks ready to move in and she stopped it the only way she could that is a wise queen and a man could be proud to serve her even if she is a southlander nynaeve opened her mouth and forgot what she was going to say when uno said in a casual tone theres a flaming whitecloak following us dont look around woman you have more bloody sense than that her neck stiffened with the effort of keeping her eyes forward prickles crawled up her back take the next turn uno that carries us away from the main streets and the flaming gates we can flaming lose him in the crowds take it she inhaled slowly made her voice less shrill i need a sight of him uno glowered so fiercely that people stepped out of their way for ten paces ahead but they turned down the next narrow street she shifted her head a trifle as they made the turn just enough to peek from the edge of her eye before the corner of a small stone tavern cut off her view the snowy cloak with the flaring sun stood out among the thin crowd there was no mistaking that beautiful face the face she had been sure she would see no other whitecloak than galad could have a reason to follow her and none to follow uno or ragan chapter sunburst the wheel weaves as soon as the building hid galad nynaeves eyes darted down the street ahead fury bubbled up at herself as much as galadedrid damodred you witless woolhead it was a narrow way like all the rest paved with rounded stones lined with gray shops and houses and taverns populated with a scattered afternoon crowd if you hadnt come into town hed never have found you too scattered to hide anyone you had to go see the prophet you had to go believing the prophet would whisk you away before moghedien gets here when are you going to learn you cant depend on anyone but yourself in an instant she made her choice when galad turned that corner and did not see them he would begin looking into shops and maybe taverns as well this way gathering her skirts she darted into the nearest alley and pressed her back against the wall no one glanced at her twice furtive as she was and what that had to say about the way things were in samara she did not want to consider uno and ragan were beside her before she finished setting her feet crowding her farther down the dusty dirt alleyway past an old splintered bucket and a rain barrel dried to the point of collapse inside its hoops at least they were doing what she wanted in a manner of speaking tense hands on long sword hilts rising above their shoulders they were ready to protect her whether she desired it or not let them you fool do you think you can protect yourself she was certainly angry enough galad of all people she should never have left the menagerie a fool whim and one that might ruin everything she could no more channel here than against masema just the possibility that moghedien or black sisters were in samara made her dependent on two men for her safety it was enough to screw her anger tight she could have chewed a hole in the stone wall behind her she knew why aes sedai had warders all but reds anyway in her head she did in her heart it just made her want to snarl galad appeared threading his way slowly through the folk out in the street eyes searching by all reason be should have gone on by he should have yet almost immediately his gaze settled on the alleyway on them he did not even have the grace to appear pleased or surprised uno and ragan moved together as galad turned toward the alley the oneeyed man had his sword out in the blink of an eye and ragan was scarcely slower for all he paused to push her deeper into the narrow passage they positioned themselves one behind the other should galad make it past uno he would still have ragan to face nynaeve ground her teeth she could make all these swords unnecessary useless she could sense the true source like a light unseen over her shoulder waiting for her embrace she could do it if she dared galad stopped at the alley mouth cloak thrown back one hand resting nonchalantly on his sword hilt a picture of springsteel grace except for his burnished mail he could have been at a ball i do not want to kill either of you shienaran he said calmly to uno nynaeve had heard elayne and gawyn speak of galads sword skill but for the first time she realized that he might really be as good as they said at least he thought he was two seasoned soldiers with blades bare and he eyed them as a wolfhound would eye a pair of lesser dogs not seeking a fight yet utterly confident he could take both never quite looking away from the two men he addressed her someone else might have run into a shop or an inn but you never do what is expected will you let me speak with you there is no need to make me kill these men none of the passersby were stopping but even with three men blocking her view she could see heads swiveling for a glimpse of what had drawn the whitecloak and plainly taking in the swords rumors would be hatching in all those minds and taking flight on wings that made dusk swallows seem slow let him by she commanded when uno and ragan did not budge she repeated herself even more firmly they did move aside then slowly as much as the narrow alley would allow yet though neither said a word there was an air of muttering about them galad came by smoothly seeming to forget the shienarans she suspected that believing so would be a mistake the topknotted men plainly did not aside from one of the forsaken she could not imagine a man she would less like to see right then but with that face in front of her she was all too conscious of her own breathing her own heartbeat it was ludicrous why could the man not be ugly or at least plain you knew i knew that you were following accusation rang strongly in her voice though she was not sure what she was accusing him of not doing what she had expected and wanted she imagined ruefully i assumed as much as soon as i recognized you nynaeve i remember that you generally see more than you let on she would not let him divert her with compliments look where that had gotten her with valan luca what are you doing in ghealdan i thought you were on your way to altara for a moment he stared down at her with those dark beautiful eyes then abruptly laughed in all the world nynaeve only you would ask me the question i should be asking you very well ill answer you for all it should be the other way round i did have orders for salidar in altara but all changed when this prophet fellow what is the matter are you unwell nynaeve forced her face to smoothness of course not she said irritably my health is quite good thank you very kindly salidar of course the name was like one of aludras firesticks going off in her head all of that racking of her brain and galad casually handed her what she had been unable to dig up on her own now if only masema found a ship quickly if only she could make sure galad would not betray them without letting uno and ragan kill him of course whatever elayne said nynaeve could not believe she would appreciate having her brother cut down small chance he would believe elayne was not with her i just cannot get over my shock at seeing you a small patch on mine when i learned you had slipped out of sienda sternness became that handsome face to an unfortunate degree but his tone offset it somewhat he could have been lecturing a small girl who had sneaked out of the house after her bedtime to climb trees i was sick near to death with worry what under the light possessed you have you any idea of the risks you ran and to come here of all places elayne always chooses to saddle a horse at the gallop if she can but i thought that you at least had more sense this socalled prophet he cut off eyeing the other two men uno had grounded his swordpoint scarred hands folded atop the pommel ragan appeared to be inspecting his blades edge to the exclusion of everything else i have heard rumors galad went on slowly that he is shienaran you cannot have been witless enough to get yourself mixed up with him there was too much question in that for her taste by far neither of them is the prophet galad she said wryly ive known them both for some little time and i can assure you of that uno ragan unless you intend to prune your toenails put those things up well they hesitated before doing as they were told uno grumping under his breath and glaring but they did it finally men usually responded to a firm voice most did sometimes anyway i hardly thought they were nynaeve galads tone even more arid than hers made her bristle but when he went on he sounded annoyed rather than superior and worried which made her bristle even more of course he all but gave her palpitations and he had the nerve to be worried i do not know what you and elayne have fallen into here and i do not care so long as i can extract you from it before you are hurt trade is slow on the river but a suitable boat of some sort should call in the next few days let me know where i can find you and i will secure you passage to somewhere in altara from there you can make your way to caemlyn she gaped in spite of herself you mean to find us a ship it is all i can do now he sounded apologetic and shook his head as if arguing with himself i cannot escort you to safety my duty is here we wouldnt want to take you from your duty she said a touch breathless if he wanted to misunderstand let him the most she had hoped for was that he would leave them be he seemed to feel the need to defend himself it is hardly safe to send you off alone but a boat will take you away before the entire border explodes which it will soon or late all it needs is one spark and the prophet is sure to strike it if no one else does you must see to setting yourselves to caemlyn you and elayne all i ask is your promise that you will go there the tower is no place for either of you or for he clamped his teeth shut but he might as well have gone ahead and named egwene it could not hurt having galad looking for a boat too if masema could forget whether he intended to close the taverns he could forget to have anyone find a riverboat especially if he thought a convenient bout of forgetfulness might keep her there to further his own plans it could not hurt if she could trust galad if she could not then she would have to hope he was not as good with that sword as he thought he was a stark thought but not so stark as what might happen would happen if he proved untrustworthy i am what i am galad and elayne is the same dodging around masema had put a bad taste on her tongue a little white tower sidestepping was as close as she could come and you are what you are now she raised her eyebrows significantly at his white cloak that lot hates the tower and they hate women who can channel now that you are one of them why shouldnt i think there will be fifty of you after me inside the hour trying to put an arrow in my back if they cant haul me off to a cell me and elayne as well galads head jerked in irritation or maybe he was offended how often must i tell you i would never let harm come to my sister or to you it truly was annoying realizing that she was annoyed at the pause that made it clear she was an afterthought she was not some silly girl to lose her wits because a man had eyes that somehow managed to be melting and incredibly penetrating at the same time if you say it so she told him and his head tossed again tell me where you are put up and i will bring word or send it as soon as i locate a suitable vessel if elayne was right he could no more lie than could an aes sedai who had sworn the three oaths but still she hesitated a mistake here could be her last she had a right to take risks for herself but this risk involved elayne too and thom and juilin for that matter they were her responsibility whatever they wanted to think but she was here and the decision had to be hers not that it might be any other way frankly light woman what more do you want of me galad growled halfraising his hands as though to grab her shoulders unos blade was between them in a flash of bright steel but elaynes brother actually brushed it aside like a twig and paid it no more mind than one i mean no harm to you now or ever i swear it by my mothers name you say that you are what you are i know what you are and what you are not perhaps half the reason i wear this he touched an edge of his snowy cloak is because the tower sent you out you and elayne and egwene for the light knows what reason when you are what you are it was like sending a boy who has just learned to hold a sword into battle and i will never forgive them there is still time for both of you to turn aside you do not have to carry that sword the tower is too dangerous for you or my sister especially now half the world is become too dangerous for you let me help you to safety the tightness slid from his voice though it took on a raw edge i beg you nynaeve if anything happened to elayne i halfwish that egwene were with you so i could scrubbing a hand through his hair he looked left and right searching for how to convince her uno and ragan held their blades ready to drive through his body but he did not appear to see them in the name of the light nynaeve please allow me to do what i can it was a simple thing that finally tipped the balance in her mind they were in ghealdan amadicia was the only land that actually made a crime out of a woman being able to channel and they were on the opposite bank of the river that left only galads oaths as a child of the light to battle against his duty to elayne she gave blood the edge in that struggle besides he really was too gorgeous for her to let uno and ragan kill him not that that had anything to do with her decision of course we are with valan lucas show she said at last he blinked at her frowned valan lucas you mean one of the menageries incredulity and disgust fought in his voice what under the light are you doing in company like that those who keep such shows are no better than no matter if you need coin i can supply some enough to see you in a decent inn his tone bespoke his certainty that she would do as he wanted not a can i help you with a few crowns or a would you like me to find a room for you he thought they should be in an inn so into an inn they would go the man might have observed enough to know she would duck into an alley but he did not know her at all it seemed besides there were reasons to stay with luca do you think there is a room or a hayloft not taken in all of samara she asked a touch more tartly than intended i am certain i can find she cut him off the last place anyone would look for us is among the shows the last place anyone but moghedien would look at least youll agree we should keep from sight as much as possible if you did find a room more than likely youd have to have someone put out of it a child of the light securing a room so for two women that would set tongues wagging and draw eyes like flies to a midden he did not like it grimacing and glaring at uno and ragan as if it were their fault but he had enough sense to see sense it is no fit place for either of you but it is probably safer than anywhere inside the city at that since you have at least agreed to go to caemlyn i will say no more on it she kept her face smooth and let him think as he wished if he thought she had promised what she had not that was his affair she had to keep him away from the show as much as possible though one glimpse of his sister in those spangled white breeches and the uproar would overshadow any riot masema could raise you will have to stay clear of the menagerie mind until you find a ship anyway then come to the performers wagons at nightfall and ask for nana he liked that even less if possible but she forestalled him firmly ive not seen a single child of the light near any of the shows if you visit one dont you think people will notice and ask why his smile was still gorgeous but it showed too many teeth you have an answer for everything it seems do you have any objection to my escorting you back there at least i most certainly do there will be rumors as it is a hundred people must have noticed us talking here she could no longer see the street past the three men yet she had no doubt passersby were still glancing into the alley and uno and ragan had not resheathed their swords but if you accompany me well be seen by ten times as many his wince was half rueful half mirthful an answer for everything he muttered but you have the right of it clearly he wished she did not hear me shienarans he said turning his head and suddenly his voice was steel i am galadedrid damodred and this woman is under my protection as for her companion i would count it small loss to die in order to save her the smallest harm if you allow either to come to that smallest harm i will find you both and kill you ignoring the sudden dangerous blankness of their faces as completely as he did their swords he swung his eyes back to her i suppose you still will not tell me where egwene is all you need know is that she is far from here folding her arms beneath her breasts she could feel her heart beating through her ribs was she making a dangerous mistake because of a pretty face and safer than any action of yours can make her he looked as if he did not believe her but he made no more of it with luck i will find a vessel in a day or two until then stay close to this valan lucas show stay low and avoid notice as much as you can with your hair that color and tell elayne not to run away from me again the light shone on you to let me find you still in one piece and it will have to shine twice as brightly to keep you from harm if you try haring off across ghealdan this prophets blasphemous ruffians are everywhere without respect for law or persons and that does not count brigands taking advantage of disorder samara itself is a wasp nest but if you will sit quietly and convince my headstrong sister to do the same i will find a way to get you out of it before you are stung it was an effort to keep her mouth shut taking what she told him and making it an injunction to her next thing the man would want to pack her and elayne in wool and sit them on a shelf wouldnt it be best if someone did a tiny voice asked havent you caused enough trouble going your own way she told the voice to be quiet it did not listen but began listing disasters and near disasters sprung from her own stubbornness apparently taking her silence for acquiescence he turned away from her and stopped ragan and uno had moved to block his way to the street glancing at her with that strange deceptive calm men so often adopted when they were a hairsbreadth from sudden violence the air seemed to crackle until she motioned hurriedly the shienarans lowered their blades and stood aside and galad took his hands from his sword brushed past them and melded into the crowd without a backward glance nynaeve gave uno and ragan each a good glare before stalking off in the opposite direction there she had had everything arranged properly and they had to nearly ruin it all men always seemed to think violence could solve anything if she had had a stout stick she would have thumped all three of them about the shoulders until they saw reason the shienarans seemed to see a little of it now they caught up to her swords scabbarded on their backs once more and followed without a word even when she twice took a wrong turn and had to double back it was especially well for them that they kept silent then she had had enough of holding her tongue first masema and then galad all she wanted was a waferthin excuse to tell someone exactly what she thought especially that little voice in her head pushed back to an insect buzz now but refusing to be quiet by the time they were out of samara and on that dirt cart track with its sparse traffic the voice refused to be denied she worried over rands arrogance but hers had brought herself and others as near calamity as made no never mind for birgitte perhaps it was well over the line even if she was alive the best thing was for nynaeve not to confront them again not the black ajah and not moghedien not until someone who knew what they were doing could decide what should be done protest welled up but she stamped on it as firmly as she ever had on thom or juilin she would go to salidar and hand the matter over to the blues that was how it would be she was set on it have you eaten something that disagrees with you ragan said your mouth is twisted as if you had chewed a ripe duckberry she gave him a look that snapped his teeth shut and stalked on the two shienarans kept pace to either side what was she going to do with them that she should put them to some use was never in doubt their appearance was too providential to throw away for one thing two additional pairs of eyes well three eyes anyway she was going to learn to look at that patch without swallowing if it killed her more eyes hunting for a ship might mean finding one sooner all very well if masema or galad found a vessel first but she did not want either to know more of her doings than she had to allow there was no telling what either might doare you following me because masema told you to look after me she demanded or because galad did what flaming difference does it make uno muttered if the lord dragon has summoned you you bloody well he cut off frowning as she raised one finger ragan eyed it as if it were a weapon do you mean to help elayne and me reach rand weve nothing better to do ragan said dryly as it is well not see shienar again till we are gray and toothless we might as well ride with you to tear or wherever he is she had not considered that but it made sense two more to help thom and juilin with chores and standing guard no need to let them know how long that might take or how many stops and detours could lie along the way the blues in salidar might not let any of them go further once they reached aes sedai they would be only accepted again stop thinking about it you are going to do it the crowd waiting in front of lucas garish sign appeared no smaller than it had before a stream of people trickled into the meadow to join the throng as another stream meandered out exclaiming over what they had seen now and again the boarhorses were visible rearing above the canvas wall to oohs and aahs from those waiting to get in cerandin was putting them through their paces again the seanchan woman always saw that the sredit got plenty of rest she was very firm about that whatever luca wanted men did do as they were told when you left no doubt that anything else was inconceivable usually they did short of the welltrampled brown grass nynaeve stopped and turned to face the two shienarans she kept her face calm but they looked suitably wary though in unos case regrettably that involved fiddling with his eyepatch in a queasymaking way the folk heading to or from the show paid no heed to them then it will not be because of masema or galad she said firmly if you are going to travel with me you will do as i say else you can go your own way for ill have none of you of course they had to exchange glances before nodding acceptance if thats how it flaming has to be uno growled then well enough if you dont have somebody to bloody well look after you youll never flaming live to reach the lord dragon some sheepgutted farmer will have you for breakfast because of your tongue ragan gave him a guarded look that said be agreed with every word but strongly doubted unos wisdom in voicing them ragan it seemed had the makings of a wise man in him if they accepted her terms it did not really matter why for now there would be plenty of time later to set them straight i dont doubt the others will agree too ragan said others she said blinking you mean there are more than the two of you how many there are only fifteen of us altogether now i dont think bartu or nengar will come sniffing after the bloody prophet uno turned his head and spat copiously only fifteen sar went over that bloody cliff in the mountains and mendao had to get himself into a flaming duel with three hunters for the horn and nynaeve was too busy stopping herself from gaping to listen fifteen she could not help toting up in her head what it would cost to feed fifteen men even when they were not particularly hungry thom or juilin either one ate more than elayne and her combined light on the other hand with fifteen shienaran soldiers there was no need to wait for a ship a riverboat was certainly the fastest way to travel she remembered what she had heard of salidar now a river town or close by a boat could take them right to it yet a shienaran escort would make their wagon just as safe from whitecloaks or bandits or followers of the prophet but much slower and a lone wagon heading away from samara with such an escort would certainly stand out a signpost for moghedien or the black ajah i will let the blues deal with them and that is that what is wrong ragan asked and uno added apologetically i shouldnt have mentioned how sakaru died sakaru that must have been after she stopped listening i dont spend much time around fla around ladies i forget you have weak bell i mean uh delicate stomachs if he did not stop tugging at that eyepatch he was going to find out how delicate her stomach was the number changed nothing if two shienarans were good fifteen were wonderful her own private army no need to worry about whitecloaks or brigands or riots or whether she had made a mistake about galad how many hams could fifteen men eat every day a firm voice right then every night just after dark one of you one mind will come here and ask for nana thats the name i am known by she had no reason for the order except to put them in the habit of doing what she told them elayne goes by morelin but you ask for nana if you need coin come to me not masema she had to suppress a wince as the words left her mouth there was still gold in the wagons stove but luca had not demanded his hundred gold crowns yet and he would there was always the jewelry if need be though she had to be sure they were weaned away from masema aside from that none of you are to come near me or the show without that they would likely set a guard or some such idiocy not unless a riverboat arrives in that case you come running on the instant do you understand me no uno muttered why do we flaming have to keep away his head jerked back as her admonitory finger almost touched his nose do you remember what i said about your language she had to make herself give him a level look that glaring red eyepatch made her stomach do flips unless you do remember you will learn why men in the two rivers have decent tongues in their mouths she watched him turn that over in his mind he did not know what her connection with the white tower was only that it existed she might be an agent of the tower or towertrained or even aes sedai though one not long to the shawl and the threat was vague enough for him to put his own worst interpretation to it she had known that technique long before hearing juilin mention it to elayne when it appeared the idea had taken hold and before he could ask any questions she lowered her hand you will stay away for the same reason galad does so as not to draw attention for the rest you will do it because i say so if i must explain my every decision to you ill have time for nothing else so you must make the best of it that was a suitably aes sedai comment besides they had no choice if they intended to help her reach rand as they thought which meant they had no choice all in all she was feeling quite satisfied with herself as she shooed them off back toward samara and strode past the waiting crowd and under the sign bearing valan lucas name to her surprise there was an addition to the show on a new platform not far from the entry a woman in gauzy yellow trousers was standing on her head arms outstretched to either side with a pair of white doves on each hand no not on her head the woman was gripping some sort of wooden frame in her teeth and balancing on that as nynaeve watched aghast the peculiar acrobat lowered her hands to the platform for a moment while bending herself double until she seemed to be sitting on her own head even that was not enough her legs curved down in front of her then impossibly back up under her arms whereupon she transferred the doves to the upturned soles of her feet now the highest part of the contorted ball she had knotted herself into the onlookers gasped and applauded but the sight made nynaeve shiver it was all too good a reminder of what moghedien had done to her that isnt why i mean to hand her over to the blues she told herself i just do not want to cause calamity again that was true but she was also afraid that the next time she would not escape so easily or so lightly she would not have admitted that to another soul she did not like admitting it to herself giving the contortionist one last puzzled glance she could not begin to puzzle out what the woman had twisted herself into now she turned away and started as elayne and birgitte suddenly appeared at her side out of the milling crowd elayne had a cloak decently covering her white coat and breeches birgitte was all but flaunting her lownecked red gown no there was no all but to it she stood even straighter than usual and had tossed back her braid to remove even its minimal covering nynaeve fingered the knot of her shawl at her waist wishing every glance at birgitte did not remind her how much she herself would be showing once the gray wool came off the other womans quiver hung at her belt and she carried the bow luca had found for her surely the day was too late for her to go through with the shooting a glance at the sky told nynaeve she was wrong despite everything that had happened the sun still stood well above the horizon shadows stretched long but not long enough to dissuade birgitte she suspected in an attempt to cover checking the sun she nodded toward the woman in the gauzy trousers who had now begun to twist herself into something that nynaeve knew was impossible while still balancing on her teeth where did she come from luca hired her birgitte answered calmly he bought some leopards as well her name is muelin if birgitte was all selfpossessed coolness elayne very nearly quivered with emotion where did she come from she spluttered she came from a show that a mob nearly destroyed i heard about that nynaeve said but that isnt what is important i not important elayne rolled her eyes to the heavens as if for guidance did you also hear why i dont know whether it was whitecloaks or this prophet but somebody whipped up that mob because they thought she glanced around without slowing and lowered her voice none of the crowd had stopped but every passerby stared at two obvious performers standing that a woman in the show might wear a shawl she emphasized the last word significantly fools to think shed be with a traveling menagerie but then you and i are and you go dashing into the city without a word to anyone weve heard everything from a baldheaded man carrying you off over his shoulder to you kissing a shienaran and traipsing away with him arm in arm nynaeve was still gaping when birgitte added luca was upset whatever the tale he said she cleared her throat and made her voice deep so she likes rough men does she well i can be as rough as a winter cob and off he set leading two lads with shoulders like sgandin quarrymen to fetch you back thom merrilin and juilin sandar went as well in not much better temper that did not improve lucas but they were all so upset over you it left no room for anger at each other for a moment nynaeve stared in confusion she liked rough men what could he possibly mean by slowly it sank in and she groaned oh that is just what i need and thom and juilin running around samara the light knew what trouble they could get into i still want to know what you thought you were doing elayne said but we are wasting time here nynaeve let them start her off through the crowd one to either side but even with the news of luca and the others she felt satisfied with her days work we should be out of here in a day or two with luck if galad doesnt find us a boat masema will it turns out he is the prophet you remember masema elayne that sourfaced shienaran we saw realizing that elayne had stopped nynaeve paused for her to catch up again galad the younger woman said disbelievingly forgetting to hold her cloak closed you saw you spoke to galad and the prophet you must have or how would they be trying to find a vessel did you have tea with them or did you just meet them in a common room where the baldheaded man carried you no doubt maybe the king of ghealdan was there too would you please convince me i am dreaming so i can wake up get a grip on yourself nynaeve said firmly it is a queen now not a king and yes she was and he wasnt bald he had a topknot the shienaran i mean not the prophet hes as bald as she glared at birgitte until the woman stopped snickering the glower slipped a little when nynaeve remembered who she was glowering at and what she had done to her but if the woman had not smoothed her features they might have found out whether she could bring herself to slap birgitte crosseyed they began walking again and she said as levelly as she could manage this is what happened i saw uno one of the shienarans who was at falme watching you highwalk elayne he doesnt think any better of the daughterheir of andor showing her legs than i do by the way in any case moiraine sent them here after falme but she related everything quickly as they made their way through the crowd riding roughshod over elaynes increasingly incredulous exclamations answering their questions in as few words as possible despite a quick interest in the shifts of the ghealdanin throne elayne concentrated on exactly what galad had said and why nynaeve had been fool enough to approach the prophet whoever he was that word fool popped up often enough to make nynaeve keep a tight leash on her temper she might doubt whether she could slap birgitte but elayne had no such protection daughterheir or not a few more repetitions and the girl woud discover it birgitte was more interested in masemas intentions on the one hand and the shienarans on the other it seemed she had encountered borderlanders in previous lives though their nations had had different names and thought well of them by and large she said little really but she appeared to approve of holding on to the shienarans nynaeve expected the news about salidar to startle them or excite them or anything but what it did birgitte took it as matteroffactly as if she had said they would eat supper with thom and juilin that night plainly she meant to go where elayne did and all else mattered little elayne looked doubtful doubtful are you certain you have tried so hard to remember and well it seems awfully fortuitous that galad should just happen to mention it to you nynaeve glowered of course i am certain coincidences do happen the wheel weaves as the wheel wills as you may have heard i remember now that he mentioned it in sienda too but i was so concerned over you being concerned about him that i didnt she cut off short they had arrived at a long narrow area near the north wall marked off by ropes at one end stood something like a segment of wooden fence two paces wide and two tall people lined the ropes four deep with children crouching down in front or holding a fathers leg or a mothers skirts a buzz rose as the three women appeared nynaeve would have stopped dead but birgitte had her by the arm and it was walk or be dragged i thought we were going to the wagon she said faintly busy with talking she had paid too little attention to where they were going not unless you want to see me shoot in the dark birgitte replied she sounded all too willing to give it a try nynaeve wished she could have made some other comment than a squeak the bit of fence filled her vision as they progressed down the open space to the exclusion of the onlookers even their increasing murmurs sounded distant the fence looked a mile from where birgitte would stand are you sure that he said he swore by our mother elayne demanded sourly acknowledging galad as her brother even that far was unpleasant for her what yes i said so didnt i listen if luca is in the city he would not know whether we did this or not until it was too late to nynaeve knew she was babbling but she could not seem to stop her tongue somehow she had never realized how far a hundred paces really was in the two rivers grown men always shot targets at twice that but then none of those targets had ever been her i mean it already is very late the shadows the glare we really should do this in the morning when the light is if he swore by her elayne broke in as if she had not been listening then he will hold to it no matter what he would sooner break an oath on his hope of salvation and rebirth than that i think no i know we can trust him she did not sound as if she particularly liked it though the light is just fine birgitte said a hint of amusement in her calm voice i might try it blindfolded this lot will want it to look difficult i think nynaeve opened her mouth but nothing came out this time she would have settled for a squeak birgitte was only making a bad joke she had to be joking they positioned her with her back against the rough wooden fence and elayne began tugging at the knot in the shawl as birgitte turned back the way they had come drawing an arrow from her quiver you really did something foolish this time elayne muttered we can trust galads oath im sure but you could not know what he might do beforehand and to approach the prophet she jerked the shawl from nynaeves shoulders roughly you could have had no idea whatsoever what he might do you worried everybody and risked everything i know nynaeve managed to get out the sun was in her eyes she could no longer see birgitte at all but birgitte could see her of course she could that was the important thing elayne looked at her suspiciously you know i know i risked everything i should have talked with you asked you i know ive been a fool i should not be allowed outside without a keeper it all came in a breathless rush birgitte must be able to see her suspicion became concern are you all right if you really do not want to do this the woman thought she was afraid nynaeve could not would not allow that she forced a smile hoped her eyes were not too wide her face felt tight of course i want to im looking forward to it actually elayne gave her a dubious frown but nodded at last you are sure about salidar she did not wait for an answer but hurried off to one side folding the shawl for some reason nynaeve could not work up a proper indignation over the question or elayne not waiting her breath was coming so fast that she was dimly aware that she might come right out of the dresss low neck yet even that thought could not catch her the sun filled her view had she squinted she might have been able to make out birgitte after a fashion but her eyes had a will of their own increasingly widening there was nothing she could do now it was a punishment for taking foolish risks she could manage only the tiniest pique over being punished after working everything out so well and elayne did not even believe her about salidar she would have to take it stoically she would seemingly out of nowhere an arrow tchunked into the wood vibrating against her right wrist and stoic resolve broke with a low wail it was all she could do to keep her knees straight a second arrow brushed the other wrist producing a slightly higher pitch to her yelp she could as soon stop birgittes shafts as silence herself arrow by arrow the yelps rose higher and it seemed to her almost as if the crowd was cheering her cries the louder she shrieked the louder they cheered and applauded by the time she was outlined from knees to head the applause was thunderous in truth she felt some irritation at the finish when the crowd all rushed to throng around birgitte leaving her standing there staring at the fletchings around her some still quivered she still quivered pushing away she scurried off toward the wagons as quickly as she could before anyone noticed how much her legs were wobbling not that anyone was paying any attention to her all she had done was stand there and pray birgitte did not sneeze or get an itch and tomorrow she would have to go through it again that or let elayne and worse birgitte know she could not face it when uno came that night asking after nana she told him in no uncertain terms to prod masema as much as he dared and to find galad and tell him he must find a boat quickly whatever it required then she took to her bed without eating and tried to make herself believe that she could convince elayne and birgitte that she was too ill to stand against that wall only she was all too certain they would know exactly what her illness was that even birgitte would likely be all sympathy just made it worse one of those fool men had to find a riverboat chapter rising sun the craft of kin tovere one hand on his sword hilt the other holding the greenandwhite tasseled length of seanchan spear rand ignored the others on the sparsely treed hilltop for the moment while he studied the three camps spread out below in the midmorning sun three distinct camps and that was the rub they were all the cairhienin and tairen forces at his disposal every man else who could use sword or spear was penned in the city or the light alone knew where the aiel had rounded up refugees in hordes between the jangai pass and here and a few had even straggled in on their own lured by rumors that these aiel at least were not killing everyone in sight or else too dispirited to care so long as they had a meal before dying too many thought they would die at the hands of the aiel or the dragon reborn or in the last battle which they seemed to think was shaping up for any day now a goodly number all together but farmers and craftsmen and shopkeepers for the most part some knew how to use bow or sling to fetch a rabbit but there was not a soldier in the lot and no time to teach them the city of cairhien itself lay little more than five miles to the west some of the fabled topless towers of cairhien visible above the intervening forest the city sprawled across hills hard by the river alguenya encircled by couladins shaido and those who had joined him one haphazard set of tents and cookfires in the long shallow valley below rand held some eight hundred tairens armored men nearly half were defenders of the stone in burnished breastplates and rimmed helmets their plump coatsleeves striped black and gold the rest were levies from a double handful of lords whose banners and pennants made a circle in the camps center around the silver crescentandstars of the high lord weiramon guards stood thickly along their picket lines as if they expected a raid against the horses any minute three hundred paces away the second camp guarded their horses as tightly the animals were a mixed lot few approaching the fine archnecked stock of tear and some former plow and cart horses were tied along those ropes or rand missed his guess the cairhienin numbered perhaps a hundred more than the tairens but their tents were fewer and most often patched and their banners and con represented some seventyodd lords few cairhienin nobles still had many retainers and the army had broken apart early in the civil war the last gathering lay another five hundred paces along full of cairhienin for the most part yet well and truly separated from the others by more than distance larger than the other pair combined this camp held few tents or horses it displayed no banners and only the officers wore con the small pennants on their backs in solid colors meant to pick them out for their men rather than signify a house infantry might be necessary but rare was the lord of tear or cairhien either one who would admit it certainty none would agree to actually lead such it was the most orderly of the camps though the cookfires in neat rows the long pikes stacked upright where they could be seized in a moment and clusters of archers or crossbowmen dotted along the lines according to lan discipline kept men alive in battle but infantry were more likely to know it and believe than cavalry the three groups were supposedly together under the same command the high lord weiramon had brought them in from the south late the day before but the two camps of horsemen watched each other nearly as warily as they did the aiel on the surrounding hills the tairens with a dose of contempt that the cairhienin echoed in ignoring the third which in turn eyed the others sullenly rands followers his allies and as ready to fight each other as anyone else still pretending to study the camps rand examined weiramon helmetless and ironspined straight nearby two younger men minor tairen lords hung at the high lords heels dark beards trimmed and oiled in perfect imitation of weiramons except that his was streaked with gray and their breastplates worn over brightly striped coats bore goldwork only a touch less ornate than his aloof apart from everyone else on the hilltop yet close to rand they could have been waiting for some martial ceremony at a royal court except for the sweat rolling down their faces they ignored that as well though the high lords sigil lacked only a few stars to duplicate lanfears but the longnosed fellow was not her in disguise with his mainly gray hair oiled like his beard and combed in a vain attempt to hide its thinness he had been coming north with reinforcements from tear when he heard that aiel were attacking the city of cairhien itself instead of turning back or sitting still he continued north as hard as his horses could stand gathering what forces he found along the way that was the good news of weiramon the bad was that he had fully expected to dispel the shaido around cairhien with what he had brought he still did and he was none too happy that rand would not let him be about it or that he was surrounded by aiel one aiel was no different from another to weiramon to the others too for that matter one of the young lords pointedly sniffed a scented silk handkerchief whenever he looked at an aiel rand wondered how long the fellow would survive and what rand would have to do about it when he died weiramon noticed rand watching and cleared his throat my lord dragon he began in a gravelly bark one good charge will scatter them like quail he slapped his gauntlets against his palm loudly foot never stands up to horse i will send in the cairhienin to flush them then follow with my rand cut him off could the man count at all did the number of aiel he could see here give him no clue to how many might be around the city it did not matter rand had heard as much of this as he could stomach you are certain of the news you bring from tear weiramon blinked news my lord dragon what oh that burn my soul theres nothing to that illianer pirates often try to raid along the coast they were more than trying by what the man had said when he arrived and the attacks on the plains of maredo do they often do that as well why burn my soul those are just brigands it was more statement of fact than protest perhaps not illianers at all but certainly not soldiers the jumble those illianers make of things who can say whether king or assemblage or council of nine has the whiphand on any given day yet if they do decide to move it will be armies striking at tear under the golden bees not raiders burning merchants wagons and border farms you can mark me on that if you wish it rand replied as politely as he could whatever power the assemblage or the council of nine or mattin stepaneos den balgar had it was what sammael chose to leave them but relatively few knew that the forsaken were loose already some who should know refused to believe or ignored it as if that would make the forsaken go away or seemed to think that if it had to happen it would be in some vague and preferably distant future there was no point in trying to convince weiramon whichever group he belonged in the mans belief or disbelief changed nothing the high lord scowled at the hollow between the hills more specifically at the two cairhienin camps with no proper rule here as yet who can say what riffraff have drifted south grimacing he slapped his gauntlets even harder before turning back to rand well we will bring them to heel soon enough for you my lord dragon if you will only give the order i can drive rand brushed past him not listening though weiramon followed still asking authority to attack the other two trailing him like heelhounds the man was a stoneblind fool they were not alone of course the hilltop was crowded really sulin had a hundred far dareis mai arrayed around the peak for one thing every last one looking even more ready to don her veil than aiel usually did it was not only the nearness of the shaido that had sulin on edge in mockery of rands contempt for the suspicions in the camps below enaila and two maidens were never far from weiramon and his lordlings and the closer they stood to rand the more the three maidens looked about to don veils not far off aviendha stood talking with a dozen or more wise ones shawls looped over their elbows all but she decked in bracelets and necklaces surprisingly it was a bony whitehaired woman even older than bair who seemed to be taking the lead rand would have expected amys or bair but even they shut up as soon as sorilea spoke melaine was with bael halfway between the other wise ones and the other clan chiefs she kept adjusting the coat of baels cadinsor as if he did not know how to dress himself and he had the patient look of a man reminding himself of all the reasons he had married it might be personal but rand suspected the wise ones were trying to influence the chiefs again if that was the case he would learn the particulars soon enough it was aviendha who held rands eye though she smiled at him briefly before returning to listening to sorilea a friendly smile but no more that was something he supposed she had not lashed out at him once since what had happened between them and if she sometimes made an acid comment it was no sharper than what he might have expected from egwene except the one time he had brought up marriage again then she had scorched his ears so thoroughly that he had left it alone thereafter but friendly was as far as it went though she was sometimes careless now about undressing in front of him at night she still insisted on sleeping no more than three paces from him the maidens at any rate seemed sure that there was a lot less than three paces between their blankets and he kept expecting that certainty to spread but so far it had not egwene would come down on him like a falling tree if she even suspected something like that it was easy enough for her to talk of elayne but he could not even puzzle out aviendha and she was right there in front of him all in all he was tenser than ever when he as much as looked at aviendha but she seemed more relaxed than he had ever seen her somehow or other that seemed the opposite of how it should be it all seemed topsyturvy with her but then min was the only woman who had not made him feel as if he were standing on his head half the time sighing he walked on still not listening to weiramon one day he was going to understand women when he had the time to apply to it he suspected a lifetime would not be enough though the clan chiefs had their own gathering of sept chiefs and representatives from the societies rand recognized some of them dark heirn chief of the jindo taardad and mangin who gave him a companionable nod and the tairens a contemptuous grimace spearslender juranai leader of aethan dor the red shields on this expedition despite a few streaks of white in his pale brown hair and roidan thickshouldered and gray who led shamad conde the thunder walkers those four had sometimes joined him in practicing the aiel way of fighting without weapons since leaving the jangai pass do you want to go hunting today mangin asked as rand passed and rand looked at him in surprise hunting there is not much to give sport but we could try catching sheep in a sack the wry glance mangin darted at the tairens left little doubt what sheep he meant though weiramon and the others did not see or affected not to the lordling with the perfumed handkerchief sniffed it again another time maybe rand replied shaking his head he thought he could have been friends with any of the four but especially mangin who had a sense of humor much like mats if he had no time to study women he certainly had no time for making new friends little time for old friends for that matter mat worried him on the highest part of the hill a heavy framework tower of logs thrust above the treetops the wide platform at the top twenty spans or more above the ground the aiel knew nothing about working with wood on that scale but there had been plenty among the cairhienin refugees who did moiraine was waiting at the base of the first slanting ladder with lan and egwene egwene had been getting a good bit of sun she really could have passed for aiel except for her dark eyes a short aiel he scanned her face quickly but detected nothing except tiredness amys and the others must be working her too hard with her training she would not thank him for interceding though have you decided rand asked stopping weiramon fell silent at last egwene hesitated but rand noted that she did not look at moiraine before nodding i will do what i can her reluctance bothered him he had not asked moiraine she could not use the one power as a weapon against the shaido not unless they threatened her or he managed to convince her they were all darkfriends but egwene had not taken the three oaths and he had been sure she would see the necessity instead she had gone whitefaced when he suggested it and had avoided for him for three days until now at least she had agreed whatever made the fight shorter against the shaido must be for the good moiraines face never changed though he had no doubt what she thought those smooth aes sedai features those aes sedai eyes could register icy disapproval without altering a jot thrusting the piece of spear through his belt he put foot to the first rung and moiraine spoke why are you wearing a sword again the last question he would have expected why shouldnt i he muttered and scrambled upward not a good answer but she had caught him off balance the halfhealed wound in his side tugged as he climbed not quite hurting but seeming about to break open just the same he paid it no mind it often felt that way when he exerted himself rhuarc and the other clan chiefs came after him bael leaving melaine last of all but thankfully weiramon and his two toadies remained on the ground the high lord knew what was to be done he needed and wanted no more information feeling moiraines eyes following him rand glanced down not moiraine it was egwene watching him climb her face so close to aes sedai that he could not have slid a hair through the difference moiraine had her head together with lans he hoped egwene was not going to change her mind on the broad platform at the top two short sweating young men in shirtsleeves were setting a brassbound wooden tube three paces long and bigger around than eithers arm on a pivoting frame fastened to the railing an identical tube already sat a few paces away where it had been almost since the tower was completed the day before a third coatless man wiped his bald head with a striped kerchief while he growled at them easy with it easy i said you motherless weasels knock a lens out of alignment and i will knock your brainless heads backward to front fasten it tight jol tight if it falls while the lord dragon is looking through it you both had better jump after it not just for him you break my work and you will wish you had broken your fool skulls jol and the other fellow cail worked on quickly but not very visibly perturbed they had had years to grow used to kin toveres way of talking it had been finding a craftsman who made lenses and looking glasses and his two apprentices among the refugees that had first given rand the idea for this tower at first none of the three noticed they were not alone the clan chiefs climbed on silent feet and toveres harangue was enough to cover the sound of rands boots rand himself was startled when lans head popped through the open trap after bael boots or no the warder made no more noise than the aiel even lan stood a head taller than the cairhienin when they finally did see the new arrivals the two apprentices gave wideeyed starts as if they had never seen an aiel before then bent themselves in half bowing to rand and stayed that way the lensmaker jerked almost as much at the sight of the aiel but made a more restrained bow wiping his head again in the middle of it told you i would have the second finished today my lord dragon tovere managed to get respect into his tone without making his voice one bit less gruff a wonderful thought this tower i would never have conceived it but once you started asking how far you could see with a looking glass give me time and i will make you one to see caemlyn from here if the tower is built high enough he added judiciously there are limits what youve done already is more than enough master tovere more than rand had hoped for certainly he had already had a look through the first looking glass jol and cail were still bent at right angles heads down perhaps you had best take your apprentices below rand said so we dont get crowded there was room for four times as many but tovere immediately poked cails shoulder with a thick finger come along you hamfisted stableboys we are in the lord dragons way the apprentices barely straightened enough to follow him gazing roundeyed at rand even more than at the aiel as they vanished down the ladder cail was a year older than he jol two both had been born in bigger towns than he had imagined before leaving the two rivers had visited cairhien and seen the king and the amyrlin seat if at a distance while he was still tending sheep very likely they still knew more of the world than he in some ways shaking his head he bent to the new looking glass cairhien leaped into view the forests never particularly thick to one used to two rivers woods stopped completely well short of the city of course high gray squaretowered walls in a perfect square against the river mocked the hills flowing curves within more towers rose in precise pattern marking the points of a grid some twenty times as high as the walls or more yet all surrounded by scaffolding the legendary topless towers were still being rebuilt after their burning in the aiel war when last he had seen the city another city had surrounded it from riverbank to riverbank foregate a rabbit warren as raucous as cairhien was solemn all in wood now only a wide stretch of ash and charred timbers bordered the walls how that fire had been kept from spreading into cairhien itself he could not understand banners decked every tower in the city too distant to make out clearly but scouts had described them to him half bore the crescents of tear the other half perhaps not surprisingly duplicated the dragon banner he had left flying over the stone of tear not one bore the rising sun of cairhien moving the looking glass only a little swept the city from his sight on the far side of the river still stood the blackened stone shells of the granaries some of the cairhienin rand had talked to claimed the torching of the granaries had led to riots and then king galldrians death and thus to the civil war others said galldrians assassination had caused the riots and the burning rand doubted that he would ever know which was the truth or whether either was a number of burnedout hulks dotted both banks of the wide river but none lay close to the city aiel had an uneasiness fear might be too strong a word about bodies of water they could not step across or wade but couladin had managed to put barriers of floating logs across the alguenya both above and below cairhien along with enough men to see they were not cut firearrows had done the rest nothing except rats and birds could get into or out of cairhien without couladins leave the hills around the city showed little sign of a besieging army here and there vultures flapped heavily no doubt feasting on the remains of some attempt to break out but no shaido were visible aiel seldom were unless they wanted to be wait rand swung the looking glass back to a treeless hilltop perhaps a mile from the city walls back to a cluster of men he could not discern faces or much else aside from the fact that they all wore the cadinsor one thing more one of those men had bare arms couladin rand was sure it must be imagination but he thought that when couladin moved he could see sunlight glittering off the metallic scales encircling the mans forearms in imitation of his own asmodean had put those there just an attempt to divert rands attention to occupy him while asmodean worked his own plans but without that how much would have turned out differently certainly he would not be standing on this tower watching a besieged city and awaiting a battle suddenly something streaked through the air on that distant hilltop a long blur and two of the men there went down thrashing staring at the fallen men both apparently transfixed with the same spear couladin and the others seemed as stunned as rand twisting the looking glass rand scanned for the man who had thrown with such force he had to be brave and a fool to get close enough rands search widened quickly beyond any possible range of a human arm he was beginning to think of ogier not likely it took a great deal to rouse an ogier into violence when another streaking blur caught his eye startled he halfstraightened before jerking the glass back to cairhiens walls that spear or whatever it was had come from there he was certain of it how was another matter entirely at this distance it was all he could do to make out an occasional someone moving on the wails or atop a tower raising his head rand found rhuarc just stepping away from the other looking glass giving up his place to han that was the whole reason for the tower and the glasses scouts brought back what word they could of how the shaido were deployed but this way the chiefs could see for themselves the terrain on which the battle would be fought they had worked out a plan between them already but one more look at the land could never go amiss rand did not know much about battles but lan thought their plan a good one at least rand did not know much in his own mind sometimes those other memories crept in and then he seemed to know more than he wanted did you see that those spears rhuarc looked as puzzled as rand knew he himself must but the aiel nodded the last took another shaido but he crawled away not couladin worse luck he gestured to the looking glass and rand let him take his place was it such bad luck couladins death would not end the threat to cairhien or to anywhere else now they were this side of the dragonwall the shaido would not tamely return just because the man they thought was the true caracarn died it might well shake them but not enough for that and after all rand had seen he did not think couladin deserved so easy a way out i can be as hard as i must he thought stroking his sword hilt for him i can chapter dice before the arrow the inside of a tent roof had to be the most boring sight in the world but lying back in his shirtsleeves on scarlettasseled cushions that melindhra had acquired mat studied the graybrown cloth intently or rather he stared beyond it one arm curled behind his head he swirled a hammeredsilver goblet full of good wine from the south of cairhien a small cask had cost him as much as two good horses would as much as two horses would have if the world and everything in it had not been stood on its head but he counted it a small price for something decent sometimes a drop or two splashed over onto his hand but he never noticed and he never took a drink by his book matters had long since gone beyond merely serious serious was being stuck in the waste with no idea of the way out serious was darkfriends popping up when you least expected trolloc attacks in the night the odd myrddraal freezing your blood with an eyeless stare that sort of thing came quickly and usually was done before you had much chance to think it was certainly not what you would seek out yet if you had to you could live with it if you could live through it but for days he had known where they were heading and why nothing quick about it days to think i am no bloody hero he thought grimly and im no bloody soldier fiercely he pushed down a memory of walking fortress walls ordering his last reserves to where another crop of trolloc scaling ladders had sprung up that was not me the light burn whoever it was im he did not know what he was a sour thought but whatever he was it involved gambling and taverns women and dancing that he was sure of it involved a good horse and every road in the world to choose from not sitting and waiting for somebody to shoot arrows at him or try to stick a sword or a spear through his ribs any different would make him a fool and he would not be that not for rand or moiraine or anybody else as he sat up the silver foxhead medallion hanging on its leather thong slipped from the unlaced neck of his shirt he tucked it back before taking a long swallow of wine the medallion made him safe from moiraine or any other aes sedai as long as they did not get it away from him surely one or another would try sooner or later but nothing except his own wits kept him safe from some fool killing him along with a few thousand other fools or from rand or from being taveren a man ought to be able to find a profit in something like that having events twist themselves around him rand certainly had in a way he himself had never noticed anything twisting around him except the fall of dice he would not turn away from some of the things that happened to taveren in stories wealth and fame dropped into their pockets as if from the sky men who wanted to kill them decided to follow instead and women with ice in their eyes decided to melt not that he was complaining at what he had really and certainly not that he wanted anything like rands bargain the price to get into the game was too high it was just that he seemed to be stuck with all the burdens of being taveren and none of the pleasure it is time to go he told the empty tent then paused thoughtfully and sipped at the goblet it is time to get on pips and ride ride to caemlyn maybe not a bad city so long as he avoided the royal palace or lugard he had heard rumors about lugard a fine place that for the likes of him time to leave rand in my dust hes got a bloody aiel army and more maidens than he can count taking care of him he doesnt need me that last was not strictly true in some strange way he was tied to rands success or failure in tarmon gaidon him and perrin both three taveren all tangled together the histories would probably only mention rand small chance he or perrin would find any place in the stories and then there was the horn of valere which he did not want to think about and would not not until he had to there might be some way out of that particular mess yet any way he looked at it the horn was a problem for another day a distant day with luck all those bills would come due on a very distant day only that might take more luck than he had the point now was that he had said all of that about going and felt scarcely a twinge not long ago he had been unable even to speak of leaving when he got too far from rand he had been drawn back like a hooked fish on some invisible line then he had become able to say it even to lay plans but the slightest thing would distract him make him put off his schemes for stealing away even in rhuidean when he had told rand he was going he had been sure something would get in the way it had in a manner of speaking mat had made it out of the waste but he was no further from rand than before this time he did not think he would be diverted not like i was abandoning him he muttered if he cant bloody take care of himself by now hell never be able to im not his bloody nursemaid draining the goblet he scrambled into his green coat settled his knives in their hiding places arranged a dark yellow silk scarf to hide the hanging scar on his throat then snatched up his hat and ducked out heat hit him in the face after the relatively cool shade inside he was not sure how the seasons changed here but summer was hanging on too long to suit him one thing he had looked forward to on leaving the waste was the arrival of autumn a little coolness no luck here at least the hats wide brim kept the sun off this hilly cairhienin forest was a pitiful thing more clearings than trees and half of them going brown in the drought not a patch on the westwood back home low aiel tents were everywhere though at any distance they took on the look of a pile of dead leaves or a bare hummock of ground unless the side flaps were up and even then they were not easy to see the aiel going about their business did not look at him twice from one crest as he crossed the encampment he caught sight of kaderes wagons all in a circle the drivers lying in the shade underneath and the peddler nowhere in view kadere kept to his wagon more and more seldom poking his nose out except when moiraine came to inspect the ladings the aiel ringing the wagons small knots with spears and bucklers bows and quivers made little pretense of being anything but guards moiraine must think kadere or some of his men would try to make off with what she had brought out of rhuidean mat wondered whether rand realized that he was giving her anything and everything she asked for a while mat had thought rand had gotten the upper hand there but he was not so sure any longer even if moiraine did do everything but curtsy and fetch rands pipe rands tent was on a hilltop by itself naturally that red banner on a staff at its front it rippled in a light breeze sometimes standing out enough to show the blackandwhite disc the thing made mats skin crawl as much as the dragon banner had if a man wanted to avoid aes sedai entanglements as any but an idiot would the last thing to do was wave that symbol about the slopes of the hill were bare but maidens tents encircled the foot of the hill and spread through the trees up surrounding slopes and down the other side that was as usual too and so was the wise ones camp within the far dareis mai dozens of low tents in shouting distance of rands hill with whiterobed gaishain bustling about there were only a few of the wise ones to be seen yet they made up for lack of numbers with the stares that followed him he had no idea how many could channel in that bunch but they were a fair equal of aes sedai weighing and measuring when it came to stares he picked up his pace making an effort not to shrug uncomfortably he could feel those eyes on his back as surely as he could have a poke from a stick and he would have to run the same gauntlet coming out well a few words with rand and it would be the last time he had to run it only when he pulled off his hat and ducked into rands tent no one was there except natael lounging on the cushions with his gilded dragoncarved harp propped against his knee and a gold goblet in his hand mat grimaced and swore under his breath he should have known as much if rand had been here he would have had to pass through a circle of maidens right around the tent most likely he was up at that newbuilt tower a good idea that know the terrain that was the second rule close behind know your enemy and not much to choose between them the thought put a sour twist to his mouth those rules came from other mens memories the only rules he wanted to remember were never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars and never gamble without knowing a back way out he almost wished those memories of other men were still separate lumps in his brain instead of oozing into his thoughts when he least expected trouble with a bilious stomach natael asked lazily one of the wise ones might have a root to cure it or you could try moiraine mat could not like the man he always seemed to be thinking of a joke he did not mean to share and he always looked as if he had three servants taking care of his clothes all that snowy lace at collar and cuffs always seeming freshly laundered the fellow never appeared to sweat either why rand wanted him around was a mystery he almost never played anything merry on that harp will he be back soon natael shrugged when he decides to perhaps soon perhaps late no man clocks the lord dragon and few women there it was again that secretive smile a touch bleak this time ill wait he meant to go through with this too many times he had found himself putting off going natael sipped at his wine studying him across the goblets rim it was bad enough that moiraine and the wise ones watched him in that silent searching way sometimes egwene did too she had certainly changed half wise one and half aes sedai but from rands gleeman it was enough to set his teeth on edge the best thing about leaving would be not having anyone look at him as if they would know in a minute what he was thinking and already knew whether his smallclothes were clean two maps lay spread out near the firepit one copied in detail from a tattered map found in a halfburned town covered northern cairhien from west of the alguenya halfway to the spine of the world while the other newly drawn and sketchy showed the land around the city slips of parchment held down with pebbles dotted both if he was going to stay and ignore nataels searching look at the same time there was nothing for it but to study the maps with the toe of his boot he shifted a few pebbles on the map of the city so he could read what was written on the parchments in spite of himself he winced if the aiel scouts could count couladin had nearly one hundred and sixty thousand spears shaido and those who had supposedly gone to join their societies among the shaido a hard nut to crack and prickly this side of the spine of the world had not seen an army like that since artur hawkwings time the second map showed the other clans that had crossed the dragonwall all had now in one force or another strung out according to when they had left the jangai and spread apart but too close to here for comfort the shiande the codarra the daryne and the miagoma between them they apparently had at least as many spears as couladin they had not left many behind if that was true the seven clans with rand almost doubled that easily enough to face couladin or the four clans either or not both not at once but both at once might be what rand had to fight what the aiel called the bleakness had to be affecting those clans too every day still men tossed down their weapons and vanished but only a fool would think it lessened their numbers any more than it did rands and there was always the possibility that some of those were going to couladin the aiel did not speak of it very much or very freely and masked the idea behind talk of joining societies but even now men and maidens decided they could not accept rand or what he had told them of themselves every morning some were missing and not all left their spears behind a pretty situation wouldnt you say mats head jerked up at lans voice but the warder had entered the tent alone just something to look at while i waited is rand coming back he will be with us soon thumbs tucked behind his sword belt lan stood beside mat looking down at the map his face gave away as much as a statues would tomorrow should bring the largest battle since artur hawkwing you dont say where was rand still up on that tower probably maybe he should go there no he could end up haring all over the camp always one step behind rand would come here eventually he wanted to talk about something besides couladin this fight is none of mine im not running away from anything that concerns me in the least what about them he gestured to the slips representing the miagoma and the others any word on whether they mean to join rand or do they just intend to sit there watching who can say rhuarc doesnt seem to know any more than i do and if the wise ones do they are not telling the only thing certain is that couladin is not going anywhere couladin again mat shifted uncomfortably and took a halfstep toward the entrance no he would wait fastening his gaze on the maps he pretended to study them further perhaps lan would leave him in silence he just wanted to say his piece to rand and go the warder appeared to want to talk though what do you think master gleeman should we rush down on couladin with everything and crush him tomorrow that sounds as good to me as any other plan natael replied dourly emptying the goblet down his throat he dropped it on the carpets and picked up the harp to begin softly strumming something dark and funereal i lead no armies warder i command nothing save myself and not always that mat grunted and lan glanced at him before returning to his study of the maps you do not think it a good plan why not he said it so casually that mat answered without thinking plenty of reasons if you surround couladin trap him between you and the city you might crush him against it how long was rand going to be but you might push him right over the walls too from what i hear hes nearly gotten over twice already even without miners or siege engines and the city is hanging on by its teeth say his piece and go that was it press him enough and youll find yourself fighting inside cairhien nasty thing fighting in a city and the idea is to save the place not finish ruining it those slips laid out on the maps the maps themselves made it all so clear frowning he squatted with his elbows on his knees lan got down with him but he hardly noticed a dicey problem and fascinating best if you try to shove him away hit him from the south mainly he pointed to the river gaelin it joined the alguenya some miles north of the city there are bridges up here leave the shaido a clear path to them always leave a way out unless you really want to find out how hard a man can fight when hes nothing to lose his finger slid east wooded hills for the most part it seemed probably not much different from right around here a blocking force here on this side of the river will make sure they go for the bridges if its big enough and positioned right once they are moving couladin wont want to try fighting someone ahead of him while youre coming behind yes almost exactly the same as at jenje not unless hes a complete fool anyway they might make it to the river in good order but those bridges will choke them i dont see aiel swimming or hunting out fords for that matter keep the pressure on shove them across with luck youll be able to harry them all the way to the mountains it was like cuaindaigh fords too late in the trolloc wars and on much the same scale not much different from the tora shan either or sulmein gap before hawkwing found his stride the names flickered through his head the images of bloody fields forgotten even by historians absorbed in the map as he was they did not register as anything but his own remembrances too bad you dont have more cavalry light cavalry is best for the harrying bite at the flanks keep them running and never let them settle to fight but aiel should do almost as well and the other reason lan asked quietly mat was caught up in it now he more than merely liked gambling and battle was a gamble to make dicing in taverns a thing for children and toothless invalids lives were the stake here your own and other mens men who were not even there make the wrong wager a foolish bet and cities died or whole nations nataels somber music was fit accompaniment at the same time this was a game that set the blood racing without lifting his eyes from the map he snorted you know as well as i if even one of those four clans decides to side with couladin theyll take you from behind while your hands are still full of shaido couladin will be the anvil and they the hammer with you the nut between only take half of what you have against couladin that makes it an even fight but you have to settle for it there was no such thing as fairness in war you took your enemy from behind when he least expected it when and where he was weakest you still have an edge he has to worry about a sortie from the city the other half you split in three parts one to funnel couladin to the river the other two a few miles apart between the city and the four clans very neat lan said nodding that slabcarved face never changed but approval touched his voice if lightly it would gain a clan nothing to attack either force especially not when the other could take it in the rear and none will try to interfere in what happens around the city for the same reason of course all four could join not likely if they havent already but if they do everything changes mat laughed aloud everything always changes the best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves the bow this would be easy enough for a child to handle except for indirian and the rest not knowing their own minds if they all decide to go over to couladin you toss the dice and hope because the dark ones in the game for sure at least youll have enough strength clear of the city nearly to match them enough to hold them for the time you need abandon the idea of pursuing couladin and turn everything on them as soon as hes well and truly begun crossing the gaelin but its my bet theyll wait and watch and come to you once couladin is done for victory settles a lot of arguments in most mens heads the music had stopped mat glanced at natael and found the man holding his harp rigidly staring at him over it harder than ever staring as if he had never seen him before did not know what he was the gleemans eyes were dark polished glass his knuckles white on the harps gilding with that it all crashed home what he had been saying the memories he had been embracing burn you for a fool for not guarding your tongue why had lan had to take the conversation that way why could he not have talked about horses or the weather or just kept his mouth shut the warder had never seemed all that eager to talk before usually the man made a tree seem talkative of course he could have kept his own mind focused and his own mouth shut too at least he had not been babbling in the old tongue blood and ashes but i hope i wasnt springing to his feet mat turned to go and found rand standing just inside the tent absently twisting that odd bit of tasseled spear as if he did not realize he was holding it how long had he been there it did not matter mat spilled it all out in a rush im leaving rand come first light in the morning i am in the saddle and gone id go this minute if i could get far enough in half a day to suit me for stopping i mean to put as many miles between me and the aiel any aiel as pips can cover before i make camp no point in bedding down close enough to be snapped up and hung out to dry by somebodys scouts couladin must have them out too and even the others might not recognize him before he had a spear in his liver i will be sorry to see you go rand said quietly dont try to talk me out of mat blinked thats it youll be sorry to see me go ive never tried to make you stay mat perrin went when he had to and so can you mat opened his mouth then closed it again rand had never tried to make him stay true he had just done it without trying but there was not the slightest bit of taveren tugging now no vague feelings that he was doing the wrong thing he was firm and clear in his purpose where will you go south not that there was much choice of direction the others led to the gaelin with nothing north of the river that he was interested in or else to aiel one lot that would certainly kill him and one that might or might not depending on how close by rand was and what they had had for supper the night before not good odds by his reckoning to begin anyway then somewhere theres a tavern and some women who dont carry spears melindhra she might present a problem he had the feeling she might be the sort of woman who did not let go until she wanted well one way or another he would deal with her maybe he could just ride out before she knew it this isnt for me rand i dont know anything about battles and i dont want to know he avoided looking at lan and natael if either man cracked his teeth he would punch him right in the mouth even the warder you understand dont you rands nod could have been understanding maybe it was id forget saying goodbye to egwene were i you i am no longer certain how much of what i tell her i might as well be telling moiraine or the wise ones or both i reached that conclusion a long time ago shes left emonds field further behind than either of us and regrets it less maybe rand said sadly the light shine on you mat he added sticking out his hand and send you smooth roads fair weather and pleasant company until we meet again that would not be soon if mat had his way he felt a little sad about that and a little foolish for feeling sad yet a man had to look after himself when all was said and done that was the long and short of it rands grip was as hard as it had ever been all that swordwork had only added new calluses atop older bowmans but the ridged heron brand in his palm was distinct against mats hand just a little reminder in case he should forget the markings under his friends coatsleeves or those even stranger things inside his head that let him channel if he could forget that rand could channel and he had not thought of it once in days days then it was far past time to be gone a few more awkward words standing there lan seemed to ignore them arms folded silently studying the maps while natael had begun idly plucking his harp mat had an ear for music and to him the unfamiliar tune had an ironic sound he wondered why the fellow had chosen it a few more moments and rand halfstepping around actually putting an end to it and then mat was outside there was a crowd out there a good hundred maidens spread about the hilltop and walking on tiptoe they were so ready to spear somebody all seven clan chiefs waiting patient and still as stone three tairen lords trying to pretend that they were not sweating and the aiel did not exist he had heard about the lords arrival and had even gone to take a look at their camp or camps but there had been no one there he knew and no one wanting to take a turn at dice or cards these three eyed him up and down frowning disdainfully and apparently decided he was no better than the aiel which was to say not worth seeing clapping his hat on his head and pulling the brim low over his eyes mat studied the tairens coldly in return for a moment he had the pleasure of seeing the younger pair at least become uncomfortably aware of him again before he started down the hill the graybeard still looked all barely concealed impatience to enter rands tent but it did not matter anyway he would never see any of them again he had no idea why he had not simply ignored them except that his step was lighter and he felt full of vinegar no wonder really leaving tomorrow at last the dice seemed to be spinning in his head and there was no knowing what pips would show when they landed odd that it must be melindhra worrying him yes he would definitely leave early and as quietly as a mouse tiptoeing on feathers whistling he set off for his tent what was the tune oh yes dance with jak o the shadows he had no intention of dancing with death but it had a merry sound so he whistled it anyway as he tried to plan the best route away from cairhien rand stood staring after mat long after the tent flaps had fallen to hide him i only heard the last bit he said finally was it all like that very nearly lan replied with only a few minutes to study the maps he laid out close to the battle plan that rhuarc and the others made he saw the difficulties and the dangers and how to meet them he knows about miners and siege engines and using light cavalry to harry a defeated foe rand looked at him the warder showed no surprise not the twitch of an eyelash of course he was the one who had said mat seemed surprisingly knowledgeable about military matters and lan was not going to ask the obvious question either which was good rand had no right to give the little answer he had he could have asked a few questions himself such as what did miners have to do with battles or maybe it was only sieges whatever the answer there was not a mine closer than the dragons dagger and no certainty anyone was still digging ore well this battle would be fought without the important thing was that he knew mat had gained more on the other side of that doorway terangreal than a tendency to spout the old tongue when not thinking and knowing that rand would surely make use of it you dont have to get any harder he thought bitterly he had seen mat climbing toward this tent and never hesitated in sending lan in to discover what might come to the surface in idle conversation alone that had been deliberate the rest might or might not be but it would happen he hoped mat had a fine time while he was free he hoped that perrin was enjoying himself in the two rivers showing off faile to his mother and sisters maybe marrying her he hoped it because he knew he would draw them back taveren pulling at taveren and he the strongest moiraine had named it no coincidence three such growing up in the same village all nearly the same age the wheel wove happenstance and coincidence into the pattern but it did not lay down the likes of the three of them for no reason eventually he would pull his friends back to him however far they went and when they came he would use them however he could however he had to because he did have to because whatever the prophecy of the dragon said he was sure the only chance he had of winning tarmon gaidon lay in having all three of them three taveren who had been tied together since infancy tied together once more no he did not need to become hard youre rank enough already to make a seanchan spew his supper play march of death he commanded in a harsher voice than he wanted and natael looked at him blankly for a moment the man had been listening to everything he would have questions but he would find no answers if rand could not tell lan mats secrets he would not spread them before one of the forsaken however tame he appeared this time he deliberately made his tone rough and pointed the length of spear at the man play it unless you know a sadder play something to make your soul weep if you have one still natael gave him an ingratiating smile and a seated bow but he went white around the eyes it was indeed the march of death that he began yet it had a sharper edge on his harp than ever before a dirgelike keen that surely would make any soul weep he stared fixedly at rand as if hoping to see some effect turning away rand stretched out on the carpets with his head to the maps and a redandgold cushion under his elbow lan would you ask the others to come in now the warder made a formal bow before stepping outside it was the first time that he had ever done that but rand noticed only absently the battle would begin tomorrow it was a polite fiction that he helped rhuarc and the others plan he was smart enough to know what he did not know and despite all of his talks with lan and rhuarc he knew he was not ready ive planned a hundred battles this size or more and given orders that led to ten times as many not his thought lews therin knew war had known war but not rand althor and that was him he listened asked questions and nodded as if he understood when the chiefs said a thing should be done a certain way sometimes he did understand and wished he did not because he knew where that understanding came from his only real contribution had been to say that couladin had to be defeated without destroying the city in any case this meeting would only add a few touches at most to what had already been decided mat would have been useful with his newfound knowledge no he would not think of his friends of what he would do to them before it was all done even leaving the battle aside there was plenty to occupy him things he could do something about the absence of cairhienin flags above cairhien marked a major problem and the continued skirmishes with andorans another what sammael was up to warranted thought and the chiefs filed in in no particular order this time dhearic came first rhuarc and erim together at the rear with lan bruan and jheran took the places next to rand they did not concern themselves with precedence among themselves and aanallein they seemed to take as all but one of them weiramon entered last his lordlings at his heels and a tightmouthed scowl on his face precedence certainly mattered to him muttering into his oiled beard he stalked his way around the firepit taking up a place behind rand until the chiefs flat stares finally broke through his shell at least among aiel a close kinsman or society brother might position himself so if there was the possibility of a knife in the back he still frowned at jheran and dhearic as though expecting one of them to make room finally bael gestured to the place beside him across the maps from rand and after a pause weiramon strode back to sit crosslegged and rigid staring straight ahead and looking like a man who had swallowed an unripe plum whole the younger tairens stood almost as stiffly at his back one with the grace to look embarrassed rand took note of him but said not a word only thumbed his pipe full of tabac and seized saidin long enough to light it he had to do something about weiramon the man exacerbated old problems and made new ones not a flicker crossed rhuarcs features but the other chiefs expressions ranged from lans sour disgust to erims clear coldeyed readiness to dance spears there and then perhaps there was a way for rand to rid himself of weiramon and make a beginning on another of his worries at the same time with rands example lan and the chiefs began filling pipes i see only small changes necessary bael said puffing his pipe alight and sparking a glower from han as usual do these small changes concern the goshien or perhaps some other clanputting weiramon from his mind rand bent himself to listening as they worked out what had to be altered from their new view of the terrain now and again one of the aiel would glance at natael a brief tightness to eyes or mouth suggesting that the mournful music plucked at something in him even the tairens grimaced sadly the sounds washed over rand though touching nothing tears were a luxury he could no longer afford not even inside chapter full aes sedai symbol this place this day the next morning rand was up and dressed well before first light in truth he had not slept and it had not been aviendha who kept him awake not even after she began undressing before he could put out the lamps and channeled one alight again as soon as he did chiding him that she was unable to see in the dark even if he could he made no reply and hours later had hardly noticed when she rose a good hour before he did dressed and left he did not even think to wonder where she was going the thoughts that had had him staring up into the blackness still ran hrough his head men would die today a great many men even if everything went perfectly nothing he did now would change it today would run out according to the pattern but over and over he mulled the decisions he had made since he first entered the waste could he have done something different something that would have avoided this day this place next time perhaps the tasseled length of spear lay atop his sword belt and scabbarded blade beside his blankets there would be a next time and one beyond that and beyond again while darkness still held the chiefs came in a bunch for a few final words to report that their men were in position and ready not that anything else was expected stonefaced as they were some emotion showed an odd mix though a skim of ebullience over somberness erim actually wore a slight smile a good day to see the end of the shaido he said finally he seemed to be walking on his toes the light willing bael said his head brushing the roof of the tent we will wash the spears in couladins blood before sunfall bad luck to talk of what will be han muttered the skim was very thin on him of course fate will decide rand nodded the light send it does not decide on too many of our number dead he wished his concern were only that few men should die because men should not have their lives cut short but there were many more days to come he would need every spear to bring order to this side of the dragonwall that was a bone between him and couladin every bit as much as the rest life is a dream rhuarc told him and han and the others nodded agreement life was only a dream and all dreams had to end aiel did not run toward death yet they did not run from it either as they were departing bael paused are you certain of what you want the maidens to do sulin has been speaking to the wise ones so that was what melaine had been at bael about the way rhuarc stopped to listen he had been hearing from amys on the subject too everyone else is doing what they are supposed to without complaining bael that was unfair but this was no game if the maidens want special consideration sulin can come to me not go running to the wise ones had they been anything but aiel rhuarc and bael would have been shaking their heads as they left rand supposed each would get an earful from his wife but they would have to live with it if far dareis mai carried his honor this time they would carry it where he wanted to rands surprise lan appeared just as he was ready to go out himself the warders cloak hung down his back disturbing the vision as it rippled with his movements is moiraine with you rand had expected lan to be glued to her side she is fretting in her tent she cannot possibly heal even all of the worst hurt today that was her choice of how to help she could not use the power as a weapon today but she could heal waste always angers her it angers us all rand snapped his taking egwene away probably upset her too as far as he could tell egwene was not very good at healing on her own but she could have aided moiraine well he needed her to keep her promise tell moiraine if she needs help ask some of the wise ones who can channel but few wise ones had any knowledge of healing she can link with them and use their strength he hesitated had moiraine ever spoken of linking to him you didnt come here to tell me moiraine is brooding he said irritably it was difficult sometimes keeping straight what came from her what from asmodean and what bubbled up from lews therin i came to ask why youve taken to wearing a sword again moiraine asked already did she send lans face did not change but he cut in roughly i want to know you can make a sword from the power or kill without but suddenly you are wearing steel on your hip again why unconsciously rand ran one hand up the long hilt at his side its hardly fair to use the power that way especially against someone who cant channel i might as well fight a child the warder stood silent for a time studying him you mean to kill couladin yourself he said at last in flat tones that sword against his spears i dont mean to seek him out but who can say what will happen rand shrugged uncomfortably not to hunt for him but if ever his twisting of chance was to favor him let it be to bring him facetoface with couladin besides id not put it past him to seek me the threats ive heard from him have been personal lan raising one fist he thrust his arm out of a crimson coatsleeve enough to make the goldenmaned dragons fore end plainly visible couladin wont rest while i live not so long as we both wear these and truth to tell he would not rest himself until only one living man bore the dragons by rights he should lump asmodean in with couladin asmodean had marked the shaido but couladins unrestrained ambition had made it possible his ambition and refusal to abide by aiel law and custom had led inevitably to this place this day beyond the bleakness and war between aiel there was taien to be laid at couladins feet and selean and dozens of ruined towns and villages since countless hundreds of burned farms unburied men and women and children had fed the vultures if he was the dragon reborn if he had any right to demand that any nation follow him much less cairhien then he owed them justice then have him beheaded when hes taken lan said harshly set a hundred men or a thousand with no purpose but to find and take him but do not be fool enough to fight him you are good with a blade now very good but aielmen are all but born with spear and buckler in hand a spear through your heart and all has been for naught so i should avoid the fighting would you if moiraine had no claims on you will rhuarc or bael or any of them i am not the dragon reborn the fate of the world does not rest on me but the momentary heat had gone from his voice without moiraine he would have been wherever the fighting was hottest if anything he looked to be regretting those claims at the moment ill not take needless risks lan but i cant run from them all the seanchan spear would remain in the tent today it would only get in his way if he did find couladin come the aiel will finish it without us if we stand here much longer when he ducked outside only a few stars remained and a thin brightness outlined the eastern horizon sharply that was not why he stopped though and lan with him maidens made a ring around the tent shoulder to shoulder facing inward a thick ring that spread down the dark shrouded slopes cadinsorclad women jammed so a mouse could not have slipped through jeadeen was nowhere in sight though a gaishain had been ordered to have him saddled and waiting not maidens alone two women in the front rank wore bulky skirts and pale blouses their hair bound back with folded scarves it was too black yet to discern faces with any certainty but there was something in the shape of those two in their foldedarm stance that named egwene and aviendha sulin stepped forward before he could open his mouth to ask what they were up to we have come to escort the caracarn to the tower with egwene sedai and aviendha who put you up to this rand demanded one glance at lan showed it had not been him even in the darkness the warder looked startled for a moment anyway his head jerking up nothing surprised lan for long egwene is supposed to be on her way to the tower now and the maidens are supposed to be there to guard her what she will do today is very important she must be protected while she does it we will protect her sulins voice was as flat as a planed board and the caracarn who gave his honor to far dareis mai to carry a murmur of approval rippled through the maidens it only makes sense rand egwene said from where she stood if one using the power as a weapon will make the battle shorter three will shorten it even more and you are stronger than aviendha and me together she did not sound as if she liked saying that last aviendha said nothing but the way she stood was eloquent this is ridiculous rand scowled let me through and go to your assigned place sulin did not budge far dareis mai carries the honor of the caracarn she said calmly and others took it up no louder but from so many womens voices it made a high rumble far dareis mai carries the honor of the caracarn far dareis mai carries the honor of the caracarn i said let me through he demanded the instant the sound died as if he had told them to begin again they did far dareis mai carries the honor of the caracarn far dareis mai carries the honor of the caracarn sulin just stood there looking at him after a moment lan leaned close to murmur dryly a woman is no less a woman because she carries a spear did you ever meet one who could be diverted from anything she really wanted give over or we will stand here all day while you argue and they chant at you the warder hesitated then added besides which it does make sense egwene opened her mouth as the litany fell off once more but aviendha put a hand on her arm and whispered a few words and egwene said nothing he knew what she had intended to say though she had been about to tell him he was a stubborn foolish woolhead or some such the trouble was that he was beginning to feel like one it did make sense for him to go to the tower he had nothing to do elsewhere the battle was in the hands of the chiefs and fate now and he would be of more use channeling than riding around hoping to meet with couladin if being an infantryman could pull couladin to him it could draw him to the tower as easily as anywhere else not that he would have much chance of seeing the man not after ordering every last maiden to defend the tower but how to back down and retain a scrap of dignity after blustering left right and center ive decided i can do the most good from the tower he said his face going hot as the caracarn commands sulin replied without a hint of mockery just as if it had been his idea from the first lan nodded then slipped away the maidens making narrow room for him the gap closed up right behind lan though and when they began to move rand had no choice except to go with them he could have channeled of course flung fire about or knocked them down with air but that was hardly the way to behave with people on his side let alone women besides he was not sure he could have made them leave him short of killing and maybe not then and anyway he had decided he was of most use at the tower after all egwene and aviendha were as silent as sulin as they walked for which he was grateful of course at least part of their silence had to do with picking their way uphill and down in the dark without breaking their necks aviendha did raise a mutter now and then that he barely caught something angry about skirts but neither made fun of him for backing down so visibly though that might well come later women seemed to enjoy jabbing the needle in just when you thought the danger was past the sky began to lighten into gray and as the log tower came into sight above the trees he broke the quiet himself i didnt expect you to be part of this aviendha i thought you said wise ones take no part in battles he was sure she had a wise one could walk through the middle of a battle untouched or into any hold or stand of a clan that had blood feud with hers but she took no part in fighting certainly not with channeling until he came to the waste even most aiel had not really known that some wise ones could channel though there were rumors of strange abilities and sometimes something the aiel thought might be close to channeling i am not a wise one yet she replied pleasantly shifting her shawl if an aes sedai like egwene can do this so can i i arranged it this morning while you still slept but i have thought of it since you first asked egwene there was enough light now for him to see egwene flush when she saw him glancing at her she tripped over nothing and he had to catch her arm to keep her from falling avoiding his eyes she jerked free maybe he would not have to worry about any needles from her they started uphill through the sparse woods toward the tower they didnt try to stop you amys i mean or bair or melaine he knew they had not if they had she would not be there aviendha shook her head then frowned thoughtfully they talked for a long time with sorilea then told me to do as i thought i must usually they tell me to do as they think i must glancing at him sideways she added i heard melaine say that you bring change to everything i do that he said setting his foot on the bottom rung of the first ladder the light help me that i do the view from the platform was magnificent even to the naked eye the land spreading out in wooded hills the trees were thick enough to hide the aiel moving toward cairhien most would already be in position but dawn cast the city itself in golden light a quick scan through one of the looking glasses showed the barren hills along the river placid and seemingly empty of life that would change soon enough the shaido were there if concealed for now they would not remain concealed when he began to direct what not balefire whatever he did it had to unnerve the shaido as much as possible before his aiel attacked egwene and aviendha had been taking turns looking through the other long tube with pauses for quiet discussion but now they were simply talking softly exchanging nods finally they moved closer to the railing and stood with their hands on the roughhewn timber staring toward cairhien goose bumps suddenly dotted his skin one of them was channeling maybe both it was the wind that he noticed first blowing toward the city not a breeze the first real wind he had felt in this country and clouds were beginning to form above cairhien heaviest to the south growing thicker and blacker as he watched roiling only there over cairhien and the shaido everywhere else as far as he could see the sky was a clear blue with only a few high thin white wisps yet thunder rolled long and solid suddenly lightning stabbed down a jagged silver streak that rent a hilltop below the city before the crack of the first bolt reached the tower two more crackled earthward wild forks danced across the sky but those single lances of brilliant white struck with the regularity of a heartbeat abruptly ground exploded where no lightning had fallen fountaining fifty feet then again somewhere else and again rand had no idea which woman was doing what but they certainly looked set to harrow the shaido out time to do his bit or stand watching reaching out he seized saidin icy fire scoured the outside of the void that surrounded what was rand althor coldly he ignored the oily filth seeping into him from the taint juggled wild torrents of the power that threatened to engulf him at this distance there were limits to what he could do in fact it was about as far as he could do anything really without angreal or saangreal very likely that was why the women were channeling one lightning bolt at a time one explosion if he was at his boundary they must be stretching theirs a memory slid across the emptiness not his lews therins for once he did not care in an instant he channeled and a ball of fire enveloped the top of a hill nearly five miles away a churning mass of pale yellow flame when it faded he could see without the looking glass that the hill was lower now and black at the crest seemingly melted between the three of them there might be no need for the clans to fight couladin at all ilyena my love forgive me the void trembled for an instant rand teetered on the brink of destruction waves of the one power crashed through him in a froth of fear the taint seemed to solidify around his heart a reeking stone clutching the rail until his knuckles ached he forced himself back to calmness forced the emptiness to hold thereafter he refused to listen to the thoughts in his head instead he concentrated everything on channeling on methodically searing one hill after another standing well back into what treeline there was on the crest mat held pips nose under his arm so the gelding would not whicker as he watched a thousand or so aiel slanting toward him across the hills from the south the sun was just peeking over the horizon stretching long rippling shadows to one side of the trotting mass the nights warmth was already beginning to give way to the heat of day the air would swelter once the sun reached any height he was already beginning to sweat the aiel had not seen him yet but he had few doubts that they would if he waited there much longer it hardly mattered that they very nearly had to be rands men if couladin had men to the south the day was going to get very interesting for those stupid enough to be in the middle of the fighting hardly mattered because he was not going to run the risk of letting them see him he had already come too close to an arrow this morning for that kind of carelessness absently he fingered the neat slice across the shoulder of his coat good shooting at a moving target only halfseen through trees he could have admired it more had he not been the target without taking his eyes from the approaching aiel he carefully backed pips deeper into the sparse thicket if they saw him and picked up their pace he wanted to know people said aiel could run down a man on horseback and he meant to have a good lead if they tried not until the trees hid them from him did he quicken his own step leading pips onto the reverse slope before mounting and turning west a man could not be too careful if he wanted to stay alive on this day and this ground he muttered to himself as he rode hat pulled low to shade his face and blackhafted spear across his pommel west again the day had begun so well a good two hours before first light when melindhra had gone off to some meeting of the maidens thinking him asleep she had not glanced at him as she stalked out muttering half under her breath about rand althor and honor and far dareis mai above all she sounded as if she were arguing with herself but frankly he did not care whether she wanted to pickle rand or stew him before she was a minute out of the tent he was stuffing his saddlebags no one had so much as looked at him twice while he saddled pips and ghosted away to the south a good beginning only he had not counted on columns of taardad and tomanelle and every other bloody clan sweeping around to the south no consolation that it was very close to what he had babbled to lan he wanted to go south and those aiel had forced him toward the alguenya toward where the fighting would be a mile or two on he cautiously turned pips upslope pausing deep in the scattered trees on the crest it was a higher hill than most and he had a good view this time there were no aiel in sight but the column winding along the bottom of the twisting hill valley was almost as bad mounted tairens had the lead behind a knot of colorful lords banners with a gap back to a thick bristling snake of pikemen in the tairens dust and then another to the cairhienin horse with their multitude of banners and pennants and con the cairhienin maintained no order at all milling about as lords shifted back and forth for conversation but at least they had flankers out to either side in any case as soon as they were past he had a clear route south and ill not stop until im halfway to the bloody erinin a flicker of movement caught his eye well ahead of the column below he would not have seen it except for being so high none of the riders could have certainly digging his small looking glass from his saddlebags kin tovere liked the dice he peered toward what he had seen and whistled softly through his teeth aiel at least as many as the men in the valley and if they were not couladins they meant to give a nameday surprise for they were lying low among the dying bushes and dead leaves for a moment he drummed fingers on his thigh shortly there were going to be some corpses down there and not many of them aiel none of my affair i am out of this out of here and heading south he would wait a bit then head off while they were all too busy to notice this fellow weiramon he had heard the graybeards name yesterday was a stone fool no foreguard out and no scouts or hed know what was bloody in store for him for that matter the way the hills lay the way the valley twisted the aiel could not see the column either only its thin dust rising skyward they certainly had had scouts to get themselves in place they could not just be waiting there on the off chance idly whistling dance with jak o the shadows he put the looking glass back to his eye and studied the hilltops yes the aiel commander had left a few men where they could signal a warning just before the column entered the killing ground but even they could not possibly see anything yet in a few minutes the first tairens would come in sight but until then it came as a shock when he heeled pips to a gallop downslope what under the light am i doing well he could not just stand by and let them all go their deaths like geese to the knife he would warn them that was all tell what lay in wait ahead then he was gone the cairhienin outriders saw him coming before he reached the bottom of the slope of course heard pips deadflat charge two or three lowered their lances mat did not precisely enjoy having a foot and a half of steel pointed at him and still less three times over but obviously one man was no threat even riding like a madman they let him pass and he swung in near the lead cairhienin lords long enough to shout halt here now by order of the lord dragon else hell channel your head into your belly and feed you your own feet for breakfast his heels dug in and pips sprang ahead he only glanced back to be sure they were doing what he said they were if showing some confusion over it the hills hid them from the aiel still and once their dust settled the aiel would have no way of knowing they were there and then he was lying low on the geldings neck whipping pips with his hat and galloping up alongside the infantry if i wait to let weiramon pass the orders itll be too late thats all he would give his warning and go the foot marched in blocks of two hundred or so pikemen with one mounted officer in the front of each and maybe fifty archers or crossbowmen at the rear most looked at him curiously as he dashed by pips heels kicking up spurts of dust but none broke stride some of the officers mounts frisked as if the riders wanted to come see what had him in such a hurry but none of them left their places either good discipline they would need it defenders of the stone brought up the tail end of the tairens in their breastplates and puffy blackandgold striped coatsleeves plumes of various colors on the rimmed helmets marking officers and underofficers the rest were armored the same but bore the colors of various lords on their sleeves the silkcoated lords themselves rode at the very front in ornate breastplates and large white plumes their banners rippling behind them in a rising breeze toward the city reining around in front of them so quickly that pips danced mat shouted halt in the name of the lord dragon it seemed the fastest way to stop them but for a moment he thought they meant to ride right over him almost at the last moment a young lord he remembered from outside rands tent flung up a hand and then they were all drawing rein in a flurry of shouted orders that ran back along the column weiramon was not there not a lord was as much as ten years older than mat what is the meaning of this demanded the fellow who had signaled dark eyes glared arrogantly down a sharp nose chin lifted so his pointed beard looked ready to stab sweat trickling down his face spoiled it only a little the lord dragon himself gave me this command who are you to he cut off as another man mat knew caught his sleeve whispering urgently potatofaced estean looked haggard beneath his helmet as well as hot the aiel had wrung him out concerning conditions in the city so mat had heard but he had gambled at cards with mat in tear he knew exactly who mat was esteans breastplate alone had chips in the ornate gilding none of the others had done more than ride around looking pretty yet sharpnoses chin came down as he listened and when estean left off he spoke in a more moderate tone no offense intended ah lord mat i am melanril of house asegora how may i serve the lord dragon moderation slipped into actual hesitation at that last and estean broke in anxiously why should we halt i know the lord dragon told us to hold back mat but burn my soul theres no honor in sitting and letting the aiel do all the fighting why should we be saddled with chasing them after theyre broken besides my father is in the city and he trailed off under mats stare mat shook his head fanning himself with his hat the fools were not even where they should be there was no chance of turning them back either if melanril would go and looking at him mat was not sure he would even on supposed orders from the lord dragon there was still no chance he sat his saddle in plain sight of the aiel lookouts if the column started turning around they would know themselves discovered and very likely they would attack while the tairens and the cairhienin pike were tangled up it would be a slaughter as surely as if they had gone ahead in ignorance where is weiramon the lord dragon sent him back to tear melanril replied slowly to deal with the illianer pirates and the bandits on the plains of maredo he was reluctant to go of course even for so great a responsibility but pardon lord mat but if the lord dragon sent you how is it that you dont know mat cut him off i am no lord and if you want to question what rand lets people know ask him that set the fellow back he was not about to question the lord bloody dragon about anything weiramon was a fool but at least he was old enough to have been in a battle except for estean looking like a sack of turnips tied on his horse all this lot had seen was a tavern fight or two and maybe a few duels fat lot of good that would do them now you all listen to me when you pass through that gap ahead between the next two hills aiel are going to come down on you like an avalanche he might as well have told them there was going to be a ball with the women all sighing to meet a tairen lordling eager grins broke out and they started dancing their horses about slapping each other on the shoulder and boasting how many they would kill estean was odd man out just sighing and easing his sword in its scabbard dont stare up there mat snapped the fools in a minute they would be calling the charge keep your eyes on me on me it was who he was friends with that settled them down melanril and the others in their fine unmarked armor frowned impatiently not understanding why he did not want to let them begin the business of killing aiel savages if he had not been rands friend they probably would have trampled him and pips both he could let them go charging off they would do it piecemeal leaving the pikes and the cairhienin horse behind though the cairhienin might join in once they realized what was happening and they would all die the smart thing would be to let them get on with it while he headed in the opposite direction the only trouble was that once these idiots let the aiel know they were discovered those aiel might decide to do something fancy like swinging around to take the strungout fools in the flank if that happened there was no certainty that he would get clear what the lord dragon wants you to do he told them is to ride ahead slowly just as if there wasnt an aiel inside a hundred miles as soon as the pikes are through the gap theyll form a hollow square and you get yourselves inside it double quick inside melanril protested angry mutters rose from the other young lords except estean who looked thoughtful there is no honor in hiding behind stinking you bloody do it mat roared reining pips close to melanrils horse or if the bloody aiel dont kill you rand will and whatever he leaves ill chop into sausage myself this was taking too long the aiel had to be wondering what they were talking about by now with any luck you will be set before the aiel can hit you if you have horsebows use them otherwise hold tight youll get your bloody charge and youll know when but if you move too early he could almost feel time running down setting the butt of his spear in his stirrup like a lance he heeled pips back down the column when he glanced over his shoulder melanril and the others were talking and peering after him at least they were not haring up the valley the commander of the pikemen proved to be a pale slender cairhienin half a head shorter than mat and mounted on a gray gelding that looked past ready for the pasture daerid had hard eyes though an oftbroken nose and three white scars crisscrossing his face one of them not very old he took off his bellshaped helmet while he talked with mat the front of his head was shaved no lord he maybe he had been part of the army before the civil war started yes his men knew how to form a hedgehog he had not faced aiel but he had faced brigands and andoran cavalry there was an implication that he had fought other cairhienin as well for one of the houses contesting for the throne daerid sounded neither eager nor reluctant he sounded like a man with a job of work to do the column stepped off as mat turned pips head the other way they marched with a measured pace and a quick look behind showed the tairens horses moving no faster he let pips go a little quicker than a walk but not much it seemed he could feel aiel eyes on his back feel them wondering what he had said and where he was going now and why just a messenger whos delivered his message and is going away nothing to worry about he certainly hoped that was what the aiel thought but his shoulders did not untense until he was sure they could no longer see him the cairhienin were still waiting where he had left them they still had their flankers out too banners and con made a thicket where the lords had gathered one in ten or better of the cairhienins number most of them wore plain breastplates and where there was gilt or silverwork it was battered as though a drunken blacksmith had been at it some of their mounts made daerids look like lans warhorse could they even do what was needed but the faces that turned to him were hard the gazes harder he was in the clear now hidden from the aiel he could ride on after telling this lot what was expected of them anyway he had sent the others on into the aiel trap he could not simply abandon them talmanes of house delovinde his con three yellow stars on blue and his banner a black fox was even shorter than daerid and had three years on mat at most but he led these cairhienin although there were older men and even gray hair present his eyes held as little expression as daerids and he looked like a coiled whip his armor and sword were utterly plain once he had told mat his name the man listened quietly while mat laid out his plan leaning a little out of the saddle to cut lines in the ground with the swordbladed spear the other cairhienin lords gathered round on their horses watching but none so sharply as talmanes talmanes studied the map he drew and studied him from boots to hat even his spear when he was done the fellow still did not speak until mat barked well i dont care whether you take it or leave it but your friends will be hipdeep in aiel in not much longer the tairens are no friends of mine and daerid is useful certainly not a friend dry chuckles ran through the onlooking lords at the suggestion but i will lead one half if you lead the other talmanes pulled off one steelbacked gauntlet and put out his hand but for a moment mat only stared at it lead him im a gambler not a soldier a lover memories of battles long gone spun through his head but he forced them down all he had to do was ride on but then maybe talmanes would leave estean and daerid and the rest to roast on the spit mat had hung them from even so it was a surprise to him when he grasped the others hand and said you just be there when youre supposed to be for reply talmanes began calling off names in a quick voice lords and lordlings reined toward mat each followed by a bannerman and perhaps a dozen retainers until he had four hundred odd of the cairhienin talmanes did not have much to say after either he just led the remainder west at a trot trailing a faint cloud of dust keep together mat told his half charge when i say charge run when i say run and dont make any noise you dont have to there was the creak of saddles and the thud of hooves as they followed him of course but at least they did not talk or ask questions a last glimpse of the other bristle of bright banners and con and then a twist in the shallow valley hid them how had he gotten into this it had all started so simply just give warning and go each step after had seemed so small so necessary and now he had waded waist deep into the mud and no choice but to keep on he hoped talmanes meant to show up the man had not even asked who he was the hill valley twisted and forked as he angled north but he had a good sense of direction for instance he knew exactly which way lay south and safety and it was not the way he was heading dark clouds were forming up there toward the city the first he had seen so thick in a long time rain would break the drought good for the farmers if any remained and settle the dust good for horsemen so they did not announce themselves too early maybe if it rained the aiel would give up and go home the wind was beginning to pick up too bringing a little cool for a wonder the sound of fighting drifted over the crests men shouting men screaming it had begun mat turned pips raised his spear and swung it right and left he was almost surprised when the cairhienin formed into one long line to either side of him facing upslope the gesture had been instinctive from another time and place but then these men had seen fighting he started pips up through the scattered trees at a slow walk and they kept pace to the quiet jangle of bridles his first thought on reaching the height was relief at seeing talmanes and his men coming into sight on the crest across from him his second was to curse daerid had formed the hedgehog spiny thickets of pikes four deep interspersed with bowmen to make a large hollow square long pikes made it difficult for the shaido to get close however they rushed in and the archers and crossbowmen were exchanging shots hot and fast with the aiel men were falling on both sides but the pikes simply closed in when one of their number went down making the square tighter of course the shaido did not appear to slacken their assault either the defenders were dismounted in the center and maybe half the tairen lords with their retainers half that was what made him want to curse the rest dashed about among the aiel slashing and stabbing with sword and lance in knots of five or ten or alone dozens of riderless horses told how well they were doing melanril was off with only his bannerman laying about with his blade two aiel darted in to neatly hamstring the lordlings horse it fell head flailing mat was sure it screamed but the din swallowed it and then melanril vanished behind cadinsorclad figures spears stabbing the bannerman lasted a moment longer good riddance mat thought grimly standing in his stirrups he raised the swordbladed spear high then swept it forward shouting los los cabadrin he would have had the words back if he could and not because they were old tongue it was a boiling cauldron down in the valley but whether or not any of the cairhienin understood a command of horsemen forward in the old tongue they understood the gesture especially when he dropped back into his saddle and dug in his heels not that he really wanted to but be could not see any choice now he had put those men down there some might have gotten away if he had told them to turn and run and he just did not have a choice banners and con waving the cairhienin charged downhill with him shouting battle cries in imitation of him no doubt though what he was shouting was blood and bloody ashes across the valley talmanes raced down just as hard sure that they had all the wetlanders penned the shaido never saw the others until crashed into from behind on both sides it was then that the lightning began to fall and after that things really got hairy chapter dragon the lesser sadness rands shirt clung to him with the sweat of effort but he kept his coat on for protection from the wind gusting toward cairhien the sun had at least another hour to reach its noonday peak yet already he felt as if he had run all morning and been beaten with a club at the finish wrapped in the void he was only distantly aware of the weariness dimly perceiving the ache in arms and shoulders in the small of his back a throb around the tender scar in his side that he was aware of them at all told the story with the power in him he could make out individual leaves on the trees at a hundred paces but whatever happened to him physically should have been as if it were happening to someone else he had long since taken to drawing on saidin through the angreal in his pocket the stone carving of the fat little man even so working the power was a strain now weaving it at this distance of miles but only the rancid threads streaking what he drew kept him from pulling more from trying to pull it all to him the power was that sweet taint or no after hours of channeling without rest he was that tired at the same time he had to fight saidin itself harder to put more of his strength into keeping it from burning him to ash where he stood from burning his mind to ash it was ever more difficult to hold off saidins destruction more difficult to resist the desire to draw more more difficult to handle what he did draw a nasty downward spiral and hours to go before the battle was decided wiping sweat from his eyes he gripped the platforms rough railing he was near the brink yet he was stronger than egwene or aviendha the aiel woman was standing peering off toward cairhien and the storm clouds occasionally bending to stare through the long looking glass egwene sat crosslegged leaning back against an upright still covered in gray bark her eyes closed they both looked as worked out as he felt before he could do anything not that he knew what he had no skill at healing egwenes eyes opened and she stood exchanging a few quiet words with aviendha that the wind snatched away from even his saidinenhanced hearing then aviendha sat down in egwenes place and let her head fall back against the upright the black clouds around the city continued to stab lightning but they were wild forks far more often than single lances now so they were taking turns giving each other a rest it would have been nice to have someone do that with him but he did not regret telling asmodean to stay in his tent he would not have trusted him to channel especially not now who could say what he would have done when he saw rand weakened as he was staggering slightly rand pulled his looking glass around to study the hills outside the city life was certainly visible there now and death wherever he looked there was fighting aiel against aiel a thousand here five thousand there swarming over the treeless hills and too closely meshed for him to do anything he could not find the column of horse and pike three times he had seen them once fighting twice their number of aiel he was certain they were still out there small hope that melanril had decided to obey his orders at this late juncture choosing the man just because he had the grace to be embarrassed by weiramons behavior had been a mistake but there had been little time to make a choice and he had had to get rid of weiramon nothing to be done about it now maybe one of the cairhienin could be put in command if even his direct order would make the tairens follow a cairhienin a milling mass right at the citys high gray wall caught his eye tall ironbound gates stood open aiel battling horsemen and spearmen almost in the open while folk tried to close the gates tried and failed because of the press of bodies horses with empty saddles and armored men unmoving on the ground half a mile from the gate marked where the sortie had been driven back arrows rained down from the walls and headsized chunks of rubble even occasional spears slashing down with enough force to spit two men or three though he still could not see from where exactly but the aiel were going over their dead ever closer to forcing their way in a quick scan showed him two more columns of aiel trotting toward the gates perhaps three thousand all told he did not doubt that they were couladins as well he was aware of grinding his teeth if the shaido got inside cairhien he would never drive them north he would have to dig them out street by street the cost in lives would dwarf the number of those already dead and the city itself would end a ruin like eianrod if not taien cairhienin and shaido were mingled like ants in a bowl but he had to do something taking a deep breath he channeled the two women had set the conditions bringing the storm clouds he did not need to be able to see their weavings to take advantage of them stark silverblue lightning struck into the aiel once twice again as fast as a man could clap rand jerked his head up blinking away the burning lines that still seemed to cross his sight and when he looked through the long tube again shaido lay like cut barley all around where the bolts had fallen men and horses thrashed on the ground closer to the gates too and some did not move at all but the uninjured were dragging the injured and the gates were beginning to close how many wont make it back inside how many of my own did i kill the cold truth was that it did not matter it had had to be done and it was done and well it was distantly he felt his knees wobbling he would have to pace himself if he was to last the rest of the day no more laying about him everywhere he had to spot where he was particularly needed where he could make a the storm clouds were massed only over the city and the hills to the south but that did not stop lightning from slashing out of the clear cloudless sky above the tower flashing down into the gathered maidens below with a deafening crack hair lifting with the tingle in the air rand stared he could feel that bolt in another way feel the weaving of saidin that had made it so asmodean was tempted even back in the tents there was no time for thought though like rapid beats on a giant drum bolt followed bolt marching through the maidens until the last struck the base of the tower in an explosion of splinters the size of arms and legs as the tower slowly began to slant over rand threw himself at egwene and aviendha somehow he managed to scoop them both into one arm then wrap the other around an upright on what was now the upslope side of the platform they stared at him wideeyed mouths coming open but there was no more time for speaking than for thinking the shattered log tower toppled crashing through the branches of the trees for an instant he believed they might cushion the fall with a snap the upright he clung to broke off the ground came up and knocked all the breath out of him a heartbeat before the women came down on top of him darkness rolled in he regained consciousness slowly hearing returned first have dug us up like a boulder and sent us rolling downhill in the night it was aviendhas voice low as if she spoke for her own ears there was something moving on his face you have taken away what we are what we were you must give us something in return something to be we need you the moving thing slowed touched more softly i need you not for myself you will understand for elayne what is between her and me now is between her and me but i will hand you to her i will if you die i will carry your corpse to her if you die his eyes popped open and for a moment they stared at each other almost nose to nose her hair was all in disarray her head scarf gone and a purple lump marred her cheek she straightened jerkily folding a damp cloth stained with blood and began dabbing at his forehead with considerably more force than before ive no intention of dying he told her though in truth he was not sure of that at all the void and saidin were gone of course just thinking of losing them as he had made him shiver it was pure luck that saidin had not scoured his mind blank in that last instant just thinking of seizing the source again made him groan without the void for buffer he felt every ache every bruise and scrape to the fullest he was so tired he could have dropped off to sleep at once if he had not hurt so much as well he did hurt then because he surely could not sleep not for a long time yet sliding a hand beneath his coat he touched his side then surreptitiously wiped the blood off his fingers onto his shirt before bringing the hand out again no wonder that a fall like that had broken open the halfhealed neverhealed wound he did not seem to be bleeding too badly but if the maidens saw it or egwene or even aviendha he might have a fight to keep from being hauled off to moiraine for healing he had too much to do yet for that being healed on top of everything else would act on him like a cudgel to the temple and besides there must be far worse hurt than what he suffered for her to deal with grimacing suppressing another groan he got to his feet with only a little help from aviendha and promptly forgot about his injuries sulin sat on the ground nearby with egwene bandaging a bloody split in her scalp and muttering fiercely at herself because she did not know how to heal but the whitehaired maiden was not the only casualty and not the worst by far everywhere cadinsorclad women were covering the dead with blankets and tending those who had merely been burned if merely could be used for lightning burns except for egwenes grumbling the hilltop lay in near silence even the injured women quiet save for hoarse breathing the log tower all but unrecognizable now had not spared the maidens in its fall breaking arms and legs tearing open gashes he watched as a blanket was laid over the face of a maiden with redgold hair almost the shade of elaynes head twisted at an unnatural angle and glazed eyes staring jolien one of those who first crossed the dragonwall to search for he who comes with the dawn she had gone to the stone of tear for him and now she was dead for him oh youve done well at keeping the maidens from harm he thought bitterly very well indeed he could still feel the lightning or rather the residue of its making almost like the afterimage burned into his eyes earlier he could trace the weave though it was fading to his surprise it led west not back toward the tents not asmodean then sammael he was sure of it sammael had sent that attack in the jangai sammael was behind the pirates and the raids in tear and sammael had done this his lips peeled back in a snarl and his voice was a harsh whisper sammael he did not realize he had taken a step until aviendha seized his arm a moment later egwene had the other the pair of them clinging to him as if they meant to root him to the spot do not be a complete woolhead egwene said giving a start at his glare but not letting go she had redone the brown scarf around her head but combing with her fingers had not put her hair back in order and dust still covered her blouse and skirt whoever did this why do you think he waited so long until you must be tired because if he missed killing you and you went after him you would be easy meat you can barely stand on your own aviendha was no readier to let go meeting his stare with a flat one of her own you are needed here rand althor here caracarn does your honor lie with killing this man or here with those you have brought to this land a young aielman came running up through the maidens shoufa around his shoulders spears and buckler swinging easily if he thought it odd to find two women holding rand between them he gave no hint of it he eyed the shattered remnants of the tower and the dead and wounded with a slight curiosity as though wondering how it might have happened and where the enemy dead might be grounding his spearpoints in front of rand he said i am seirin of the shorara sept of the tomanelle i see you seirin rand replied just as formally not easy with a pair of women holding him as if they thought he might run han of the tomanelle sends word to the caracarn the clans to the east are moving toward each other all four han means to join with dhearic and he has sent to erim to join them rand drew a measured breath and hoped the women thought his grimace was for the news his side burned and he could feel blood spreading slowly down his shirt so there would be nothing to force couladin north when the shaido broke if they broke they had given no evidence of it yet that he had seen why were the miagoma and the others joining together if they meant to come against him they were only giving warning but if they meant to come against him han and dhearic and erim would be outnumbered and if the shaido held long enough and the four clans broke through across the wooded hills he could see that it had begun to rain over the city now that egwene and aviendha were not holding the clouds that would hamper both sides unless the women were in better shape than they looked they might be unable to regain control from this distance tell han to do what he must to keep them off our backs young as he was he was about rands age come to that seirin raised an eyebrow in surprise of course han would not do differently and seirin knew it he waited only long enough to make certain that rand had no further message then he was off and running downhill just as fast as he had come no doubt he hoped to get back without missing any more of the fighting than he had to for that matter it might already have begun there to the east i need someone to fetch jeadeen rand said as soon as seirin had dashed off if he tried to walk that far he really would need the women to hold him up the two of them looked nothing alike yet they managed practically identical suspicion those frowns must have been one of the things every girl was taught by her mother i am not going after sammael not yet i have to get closer to the city though he nodded to the fallen tower that was the only gesture available with them hanging on master tovere might be able to salvage the lenses from the looking glasses but there were not three logs of the tower unbroken no more observing everything from on high today egwene was plainly uncertain but aviendha barely paused before asking a young maiden to go to the gaishain to fetch mist too which he had not counted on egwene began brushing herself off muttering under her breath at the dust and aviendha had found an ivory comb and another scarf somewhere despite the fall somehow they already looked considerably less disheveled than he weariness still marked their faces but as long as they could channel at all they would be useful that gave him pause did he ever think of anyone now except as to how useful they were he should be able to keep them as safe as they had been atop the tower not that the tower had been very safe as it turned out but this time he would manage things better sulin stood as he approached a pale cap of algode bandage covering the top of her head her hair a white fringe below i am moving nearer the city he told her where i can see what is happening and maybe do something about it everyone who is injured is to remain here alone with enough others to protect them if need be make it a strong guard sulin i only need a handful with me and its poor repayment for the honor the maidens have shown me if i let their wounded be slaughtered that should hold the greater part of them away from the fighting he himself would have to stay clear to keep the rest out but the way he felt that would be no burden i want you to stay here and i am not one of the injured she said stiffly and he hesitated then nodded slowly very well he had no doubt that her injury was serious but neither did he doubt that she was tough and if she stayed he might be stuck with someone like enaila leading his guard being treated like a brother was nowhere near as annoying as being treated like a son and he was in no mood to put up with the latter but i trust you to see that no one follows who is injured sulin i will have to keep moving i cant afford anyone who will slow me down or must be left behind she nodded so quickly that he was convinced she would make any maiden with as much as a scratch remain behind except herself of course this was one time he felt no guilt over using someone the maidens had chosen to carry the spear but they had chosen to follow him too maybe follow was not precisely the word considering some of the things they did but that did not change anything to his mind he would not he could not order a woman to her death and that was that in truth he had expected some sort of protest before this he was only grateful that it had not come i must be more subtle than i think two palerobed gaishain arrived leading jeadeen and mist and behind them followed a crowd of others arms full of bandages and ointments and over their shoulders bulging water bags in layers under the direction of sorilea and a dozen other wise ones whom he had met at most he thought he might know the names of half sorilea was very definitely in charge and she quickly had gaishain and other wise ones alike circulating among the maidens tending wounds she eyed rand and egwene and aviendha frowning thoughtfully and pursing her thin lips obviously thinking that all three looked tossed about enough to need their injuries bathed that look was enough to send egwene scrambling into the grays saddle with a smile and a nod for the aged wise one though if aiel had been more familiar with riding sorilea would have realized that egwenes awkward stiffness was not usual and it was a measure of aviendhas condition that she let egwene pull her up behind the saddle without the slightest protest she smiled at sorilea too gritting his teeth rand pulled himself into his own saddle in one smooth motion aching muscles protests were buried under an avalanche of pain in his side as though he had been stabbed anew and it took a full minute before he could breathe again but he let none of it show egwene reined mist close to jeadeen near enough to whisper if you cannot mount a horse any better than that rand althor maybe you should forget about riding at all for a while aviendha wore one of those blank aiel expressions but her eyes were intent on his face i noticed you mounting too he said quietly maybe you ought to stay here and help sorilea until you feel better that shut her up even if it did tighten her mouth sourly aviendha gave sorilea another smile the old wise one was still watching rand booted the dapple to a trot downhill every step sent a jolt up his side that had him breathing through his teeth but he had ground to cover and he could not do it at a walk besides sorileas stare had been starting to get on his nerves mist joined jeadeen before he was fifty paces down the overgrown slope and another fifty brought sulin and a stream of maidens some running to position themselves ahead more than he had hoped for but it should not matter what he had to do would not involve getting very close to the fighting they could stay back in safety with him seizing saidin was an effort in and of itself even through the angreal and the sheer weight of it seemed to press down on him greater than ever the taint stronger at least the void shielded him from his own pain somewhat anyway and if sammael tried to play games with him again he quickened jeadeens pace whatever sammael did he still had his own job to do rain dripped from the brim of mats hat and periodically he had to lower his looking glass and wipe off the end of the tube the downpour had slackened in the last hour but the sparse branches overhead gave no shelter at all his coat was long since soaked and pips ears were down the horse stood as if not intending to move however mat thumped his heels he did not know for sure what time of day it was somewhere in the middle of the afternoon he thought but the dark clouds had not thinned along with the rain and they hid the sun where he was on the other hand it felt very much like three or four days since he had ridden down to warn the tairens he was still not sure why he had done that it was southward that he peered and a way out that he looked for a way out for three thousand men easily that many survived yet though they had no idea what he was up to they believed he was hunting another fight for them but three so far were three too many by his book he thought he could have escaped on his own now so long as he kept his eyes open and his wits about him three thousand men however drew eyes whenever they moved and they did not move quickly what with more than half their number afoot that was why he was on this lightforsaken hilltop and why the tairens and cairhienin were all jammed into the long narrow hollow between this hill and the next if he simply made a break for it jamming the looking glass back to his eye he glared south at sparsely wooded hills here and there were thickets some fairly large but most of the land was scrub or grass even here he had worked back to the east using every fold in the ground that would hide a mouse bringing the column with him out of the treeless terrain and into some proper cover out of those bloody lightning strikes and fireballs he was not sure whether it was worse when they came or when the earth simply erupted in a roar for no apparent reason all that effort to find that the battle was shifting with him he could not seem to get out of the center of the thing wheres my bloody luck now that i really need it he was a peabrained fool for staying just because he had managed to keep the others alive this long did not mean he could keep it up soon or late the dice would come up the dark ones eyes theyre the flaming soldiers i should leave them to it and ride but he kept searching scanning the wooded peaks and ridges they gave cover for couladins aiel as well as for him but here and there he could make them out not all were involved in pitched battles but every last group was larger than his every one was between him and safety to the south and he had no way to tell who was who until it might be too late the aiel themselves seemed to know at a glance but that did him no good some mile or more off a few hundred cadinsorclad shapes running eight abreast and heading east topped a rise where halfadozen leatherleaf made a poor excuse for a copse before the lead runners could start down the other side a lightning bolt flashed down into their midst splashing men and earth like a stone thrown into a pond pips did not even quiver as the clap reached mat the gelding had grown accustomed to closer strikes than that some of the fallen men picked themselves up limping and immediately joined those who had kept their feet in a hasty check of the unmoving no more than a dozen were hauled across shoulders before they all dashed down from the height back the way they had come none paused to look at the crater mat had watched them learn that lesson waiting only invited a second silvery lance from the clouds in moments they were out of sight except for the dead he swung the looking glass east there was a look of sunlight a few miles that way the log tower should have been visible poking above the trees but he had not been able to find it in some time maybe he was looking in the wrong places it did not matter the lightning had to be rands work and all the rest of it as well if i can get far enough that way he would be right back where he started even if it was not the pull of taveren drawing him back he would have a hard time leaving again once moiraine found out and there was melindhra to consider he had never heard of a woman who would not take it askance when a man tried to walk out of her life without letting her know as he panned the looking glass slowly hunting the tower a slope covered in spaced leatherleaf and paperbark abruptly went up in flames every tree become a torch at the same instant slowly he lowered the brassbound tube he hardly required it to see the fire and the thick gray smoke already making a thick plume into the sky he did not need signs to recognize channeling when he saw it not like that had rand finally tipped over the edge of madness or maybe aviendha had finally had enough of being forced to stay around him never upset a woman who could channel that was a rule mat seldom managed to follow but he did try save the smart mouth for somebody besides yourself he thought sourly he was just trying not to think about the third alternative if rand had not finally gone mad and aviendha or egwene or one of the wise ones had not decided to be rid of him then someone else was taking a hand in the days business he could add two twos without getting five sammael so much for trying that way out it was no way out of anything blood and bloody ashes what has happened to my a fallen branch cracked under someones foot behind him and he reacted without thinking knees more than reins pulling pips in a tight circle swordbladed spear whipping across from the pommel of his saddle estean almost dropped his helmet his eyes going wide as the short blade stopped a breath short of splitting his head for him the rain had slicked his hair down into his face also afoot nalesean grinned partly startled and partly amused at the other young tairens discomfort squarefaced and blocky nalesean was the second since melanril to lead the tairen cavalry talmanes and daerid were there as well a pace behind as usual and blankfaced beneath their bellshaped helmets also as usual the four had left their horses farther back in the trees there are aiel coming straight for us mat nalesean said as mat raised the ravenmarked spear upright the light burn my soul if theres a one less than five thousand he grinned at that too i dont think they know were here waiting for them estean nodded once they are keeping to the valleys and hollows hiding from he glanced at the clouds and shivered he was not the only one to be uneasy about what might come out of the sky the otherthree looked up too anyway its plain they mean to go through where daerids men are there was actually a touch of respect in his voice when he mentioned the pikes grudging true and not very strong but it was difficult to look down on someone after they had saved your neck a few times they will be on top of us before they see us wonderful mat breathed that is just bloody wonderful he meant it for sarcasm yet nalesean and estean missed the flavor of course they looked eager but daerid wore as much expression on his scarred face as a rock and talmanes lifted an eyebrow at mat just a fraction shook his head a hair that pair knew fighting the first encounter with the shaido had been an even wager at best one mat would never have taken if not forced that all the lightning had shaken the aiel enough to turn it into a rout changed nothing twice more today they had seen action when mat discovered himself in a choice of whether to catch or be caught and neither had come out nearly as well as the tairens believed one had been a draw but only because he had been able to lose the shaido after they pulled back to regroup at least they had not come again while he was getting everyone away through the twisting hill valleys he suspected they had found something else to occupy them maybe more of that lightning or fireballs or the light knew what he knew very well what had allowed them to escape their last fight with skins mostly whole another bunch of aiel plowing into the rear of those fighting him just in time to keep the pikes from being overrun the shaido had decided to withdraw to the north and the others he still did not know who had swung off to the west leaving him in possession of the field nalesean and estean considered it a clear victory daerid and talmanes knew better how long mat asked it was talmanes who answered half an hour perhaps a little more if grace favors us the tairens looked doubtful they still did not seem to realize how quickly aiel could move mat had no such illusions he had already studied the surrounding terrain but he looked at it again and sighed there was a very good view from this hill and the only halfway decent stand of trees within half a mile was right where he sat his saddle the rest was scrub brush little as much as waisthigh dotted with leatherleaf and paperbark and the occasional oak those aiel would surely send scouts up here for a look and there was no chance at all that even the horsemen could get out of sight before they did the pikes would be right out in the open he knew what had to be done it was catch or be caught again but he did not have to like it he only took a glance but before he could open his mouth daerid said my scouts tell me couladin himself is with this lot at least their leader has his arms bare and shows marks such as the lord dragon is said to carry mat grunted couladin and heading east if there was any way to step aside the fellow would run headlong into rand that might even be what he was after mat realized that he was smoldering and it had nothing to do with couladin wanting to kill rand the shaido chief or whatever the man was might remember mat vaguely as somebody hanging about rand but couladin was the reason he was stuck out here in the middle of a battle trying to stay alive wondering whether any minute it was going to turn into a personal fight between rand and sammael the kind of fight that might kill everything within two or three miles thats if i dont get a spear through the brisket first and no more choice about it than had a goose hanging outside the kitchen door none of it would be so without couladin a pity no one had killed the man years ago he certainly gave excuses enough aiel seldom let anger show and when they did it was cold and tight couladin on the other hand seemed to flare up two or three times a day losing his head in a fiery rage as quick as snap a straw a miracle he was still alive and the dark ones own luck nalesean mat said angrily swing your tairens wide to the north and come in on these fellows from behind we will be holding their attention so you ride hard and come down like a barn collapsing so he has the dark ones luck does he blood and ashes but i hope mine is back in talmanes you do the same to the south move both of you weve little time and its wasting the two tairens bowed hastily and dashed for their horses clapping on their helmets talmanes bow was more formal grace favor your sword mat or perhaps i should say your spear then he was gone too looking up at mat as the three vanished down the hill daerid slashed rain from his eyes with a finger so you will stay with the pikes this time you must not let your anger at this couladin overcome you a battle is no place to try fighting a duel mat barely stopped from gaping a duel him with couladin was that why daerid thought he was staying with the foot he had chosen it because it was safer to be behind the pikes that was his reason the whole reason not to worry i can hold myself in rein and he had thought daerid the most sensible of the whole lot the cairhienin merely nodded i thought that you could you have seen pikes pushed before and faced a charge or two i vow talmanes gives praises when there are two moons yet i heard him say aloud that he would follow wherever you led some day i would like to hear your story andorman but you are young under the light i mean no disrespect and young men have hot blood this rain will keep it cool if nothing else does blood and ashes were they all mad talmanes was praising him he wondered what they would say if they found out he was only a gambler following bits of memory from men dead a thousand years and more they would be drawing lots for first chance to spit him like a pig the lords especially no one liked being made to look a fool but nobles seemed to like it least of all perhaps because they so often managed it on their own well one way or another he meant to be miles away when that discovery came bloody couladin id like to shove this spear down his throat heeling pips he started for the opposite slope where the foot waited below daerid climbed into his own saddle and swung in beside him nodding as mat spun out his plan the bowmen on the slopes where they could cover the flanks but lying down hidden in the brush until the last minute one man on the crest to signal the aiel in sight and the pikes to step off as soon as he did marching straight out toward the approaching enemy as soon as we can see the shaido well retreat just as fast as we can almost back to the gap between these two hills then turn to face them they will think we wanted to run realized we could not and turned at bay like a bear to the hounds seeing us less than half their number and fighting only because we must they should think to roll over us can we but hold their attention until the horse comes down on them from behind the cairhienin actually grinned it is using the aiels own tactics against them we had better hold their bloody attention mats tone was as dry as he was wet to make sure we do to make sure they dont start putting loops around our flanks i want a cry raised as soon as you stop the retreat protect the lord dragon this time daerid laughed aloud that should bring the shaido in right enough especially if couladin was leading if couladin really was leading if he thought rand was with the pikes if the pikes could hold until the horse arrived a lot of ifs mat could hear those dice rolling in his head again this was the biggest gamble he had ever taken in his life he wondered how long it was until nightfall a man should be able to make his way out in the night he wished those dice would get out of his head or else fall so he knew what they showed scowling into the rain he booted pips on down the hillside jeadeen stopped on a crest where a dozen trees made a thin topknot and rand hunched slightly against the pain in his side the crescent moon riding high cast a pale light yet even to his saidinamplified vision anything more than a hundred paces distant was featureless shadow night swallowed the surrounding hills whole and he was only intermittently aware of sulin hovering nearby and maidens all around him but then he could not seem to keep his eyes more than half open they felt grainy and he thought the gnawing pain in his side might be all that held him awake he did not think of it often thought was not only distant now it was slow was it twice sammael had attempted his life today or three times more it seemed that he should be able to remember how often someone had tried to kill him no not to kill to bait are you still so jealous of me tel janin when did i ever slight you or give you one finger less than your due swaying rand scrubbed a hand through his hair there had been something odd about that thought but he could not recall what sammael no he could deal with him when if no matter later today sammael was only a distraction from what was important he might even be gone vaguely it seemed that there had been no attack after after what he recalled countering sammaels last move with something particularly nasty but he could not pull the memory to the surface not balefire mustnt use that threatens the fabric of the pattern not even for ilyena i would burn the world and use my soul for tinder to hear her laugh again he was drifting again away from what was important however long ago the sun had gone down it had sunk on fighting lengthening shadows gradually overwhelming the goldenred light the men killing and dying now vagrant winds still brought distant shouts and screams because of couladin true but at the heart of it because of himself for a moment he could not remember his name rand althor he said aloud and shivered though his coat was damp with sweat for an instant that name had sounded strange to him i am rand althor and i need to i need to see he had not eaten since morning but then the taint on saidin drove hunger away the void quivered constantly and he hung on to the true source by his fingernails it was like riding a bull driven mad by redwort or swimming naked in a river of fire churned to rapids by jagged boulders of ice yet when he was not on the brink of being gored or battered or drowned it seemed that saidin was the only strength left in him saidin was there filing at the edges of him trying to erode or corrode his mind but ready to be used with a jerky nod he channeled and something burned high in the sky something a ball of bubbling blue flame that banished shadows in harsh light hills mounded up all around trees black in the stark illumination nothing moved a faint sound came to him on a gust of wind cheering perhaps or singing or maybe he was imagining things it was so tiny he could well have been and it died with the wind suddenly he became aware of the maidens around him hundreds of them some including sulin were staring at him but many had their eyes squeezed shut it took him a moment to realize they were trying to preserve night vision he frowned searching egwene and aviendha were no longer there another long moment passed before he remembered to loose the weave of his channeling and let blackness reclaim the night a deep blackness to his eyes now where are they he was vaguely irritated when he had to say who he meant and just as vaguely aware that he had no reason for it they went to moiraine sedai and the wise ones at dusk caracarn sulin replied moving closer to jeadeen her short white hair shone in the moonlight no her head was bandaged how could he have forgotten a good two hours gone they know that flesh is not stone even the strongest legs can run only so far rand frowned legs they had been riding mist the woman was making no sense i have to find them they are with moiraine sedai and the wise ones caracarn she said slowly he thought she was frowning too but it was hard to be sure not them he muttered have to find my people theyre still out there sulin why was the stallion not moving can you hear them out there in the night still fighting i need to help them of course he had to dig his heels into the dapples ribs but when he did jeadeen only shifted sideways with sulin holding on to his bridle he did not remember that she had been holding the bridle the wise ones must speak to you now rand althor her voice had changed but he was too weary to say how cant it wait he must have missed the runner with the message i must find them sulin enaila seemed to spring up on the other side of the stallions head you have found your people rand althor the wise ones are waiting for you sulin added she and enaila turned jeadeen without waiting on his agreement maidens crowded in for some reason as they started along a winding way down the side of the hill faces reflecting moonlight as they stared up at him so close their shoulders brushed the horses flanks whatever they want he grumbled they had best be quick there was no need for them to be leading the dapple but it was too much effort to make a fuss over it he twisted to look back grunting at the pain in his side the crest was already swallowed in the night i have a lot to do yet i need to find couladin sammael the men who were fighting and dying for him i need to find them he was so tired but he could not sleep yet lamps on poles lit the wise ones encampment and small fires where kettles of water were hauled away and replaced by whiterobed men and women as soon as they began boiling gaishain scurried everywhere and wise ones as well tending the wounded whose numbers swelled the camp moiraine was moving slowly down the long lines of those who could not stand only rarely pausing to lay hands on an aiel who then thrashed in the throes of being healed she swayed whenever she straightened and lan hovered behind her as if wanting to hold her up or expecting to have to sulin exchanged words with adelin and enaila too low for rand to make out and the younger women ran to speak to the aes sedai despite the numbers of wounded not all of the wise ones were looking after them inside a pavilion off to one side perhaps twenty sat in a circle listening to one standing in the center when she sat another took her place gaishain knelt around the outside of the pavilion but none of the wise ones appeared to have any interest in wine or anything except what they were hearing rand thought the speaker was amys to his surprise asmodean was also helping out with the wounded the water bag hanging from each shoulder looking decidedly odd with his dark velvet coat and white lace straightening from giving a drink to a man stripped to the waist except for bandages he saw rand and hesitated after a moment he handed the water bags to one of the gaishain and wove his way through the maidens toward rand they ignored him they all seemed to be watching adelin and enaila speaking to moiraine or else eyeing rand and his face was tight by the time he had to pause for the solid circle of far dareis mai around jeadeen they were slow in parting and did so just enough to let him through to rands stirrup i was sure you must be safe i was sure from his tone of voice he had been no such thing when rand did not speak asmodean shrugged uncomfortably moiraine insisted i carry water a forceful woman to not allow the lord dragons bard to trailing off he licked his lips quickly what happened sammael rand said but not in answer he was just speaking the thoughts that drifted through the void i remember when he was first named destroyer of hope after he betrayed the gates of hevan and carried the shadow down into the rorn mdoi and the heart of satelle hope did seem to die that day culan cuhan wept what is wrong asmodeans face had gone as white as sulins hair he only shook his head mutely rand peered at the pavilion whoever was speaking now he did not know her is that where they are waiting for me then i should join them they will not welcome you yet lan said appearing beside asmodean who jumped or any man rand had not heard or seen the warder approach either but he only turned his head even that seemed an effort it seemed to be someone elses head they meet with wise ones from the miagoma the codarra the shiande and the daryne the clans are coming to me rand said flatly but they had waited long enough to make today bloodier it never happened like that in the stories so it seems but the four chiefs will not meet you until the wise ones have made their arrangements lan added dryly come moiraine can tell you more than i of it rand shook his head done is done i can hear details later if han doesnt need to keep them from our backs any longer then i need him sulin send a runner han it is done rand the warder said insistently all of it only a few shaido remain south of the city thousands have been taken prisoner and most of the rest are crossing the gaelin word would have been sent to you an hour ago had anyone known where you were youve kept moving come and let moiraine tell you done weve won you have won completely rand peered at the men being bandaged the patient lines awaiting bandages and those leaving with them the rows that lay almost unmoving moiraine was still making her way along those pausing wearily here and there to heal only a few of the wounded would be here of course they would have been coming as they could throughout the day leaving as and when they could if they could none of the dead would be here only a battle lost is sadder than a battle won he seemed to remember saying that before long ago perhaps he had read it no there were too many living in his responsibility for him to worry over the dead but how many faces will i know like joliens i will never forget ilyena not if all the world burns frowning he raised a hand to his head those thoughts had seemed to come on top of one another from different places he was so tired he could hardly think but he needed to needed thoughts that did not slide by almost beyond his reach he released the source and the void and convulsed as saidin almost drove him under in that moment of retreat he barely had time to realize his mistake with the power gone exhaustion and pain crashed down on him he was aware of faces turned up to him as he toppled from his saddle mouths moving hands reaching to grab him cushion his fall moiraine lan shouted voice hollow in rands ears he is bleeding badly sulin had his head cradled in her arms hold on rand althor she said urgently hold on asmodean said nothing but his face was bleak and rand felt a trickle of saidin flowing into him from the man darkness came chapter rising sun after the storm sitting on a small boulder jutting from the foot of the slope mat winced as he pulled his broadbrimmed hat lower against the midmorning sun partly to shield his eyes from the sun there was another thing he did not want to see though cuts and bruises reminded him especially the arrow slash along his temple that the hat pressed against an ointment from daerids saddlebags had stopped the bleeding there and elsewhere yet everything still hurt and most of it stung that part would grow worse the heat of the day was just beginning to take hold but sweat was beading up on his face and already dampening his smallclothes and shirt idly he wondered whether autumn would ever come to cairhien at least discomfort kept him from thinking how tired he was even after a night with no sleep he would have lain awake in a feather bed much less blankets on the ground not that he wanted to be anywhere near his tent in any case a fine bloody todo nearly killed im sweating like a pig i can t find a comfortable place to stretch out and i dont dare get drunk blood and bloody ashes he stopped fingering a slice across the chest of his coat an inch difference and that spear would have gone through his heart light but the man had been good and put that part of it out of his mind not that it was easy with what was going on all around him for once the tairens and cairhienin did not seem to mind seeing aiel tents in every direction there were even aiel right in the camp and almost as miraculously tairens mingling with cairhienin among the smoky cookfires not that anyone was eating the kettles had not been set on the fires although he could smell meat burning somewhere instead most were as drunk as they could manage on wine brandy or aiel oosquai laughing and celebrating not far from where he sat a dozen defenders of the stone stripped to sweaty shirtsleeves were dancing to the claps of ten times as many watchers in a line with arms around each others shoulders they stepped so quickly that it was a wonder none of them tripped or kicked the man next to them for another circle of onlookers near a tenfoot pole stuck in the ground mat hastily averted his eyes as many aielmen were doing some kicking of their own mat assumed it was a dance another aiel was playing the pipes for them they leaped as high as they could flung one foot even higher then landed on that foot and immediately leaped upward again faster and faster sometimes spinning like horizontal tops at the height of their leaps or turning somersaults or backflips seven or eight tairens and cairhienin sat nursing broken bones from trying it all the while cheering and laughing like madmen passing a stone crock of something back and forth in other places other men were dancing and maybe singing it was hard to say in the din without stirring he could count ten flutes not to mention twice as many tin whistles and a skinny cairhienin in a ragged coat was blowing something that looked part flute and part horn with some odd bits tossed in and there were countless drums most of them pots being banged with spoons in short the camp was bedlam and a ball rolled into one he recognized it mainly from those memories he could still assign to other men if he concentrated hard enough a celebration of still being alive one more time they had walked under the dark ones nose and survived to tell the tale one more dance along the razors edge finished almost dead yesterday maybe dead tomorrow but alive gloriously alive today he did not feel like celebrating what good was being alive if it meant living in a cage he shook his head as daerid estean and a heavyset redhaired aielman he did not know staggered by holding each other up barely audible through the clamor daerid and estean were trying to teach the taller man between them the words to dance with jak o the shadows well sing all night and drink all day and on the girls well spend our pay and when its gone then well away to dance with jak o the shadows the sun dark fellow showed no interest in learning of course he would not unless they convinced him it was a proper battle hymn but he listened and he was not the only one by the time the three passed out of sight in the milling crowd they had acquired a tail of twenty more waving dented pewter cups and tarred leather mugs all bellowing the tune at the top of their lungs therere some delight in ale and wine and some in girls with ankles fine but my delight yes always mine is to dance with jak o the shadows mat wished he had never taught any of them the song the teaching had just kept his mind occupied while daerid stopped him from bleeding to death that ointment stung as bad as the gashes themselves had and daerid would never make a seamstress jealous with his delicate handling of needle and thread only the song had spread from that first dozen like fire in dry grass tairens and cairhienin horse and foot had all been singing it when they returned at dawn returned right back to the hill valley where they had started below the ruin of the log tower and no chance for him to get away he had offered to ride ahead and talmanes and nalesean nearly came to blows over who was to provide his escort not everyone had become the best of friends all he needed now was for moiraine to come asking questions about where he had been and why flattering at him about taveren and duty about the pattern and tarmon gaidon until his head spun doubtless she was with rand now but she would get around to him eventually he glanced up at the hilltop and the tangle of shattered logs among broken trees that cairhienin fellow who had made the looking glasses for rand was up there with his apprentices poking about the aiel had been full of what happened there it was definitely past time for him to be gone the foxhead medallion protected him from women channeling but he had heard enough from rand to know a mans channeling was different he had no interest in finding out whether the thing would shield him from sammael and his ilk grimacing at darts of pain he used the blackhafted spear to lever himself to his feet around him the celebration went on if he drifted down to the picket lines now he was not looking forward to saddling pips the hero should not sit without drinking startled he jerked around grunting at the stab of his wounds to stare at melindhra she had a large clay pitcher in one hand not spears and her face was not veiled but her eyes seemed to be weighing him now listen melindhra i can explain everything what must be explained she asked flinging her free arm around his shoulders even with the sudden jolt he tried to stand straighter be still was not used to having to look up at a woman i knew you would seek your own honor the caracarn casts a great shadow but no man wishes to spend his life in the shade closing his mouth hurriedly he managed a faint of course she was not going to try to kill him thats it exactly in his relief he took the pitcher from her but his gulp turned into a splutter it was the rawest doubledistilled brandy he had ever tasted she retrieved the pitcher long enough to take a draw then sighed gratefully and pushed it back at him he was a man of much honor mat cauthon better that you had captured him but even by killing him you have gained much ji it was well that you sought him out despite himself mat looked at what he had been avoiding and shivered a leather cord tied in short flamered hair held couladins head atop the tenfoot pole near where the aielmen were dancing the thing seemed to be grinning at him sought couladin out he had done his best to keep the pikes between him and any of the shaido but that arrow had clipped the side of his head and he was on the ground before he knew it struggling to get to his feet with the fight raging all around him laying about him with the ravenmarked spear trying to make it back to pips couladin had appeared as if springing out of air veiled for killing but there had been no mistaking those bare arms entwined with dragons glittering goldandred the man had been cutting a swath into the pikemen with his spears shouting for rand to show himself shouting that he was the true caracarn maybe he really believed it by then mat still did not know whether couladin had recognized him but it had made no difference not when the fellow decided to carve a hole through him to find rand he did not know who had cut off couladins head afterward either i was too busy trying to stay alive to watch he thought sourly and hoping he would not bleed to death back in the two rivers he had been as fine a hand with a quarterstaff as anyone and a quarterstaff was not so different from a spear but couladin must have been born with the things in his hands of course that skill had not availed the man much in the end maybe i still have a little bit of luck please light let it show itself now he was thinking of how to get rid of melindhra so he could saddle pips when talmanes presented himself with a formal bow hand to heart in the cairhienin fashion grace favor you mat and you mat said absently she was not going to go because he asked asking would certainly put a fox in the henyard maybe if he told her he wanted to take a ride they said aiel could run down horses a delegation came from the city during the night there will be a triumphal procession for the lord dragon in gratitude from cairhien will there she had to have duties of some sort the maidens were always flocking around rand maybe she would be called off for that glancing at her though he did not think he had better count on it her wide smile was proprietary the delegation was from the high lord meilan nalesean said joining them his bow was just as correct both hands sweeping wide but hasty it is he who offers the procession to the lord dragon lord dobraine lord maringil and lady colavaere among others also came to the lord dragon mat pulled his mind back to the moment each of the pair was trying to pretend the other of them did not exist both looking right at him with never the flicker of an eye toward each other but their faces were as tight as their voices from the strain their hands white knuckled on sword hilts it would be a cap to everything if they came to blows and him likely still trying to hobble out of reach when one of them ran him through by accident what does it matter who sent a delegation as long as rand gets his procession it matters that you should ask him for our rightful place at the head talmanes said quickly you slew couladin and earned us that place nalesean closed his mouth and scowled plainly he had been about to say the same thing you two ask him mat said its none of my affair melindhras hand tightened on the back of his neck but he did not care moiraine would surely not be far from rand he was not about to put his neck in a second noose while still trying to think his way out of the first talmanes and nalesean gaped at him as if he were demented you are our battle leader nalesean protested our general my bodyservant will polish your boots talmanes put in with a small smile that he carefully did not direct at the squarefaced tairen and brush and mend your clothes so you will appear at your best nalesean gave his oiled beard a jerk his eyes darted halfway to the other man before he could stop them if i may offer i have a good coat i think will fit you well gold satin and crimson it was the cairhienins turn to glower general mat exclaimed holding himself up with the spear haft im no flaming i mean i wouldnt want to usurp your place let them figure out which one of them he meant burn my soul nalesean said it was your battle skill that won for us and kept us alive not to mention your luck ive heard how you always turn the right card but it is more than that id follow you if you had never met the lord dragon you are our leader talmanes said right on top of him in a voice more sober if no less certain until yesterday i have followed men of other lands because i must you i will follow because i want to perhaps you are not a lord in andor but here i say that you are and i pledge myself your man cairhienin and tairen stared at one another as though startled at voicing the same sentiment then slowly reluctantly exchanged brief nods if they did not like each other and only a fool would bet against that they could meet on this point after a fashion i will send my groom to prepare your horse for the procession talmanes said and barely frowned when nalesean added mine can share the work your mount must do us proud and burn my soul we need a banner your banner at that the cairhienin nodded emphatically mat was not sure whether to laugh hysterically or sit down and cry those bloody memories if not for them he would have ridden on if not for rand he would not have the things he could trace the steps that led to them each necessary as it seemed at the time and seeming an end in itself yet each leading inevitably to the next at the beginning of it all lay rand and bloody taveren he could not understand why doing something that seemed absolutely necessary and as close to harmless as he could make it always seemed to lead him deeper into the mire melindhra had begun stroking the back of his neck instead of squeezing it all he needed now he glanced up the hill and there she was moiraine on her delicatestepping white mare with lan on his black stallion towering at her side the warder bent toward her as if to listen and there seemed to be a brief argument a violent protest on his part but after a moment the aes sedai reined aldieb around and rode out of sight toward the opposite slope lan remained where he was on mandarb watching the camp below watching mat he shivered couladins head really did appear to be grinning at him he could almost hear the man speak you may have killed me but youve put your foot squarely in the trap im dead but youll never be free just bloody wonderful he muttered and took a long choking swallow of the rough brandy talmanes and nalesean seemed to think be meant it as said and melindhra laughed agreement some fifty or so tairens and cairhienin had gathered to watch the two lords speak to him and they took his drinking as a signal to serenade him beginning with a verse of their own well toss the dice however they fall and snuggle the girls be they short or tall then follow young mat whenever he calls to dance with jak o the shadows with a wheezing laugh he could not stop mat sank back down onto the boulder and set about emptying the pitcher there had to be some way out of this there just had to be rands eyes opened slowly staring up at the roof of his tent he was naked beneath a single blanket the absence of pain seemed almost startling yet he felt even weaker than he remembered and he did remember he had said things thought things his skin went cold i cannot let him take control i am me me fumbling beneath the blanket he found the smooth round scar on his side tender yet whole moiraine sedai healed you aviendha said and he gave a start he had not seen her sitting crosslegged on the layered rugs near the firepit sipping from a silver cup worked with leopards asmodean lay sprawled across tasseled cushions chin on his arms neither appeared to have slept dark circles underlined their eyes she should not have had to aviendha went on in a cool voice tired or not she had every hair in place and her neat clothes were a sharp contrast to asmodeans rumpled dark velvets now and then she twisted the ivory bracelet of rosesandthorns that he had given her as if not realizing what she was doing she wore the silver snowflake necklace too she still had not told him who had given it to her though she had seemed amused when she realized he really wanted to know she certainly did not look amused now moiraine sedai herself was near collapse from healing wounded aanallein had to carry her to her tent because of you rand althor because healing you took the last of her strength the aes sedai is on her feet already asmodean put in stifling a yawn he ignored aviendhas pointed stare she has been here twice since sunrise though she said you would recover i think she was not so certain last night nor was i pulling his gilded harp around in front of him he fussed with it speaking in an idle tone i did what i could for you of course my life and fortune are tied to yours but my talents lie elsewhere than healing you understand he strummed a few notes to demonstrate i understand that a man can kill or gentle himself doing what you did strength in the power is useless if the body is exhausted saidin can easily kill if the body is exhausted or so i have heard are you finished sharing your wisdom jasin natael aviendhas tone was chillier if anything and she did not wait for a reply before turning a gaze like bluegreen ice back to rand the interruption it seemed was his fault a man may behave like a fool sometimes and little is the worse for it but a chief must be more than a man and the chief of chiefs more still you had no right to push yourself near to death egwene and i tried to make you come with us when we grew too tired to continue but you would not listen you may be as much stronger than we as egwene claims yet you are still flesh you are the caracarn not a new seia doon seeking honor you have toh obligation to the aiel rand althor and you cannot fulfill it dead you cannot do everything yourself for a moment he could only gape at her he had barely managed to do anything at all had left the battle to others for all practical purposes while he stumbled about trying to be useful he had not even been able to stop sammael from striking where and as he chose and she upbraided him for doing too much i will try to remember he said finally even so she looked ready to lecture more what news of the miagoma and the other three clans he asked as much to divert her as because he wanted to know women seldom seemed willing to stop until they had hammered you into the ground unless you managed to distract them it worked she was full of what she knew of course and as eager to instruct as to scold asmodeans soft strumming for once something pleasant even pastoral made an odd background for her words the miagoma the shiande the daryne and the codarra were camped within sight of one another a few miles to the east a steady stream of men and maidens moved between the camps including rands but only among societies and indirian and the other chiefs were not stirring there was no doubt now that they would come to rand eventually but not until the wise ones finished their talks they are still talking rand said what under the light do they have to discuss that takes so long the chiefs are coming to follow me not them she gave him a flat look that would have done credit to moiraine the wise ones words are for wise ones rand althor hesitating she added as if making a concession egwene may tell you something of it when it is done her tone implied that egwene might not too she resisted his attempts to learn more and finally he let it lie perhaps he would find out before it bit him and perhaps not but either way he was not going to pry one word out of her that she did not want to speak aes sedai had nothing on aiel wise ones when it came to guarding their secrets and surrounding themselves with mystery aviendha was absorbing that particular lesson very well egwenes presence at the meeting of wise ones came as a surprise and so did moiraines absence he would have expected her to be in the middle twitching strings to her plans but it turned out that one grew from the other the newcome wise ones had wanted to meet with one of the aes sedai who followed the caracarn and although she was back on her feet after healing him moiraine claimed to have no time egwene had been routed from her blankets as a replacement that made aviendha laugh she had been outside when sorilea and bair practically dragged egwene from her tent trying to pull on her clothes while they hustled her along i called to her that she would have to dig holes in the ground with her teeth this time if she had been caught in a misdeed and she was so sleepy she believed me she began protesting that she would not so hard that sorilea began demanding what she had done to think she deserved to you should have seen egwenes face she laughed so hard that she nearly toppled over asmodean actually looked at her askance though why he should being what and who he was was beyond rand but rand only waited patiently until she caught her breath for aiel humor this was mild more the sort of thing he would have expected from mat than from any woman but mild even so when she straightened wiping her eyes he said what of the shaido then or are their wise ones also at this conclave she answered still giggling into her wine she considered the shaido finished hardly worth considering now thousands of prisoners had been taken with a trickle still being brought in and the fighting had died down except for a few small skirmishes here and there yet the more he got out of her the less he could see them as done for with the four clans keeping han occupied the bulk of couladins people had crossed the gaelin in good order even carrying away most of the cairhienin prisoners they had captured worse they had destroyed the stone bridges behind them that did not concern her but it did him tens of thousands of shaido north of the river no way to get at them until the bridges were replaced and even wooden spans would take time it was time that he did not have at the very end when it seemed there was no more to say on the shaido she told him what made him forget worrying about the shaido and what trouble they would cause she just tossed it in as if she had almost forgotten mat killed couladin he said incredulously when she was done mat did i not say so the words were sharp but halfhearted peering at him over her winecup she seemed more interested in how he would take the news than in whether he doubted her word asmodean plucked a few chords of something martial the harp seemed to echo to drums and trumpets in some ways a young man of as many surprises as you i truly look forward to meeting the third of you this perrin one day rand shook his head so mat had not escaped the pull of taveren to taveren after all or maybe it was the pattern that had caught him and being taveren himself either way he suspected mat was not too happy right that moment mat had not learned the lesson that he had try to run away and the pattern pulled you back often roughly run in the direction the wheel wove you and sometimes you could manage a little control over your life sometimes with luck maybe more than any expected at least in the long haul but he had more urgent concerns than mat or the shaido a glance at the entrance told him the sun was well up though all he saw otherwise was two maidens squatting just outside spears across their knees a night and most of a morning with him unconscious and sammael had either not tried to find him or had failed he was careful to use that name even to himself though another floated in the back of his mind now tel janin aellinsar no history recorded the name no fragment in the library at tar valon moiraine had told him everything the aes sedai knew of the forsaken and it was little more than was told in village tales even asmodean had always called him sammael if for a different reason long before the war of the shadow ended the forsaken had embraced the names men had given them as if symbols of rebirth in the shadow asmodeans own true name joar addam nesossin made the man flinch and he claimed to have forgotten the others in the course of three thousand years perhaps there was no real reason to hide what was going on inside his head maybe it was only an attempt to deny reality to himself but sammael the man would remain and as sammael he would pay in full for every maiden he had killed the maidens rand had not been able to keep safe even as he made the resolution he grimaced he had made a beginning by sending weiramon back to tear the light willing only he and weiramon knew how much of one so far but he could not go chasing off after sammael whatever he wanted or vowed not yet there were matters to be seen to here in cairhien first aviendha might think he did not understand jietoh and perhaps he did not but he understood duty and he had one to cairhien besides there were ways to tail it in with weiramon sitting up and trying not to show the effort of it he covered himself as decently as he could in the blanket and wondered where his clothes were he did not see anything but his boots standing over behind aviendha she probably knew it might have been gaishain who undressed him but it could just as easily have been she i need to go into the city natael have jeadeen saddled and brought up tomorrow perhaps aviendha told him firmly catching asmodeans coatsleeve as he started to rise moiraine sedai said you would need to rest for today aviendha now i dont know why meilan isnt here if hes alive but i mean to find out natael my horse she put on a stubborn face but asmodean jerked his arm free smoothing the wrinkled velvet and said meilan was here and others he was not to be told aviendha began angrily then tightened her mouth before finishing he needs to rest so the wise ones thought they could keep things from him well he was not as weak as they believed he tried to stand holding the blanket close and turned the motion into shifting his position when his legs refused to cooperate maybe he was as weak as they thought but he did not intend to let that stop him i can rest when im dead he said and wished he had not when she flinched as if he had hit her no she would not have flinched at a blow his staying alive was important to her for the aiels sake and a threat there could hurt her more than a fist tell me about meilan natael aviendha kept a sullen silence though if looks had had anything to do with it asmodean would have been struck dumb as well a rider had come from meilan in the night bearing flowery praises and assurances of undying loyalty at dawn meilan himself appeared with the six other high lords of tear who were in the city and a small host of tairen soldiers who fingered sword hilts and gripped lances as though more than half expecting to fight the aiel who had stood silently watching them ride in it came close asmodean said this meilan is not used to being thwarted i think and the others scarcely more so especially the lumpyfaced one torean and simaan that one has eyes as sharp as his nose you know i am used to dangerous company but these men are as dangerous in their way as any i have known aviendha sniffed loudly whatever they are used to they had no choice with sorilea and amys and bair and melaine on one side and sulin with a thousand far dareis mai on the other and there were some stone dogs she conceded and a few water seekers and some red shields if you truly serve the caracarn as you claim jasin natael you should guard his rest as they do it is the dragon reborn i follow young woman the caracarn i leave to you go on natael rand said impatiently earning a sniff for himself she was right concerning the tairens choices though perhaps the maidens and others fingering their veils had concerned them more than the wise ones in any case even aracome a graying slender man with a longsmoldering temper had been near bursting aflame by the time they reined their horses around and gueyam bald as a stone and wide as a blacksmith was whitefaced in rage asmodean was not sure whether it had been the certainty of being overwhelmed that stopped them drawing swords or the realization that if they somehow managed to cut a path to rand he was unlikely to welcome them with his allies blood on their blades meilans eyes were bulging out of his head the man finished but before leaving he shouted out his allegiance and fealty to you perhaps he thought you might hear the others echoed him quickly yet meilan added something that made them stare i make a gift of cairhien to the lord dragon he said then he announced that he would prepare a grand triumph for you when youre ready to enter the city theres an old saying in the two rivers rand said dryly the louder a man tells you hes honest the harder you must hold on to your purse another said the fox often offers to give the duck its pond cairhien was his without gifts from meilan he had no doubts about the mans loyalty it would last just as long as meilan believed he would be destroyed if caught betraying rand if caught that was the hook those seven high lords in cairhien had been the most assiduous in trying to see him dead in tear that was why he had sent them here had he executed every tairen noble who plotted against him there might have been none left at the time handing them anarchy famine and civil war to deal with a thousand miles from tear had seemed a good way to put a crimp in their schemes while doing some good where it needed doing of course he had not even known couladin existed then much less that the man would lead him to cairhien it would be easier if this was a story he thought in stories there were only so many surprises before the hero knew everything he needed he himself never seemed to know a quarter of everything asmodean hesitated that old saying about shouting men might be applied to him too as he was no doubt aware but when rand said no more he added i think he wants to be king of cairhien subject to you of course and preferably with me far away meilan probably expected rand to return to tear and to callandor meilan certainly would never be afraid of too much power of course asmodean sounded even drier than rand had there was another visit between those two a dozen cairhienin lords and ladies without retainers came cloaked and with faces hidden in their hoods despite the heat plainly they knew that the aiel despised cairhienin and just as plainly returned the sentiment yet they were as nervous that meilan might discover they had come as that the aiel might decide to kill them when they saw me asmodean said wryly half seemed ready to kill me for fear i was tairen you have far dareis mai to thank that you still have a bard few as they were the cairhienin had still been harder to turn back than meilan growing sweatier and more whitefaced by the minute but stubbornly demanding to see the lord dragon it was a measure of their desire that when demands failed they finally descended to open begging asmodean might have thought aiel humor odd or harsh but he chuckled over nobles in silk coats and riding dresses trying to pretend he was not there as they knelt to catch at the wise ones woolen skirts sorilea threatened to have them stripped and flogged back to the city his muted laughter turned disbelieving they actually discussed it among themselves had the requirement allowed them to reach you i do believe some would have accepted sorilea should have done it aviendha put in surprisingly agreeable the oathbreakers have no honor at last melaine had the maidens throw them across their horses like bundles and run the animals from camp with the oathbreakers hanging on as they might asmodean nodded but before that two of them did speak to me once they were certain i was not a tairen spy lord dobraine and lady colavaere they clouded everything in so many hints and innuendoes that i cannot be certain but i would not be surprised if they mean to offer you the sun throne they could bandy words with some people i used to be acquainted with rand barked a laugh maybe they will if they can manage the same terms as meilan he had not needed moiraine to tell him that cairhienin played the game of houses in their sleep nor asmodean to tell him they would try it with the forsaken the high lords to the left and the cairhienin to the right one battle done and another of a different sort if no less dangerous beginning in any case i mean the sun throne for someone who has a right to it he ignored the speculation on asmodeans face perhaps the man had tried to help him the night before and perhaps he had not but he did not trust the fellow enough to let him know half of his plans however much asmodeans future might be tied to his his loyalty was all necessity and he was still the same man who had chosen to give his soul to the shadow meilan wants to give me a grand entry when i am ready does he so much the better that i see whats what before he expects me it came to him why aviendha had become so agreeable even helping the talk along as long as he sat here talking he was doing exactly what she wanted are you going to get my horse natael or must i asmodeans bow was deep formal and on the surface at least sincere i serve the lord dragon chapter full aes sedai symbol other battles other weapons frowning after asmodean and wondering how far he trusted the man rand was startled when aviendha threw down her cup splashing wine onto the rugs aiel did not waste anything that could be drunk not only water staring at the wet spot she appeared just as surprised but only for a moment the next instant she had planted fists on hips where she sat and was glaring at him so the caracarnwill enter the city when he can barely sit up i said the caracarnmust be more than other men but i did not know he was more than mortal where are my clothes aviendha you are only flesh my clothes remember your toh rand althor if i can remember jietoh so can you that seemed a strange thing to say the sun would rise at midnight before she forgot the smallest scrap of jietoh if you keep on like this he said with a smile i will begin thinking you care for me he meant it for a jest there were only two ways to deal with her joke or simply override her arguing was fatal and a mild one considering they had spent a night in each others arms but her eyes went wide in outrage and she jerked at the ivory bracelet as if to pull it off and throw it at him the caracarnis so far above other men that he does not need clothes she spat if he wishes to go let him go in his skin must i bring sorilea and bair or perhaps enaila and somara and lamelle he stiffened of all the maidens who treated him as a longlost son of ten she had chosen the three worst lamelle even brought him soup the woman could not cook a lick but she insisted on making him soup you bring whoever you wish he told her in a tight flat voice but i am the caracarn and i amgoing into the city with luck he could find his clothes before she returned somara was nearly as tall as he and at the moment probably stronger the one power certainly would do him no good he could not have embraced saidinif sammael appeared in front of him much less held onto it for a long moment she met his stare then abruptly picked up the leopardworked cup and refilled it from a hammeredsilver pitcher if you can find your clothes and dress yourself without falling down she said calmly you may go but i will accompany you and if i think you are too weak to continue you will return here if somara must carry you in her arms he stared as she stretched out on one elbow carefully arranged her skirts and began sipping at her wine if he mentioned marriage again no doubt she would snap his head off again but in some ways she behaved as if they were married the worst parts of it at least the parts that did not seem a pennyworth different from enaila or lamelle at theirworst muttering to himself he gathered the blanket around him and shuffled past her and the firepit to his boots clean woolen stockings were folded up inside but nothing else he could summon gaishain and have the entire matter spread through the camp not to mention the possibility that the maidens would get into it after all then the question would be whether he was the caracarn who must be obeyed or just rand althor another man entirely in their eyes a rolled rug at the back of the tent caught his eye rugs were always spread out his sword was inside the belt with the dragon buckle wrapped around the scabbard humming to herself eyes lidded aviendha looked half asleep as she watched him search you no longer need that she invested the word with so much disgust that no one would have believed she had given him the sword what do you mean there were only a few small chests in the tent inlaid with motherofpearl or worked in brass or in one case gold leaf the aiel preferred putting things in bundles none held his clothes the goldcovered chest all unfamiliar birds and animals held tightly tied leather sacks and gave off a smell of spices when he raised the lid couladin is dead rand althor startled he stopped and stared at her what are you talking about would lan have told her no one else knew but why no one told me if that is what you are thinking i know you now rand althor i learn you more every day i wasnt thinking any such thing he growled there isnt anything anybody could tell irritably he snatched up the scabbarded sword and carried it awkwardly under his arm as he went on searching aviendha continued sipping wine he thought she might be hiding a smile a fine thing the high lords of tear sweated when rand althor looked at them and the cairhienin might offer him their throne the greatest aiel army the world had ever seen had crossed the dragonwall on the orders of the caracarn the chief of chiefs nations trembled at mention of the dragon reborn nations and if he did not find his clothes he would sit waiting on permission to go outside from a lot of women who thought they knew better about everything than he did he finally found them when he noticed the goldembroidered cuff of a red coatsleeve sticking out from under aviendha she had been sitting on them all along she grunted sourly when he asked her to move but she did it finally as usual she watched him shave and dress channeling the water hot for him without comment and without being asked after the third time he nicked himself and muttered about cold water in truth this time he was bothered as much because she might see his unsteadiness as for any other cause you can become used to anything if it goes on long enough he thought wryly she misunderstood his head shaking elayne will not mind if i look rand althor pausing with the laces of his shirt half done he stared at her do you really believe that of course you belong to her but she cannot own the sight of you laughing silently he went back to the laces it was good to be reminded that her newfound mystery hid ignorance aside from anything else he could not help smiling smugly as he finished dressing buckled on his sword and took up the tasseled seanchan spearhead that last turned the smile a touch toward grimness he had meant it as a reminder that the seanchan were still in the world but it served to recall all the things that he must juggle cairhienin and tairens sammael and the other forsaken the shaido and nations that did not know him yet nations that would have to before tarmon gaidon dealing with aviendha was really quite simple compared with that maidens leaped to their feet when he ducked out of the tent quickly to hide the unsteadiness of his legs he was not sure how far he succeeded aviendha kept to his side as though she not only intended to catch him if he fell over but fully expected him to it did nothing for his mood when sulin in her cap of bandages looked questioningly at her not him her and waited for her nod before ordering the maidens to be ready to move asmodean came riding his mule up the hill leading jeadeen by the reins somehow he had found time to don fresh clothes all dark green silk with spills of white lace of course the gilded harp hung on his back but he had given up wearing the gleemans cloak and he no longer carried the crimson banner with its ancient symbol of the aes sedai that office fell to a cairhienin refugee named pevin an expressionless fellow in a patched farmers coat of rough dark gray wool on a brown mule that should have been put out to grass from pulling a cart some years back a long scar still red ran up the side of his narrow face from jaw to thinning hair pevin had lost his wife and sister to the famine his brother and a son to the civil war he had no idea which houses men had killed them or who they had supported for the sun throne fleeing toward andor had cost him a second son at the hands of andoran soldiers and a second brother to bandits and returning had cost the last son dead on a shaido spear and his daughter as well carried off while pevin was left for dead the man rarely spoke but as near as rand could make out his beliefs had been winnowed down to a bare three the dragon had been reborn the last battle was coming and if he stayed close to rand althor he would see his family avenged before the world was destroyed the world would end surely but it did not matter nothing did so long as he saw that vengeance he bowed silently to rand from his saddle as the mare reached the crest his face was absolutely blank but he held the banner straight and steady climbing onto jeadeen rand pulled aviendha up behind him without letting her use a stirrup just to show her that he could and kicked the dapple into motion before she was settled she flung both arms around his waist grumbling only partly under her breath he caught a few more snippets of her current opinion of rand althor and of the caracarn too she made no move to let go though for which he was grateful not only was it pleasant having her pressed against his back the support was welcome with her halfway to the saddle he had suddenly not been sure whether she was coming up or he down he hoped she had not noticed he hoped that was not why she was holding on to him so tightly the crimson banner with its large blackandwhite disc rippled behind pevin as they zigzagged down the hill and along the shallow valleys as usual the aiel gave little attention to the party as it passed though the banner marked his presence as surely as the encircling escort of several hundred far dareis maieasily keeping pace with jeadeen and the mules they went on about their business among the tents covering the slopes at most glancing up at the sound of hooves it had been startling to hear of nearly twenty thousand prisoners taken from couladins followers until leaving the two rivers he had never really believed so many people could be in one place but seeing them was twice the shock in clusters of forty or fifty they dotted the hillsides like cabbages men and women alike sitting naked in the sun each cluster under the eyes of one gaishainif that certainly no one else paid them much mind though now and again a cadinsorclad figure approached one of the groups and ordered a man or woman off on an errand whoever was called out went at a run unguarded and rand saw several returning to slip back into their places for the rest they sat quietly almost looking bored as if they had no reason to be elsewhere or desire to be either perhaps they would put on white robes just as calmly yet he could not help remembering how easily these same people had violated their own laws and customs already couladin might have begun the violation or ordered it but they had followed and obeyed frowning at the prisoners twenty thousand and more to come he would certainly never trust one to hold to gaishain it took some time before he noticed an oddity among the other aiel maidens and aielmen who carried the spear never wore anything on their heads except the shoufa and never any color that would not fade into rocks and shadows but now he saw men with a narrow scarlet headband perhaps one in four or five had a strip of cloth knotted around his temples with a disc embroidered or painted above the brows two joined teardrops black and white perhaps most strangely of all gaishainwore it too most had their cowls up but every last bareheaded one wore it and algaidsiswaiin their cadinsorsaw and did nothing whether wearing the headband or not gaishainwere never to wear anything that those who could touch weapons did never i do not know aviendha said curtly into his back when he asked what it meant he tried to sit up straighter she really did seem to be holding to him more tightly than necessary after a moment she went on so softly that he had to listen sharp to catch it all bair threatened to strike me if i mentioned it again and sorilea hit me across the shoulders with a stick but i think they are those who claim we are siswaiaman rand opened his mouth to ask the meaning he knew a scant few words of the old tongue no more when interpretation floated to the surface in his mind siswaiaman literally the spear of the dragon sometimes asmodean chuckled it is difficult to see the difference between oneself and ones enemies they want to own the world but it seems you already own a people turning his head rand stared at him until amusement faded and shrugging uncomfortably he let his mule fall back beside pevin and the banner the trouble was that the name did imply more than implied ownership that was out of lews therins memories too it did not seem possible to own people but if it was he did not want to all i want is to use them he thought wryly i see you dont believe it he said over his shoulder none of the maidens had donned the thing aviendha hesitated before saying i do not know what to believe she spoke as quietly as before yet she sounded angry and unsure there are many beliefs and the wise ones are often silent as if they do not know the truth some say that in following you we expiate the sin of our ancestors in in failing the aes sedai the catch in her voice startled him he had never considered that she might be as worried as any other aiel about what he had revealed of their past ashamed might be a better word than worried shame was an important part of jietoh they were ashamed of what they had been followers of the way of the leaf and at the same time ashamed that they had abandoned their pledge to it too many have heard some version of part of the prophecy of rhuidean now she went on in a more controlled tone for all the world as if she had heard a word of that prophecy herself before she began training to become a wise one but it has been twisted they know that you will destroy us her control faltered for the space of one deep breath but many believe that you will kill us all in endless dances of the spear a sacrifice to atone for the sin others believe that the bleakness itself is a testing to wear away all but the hard core before the last battle i have even heard some say that the aiel are now your dream and that when you wake from this life we will be no more a grim set of beliefs that bad enough that he had revealed a past they saw as shaming it was a wonder they had not all left him or gone mad what do the wise ones believe he asked as quietly as she that what must be will be we will save what can be saved rand althor we do not hope to do more we she included herself among the wise ones just as egwene and elayne included themselves among aes sedai well he said lightly i expect sorilea at least believes i should have my ears boxed probably bair does too and certainly melaine among other things she mumbled to his disappointment she pushed away from him although keeping a hold on his coat they believe many things i could wish they did not he grinned in spite of himself so she did not believe he needed his ears boxed that was a pleasant change since waking hadnan kaderes wagons lay a mile or so from his tent circled in a broad depression between two hills where stone dogs kept watch a creamcolored coat straining over his bulk the hatchetnosed darkfriend looked up mopping his face with the inevitable large handkerchief as rand rode past with his banner and loping escort moiraine was there as well examining the wagon where the doorframe terangrealwas lashed under canvas behind the drivers seat she did not even glance around until kadere spoke to her by his gestures he was plainly suggesting that she might want to accompany rand in fact he appeared eager for her to go and small wonder he had to be congratulating himself on keeping his being a darkfriend hidden so long but the more he was in company with an aes sedai the more he was in danger of discovery indeed it was a surprise to rand that the man was still there at least half of the drivers who had entered the waste with him had slipped away since crossing the dragonwall replaced by cairhienin refugees chosen by rand himself to make sure they were not of kaderes sort he expected every morning to find the fellow himself gone too especially since isendres escape the maidens had nearly torn the wagons apart looking for the woman while kadere sweated his way through three handkerchiefs rand would not regret it if kadere managed to sneak off in the night the aiel guards had orders to let him go so long as he did not try to take moiraines precious wagons more obviously every day their loads were a treasure to her and rand would not see her lose them he glanced over his shoulder but asmodean was staring straight ahead ignoring the wagons altogether he claimed to have had no contact with kadere since rand captured him and rand thought it might be true certainly the merchant never left his wagons and was never out of sight of aiel guards except when inside his own wagon opposite the wagons rand half drew rein without thinking surely moiraine would want to accompany him into cairhien she might have crammed his head full but it always seemed there was another piece she wanted to fit in and this once in particular he could do with her presence and advice but she merely looked at him for a long moment then turned back to the wagon frowning he heeled the dapple on as well to remember she had other sheep to shear than he knew about he had become too trusting best to be as wary of her as of asmodean trust no one he thought bleakly for an instant he did not know whether it was his thought or lews therins but in the end he decided it did not matter everybody had their own goals their own desires much the best to trust no one completely except himself yet he wondered with another man oozing through the back of his mind how far could he trust himself vultures filled the sky around cairhien in spiraling layers of black wings on the ground they flapped about among clouds of buzzing flies squawking hoarsely at glossy ravens that tried to usurp their rights to the dead where aiel went across the treeless hills recovering the bodies of their slain the birds lumbered aloft fatly screeching protests then settled again as soon as the living humans were a few paces gone vultures and ravens and flies together could not really have made the sunlight dimmer yet it seemed so stomach twisting trying not to see rand heeled jeadeen faster until aviendha clung to his back once more and the maidens were running no one protested and he did not believe it was only because aiel could maintain that speed for hours even asmodean looked pale around the eyes pevins face never changed though the bright banner whipping above him appeared a mockery in that place what lay ahead was little better rand remembered the foregate as a raucous beehive a tangled warren of streets full of noise and color now it was a still thick band of ashes surrounding the square gray walls of cairhien on three sides charred timbers lay crazily atop stone foundations and here and there a sootblack chimney yet stood sometimes tilting precariously in places a chair lying somehow untouched in the dirt street a hasty bundle dropped by someone fleeing a rag doll emphasized the desolation breezes stirred some of the banners on the citys towers and along the walls a dragon standing out redandgold on white at one place the crescents of tear white on redandgold at another the middle set of the jangai gates stood open three tall square arches in the gray stone guarded by tairen soldiers in rimmed helmets some were mounted but most afoot and the variously colored stripes on their wide sleeves showed they were retainers of several lords whatever was known in the city about the battle being won and aiel allies coming to the rescue the approach of half a thousand far dareis maicreated some little stir hands went uncertainly to sword hilts or spears and long shields or lances some of the soldiers half moved as if to close the gates even while looking to their officer with three white plumes on his helmet who hesitated standing in his stirrups and shading his eyes against the sun to study the crimson banner and more particularly rand abruptly the officer sat down saying something that sent two of the mounted tairens galloping back through the gates almost immediately he was waving the other men aside calling make way for the lord dragon rand althor the light illumine the lord dragon all glory to the dragon reborn the soldiers still appeared uneasy about the maidens but they formed into lines to either side of the gates bowing deeply as rand rode through aviendha sniffed loudly at his back and again when he laughed she did not understand and he had no intention of explaining what amused him was that however hard tairens or cairhienin or anyone else tried to puff up his head he could rely on her and the maidens at least to take the swelling down and egwene and moiraine and elayne and nynaeve for that matter if he ever saw either again come to think of it the lot of them seemed to make that a large part of their lifes work the city beyond the gates stilled his laughter here the streets were paved some broad enough for a dozen or more large wagons abreast all straight as knife cuts and crossing at right angles the hills that rolled outside the walls were here carved and terraced faced with stone they looked as much made by men as the stone buildings with their severe straight lines and sharp angles or the great towers with their unfinished tops surrounded by scaffolding people crowded the streets and the alleys dulleyed and hollowcheeked huddling beneath makeshift leantos or ragged blankets rigged as tents or simply jammed together in the open in the dark clothes favored by cairhienin city dwellers and the bright colors of foregaters and the rough garb of farmers and villagers even the scaffolds were filled on every level to the very top where folk looked tiny for the height only the middle of the streets remained clear as rand and the maidens made their way along and that only for as long as it took the people to surge out around them it was the people who stilled his mirth worn and ragged as they were jammed together like sheep in a toosmall pen they cheered he had no idea how they knew who he was unless perhaps the officers shouts at the gates had been heard but a roar sprang ahead of him as he circled through the streets the maidens forcing a way through the throng the thunder of it overwhelmed any words except for the occasional lord dragon when enough shouted it together but the meaning was clear in men and women holding up children to see him pass in scarves and scraps of cloth waved from every window in people who tried to push past the maidens with outstretched hands they certainly seemed to have no fear of aiel not at the chance to lay a finger on rands boots and their numbers were such the pressure of hundreds shoving them forward that some managed to wriggle through actually a good many touched asmodeans instead he certainly looked a lord in all his dripping lace and perhaps they thought the lord dragon must be an older man than the youth in a red coat but it made no difference whoever managed to put hand to anyones boot or stirrup even pevins wore joy on their faces and mouthed lord dragon into the din even as maidens forced them back with their bucklers between the clamor of acclaim and the riders sent by the officer at the gate it was no surprise when meilan appeared a dozen lesser tairen lords for retinue and fifty defenders of the stone to clear his way laying about them with the butts of their lances grayhaired hard and lean in his fine silk coat with stripes and cuffs of green satin the high lord sat his saddle with the stiffbacked ease of one who had been put on a horse and taught to command it almost as soon as he could walk he ignored the sweat on his face and equally the possibility that his escort might trample someone both were minor annoyances and the sweat likely the greater edorion the pinkcheeked lordling who had come to eianrod was among the others not quite so plump as he had been so his redstriped coat hung on him the only other rand recognized was a broadshouldered fellow in shades of green reimon had liked to play at cards with mat back in the stone as he recalled the others were older men for the most part none displayed any more consideration of the crowd they plowed through than meilan there was not one cairhienin in the lot the maidens let meilan ride through when rand nodded but closed behind him to exclude the rest a fact the high lord did not notice at first when he did his dark eyes smoldered angrily he was often angry meilan was since rand had first come to the stone of tear the noise began to abate with the tairen arrival fading to a dull murmur by the time meilan made a rigid bow to rand from his saddle his gaze flickered to aviendha before he decided to ignore her just as he was trying to ignore the maidens the light illumine you my lord dragon be you well come to cairhien i must apologize for the peasants but i was unaware you meant to enter the city now had i known they would have been cleared i meant to give you a grand entry befitting the dragon reborn i have had one rand said and the other man blinked as you say my lord dragon he went on after a moment his tone making it clear that he did not understand if you will accompany me to the royal palace i have arranged a small greeting small indeed i fear since i had no warning of you yet by this even i will make sure whatever you have arranged now will do rand cut in and received another bow and a thin oily smile for reply the fellow was all subservience now and in an hour he would be talking as to someone too feeblewitted to understand facts held under his nose but beneath it all lay a contempt and hatred that he believed rand did not see although they shone in his eyes contempt because rand was not a lord not truly as meilan saw it by birth and hatred because meilan had had the power of life and death before rand came with few his equal and none his superior to believe that the prophecies of the dragon would be fulfilled someday was one thing to have them fulfilled and his own power diminished by them was quite another there was a moment of confusion before rand made sulin allow the other tairen lords to bring their horses in behind asmodean and pevins banner meilan would have had the defenders clear the way again but rand curtly ordered that they follow behind the maidens the soldiers obeyed faces unchanging beneath the rims of their helmets though their whiteplumed officer shook his head and the high lord put on a condescending smile that smile faded when it became clear that the crowds opened up easily ahead of the maidens that they did not have to club a path through he attributed to the aiel reputation for savagery and frowned when rand made no reply one thing rand made note of now that he had tairens with him the cheers did not rise again the royal palace of cairhien occupied the highest hill of the city exactly in the center square and dark and massive in fact between the palace in all its levels and the stonefaced terracing it was hard to say there was a hill there at all lofty colonnaded walks and tall narrow windows high above the ground did no more to relieve the rigidity than did gray stepped towers precisely placed in concentric squares of increasing height the street became a long broad ramp leading up to tall bronze gates and a huge square courtyard beyond lined with tairen soldiers standing like statues spears slanted more stood on the overlooking stone balconies a ripple of murmurs ran through the ranks at the appearance of the maidens but it was quickly stilled in chanted shouts of all glory to the dragon reborn all glory to the lord dragon and tear all glory to the lord dragon and the high lord meilan from meilans expression you would have thought it all spontaneous darkgarbed servants the first cairhienin rand had seen in the palace rushed out with worked golden bowls and white linen cloths as he swung a leg over the high pommel and slid from his saddle others came to take reins he took the excuse of bathing his face and hands in cool water to leave aviendha to climb down by herself trying to help her down might have ended with them both flat on the paving stones unprompted sulin chose out twenty maidens besides herself to accompany him within on the one hand he was glad she did not want to keep every last spear around him on the other hand he wished enaila lamelle and somara were not among the twenty the considering looks they gave him especially lamelle a lean strongjawed woman with dark red hair nearly twenty years older than he made him grind his teeth while trying to smile reassuringly somehow aviendha must have managed to speak to them and to sulin behind his back i may not be able to do anything about the maidens he thought grimly as he tossed a linen towel back to one of the serving men but burn me if there isntone aiel woman wholl learn im thecaracarn the other high lords greeted him at the foot of the broad gray stairs that led up from the courtyard all in colorful silk coats and satin stripes and silverworked boots it was plain that none were aware meilan had gone to meet him until after the fact potatofaced torean oddly languid for such a lumpy man sniffed anxiously at a scented handkerchief gueyam oiled beard making his head seem even balder clenched fists the size of small hams and glared at meilan even as he bowed to rand simaans sharp nose seemed to quiver in outrage maraconn with blue eyes rare in tear compressed his thin lips until they almost disappeared and while hearnes narrow face was all smiles he tugged unconsciously at one earlobe as he did when furious only bladeslender aracome showed no outward emotion but then he almost always kept his anger well banked until ready to let it burst into flame it was too good an opportunity to miss silently thanking moiraine for her lessons it was easier to trip a fool than to knock him down she said rand clasped toreans pudgy hand warmly and clapped gueyam on the point of a thick shoulder returned hearnes smile with one warm enough for a close companion and nodded silently to aracome with a seemingly significant glance simaan and maraconn he all but ignored after one look as flat and cool as a deep winter pond for each that was all it needed for the moment beyond watching their eyes shift and faces tighten in thought they had played daes daemar the game of houses their entire lives and being among cairhienin who could read volumes in a raised eyebrow or a cough had only heightened their sensitivity each man knew rand had no reason to be friendly toward him but each had to wonder if his own greeting was only to cover something real with someone else simaan and maraconn appeared the most worried yet the others eyed those two perhaps the most suspiciously of all perhaps his coolness had been the true cover or maybe that was what they were meant to think for himself rand thought that moiraine would be proud of him and so would thom merrilin even if none of these seven was actively plotting against him at the moment something he did not think even mat would bet on men in their positions could do much to disrupt his plans without being seen to and they would do so from habit if for no other reason or they would have he had them off balance now if he could keep them that way they would be too busy watching each other and too afraid of being watched in turn to trouble him they might even obey for once without finding a hundred reasons why things should be done differently from what he wanted well that might be asking too much his satisfaction slipped when he saw asmodeans sardonic grin worse was aviendhas wondering stare she had been in the stone of tear she knew who these men were and why he had sent them here i do what i must he thought sourly and wished it did not sound as if he were trying to excuse himself inside he said more sharply than he intended and the seven high lords jumped as if suddenly recalling who and what he was they wanted to crowd around him as he climbed the stairs but except for meilan to show the way the maidens simply made a solid circle around him and the high lords brought up the rear with asmodean and the lesser lords aviendha stuck close by of course and sulin was on his other side somara and lamelle and enaila right behind him they could have reached out and touched his back without stretching he gave aviendha an accusing look and she arched her eyebrows at him so questioningly that he almost believed she had nothing to do with it almost the corridors of the palace were empty except for darkliveried servants who bowed almost chest to knees or curtsied just as deeply as he passed but when he entered the grand hall of the sun he discovered that the cairhienin nobility had not been excluded from the palace entirely the dragon reborn comes intoned a whitehaired man just inside the huge gilded doors worked with the rising sun his red coat embroidered with sixpointed stars in blue a little large on him after his time in cairhien marked him for an upper servant of meilans house all hail the lord dragon rand althor all glory to the lord dragon a quick roar filled the chamber to its anglevaulted ceiling fifty paces up hail the lord dragon rand althor all glory to the lord dragon the light illumine the lord dragon the silence that followed seemed twice as still by comparison between massive square columns of marble thick streaked with blue so deep it was almost black stood more tairens than rand expected ranks of lords and ladies of the land dressed in their finest in peaked velvet hats and coats with puffy striped sleeves in colorful gowns and lace ruffs and closefitting caps intricately embroidered or sewn with pearls or small gems to their rear were the cairhienin darkly garbed except for slashes of color across the breast of gown or kneelength coat the more stripes in house colors the higher the rank of the wearer but men and women with color from neck to waist or lower stood behind tairens clearly of minor houses with yellow embroidery instead of threadofgold and wool instead of silk no few of the cairhienin men had shaved and powdered the front of their heads all of the younger men had the tairens looked expectant if uneasy the cairhienin faces could have been chiseled from ice there was no way to say who had cheered and who not but rand suspected most of those cries had come from the front rows a good many wished to serve you here meilan murmured as they made their way up the bluetiled floor with its great golden mosaic of the rising sun a ripple of silent curtsies and bows followed rand only grunted they wished to serve him he did not need moiraine to know that these lesser nobles hoped to become greater on estates carved out of cairhien no doubt meilan and the other six had already intimated if not promised which lands would be whose at the far end of the grand hall the sun throne itself stood centered atop a wide dais of deep blue marble even here cairhienin restraint held for a throne at any rate the great heavyarmed chair glittered with gilt and golden silk but somehow it seemed to be all plain vertical lines except for the wavyrayed rising sun that would stand above the head of whoever sat on it that was meant to be him rand realized long before reaching the nine steps to the dais aviendha climbed up with him and asmodean as his bard was allowed up as well but sulin quickly arrayed the other maidens around the dais their casually held spears blocking meilan as well as the rest of the high lords frustration painted those tairen faces the hall was so quiet that rand could hear himself breathe this belongs to someone else he said finally besides ive spent too long in the saddle to welcome such a hard seat bring me a comfortable chair there was a moment of shocked silence before a murmur ran through the hall meilan suddenly wore such a look of speculation quickly suppressed that rand nearly laughed very likely asmodean was right about the man asmodean himself was eyeing rand with barely hidden surmise it was some minutes before the fellow in the starembroidered coat ran up panting followed by two darkliveried cairhienin carrying a highbacked chair piled with silkcovered cushions and pointed out where to place it with a great many worried glances at rand vertical lines of gilt ran up the chairs heavy legs and back but it seemed insignificant in front of the sun throne while the three servants were still bowing themselves away bending double on every step rand tossed most of the cushions to one side and sat down gratefully the seanchan spearhead on his knee he was careful not to sigh though aviendha was watching him too carefully for that and the way somara kept glancing from her to him and back confirmed his suspicions but whatever his problems with aviendha and far dareis mai most present awaited his words with equal parts eagerness and trepidation at leasttheyll jump when i say toadhe thought they might not like it but they would do it with moiraines help he had worked out what he must do here some he had known was right even without her suggestions it would have been good to have her there to whisper in his ear if needed instead of aviendha waiting to signal somara but there was no point in waiting surely every tairen and cairhienin noble in the city was in this chamber why do the cairhienin hang back he said loudly and the crowd of nobles shifted exchanging confused glances tairens came to help but that is no reason for cairhienin to hold themselves in the rear here let everyone sort themselves by rank everyone it was difficult to say whether tairens or cairhienin were the most stunned though meilan looked ready to swallow his tongue and the other six not far behind even slowburning aracome went white in the face with much shuffling of boots and twitching aside of skirts with many icy stares on both sides it was done until the front rows were all men and women with stripes across their chests and the second held only a few tairens meilan and his fellows had been joined at the foot of the dais by twice their number of cairhienin lords and ladies most graying and everyone stripes from neck nearly to knees though perhaps joined was not the right word they stood in two groups with a full three paces between and looked away from one another so hard that they might as well have shaken fists and shouted every eye was on rand and if the tairens were in a fury the cairhienin were still ice with only hints of a thaw in the considering way they studied him i have noticed the banners flying above cairhien he went on once the movement stilled it is well that so many of the crescents of tear fly without tairen grain cairhien would have no living to hoist a banner and without tairen swords the people of this city who survived today noble as well as common would be learning to obey the shaido tear has earned her honor that puffed up the tairens of course bringing fierce nods and fiercer smiles though it certainly seemed to confuse the high lords coming on the heels of the other for that matter the cairhienin below the dais were eyeing one another doubtfully but i do not need so many banners for myself let one dragon banner remain on the highest tower of the city so all who approach can see but let the rest be taken down and replaced with the banners of cairhien this is cairhien and the rising sun must and will fly proudly cairhien has her own honor which she shall keep the chamber erupted in a roar so suddenly that maidens hefted their spears a roar that reverberated from wall to wall in an instant sulin was flashing maiden handtalk but already halfraised veils were being let fall the cairhienin nobles were cheering every bit as loudly as the people in the streets had capering and waving their arms like foregaters at festival in the pandemonium it was the tairens turn to exchange silent stares they did not look angry even meilan appeared unsure more than anything else though like torean and the others he watched in amazement the lords and ladies of high rank around him so coldly dignified a moment before now dancing and shouting for the lord dragon rand did not know what any of them read into his words certainly he had expected them to hear more than he said especially the cairhienin and perhaps even that some would hear what he really meant but nothing had prepared him for this display cairhienin reserve was an odd thing he well knew mixed at times with unexpected boldness moiraine had been reticent on the matter for all her insistence on trying to teach him everything the most she had said was that if that reserve broke it could do so to a surprising degree surprising indeed when the cheering finally died down the giving of oaths of fealty began meilan was the first to kneel tightfaced as he pledged under the light and by his hope of salvation and rebirth to serve faithfully and obey it was an old form and rand hoped it might actually constrain some to keep the oath once meilan had kissed the tip of the seanchan spearhead trying to hide a sour grimace by stroking his beard he was replaced by the lady colavaere a more than handsome woman in her middle years with dark ivory lace spilling over the hands she placed between rands and horizontal slashes of color from high lace collar to her knees she gave the oath in a clear firm voice and the musical accent he was used to hearing from moiraine her dark gaze had something of the weighingandmeasuring look of moiraine as well most especially when she eyed aviendha as she curtsied her way back down the steps torean replaced her sweating as he swore and lord dobraine replaced torean deepset eyes probing one of the few older men to have shaved the front of his long mostly gray hair then aracome and rand felt impatience as the procession continued one by one up to kneel before him cairhienin succeeding tairen succeeding cairhienin as he had decreed this was all necessary so moiraine said and so agreed a voice in his head that he knew for lews therins but to him it was part of the delay he must have their loyalty if only on the surface in order to begin making cairhien secure and that beginning at least had to be made before he could move on sammael and that i will do i have too much to do yet to let him go on stabbing at my ankles from the bushes he will find out what it means to rouse the dragon he did not understand why those coming before him began to sweat and lick their lips as they knelt and stammered the words of fealty but then he could not see the cold light burning in his own eyes chapter elephant the price of a ship finishing her morning wash nynaeve toweled herself dry and pulled on a fresh silk shift reluctantly silk was not as cool as linen and even with the sun only just up the heat in the wagon foretold another scorching day besides which the thing was cut so she was half afraid it would fall in a puddle around her ankles if she breathed wrong at least it was not damp with nightsweat as her discarded one was disturbing dreams had racked her sleep dreams of moghedien that woke her bolt upright and those better than the ones she did not wake out of dreams of birgitte shooting arrows at her and notmissing dreams of the prophets followers rioting through the menagerie of being stranded forever in samara because no vessel ever came of reaching salidar and finding elaida in charge or moghedien again there too she had wakened weeping from that one all just worry of course and natural enough three nights camped here without a ship appearing three sweltering days of standing blindfolded against that cursed piece of wall that was enough to put anyone on edge even without worrying whether moghedien was closing in but then just because the woman knew they were with a menagerie did not mean she had to find them in samara there were other traveling menageries in the world besides those gathered here thinking up reasons not to worry was easier than not worrying though but why should i be anxious about egwenedipping a split twig into a small dish of saltandsoda on the washstand she began scrubbing her teeth vigorously egwene had popped up in nearly every dream yammering at her but she could not see how egwene came into them in truth anxiety and lack of sleep were only part of what made her mood vile this morning the others were such minor things but they were realities a pebble in your shoe was small compared to having your head cut off but if the pebble was there and the chopping block might never be it was not possible to avoid her own reflection and her hair hanging loose about her shoulders instead of decently braided brush it how she would the brassy red color never became less loathsome and she knew all too well that a blue dress was laid out on the bed behind her a blue to make even a tinker woman blink and cut as low as the original red gown hanging on a peg that was why she had on this precariously clinging shift one dress like that was not enough not according to valan luca clarine was at work on another pair in a virulent yellow and there was talk of stripes nynaeve did not want to know about stripes at least the man could let me choose the colors she thought working the split twig furiously or clarine but no he had his own ideas and he never asked not valan luca his color choices sometimes made her forget the necklines i ought to throw it in his faceyet she knew she would not birgitte flaunted herself in those dresses without the hint of a blush the woman was certainly nothinglike any of the stories about her not that she was going to wear the fool dress without protest because birgitte did she was not competing with the woman in any way it was just that if you have to do a thing she growled around the twig best you get used it what did you say elayne asked if youre going to talk please take that out of your mouth the noise is disgusting otherwise wiping her chin nynaeve glared over her shoulder elayne was seated on her own narrow bed with her legs drawn up beside her braiding her blackdyed hair she already had on her white breeches all sewn with spangles and a snowy silk blouse with ruffles at the neck that was much too sheer her sequinsplattered white coat lay beside her white she also had two suits of clothes for performing with a third in the making all in white if not exactly plain if you are going to dress in that fashion elayne you should not sit so its indecent the other woman glowered sullenly but she did put her slippered feet on the floor and raised her chin in that haughty way she had i think i may take a walk into the town this morning she said coolly still working at the braid this wagon is confining rinsing her mouth nynaeve spat into the washbowl loudly the wagon certainly did seem smaller by the day maybe they did need to keep out of sight as much as possible it had been her idea one she was coming to regret but this was becoming ridiculous three days shut up with elayne except when they went to perform was beginning to feel like three weeks or three months she had never before realized what an acid tongue elayne had a ship had to come any kind of ship she would give every last coin hidden in the brick stove every last jewel anything for a ship today well that wouldnt attract any attention would it but perhaps you could use the exercise or maybe its just the way those breeches fit your hips blue eyes flared but elaynes chin remained high and her tone cold i dreamed about egwene last night and between going on about rand and cairhien i worry about what is happening there even if you do not in between she said you were turning into a screaming harridan not that i think so necessarily i would have said a fishmonger now you listen to me you illtempered little chit if you dont still glaring nynaeve snapped her mouth shut then drew breath slowly with an effort she forced her voice to be level you dreamed about egwene elayne nodded curtly and she talked of rand and cairhien the younger woman rolled her eyes in exaggerated exasperation and went on with her braid nynaeve made her hand loose its fistful of brassy red hair made herself stop thinking of teaching the daughterheir of bloody andor some simple common courtesy if they did not find a ship soon if you can think of anything except how to show more of your legs than you already are it might interest you to know that she was in my dreams too she said rand won a great victory at cairhien yesterday i may be exposing my legs elayne barked spots of color rising in her cheeks but at least i am not flashing my you dreamed of her too it did not take long to compare notes though elayne continued to show a viperish tongue nynaeve had had a perfectly good reason for screaming at egwene and elayne probably hadbeen dreaming of parading in front of rand in her sequined costume if not less saying so was simple honesty even so it quickly became clear that egwene had said the same things in both their dreams and that left little room for doubt she kept saying she was really there nynaeve muttered but i thought it was just part of the dream egwene had told them often enough that it was possible talking to someone in her dreams but she had never said that she could why should i have believed i mean she said shed finally recognized some spear hes taken to carrying as seanchan work thats preposterous of course elayne arched one eyebrow in an irritating manner just as preposterous as finding cerandin and her sredit there must be other seanchan refugees nynaeve and spears are likely the leastof what they left behind why could the woman not say anything without a barb i notice how well youbelieved elayne threw the finished braid over her shoulder then tossed her head again superciliously for good measure i do hope rand is all right nynaeve sniffed egwene had said he would need days of rest before he was on his feet again but he hadbeen healed the other woman continued no one has ever taught him he mustnt overextend himself doesnt he know the power can kill him if he draws too much or weaves when tired that much is the same for him as for us so she meant to change the subject did she perhaps he doesnt know nynaeve told her sweetly since there isnt a white tower for men that made her think of something else do you think it really was sammael caught with a retort on the tip of her tongue elayne glowered at her sideways then heaved a peevish sigh it hardly matters to us does it what we should be thinking about is using the ring again for more than meeting egwene there is so much to learn the more i do learn the more i know how much i dont know yet no nynaeve did not really expect the other woman to take out the ring terangrealthen and there but she took a reflexive step toward the brick stove no more trips to telaranrhiod for either of us except to meet her elayne went right on without appearing to notice nynaeve could have been talking to herself it isnt as though we need to channel we wont give ourselves away that way she did not look at nynaeve but there was a hint of bite in her voice she maintained that they could use the power if they were careful for all nynaeve knew elayne did just that behind her back ill wager if one of us visited the heart of the stone tonight egwene would be there think if wecould talk to herin her dreams wed not need to worry about encountering moghedien in telaranrhiodany longer you think its easy to learn then nynaeve asked dryly if thats so why hasnt she taught us already why hasnt she done it before this her heart was not in it though she was the one worried about moghedien elayne knew the woman was dangerous but it was like knowing a viper was dangerous elayne knew but nynaeve had been bitten and being able to communicate without entering the world of dreams would be valuable quite aside from avoiding moghedien in any case elayne still was paying no attention to her i wonder why she was so insistent we not tell anyone that makes no sense for a moment she worried her underlip with her teeth there is another reason to talk to her as soon as we can it didnt mean anything to me then but the last time she spoke to me she vanished in midsentence what i remember now is that before she did she suddenly looked surprised and frightened nynaeve took a deep breath and pressed both hands hard against her stomach in a vain effort to quiet sudden flutters she managed to keep her voice flat though moghedien light you do have cheerful thoughts no if moghedien could come into our dreams i think we would know it by now elayne gave a small shiver she did have some idea of how dangerous moghedien was anyway it wasnt that sort of look she was frightened but not enough for that then maybe she isnt in any danger maybe forcing her hands to her sides nynaeve compressed her lips angrily only she was not certain who she was angry with putting the ring away out of sight except for meetings with egwene had been a good idea it had any venture into the world of dreams could have found moghedien and keeping clear of her was better than a good idea she already knew she was overmatched that thought rankled worse every time she had it but it was the simple truth yet now there was the chance that egwene needed help a small chance just because she was properly wary of moghedien did not mean she was underrating the possibility and it might be that rand had one of the forsaken after him in the same personal way that moghedien was after her and elayne what egwene reported both of cairhien and of the mountains smacked of one man daring another to knock a chip off his shoulder not that she could see anything to do about that but egwene sometimes it seemed to nynaeve that she had forgotten why she had left the two rivers in the first place to protect young people from her village who had been caught in aes sedai webs not that much younger than herself only a few years yet the gap seemed wider when you were the village wisdom of course the womens circle in emonds field had certainly chosen a new wisdom by now but that did not make it less her village or them less her people in her heart of hearts it made her no less the wisdom somehow though protecting rand and egwene and mat and perrin from aes sedai had become helping them survive and finally without her quite realizing when or how even that goal had been submerged in other needs entering the white tower to learn how better to pull down moiraine had become a burning desire to learn how to heal even her hatred for aes sedai meddling in peoples lives now coexisted with her desire to become one not that she really wanted to but it was the only way to learn what she wanted to learn everything had become as tangled as one of those aes sedai webs herself included and she did not know how to escape i am still who i always have been iwill help them as much as i can tonight she said aloud i will use the ring sitting down on the bed she began to pull on her stockings stout wool was hardly comfortable in this heat but at least part of her would be decently clothed stout stockings and stout shoes birgitte wore brocaded slippers and gossamer silk stockings that surely looked cool she put the thought firmly out of her head just to see if egwene isin the stone if she isnt i will come back and we wont use the ring again until the next scheduled meeting elayne watched her with an unblinking stare that made her tug at her stockings in increasing discomfort the woman did not say a word but her expressionless gaze implied that nynaeve might be lying to nynaeve it did it did not help that the thought had flittered on the edge of consciousness that she could easily make sure the ring was not touching her skin when she went to sleep there was no real reason to believe that egwene would be waiting in the heart of the stone tonight she had never really considered it the thought had drifted up unbidden but it had been there and made it hard to meet elaynes eyes what if she was afraid of moghedien it was only good sense however it galled to admit it i will do what i must she clamped down firmly on butterflies in the pit of her belly by the time she tossed the shift down over her stockings she was eager to don the blue dress and go out into the heat just to escape elaynes eyes elayne was just finishing helping her with the rows of small buttons up the back and muttering that no one had helped her as if anyone needed help with breeches when the wagon door banged open letting in a wave of hot air startled nynaeve jumped and covered her bosom with both hands before she could stop herself when birgitte climbed in instead of valan luca she tried to pretend she was adjusting the neckline smoothing identical brilliant blue silk over her hip the taller woman pulled her thick black braid over one bare shoulder with a selfpleased grin if you want to draw attention dont bother fiddling it is too obvious just breathe deeply she demonstrated then laughed at nynaeves scowl nynaeve made an effort to keep her temper though why she should she did not know she could hardly imagine that she had felt guilt over what had happened gaidal cain was probably glad to get away from the woman and birgitte got to wear her hair the way she wanted not that that had anything to do with anything i knew someone like you in the two rivers maerion calle knew every merchants guard by his first name and she certainly had no secrets from any of them birgittes smile tightened and i knew a woman like you once mathena looked down her nose at men too and even had a poor fellow executed for coming on her by accident while she swam naked she had never even been kissed until zheres stole one from her youd have thought she had discovered men for the first time she became so besotted zheres had to go live on a mountain to escape her watch out for the first man to kiss you one has to come along sooner or later fists clenching nynaeve took a step toward her or tried to somehow elayne was in between them hands upraised both of you stop it this minute she said eyeing them in turn with equal haughtiness lini always said waiting turns men into bears in a barn and women into cats in a sack but you will stop clawing at one another right now i will not put up with it any longer to nynaeves surprise birgitte actually blushed and mumbled a sullen apology to elayne of course but the apology itself was the surprise birgitte had chosen to stay close to elayne there was no need for her to hide but after three days the heat was apparently affecting her as badly as it did elayne for herself nynaeve gave the daughterheir her frostiest stare she had managed to maintain an even disposition while they waited cooped up together she had but elayne certainly had no room to talk now elayne said still in that icy tone did you have some reason for barging in like a bull or have you simply forgotten how to knock nynaeve opened her mouth to say something about cats just a gentle reminder but birgitte forestalled her if in a tighter voice thom and juilin are back from the town back nynaeve exclaimed and birgitte glanced at her before returning to elayne you did not send them i did not elayne said grimly she was out of the door birgitte at her heels before nynaeve could say a word there was nothing for it but to follow grumbling to herself elayne had better not suddenly think she was the one giving orders nynaeve had still not forgiven her for revealing so much to the men the dry heat seemed even worse outside for all the sun still sat on the canvas wall around the menagerie sweat popped out on her brow before she reached the foot of the ladder but for once she did not grimace the two men sat on threelegged stools beside the cookfire hair wild and coats looking as if they had rolled in the dirt a trickle of red ran from beneath a wadded cloth thom was pressing to his scalp down across a fan of dried blood that covered his cheek and stained one long white mustache a purple lump the size of a hens egg stood out beside juilins eye and he held his thumbthick staff of pale ridged wood in a hand roughly wrapped with a bloody bandage that ridiculous conical red cap sitting on the back of his head appeared to have been trampled from the noises inside the canvas walls the horse handlers were already at work cleaning cages and no doubt cerandin was with her sredit none of the men would go near them but there was relatively little stir around the wagons as yet petra was smoking his longstemmed pipe while he helped clarine prepare their breakfast two of the chavanas were studying some piece of apparatus with muelin the contortionist while the other pair were chatting with two of the six female acrobats luca had hired away from sillia ceranos show they claimed to be sisters named murasaka despite being even more disparate in looks and coloring than the chavanas one of the pair lounging in colorful silk robes with brugh and taeric had blue eyes and almost white hair the other skin nearly as dark as her eyes everyone else was already garbed for the days first performance the men barechested in colorful breeches muelin in gauzy red and a tight matching vest clarine in highnecked green sequins thom and juilin attracted a few looks but fortunately no one thought it necessary to come inquire after their health perhaps it was the hangdog way they sat shoulders slumped eyes on the ground under their boots doubtless they knew they were in for a tonguelashing that would sear their hides nynaeve certainly intended to give them one elayne though gasped at the sight of them and went running to kneel beside thom all the anger of a moment before taking wing what happened oh thom your poor head that must hurt so this is beyond my abilities nynaeve will take you inside and see to it thom you are too old to get yourself into scrapes like this indignantly he fended her off as best he could while holding his compress in place leave over child ive had worse than this falling out of bed will you leave over nynaeve was not about to do any healing despite being angry enough she planted herself in front of juilin fists on her hips and a brooknononsense answermerightnow look on her face what do you mean sneaking off without telling me as well to start letting elayne know that shewas not in charge if you had gotten your throat cut instead of a mouse on your eye how would we know what had happened to you there was no reason for you to go none finding a ship has been seen to juilin glared up at her shoving his cap forward over his forehead seen to is it is that why the three of you have taken to stalking about like he cut off as thom groaned loudly and swayed once the old gleeman had quieted elaynes concerned flutters with protestations that it had just been a momentary pang that he was fit to attend a ball and given juilin a significant glance he obviously hoped the women would not see nynaeve turned a dangerous eye back to the dark tairen to learn just what it was he thought they had been stalking about like a good thing we did go he told her instead in a tight voice samaras a school of silverpike around a chunk of bloody meat there are mobs on every street hunting darkfriends and anybody else who isnt ready to hail the prophet as the one true voice of the dragon reborn it started three hours or so ago near the river thom put in giving in with a sigh to elaynes bathing his face with a damp cloth he appeared to be ignoring her mutters which must have taken some doing since nynaeve could clearly hear foolish old man and need someone to take care of you before you get yourself killed among other things in a tone easily as exasperated as it was fond how it began i dont know i heard aes sedai blamed whitecloaks trollocs everybody but the seanchan and if they knew the name theyd blame them too he winced at elaynes pressure the last hour we were a little too personally involved in getting clear to learn much there are fires birgitte said petra and his wife noticed her pointing and stood to stare worriedly two dark plumes of smoke rose above the canvas wall in the direction of the town juilin rose and looked nynaeve in the eyes with a hard gaze it is time to go maybe well stand out enough for moghedien to find us but i doubt it there are people running every direction they can run in another two hours it wont be a pair of fires it will be fifty and avoiding her wont do much good if were torn to pieces by a mob theyll turn to the shows once they have smashed what can be smashed in the town dont use that name nynaeve said sharply with a frown for elayne that the younger woman did not see letting men know too much was always a mistake the trouble was he was right but letting a man know that too quickly was a mistake too i will consider your suggestion juilin i would hate to run away for no reason and then learn that a ship had come right after we left he stared at her as if she were mad and thom shook his head despite elaynes holding it still for her washing but a figure making his way through the wagons brightened nynaeve perhaps its come already unos painted eyepatch and scarred face his topknot and the sword on his back attracted casual nods from petra and the various chavanas and one shiver from muelin he had made each of the evening visits himself though with nothing to report his presence now had to mean there was something as usual he grinned at birgitte as soon as he saw her and rolled his lone eye in an ostentatious stare at her exposed bosom and as usual she grinned back and eyed him up and down lazily for once though nynaeve did not care how reprehensibly they behaved is there a ship unos grin faded theres a bloo a ship he said grimly if i can get you to it whole we know all about the rioting surely fifteen shienarans can get us safely through you know about the rioting he muttered eyeing thom and juilin do you fla do you know masemas people are fighting whitecloaks in the streets do you know hes bloo hes ordered his people to take amadicia with fire and sword there are thousands across the blo aagh the river already thats as may be nynaeve said firmly but i expect you to do as you said you would you promised to obey me if you recall she put just a slight emphasis on the word and gave elayne a meaning look pretending not to see the woman stood bloodied washcloth in her hand and directed her attention to uno i have always been told that shienarans are among the bravest soldiers in the world that razor edge to her voice had suddenly become regal silk and honey i heard many stories of shienaran bravery when i was a child she rested a hand on thoms shoulder but her eyes remained on uno i remember them still i hope i shall always remember them birgitte stepped closer and began massaging the back of unos neck while she looked him straight in the eye that glaring red eye on his eyepatch did not seem to upset her at all three thousand years guarding the blight she said gently gently it had been two days since she had spoken to nynaeve like that three thousand years and never a step back not paid for ten times over in blood this may not be enkara or the soralle step but i know what you will do what did you do he growled read all the flaming histories of the flaming borderlands immediately he flinched and glanced at nynaeve it had been necessary to tell him she expected absolutely clean language out of him he was not taking it well but there was no other way to prevent backsliding and birgitte should not frown at her can you talk to them he directed at thom and juilin theyre fla fools to try this juilin flung up his hands and thom laughed out loud did you ever know a woman who listened to sense when she didnt want to the gleeman replied he grunted as elayne pulled his compress away and began dabbing at his split scalp with perhaps a bit more force than was strictly necessary uno shook his head well if im to be cozened i suppose ill be cozened but mark this masemas people found the ship riversnake or something like not an hour after it docked but whitecloaks seized it thats what started this little row the bad news is the whitecloaks still hold the docks the worse is masema may have forgotten the ship i went to see him and he wouldnt hear of ships all he can talk about is hanging whitecloaks and making amadicia bend knee to the lord dragon if he has to put the whole land to the torch but he hasnt bothered to tell all of his people theres been fighting near the river and may still be getting you through the riots will be bad enough but if theres a battle at the docks i make no promises and how im to put you on a ship in whitecloak hands i dont begin to know letting out a long breath he scrubbed sweat from his forehead with the back of a scarred hand the strain of so long a speech without cursing was plain on his face nynaeve might have relented on his language at that moment if she had not been too stunned to speak it had to be coincidence light i said anything for a ship but i didnt mean this not thisshe did not know why elayne and birgitte were staring at her with such blank expressions they had known everything she had and neither had brought up this possibility the three men exchanged frowns obviously aware that something was going on and just as obviously unaware what it was for which thank the light much better when they did not know everything it just had to be coincidence in one way she was more than happy to focus on another man making his way through the wagons it gave an excuse to pull her eyes away from elayne and birgitte in another way the sight of galad made her stomach settle right to her shoes he wore plain brown and a flat velvet cap instead of his white cloak and burnished mail but his sword still rested on his hip he had not been to the wagons before and the effect of his face was dramatic muelin took an unconscious step toward him and the two slender acrobats leaned forward mouths open the chavanas were plainly forgotten and scowling for it even clarine smoothed her dress as she watched him until petra took his pipe from his mouth and said something then she went over to where he sat laughing and snuggled his face to her plump bosom but her eyes still followed galad over her husbands head nynaeve was in no mood to be affected by a handsome face her breath hardly quickened at all it was you wasnt it she demanded before he even reached her you seized the riversnake didnt you why riverserpent he corrected eyeing her incredulously you did ask me to secure you passage i didnt ask you to start a riot a riot elayne put in a war an invasion all begun over this vessel galad answered calmly i gave nynaeve my word sister my first duty is to see you safely on your way to caemlyn and nynaeve of course the children would have had to fight this prophet soon or late couldnt you simply have let us know the ship was here nynaeve asked wearily men and their word it was all very admirable sometimes but she should have listened when elayne said he did what he saw as right no matter who was hurt i dont know what the prophet wanted the ship for but i doubt it was so you could take passage downriver nynaeve flinched besides which i paid the captain your passage while he was still unloading his cargo an hour later one of the two men i left to make sure he did not sail without you came to tell me the other man was dead and the prophet had taken the ship i dont understand what you are so upset about you wanted a ship needed a ship and i got you one frowning galad addressed thom and juilin what is the matter with them why do they keep staring at one another women juilin said simply and got slapped on the back of the head by birgitte for his trouble he glared at her horseflies have a nasty bite she grinned and his glower faded into uncertainty as he readjusted his cap we can sit here all day discussing right and wrong thom said dryly or we can take this vessel passage has been paid and theres no getting the price back now nynaeve flinched again however he meant it she knew how she heard it there may be trouble reaching the river galad said i donned this clothing because the children are not popular in samara at the moment but the mobs can set on anyone he eyed thom doubtfully with his white hair and long white mustaches and juilin a little less so even disheveled the tairen looked hard enough to pound posts then turned to uno where is your friend another sword might be useful until we reach my men unos smile was villainous clearly there was no more love between them than at their first meeting hes about and maybe one or two more ill see them to the ship if your whitecloaks can hold on to it or if they cant elayne opened her mouth but nynaeve spoke up quickly thats enough both of you elayne would just have tried honeyed words again they might have worked but she wanted to lash out at something anything we need to move quickly she should have considered when she flung two madmen at the same target what might happen if they both hit at once uno gather the rest of your men as fast as you can he tried to tell her they were already waiting on the other side of the menagerie but she plowed on they weremadmen bothof them allmen were galad you rouse and rise lucas shout cut into her words as he trotted between the wagons limping and with a bruise discoloring the side of his face his scarlet cape was soiled and torn it seemed thom and juilin were not the only ones to have entered the town brugh go tell the horse handlers to hitch the teams well have to abandon the canvas he grimaced at the words but i mean to be on the road in under an hour andaya kuan pull your sisters out wake anybody still asleep and if theyre washing tell them to dress dirty or come naked hurry unless youre ready to proclaim the prophet and march to amadicia chin akimas lost his head already along with half his performers and sillia cerano and a dozen of hers were flogged for being too slow move by that time everybody except those around nynaeves wagon were at the run lucas limp slowed as he approached eyeing galad warily and uno for that matter though he had seen the oneeyed man twice before nana i want to talk to you he said quietly alone we will not be going with you master luca she told him alone he said and seized her arm hauling her away she looked back to tell the others not to interfere and found there was no need elayne and birgitte were hurrying off toward the canvas wall that encompassed the menagerie and except for a few glances at her and luca the four men were engrossed in conversation she sniffed loudly fine men they were to watch a woman manhandled and do nothing jerking her arm free she strode along beside luca silk skirts swishing her displeasure i suppose you want your money now that we are going well you shall have it one hundred gold marks though i think you should allow something for the wagon and horses were leaving behind and for what weve brought in we have certainly increased the number of your patrons morelin and juilin with their highwalking me with the arrows thom do you think i want the gold woman he demanded rounding on her if i did id have asked for it the day we crossed the river have i asked did you ever think why not in spite of herself she took a step back crossing her arms beneath her breasts sternly and immediately wished she had not that stance more than emphasized what she was exposing stubbornness kept her arms where they were she was not about to let him think she was flustered especially since she was but surprisingly his eyes remained on hers maybe he was ill he had never avoided looking at her bosom before and if valan luca was not interested in bosoms orgold if not about the gold then why do you want to talk to me all the way back here from the town he said slowly following her i kept thinking that now you would finally go she refused to back away again even when he was standing over her and staring down intently at least he was still looking at her face i dont know what you are running from nana sometimes i almost believe your story morelin certainly has a noblewomans manner about her at least but you were never a ladys maid the last few days ive half expected to find the pair of you rolling on the ground tearing one anothers hair and maybe maerion in the pile he must have seen something on her face because he cleared his throat and hurried on the point is i can find someone else for maerion to shoot at you do scream so beautifully anyone would think you were truly terrified but he cleared his throat again even more hastily and drew back what i am trying to say is that i want you to stay theres a wide world out there a thousand towns waiting for a show like mine and whatever is chasing you will never find you with me a few of akimas people and some of silicas who havent been marched off across the river theyre joining me valan lucas show will be the greatest the world has ever seen stay why should i stay i told you from the first we only wanted to reach ghealdan and nothing has changed why why to have my children of course he took one of her hands in both of his nana your eyes drink my soul your lips inflame my heart your shoulders make my pulse race your she cut in hurriedly you want to marry me she said incredulously marry he blinked well uh yes yes of course his voice picked up strength again and he pressed her fingers to his lips we will be wed at the first town where i can arrange it ive never asked another woman to marry me i can quite believe it she said faintly it took some effort to pull her hand free i am sensible of the honor master luca but valan nana valan but i must decline i am betrothed to another well she was in a way lan mandragoran might think his signet ring just a gift but she saw it differently and i am going should bundle you up and carry you with me dirt and rips somewhat spoiled the grandiloquent flourish of his cape as he drew himself up with time you would forget the fellow you try it and ill have uno make you wish you had been sliced for sausage that barely deflated the fool man at all she drove a finger hard against his chest you do not know me valan luca you dont know anything about me my enemies the ones you dismiss so easily would make you take off your skin and dance in your bones and you would be grateful if that was all they did now i am going and i dont have time to listen to your drivel no dont say any more my mind is set and you will not change it so you might as well stop blathering luca sighed heavily you are the only woman for me nana let other men choose boring flutterers with their shy sighs a man would know he had to walk through fire and tame a lioness with his bare hands every time he approached you every day an adventure and every night his smile almost earned him boxed ears i will find you again nana and you will choose me i know it in here thumping his chest dramatically he gave his cape an even more pretentious swirl and you know it too my dearest nana in your fair heart you do nynaeve did not know whether to shake her head or gape men weremad allof them he insisted on escorting her back to her wagon holding her arm as if they were at a ball stalking though the turmoil of horse handlers rushing to hitch teams the din of men shouting horses whickering bears growling leopards coughing elayne found herself muttering under her breath to match any of the animals nynaeve had no room to talk about her showing her legs she had seen the way the woman stood up straighter when valan luca appeared and breathed deeper too for galad as well for that matter it was not as if she enjoyedwearing breeches they werecomfortable true and cooler than skirts she could see why min chose to wear mens clothes almost there was the problem of getting past the feeling that the coat was really a dress that barely covered your hips she had just managed that so far not that she intended to let nynaeve know her and her viperish tongue the woman should have realized galad would ignore the cost of keeping his promise it was not as if elayne had not told her about him often enough and involving the prophet nynaeve just acted without thinking about what she was doing did you say something birgitte asked she had gathered her skirts over one arm to keep up unashamedly baring her legs from blue brocaded slippers to well above her knees and those sheer silk stockings did not hide as much as breeches elayne stopped dead what do you think of how i am dressed it allows freedom of movement the other woman said judiciously elayne nodded of course its good that your bottom isnt too big as tight as those striding on furiously elayne tugged the coat down with sharp yanks nynaeves tongue had nothing on birgittes she really should have required some oath of obedience or at least some show of proper respect she would have to remember that once it came time to bond rand when birgitte caught up to her wearing a sour expression as if shewere driven almost beyond endurance neither of them spoke dressed in green sequins the palehaired seanchan woman was using her goad to guide the huge bull sreditas his head pushed the heavy wagon holding the blackmaned lions cage a horse handler in a shabby leather vest held the wagon tongue steering the wagon around to where its horses could be hitched more easily the lion stalked back and forth lashing his tail and now and then giving a hoarse cough that sounded like the beginning of a roar cerandin elayne said i must speak to you in a moment morelin fixed on the tusked gray animal as she was her quick slurred way of speaking made her nearly unintelligible now cerandin we have little time but the woman did not halt the sreditand turn until the horse handler called out that the wagon was in position then she said impatiently what do you need morelin i have much to do yet and i would like to change this dress is not for traveling the animal stood waiting patiently behind her elaynes mouth tightened slightly we are leaving cerandin yes i know the riots such things should not be allowed if this prophet thinks to harm us he will learn what mer and sanit can do she twisted to scratch mers wrinkled shoulder with her goad and he touched her shoulder with his long nose a trunk cerandin called it some prefer loparor grolmfor battle but sreditproperly used be quiet and listen elayne said firmly it was an effort to maintain her dignity with the seanchan woman being obtuse and birgitte standing aside with her arms folded she was certain birgitte was just waiting to say something else cutting i do not mean the show i mean myself and nana and you we are taking ship this morning in a few hours we will be beyond the prophets reach forever cerandin shook her head slowly few river craft can carry sredit morelin even if youve found one that can what would they do what would i do i do not think i can earn as much by myself as i can with master luca not even with you highwalking and maerion shooting her bow and i suppose thom would juggle no no it is better if we all remain with the show the sreditwill have to be left behind elayne admitted but i am sure that master luca will take care of them we will not be performing cerandin theres no more need for that where i am going there are those who would like to learn about she was conscious of the horse handler a lanky fellow with an incongruously bulbous nose standing close enough to listen about where you came from much more than youve told us already no not listening leering by turns at birgittes bosom and at herlegs she looked at him until his insolent grin turned sickly and he scuttled back to his duties cerandin was shaking her head again i am to leave mer and sanit and nerin to be cared for by men who are afraid to come near them no morelin we will stay with master luca you too it is much better remember how bedraggled you were the day you came you do not want to return to that drawing a deep breath elayne stepped closer no one but birgitte was close enough to overhear but she did not want to take foolish chances cerandin my true name is elayne of house trakand daughterheir of andor one day i will be queen of andor based on the womans behavior the first day and even more on what she had told them of seanchan that should have been enough to quell any resistance instead cerandin looked her straight in the eye you claimed to be a lady the day you came but pursing her lips she eyed elaynes breeches you are a very good highwalker morelin with practice you may be good enough to perform before the empress one day everyone has a place and everyone belongs in their place for a moment elaynes mouth worked soundlessly cerandin did not believe her i have wasted quite enough time cerandin she reached for the womans arm to haul her along bodily if necessary but cerandin caught her hand twisted and with a wideeyed yelp elayne found herself on tiptoe wondering whether her wrist would break before her arm came out of her shoulder birgitte just stood there arms folded under her breasts and had the nerve to raise an eyebrow questioningly elayne gritted her teeth she wouldnot ask for help release me cerandin she demanded wishing she did not sound quite so breathy i said release me cerandin did after a moment and stepped back warily you are a friend morelin and always will be you could be a lady one day you have the manner and if you attract a lord he may take you for one of his asa asasometimes become wives go with the light morelin i must finish my work she held out the goad for mer to curl his trunk around and the big animal let her lead him ponderously away cerandin elayne said sharply cerandin the palehaired woman did not look back elayne glared at birgitte a great lot of help you were she growled and stalked off before the other woman could reply birgitte caught her up and fell in at her side from what i hear and what ive seen you have spent considerable time teaching the woman she has a backbone did you expect me to help you take it away from her again i was not trying to do any such thing elayne muttered i was trying to take care of her she is a long way from home a stranger wherever she goes and there are some who would not treat her kindly if they learned where she came from she seems well able to take care of herself birgitte said dryly but then perhaps you taught her that too perhaps she was helpless before you found her elaynes stare seemed to slide off her like ice sliding down warm steel you just stood and watched her you are supposed to be my she glanced around it was only a glance but several of the horse handlers ducked their heads away my warder you are supposed to help me defend myself when i cannot channel birgitte looked around too but unfortunately there was no one close enough to make her hold her tongue i will defend you when you are in danger but if the danger is only of being turned over someones knee because youve behaved like a spoiled child i will have to decide whether its better to let you learn a lesson that might save you the same or worse another time telling her you were heir to a throne really if you are going to be aes sedai you had better start practicing how to bend the truth not break it into shards elayne gaped it was not until she stumbled over her own feet that she managed to say but i am if you say so birgitte said rolling her eyes at the spangled breeches elayne could not help herself nynaeve wielding her tongue like a needle cerandin stubborn as two mules and now this she threw back her head and screamed with frustration when the sound died it seemed as if the animals had quieted horse handlers stood about staring at her coolly she ignored them nothing could worm its way under her skin now she was as calm as ice perfectly in control of herself was that a cry for help birgitte said tilting her head or are you hungry i suppose i could find a wet nurse in elayne strode away with a snarl that would have done any of the leopards proud chapter sunburst leavetakings once she was back in the wagon nynaeve changed into a decent dress with a few exasperated mutters for having to undo one set of buttons and do up another by herself the plain gray wool fine and well cut yet hardly elaborate would pass without comment almost anywhere but it was decidedly warmer still it felt good to be decently garbed again and somehow odd as if she were wearing too many clothes it must be the heat quickly she knelt in front of the small brick stove with its tin chimney and opened the iron door on their valuables the twisted stone ring was fast nestled into her belt pouch beside lans heavy signet ring and her gold great serpent the small gilded coffer containing the gems amathera had given her went into the leather scrip with the pouches of herbs taken from ronde macura in mardecin and the small mortar and pestle for preparing them she fingered through the latter just to remind herself what each contained from healall to that dreadful forkroot the lettersofrights went in as well and three of the six purses none quite as fat as it had been after paying the menageries way to ghealdan luca might not be interested in his hundred marks but he had had no qualms about collecting his expenses one of the letters authorizing the bearer to do whatever she wished in the name of the amyrlin seat joined the rings no more than vague rumors of some sort of trouble in tar valon had reached samara she might find a use for it even with siuan sanches signature the dark wooden box she left where it sat next to three of the purses as well as the rough jute bag containing the adam that she certainly had no wish to touch and the silver arrow elayne had found the night of the calamitous encounter with moghedien for a moment she frowned at the arrow contemplating moghedien it wasbest to do whatever was necessary to avoid her it was i bested her onceand had been hung up like a sausage in the kitchen the second time if not for birgitte she made her own choice the woman had said so and it was true i could defeat her again i could but if i failed if she failed she was only trying to avoid the washleather purse stuffed right to the back and she knew it yet there was not a hairs difference for ugliness between the purse and the thought of losing to moghedien again drawing a deep breath she gingerly reached in and took it up by the drawstrings and knew she had been wrong evil seemed to bathe her hand stronger than ever as if the dark one really was trying to break through the cuendillarseal inside better to dwell all day on defeat by moghedien there was a worldof difference between thought and reality it had to be imagination there had been no such feeling in tanchico but she wished she could let elayne carry that too or leave it there stop being foolish she told herself firmly it holds the dark ones prison shut you are just letting your fancies run wild but she still dropped it like a weekdead rat onto the red dress luca had had made then wrapped and tied the thing securely with more than a little haste the silken parcel went into the middle of a bundle of clothes she was taking with her inside her good gray traveling cloak a few inches distance was enough to take away the sensation of dark bleakness but she still wanted to wash her hand if only she did not know it was there she wasbeing foolish elayne would laugh at her and birgitte as well and rightly actually the clothes she wanted to keep made two packages and she regretted every stitch she had to leave behind even the lowcut blue silk not that she ever wanted to wear anything like it again she did not intend to touchthe red dress certainly until she handed the intact packet to an aes sedai in salidar but she could not help totting up the cost of clothes horses and wagons abandoned since leaving tanchico and the coach and the barrels of dye even elayne would have winced if she had ever thought of it that young woman believed there would always be coin when she reached into her purse she was still making the second bundle when elayne returned and silently changed into a blue silk dress silently except for mutters when she had to double her arms behind her to fasten the buttons nynaeve would have helped had she been asked but since she was not she examined the other woman for bruises while she changed she thought she had heard a scream only minutes before elayne arrived and if she and birgitte had actually come to blows she was not certain she was glad to find none a riverboat would be just as confining as this wagon in its own way and less than pleasant if the two women were at one anothers throats but then again it might have helped had they worked off some of their beastly tempers elayne said not a word while she gathered her own belongings not even when nynaeve asked quite amiably where she had gone haring off to as if she had sat on a cockleburr that got only a raised chin and a chilly stare as though the girl thought she was already on her mothers throne sometimes elayne was even more silent in a way that said far more than words could finding three purses remaining she paused before taking them and the temperature in the wagon lowered considerably though the purses were only her share nynaeve was tired of the carping over how she doled out coins let the woman watch them dribble away and realize there might be no more for some time when elayne realized the ring was gone though and the dark box still sitting there elayne hefted the box and opened the lid pursing her lips as she studied the contents the other two terangrealthey had carried all the way from tear a small iron disc worked on both sides with a tight spiral and a narrow plaque five inches long seemingly amber yet harder than steel and with a sleeping woman somehow carved inside it either could be used to enter telaranrhiod though not so easily or so well as could the ring to use either it was necessary to channel spirit the sole one of the five powers that could be channeled in sleep it had seemed only right to nynaeve leaving them for elayne since she was taking charge of the ring closing the box with a sharp click elayne stared at her absolutely expressionless then stuffed it into one of her bundles alongside the silver arrow her silence was thunderous elayne also made two bundles but hers were larger she left nothing out except the spangled coats and breeches nynaeve refrained from suggesting that she had overlooked them she should have with the sulking that was going on but sheknew how to promote harmony she limited herself to one sniff when elayne ostentatiously added the adamto her things though from the look she got in return you would have thought she had made her objections known at length by the time they left the wagon the quiet could have been chipped and used to chill wine outside the men were ready and muttering to themselves and throwing impatient looks at her and elayne it was hardly fair galad and uno had nothing to prepare thoms flute and harp hung on his back in leather cases along with a small bundle and juilin notched swordbreaker at his belt and leaning on his headhigh staff wore an even smaller bundle neatly tied men were willing to wear the same clothes until they rotted off of course birgitte was ready too bow in hand quiver at her hip and a cloakwrapped bundle at her feet not much smaller than one of elaynes nynaeve would not have put it past birgitte to have lucas dresses in there but it was what she wore that gave a moments pause her divided skirts could have been the voluminous trousers she had worn in telaranrhiod except for being more gold than yellow and not being gathered at the ankles the short blue coat was identical in cut the mystery of where the garments had come from was solved when clarine scurried up chattering that she had taken too long with two more of the skirts and another coat to fold into birgittes bundle she stayed to say how sorry she was that they were leaving the show and she was not the only one to take a few moments from the bustle of hitching horses and packing up aludra came with wishes for a safe journey wherever they were going in her taraboner accents and with two more boxes of her firesticks nynaeve tucked them into her scrip with a sigh she had made a point of leaving the others behind and elayne had pushed them to the back of the shelf behind a sack of beans when she thought nynaeve was not looking petra offered to help escort them to the river pretending not to see his wifes eyes tighten with concern and so did the chavanas and kin and bari the jugglers though when nynaeve told them there was no need and petra frowned they could barely hide their relief she had to speak quickly for galad and the other men looked on the point of accepting surprisingly even latelle appeared briefly with words of regret smiles and eyes that said she would carry their bundles if it saw them gone any sooner nynaeve was surprised cerandin did not come though in a way she was just as glad elayne might get on famously with the woman but since the incident where she had been assaulted nynaeve had felt a tension whenever she was around her perhaps the more because cerandin gave no outward sign of the same luca himself was the last thrusting a handful of pitiful droughtdwarfed wildflowers at nynaeve the light alone knew where he had found them with protestations of undying love extravagant praises for her beauty and dramatic vows to find her again if he had to travel to the corners of the world she was not sure which made her cheeks grow hotter but her frosty stare wiped the grin from juilins face and astonishment from unos whatever thom and galad thought they had enough sense to keep their features smooth she could not make herself look at birgitte or elayne the worst was that she had to stand there and listen wilted flowers drooping over her hand her face growing redder trying to send him away with a flea in his ear would likely only have sparked him to greater efforts and given the others more fodder than they already had she very nearly heaved a sigh of relief when the idiot man finally bowed himself away in elaborate flourishes of his cape she held on to the flowers striding ahead of the others so she did not have to see their faces and angrily shoving bundles back into place when they shifted until she was out of sight of the wagons around the canvas wall then she threw the bedraggled blossoms down so violently that ragan and the rest of the roughclad shienarans squatting halfway across the meadow to the road exchanged glances each had a blanketwrapped bundle on his back small of course alongside his sword but they were hung about with enough water bottles to last for days and every third man had a pot or kettle dangling somewhere fine if there was cooking to be done let them do it not waiting for them to decide whether she was safe to approach she stalked out to the dirt road alone valan luca was the source of her fury humiliating her that way she should have thumped his head and the dark one take what anyone thought but its target was lan mandragoran lan had never given her flowers not that that was of any account he had expressed his feelings in words deeper and more heartfelt than valan luca could ever manage she had meant every word to luca but if lan said he was going to carry you off threats would never stop him channeling would not stop him unless you managed it before he turned your brain and your knees to jelly with kisses still flowers would have been nice nicer than another explanation of why their love could never be certainly men and their word men and their honor wedded to death was he him and his personal war with the shadow he was going to live he was going to wed her and if he thought differently on either point she intended to set him straight there was only the small matter of his bond to moiraine to deal with she could have screamed in frustration she was a hundred paces down the road before the others caught up glancing at her sideways elayne only sniffed loudly while struggling to readjust the two large bundles on her back she wouldhave to take everything but birgitte strode along pretending to speak under her breath yet quite audibly muttering about women who rushed off like carpan girls leaping from a river cliff nynaeve ignored them equally the men spread out galad in the lead flanked by thom and juilin the shienarans in a long file to either side wary eyes searching every withered bush and fold in the ground walking in the middle of them nynaeve felt foolish you would have thought they expected an army to rise up out of the ground you would have thought she and the other two women were helpless especially when the shienarans silently followed unos lead and unlimbered their swords why there was not a human being in sight even the shanty villages appeared abandoned galads blade remained in its scabbard but juilin began hefting his thumbthick staff instead of using it for a walking stick and knives appeared in thoms hands and vanished as if he was unconscious of what he was doing even birgitte fitted an arrow to her bow nynaeve shook her head it would take a brave mob to come in eyeshot of this lot then they reached samara and she began to wish she had accepted petras offer and the chavanas and anyone elses she could have found the gates stood open and unguarded and six black columns of smoke rose above the gray town walls the streets beyond were still shattered glass from broken windows crunched underfoot that was the only sound except for a distant buzz like monstrous swarms of wasps scattered through the city furniture and bits of clothing littered the paving stones pots and pottery things dragged from shops and homes whether by looters or by people fleeing there was no way to tell not only property had been destroyed in one place a corpse in a fine green silk coat hung half out of a window limp and unmoving in another a fellow garbed in rags dangled by his neck from the eaves of a tinsmiths shop sometimes down a side street or alley she caught a glimpse of what might have been discarded bundles of old clothes she knew they were not in one doorway where the splintered door hung crazily by a single hinge small flames licked up around a wooden staircase smoke just beginning to trickle out the street might be empty now but whoever had done that was not long gone head swiveling trying to watch every way at once nynaeve took a firm hold on her belt knife sometimes the angry buzz grew louder a wordless guttural roar of rage that seemed no more than one street over and sometimes it faded to a dull murmur yet when trouble came it came suddenly and silently the mass of men stalked around the next corner but one like a pack of hunting wolves jamming the street from side to side soundless but for the thud of boots the sight of nynaeve and the others was a torch tossed into a haystack there was no hesitation as one they surged forward howling and rabid waving pitchforks and swords axes and clubs anything that could be taken to hand for a weapon enough anger still clung in nynaeve for her to embrace saidar and she did it without thinking even before she saw the glow spring up around elayne there were a dozen ways she could halt this mob by herself a dozen more she could destroy it if she chose if not for the possibility of moghedien she was not sure whether the same thought held elayne she only knew that she hung on to her anger and the true source with equal fervor and it was moghedien more than the onrushing rabble that made it hard she hung on to them and knew she dared do nothing not if there was any other chance almost she wished she could cut the flows being woven by elayne there had to be some other chance one man a tall fellow in a ragged red coat that had belonged to someone else once by its greenandgold embroidery ran out in front of the others on long legs shaking a woodaxe overhead birgittes arrow took him through one eye he went down in a sprawling heap and was trampled by the others all contorted faces and wordless screams nothing was going to stop them with a wail half outrage half pure fear nynaeve jerked her belt knife free and at the same time prepared to channel like a wave striking boulders the charge splintered on shienaran steel the topknotted men not much less ragged than those they fought worked their twohanded swords methodically craftsmen at their craft and the onslaught went no farther than their thin line men fell screaming for the prophet but more scrambled over them juilin the fool was in that row flattopped conical cap perched on his dark head thin staff a blur that deflected stabs broke arms and cracked skulls thom worked behind the line his limp strong as he darted from place to place to confront the few who managed to wriggle through only a dagger in either hand yet even swordsmen died on those blades the gleemans leathery face was grim but when one bulky fellow in a blacksmiths leather vest nearly reached elayne with his pitchfork thom snarled as viciously as any in the mob and very nearly cut the mans head off while slitting his throat through it all birgitte calmly shifted from spot to spot every arrow finding an eye yet if they held the mob it was galad who broke them he faced their charge as though awaiting the next dance at a ball arms folded and unconcerned not even bothering to bare his blade until they were almost on top of him then he did dance all his grace turned in an instant to fluid death he did not stand against them he carved a path into their heart a clear swath as wide as his swords reach sometimes five or six men closed in around him with swords and axes and table legs for clubs but only for the brief time it took them to die in the end all their rage all their thirst for blood could not face him it was from him that the first ran flinging away weapons and when the rest fled they divided around him as they vanished back the way they had come he stood twenty paces from anyone else alone among the dead and the groans of the dying nynaeve shivered as he bent to clean his blade on a corpses coat he was graceful even doing that he was beautiful even doing that she thought she might sick up she had no idea how long it had taken some of the shienarans were leaning on their swords panting and eyeing galad with a good deal of respect thom was bent over with one hand on his knee trying to fend elayne off with the other while telling her he just had to catch his breath minutes an hour it could have been either for once looking at the injured men lying on the pavement here and there the one crawling away she felt no desire to heal no pity at all not far off was a pitchfork where someone had flung it a mans severed head was impaled on one tine a womans on another all she felt was queasy and grateful that it was not her head that and cold thank you she said aloud to no one in particular and to everyone thank you very much the words grated a little she did not like confessing something she had not been able to do for herself but they were fervent then birgitte nodded in acknowledgment and nynaeve had to struggle with herself but the woman had done as much as anyone considerably more than she herself she thrust her belt knife back into its sheath you shot very well with a wry grin as if she knew exactly how difficult those words had been birgitte set about recovering her arrows nynaeve shuddered and tried not to watch most of the shienarans had wounds and thom and juilin both wore their own blood in places miraculously galad was untouched or perhaps not so miraculously remembering how he had handled his sword but manlike to the bitter end every one of them insisted that his hurts were not serious even uno said they had to keep moving him with one arm hanging and a gash down the side of his face whose scar would nearly mirror the first if it was not healed soon in truth she was not reluctant to go despite telling herself that she should be seeing to injuries elayne put a supporting arm around thom he responded by refusing to lean on her and beginning to recite a tale in high chant so flowery it was difficult to recognize the story of kirukan the beautiful soldier queen of the trolloc wars she had a temper like a boar caught in briars at the best birgitte said softly to no one in particular not at all like anyone close by nynaeve ground her teeth catch her complimenting the woman again no matter what she did come to think of it any man in the two rivers could have shot as well at that range any boy rumbles followed them distant roars from other streets and often she had the feeling of eyes watching from one of the vacant glassless windows but word must have spread or else the watchers had seen what happened because they saw no one else living until suddenly two dozen whitecloaks stepped into the street in front of them half with drawn bows the rest with bared blades the shienarans blades were up in a heartbeat quick words between galad and a fellow with a grizzled face beneath his conical helmet passed them through though the man did eye the shienarans doubtfully and thom and juilin and for that matter birgitte it was enough to rankle nynaeve all very well for elayne to march along with her chin raised ignoring the whitecloaks as though they were servants but nynaeve did not like being taken for granted the river was not far beyond a few small stone warehouses under slate roofs the towns three stone docks barely reached water over the dried mud a fat vessel with two masts sat low at the end of one nynaeve hoped there would be no problem obtaining separate cabins she hoped it would not heave too badly a small crowd huddled twenty paces from the dock under the watchful eyes of four whitecloaked guards nearly a dozen men mainly old and all ragged and bruised and twice as many women most with two or three children clinging to them some with a babe in arms beside two more whitecloaks stood right at the dock the children hid their faces in their mothers skirts but the adults gazed yearningly at the ship the sight wrenched at nynaeves heart she remembered the same gazes many more of them in tanchico people desperately hoping for a way to safety she had not been able to do anything for those before she could do anything for these galad had seized her and elayne by the arm and hustled them along the dock and down an unsteady gangplank six more sternfaced men in white cloaks and burnished mail stood on the deck watching a cluster of barefoot and mostly barechested men squatting in the bluff bows it was close whether the captain at the foot of the plank gazed at the whitecloaks more sourly or at the motley party that trooped onto his ship agni neres was a tall bony man in a dark coat with ears that stood out and a dour cast to his narrow face he paid no mind to the sweat rolling down his cheeks you paid me passage for two women i suppose you want me to take the other wench and the men for free birgitte eyed him dangerously but he seemed not to see you shall have your fare money my good captain elayne told him coolly as long as its reasonable nynaeve said and ignored elaynes sharp glance neres mouth thinned though it hardly seemed possible and he addressed galad again then if youll get your men off my craft ill sail i like being here in daylight now less than ever as soon as you take your otherpassengers on nynaeve said nodding to the people huddled ashore neres looked for galad only to find that he had moved away to speak with the other whitecloaks then eyed the folk ashore and spoke at the air above nynaeves head any who can pay not many in that lot look like they can and i could not take the lot if they could she raised herself on tiptoe so he could not possibly miss her smile it snapped his chin down into his collar every last one of them captain else ill shave your ears off for you the mans mouth opened angrily then abruptly his eyes widened staring past her all right he said quickly but i expect some sort of payment mind i give alms on firstday and thats long past heels settling back to the deck she looked over her shoulder suspiciously thom juilin and uno stood there blandly watching her and neres as blandly as they could manage with unos features and blood all over their faces far too blandly with a sharp sniff she said i will see them all aboard before anybody touches a rope and went in search of galad she supposed he deserved some thanks he had thought what he was doing was the right thing that was the trouble with the best of men they always thought they were doing the right thing still whatever the three had done they hadsaved argument she found him with elayne that handsome face painted with frustration he brightened at the sight of her nynaeve ive paid your way as far as boannda thats only halfway to altara where the boern runs into the eldar but i could not afford to pay further captain neres took every copper in my purse and i had to borrow besides the fellow charges ten prices im afraid you will have to make your own way to caemlyn from there i truly am sorry you have done quite enough already elayne put in her eyes drifting toward the plumes of smoke rising above samara i gave my promise he said with a weary resignation plainly they had had the same exchange before nynaeve came nynaeve managed to offer her thanks which he dismissed graciously but with a look as if she too did not understand and she was more than ready to admit as much he started a war to keep a promise elayne was right about that it would be a war if it was not already yet with his men holding neres ship he would not demand a better price it was neres ship and neres could charge as he chose as long as he took elayne and nynaeve it was true galad never counted the cost of doing right not to himself or anyone else at the gangplank he paused staring at the town as if seeing the future stay clear of rand althor he said bleakly he brings destruction he willbreak the world again before he is done stay clear of him and he was trotting up to the dock already calling for his armor nynaeve found herself sharing a wondering gaze with elayne though it quickly broke up in embarrassment it was hard to share a moment like that with someone you knew might rake you with her tongue at least that was why she felt discomfited why elayne should look flustered she could not imagine unless the woman was starting to come to her senses surely galad did not suspect they had no intention of going to caemlyn surely not men were never that perceptive she and elayne did not look at one another again for some time chapter waves to boannda there was little trouble getting the huddled crowd of men women and children aboard not once nynaeve made it clear to captain neres that he wasgoing to find room for everyone and whatever hethought he was going to charge sheknew exactlyhow much she would give for their fares to boannda of course it might have helped a little that shed taken the precaution of quietly telling uno to have the shienarans do something with their swords fifteen hardfaced roughdressed men all with shaved heads and topknots not to mention bloodstains oiling and sharpening blades laughing as one recounted how another had almost been spitted like a lamb well they had a most salutary effect she counted the money into his hand and if it pained her she only had to summon the memory of those docks at tanchico to keep counting neres was right in one thing these folk did not look to have much coin they would need whatever coppers they had elayne had no call to ask in that sickly sweet tone if she was having a tooth pulled the crew ran at neres shouted commands to cast off while the last of the people were still scrambling aboard carrying their wretched possessions in their arms those who had anything at all beyond the rags on their backs in truth they crowded even the fat vessel so that nynaeve began to wonder whether neres had been right about that too yet such hope dawned on their faces once their feet were firmly on the deck that she was embarrassed to have considered it and when they learned she had paid their passage they clustered around her struggling to kiss her hands the hem of her skirt crying out thanks and blessings some with tears streaming down dirty cheeks men as well as women she wished she could sink through the planks under her feet the decks bustled as sweeps went out and sails rose and samara began to dwindle behind before she could put an end to the demonstration completely if elayne or birgitte had said one word she would have thumped them both twice around the ship for good measure five days they were on riverserpent five days running down the slowly winding eldar through baking days and nights not much cooler some things changed for the better in that time but the voyage did not begin well the first real problem of the trip was neres cabin in the stern the only accommodation on the ship except the deck not that neres was reluctant about moving out his haste breeches and coats and shirts flung over his shoulders and dangling from a great wad in his arms shaving mug clutched in one hand and razor in the other made nynaeve look hard at thom and juilin and uno it was one thing for her to make use of them when she chose to quite another for them to go looking afterher behind her back their faces could not have been more open or their eyes more innocent elayne brought up another of linis sayings an open sack hides nothing and an open door hides little but an open man is surely hiding something but whatever problem the men might prove to be the problem now was the cabin itself it smelled of must and mold even with the tiny windows swung out and they let little light into its dank confines confines was the word the cabin was small smaller than the wagon and most of the space was taken by a heavy table and highbacked chair fastened to the floor and the ladder leading up to the deck a washstand built into the wall with a grimy pitcher and bowl and a narrow dusty mirror crowded the room still more and completed the furnishings except for a few empty shelves and pegs for hanging clothes the ceiling beams crouched right overhead even for them and there was only one bed wider than what they had been sleeping on yet hardly wide enough for two tall as he was neres might as well have lived in a box the man surely had not given up one inch that might be stuffed with cargo he came to samara in the night elayne muttered unburdening herself of her bundles and putting hands on hips as she looked around disparagingly and he wanted to leave in the night i heard him tell one of his men that he meant to sail on through the night whatever the the wenches wanted apparently hes not much pleased to be moving in daylight thinking of the other womans elbows and cold feet nynaeve wondered whether she would not have done better to sleep up above with the refugees what are you going on about the man is a smuggler nynaeve in thisvessel dropping her own bundles nynaeve laid the scrip on the table and sat down on the edge of the bed no she would not sleep on deck the cabin might smell but it could be aired out and if the bed was cramped it had a thick feather mattress the ship didroll disturbingly she might as well have what comfort she could elayne could not chaseher out of there it is a barrel we will be lucky to reach boannda in two weeks the light alone knows how long to salidar neither of them really knew how far salidar was and it was not yet time to broach the matter with captain neres everything fits even the name riverserpent what honest trader would name his craft so well what if he is it wouldnt be the first time weve made use of a smuggler elayne threw up her hands in exasperation she always did think obeying the law was important however fool the law was she shared more with galad than she would be willing to admit so neres had called them wenches had he the second difficulty was room for the others riverserpentwas not a very large vessel if wide and counting everyone there were well over a hundred people aboard a certain amount of space had to go to the crew working the sweeps and tending ropes and sails and that did not leave much for the passengers it did not help that the refugees kept as far from the shienarans as possible it seemed they had had their fill of armed men there was scarcely room for everyone to sit and none for lying down nynaeve approached neres straight away these folk need more room especially the women and children since you have no more cabins your hold will have to do neres face darkened staring straight ahead somewhere a pace to her left he growled my hold is full of valuable cargo very valuable cargo i wonder if customs men are active along the eldar here elayne said idly eyeing the treelined banks to either side the river was only a few hundred paces wide here bordered with dried black mud and bare yellow clay ghealdan to one side and amadicia to the other it might seem odd your hold full of goods from the south and you heading south of course you probably have all the documents showing where youve paid duties and you could explain that you didnt unload because of the troubles in samara i have heard that excise men are quite understanding really the corners of his mouth turning down he still did not look at either of them which was why he had a very good view when thom fanned empty hands made a flourish and was suddenly twirling a pair of knives through his fingers before making one of them disappear just keeping in practice thom said scratching one long mustache with the other blade i like to maintain certain skills the gash in his whitehaired scalp and the fresh blood on his face added to a bloodstained rent in one shoulder of his coat and tears elsewhere besides made him look villainous in any company but unos the shienarans toothy smile held no mirth at all and did unfortunate things to his long scar and the new slash down his face red and raw the glaring crimson eye on his patch almost paled in comparison neres shut his eyes and drew a long long breath the hatches came open and crates and casks went splashing over the side some heavy most light and smelling of spices neres winced every time the river closed over something else he brightened if such a thing could be said of him when nynaeve directed that bolts of silk and carpets and bales of fine woolens be left below until he realized that she meant them for bedding if his face had been sour before now it could have curdled milk in the next room through the whole thing he never said a word when women began drawing up buckets of water on ropes to wash their children right there on the deck he strode to the stern hands clenched behind his back and stared at the few floating casks as they fell behind in a way it was neres peculiar attitude toward women that began smoothing the edges from elaynes acid tongue and birgittes that was the way nynaeve saw it she herself had maintained her usual even disposition of course neres disliked women the crew spoke quickly when they had to speak to one of the women all the while darting glances at the captain until they could hurry back to their duties a fellow who seemed to have nothing to do for a moment was more likely than not to be sent running to some task by a roar from neres if he exchanged two words with anyone in skirts their hasty comments and muttered warnings made neres opinions perfectly clear women cost a man money they fought like alley cats and they caused trouble any and all trouble a man had could be laid to women one way or another neres expected half of them to be rolling on the deck clawing one another before the first sunset they would all flirt with his crew and bring on dissension where they did not cause fights could he have sent all women off his ship forever he might have been happy could he have had them out of his life he would have been ecstatic nynaeve had never encountered the like oh she had heard men mutter about women and money as if men did not fling coin about like water they just had no head for money less than elayne and she had even heard them lay various troubles to women usually when it was they themselves who had caused all the bother but she could not recall evermeeting a man who truly dislikedwomen it was a surprise to learn that neres had a wife and a horde of children in ebou dar but no surprise that he stayed at home only long enough to load a new cargo he did not even want to talkto a woman it was simply amazing sometimes nynaeve found herself looking at him sideways the way she would have at some incredible animal far stranger than sredit or anything else in lucas menagerie naturally there was no way that elayne or birgitte could vent their bile where he might hear rolling eyes and meaningful looks among thom and the others were bad enough they at least made some effort to hide them neres open satisfaction at having his ridiculous expectations met he surely would have seen it so that would have been unbearable he left them no choice but to swallow their acid and smile for herself nynaeve could have done with a little time with thom and uno and juilin away from neres eye they were forgetting themselves again forgetting they were supposed to do as they were told the results did not matter they should wait and for some reason they had taken to tormenting neres with darkly smiling comments about cracking heads and slitting throats but the only place she could be sure of avoiding neres was in the cabin they were not particularly large men though thom was tall and uno fairly wide yet crowded in there they would have filled the tiny space to where they were looming over her hardly conducive to the tonguelashing she wanted to hand out give a man the chance to loom and he had the battle half won so she put on a pleasant mask ignored startled frowns from thom and juilin incredulous stares from uno and ragan and enjoyed the outward good temper the other women had been forced to adopt she managed to keep smiling when she learned why the sails were so full the undulating riverbanks rushing by under the afternoon as fast as a trotting horse neres had had the sweeps pulled in and stored along the railings he almost looked happy almost a low clay bluff ran along the amadicia bank on the ghealdan side lay a broad ribbon of reeds between river and trees mainly brown where water had receded samara lay only a few hours upriver you channeled she said to elayne through her teeth wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand she resisted the urge to dash it to the slowly heaving deck the other passengers left a clear space for the two of them and birgitte a few paces across but she still kept her voice low and as affable as she could manage her stomach seemed to move a heartbeat behind the ships roll that hardly improved her temper this wind is your doing she hoped there was enough red fennel in her scrip from elaynes damply glowing countenance and wide eyes milk and honey should have fountained from her mouth you are turning into a frightened rabbit pull yourself together samara is milesbehind us no one could sense anything useful from that far she would have to be on the ship with us to know i was very quick nynaeve thought her own face might crack if she held her smile any longer but out of the corner of her eye she could see neres studying his passengers and shaking his head angry as she was at that moment she could also see the almost faded residue of the other womans weaving working weather was like rolling a stone downhill it tended to keep going the way you started it when it bounced away from the path as it would sooner or later you just had to twitch it back moghedien might have felt a weave of that size from samara maybe but certainly not well enough to say where it had been done she herself was a match for moghedien in raw strength and if she was not strong enough to do something it seemed safe to say the forsaken was not either and she did want to travel as quickly as possible right then one day more than necessary in close quarters with the other two held as much attraction for her as sharing the cabin with neres for that matter an extra day on water was nothing to look forward to how could a ship move in such a fashion when the river looked so flat smiling was beginning to make her lips ache you should have asked elayne you always go and do things without asking without thinking its time you realized if you fall into a hole running blindly your old nurse isnt going to come pick you up and wash your face by the last word elaynes eyes were as round as teacups and her bared teeth looked ready to bite birgitte put a hand on each of them leaning close and beaming as though joy had her by the throat if you two dont stop this im going to tip you both into the river to cool off you are both acting like shago barmaids with winteritch sweating faces frozen in amiability the three women stalked in different directions just as far apart as the ship would allow near sunset nynaeve heard ragan say that she and the others must really be relieved to be away from samara the way they were all but laughing on one anothers shoulder and the other men seemed to be thinking much the same but the rest of the women aboard watched them with faces much too smooth theyknew trouble when they saw it yet bit by bit that trouble oozed away nynaeve was not exactly sure how perhaps the pleasant exteriors elayne and birgitte put on just seeped inside in spite of them perhaps the ridiculousness of it all trying to keep a friendly smile on your face while putting a proper bite into your words struck them more and more whatever did it she could not complain at the outcome slowly day by day words and tones began to match faces and now and then one of them even looked embarrassed plainly remembering how she had been behaving neither spoke one word of apology of course which nynaeve quite understood had she been as foolish and vicious as they she certainly would not want to remind anyone the children played a part in restoring elayne and birgitte to equilibrium too though it actually started with nynaeve looking after the mens wounds that first morning on the river she brought out her scrip full of herbs making poultices and ointments bandaging cuts those gashes made her angry enough to heal sickness and injury always made her angry and she did so for some of the worst though she had to be careful wounds vanishing would have set people talking and the light knew what neres would do if he thought he had an aes sedai aboard very likely sneak a man ashore in amadicia by night and try to have them arrested for that matter the news might have sent some of the refugees over the side with uno for example she rubbed a touch of stinging mardrootoil liniment into his heavily bruised shoulder dabbed a bit of healall ointment on the fresh slash down his face no point wasting either and wrapped his head in bandages until he could hardly move his jaw before healing him when he gasped and flailed she said briskly dont be such a baby i wouldnt have thought a little pain would bother a big strong man now you leave those alone if you even touch them in the next three days ill dose you with something you wont soon forget he nodded slowly staring at her so uncertainly that it was plain he did not know what she had done if he realized when he finally took the bandages off with luck no one else would remember exactly how bad the gash had been and he should have sense enough to keep his mouth shut once she began it was only natural to go on to the rest of the passengers few of the refugees lacked bruises and scrapes and some of the children were showing signs of fevers or worms those she could heal without worry children always made a fuss when they were dosed with anything that did not taste of honey if they told their mothers it had felt odd children always had fancies she had never really been comfortable around children true she wanted to have lans babies part of her did children could make a mess from nothing they seemed to have the habit of doing the opposite of what you told them as soon as your back was turned just to see how you would react yet she found herself smoothing back the dark hair of a boy no higher than her waist who stared up at her owlishly with bright blue eyes they looked very like lans eyes elayne and birgitte joined her just to help keep order at first but one way or another they gravitated to the children too strangely birgitte did not look at all silly with a boy of three or four cradled on either hip and a ring of children about her singing them a nonsense song about dancing animals and elayne handed round a sack of sweet red candies the light knew where she had gotten them or why she did not look guilty at all when nynaeve caught her sneaking one into her own mouth she only grinned gently pulled a little girls thumb from hermouth and replaced it with another candy the children laughed as if just remembering how and snuggled themselves into nynaeves skirts or elaynes or birgittes as easily as into their mothers it was very difficult to maintain any sort of temper in those circumstances she could not even bring herself to do more than sniff and that faintly when elayne resumed her study of the adamin the privacy of the cabin on the second day the woman seemed more convinced than ever that the bracelet necklace and leash created a strange form of linking nynaeve even sat with her once or twice the sight of the vile thing itself was enough to enable her to embrace saidarand follow along the refugees stories came out of course families separated lost or dead farms and shops and crafts ruined as ripples of the worlds troubles spread out disrupting trade people could not buy when they could not sell the prophet had only been the last brick on the cart that broke the axle nynaeve said nothing when she saw elayne slipping a gold mark to a fellow with thin gray hair who knuckled a wrinkled forehead and tried to kiss her hand she would learn how fast gold vanished besides nynaeve had handed out a few coins herself well perhaps more than a few all but two of the men were grizzled or balding with leathery faces and workcallused hands younger men had been snatched into the army if they were not caught up by the prophet those who refused one or the other had been hanged the young pair little more than boys really nynaeve doubted if either had to shave regularly wore hunted stares and flinched if one of the shienarans looked at them sometimes the older men talked of starting over finding a bit of land to farm or taking up their trade again but the tone of their voices said it was more bluff and bravado than real hope mostly they talked quietly of their families a wife lost sons and daughters lost grandchildren lost they sounded lost the second night a jugeared fellow who had seemed the most enthusiastic in a sad lot had just vanished he was simply gone when the sun came up he might have swum ashore nynaeve hoped he had still it was the women who caught her heart they had no more prospects than the men no more certainties but most had more burdens none had a husband with her or even knew if she had a husband alive yet the responsibilities that weighed them down also kept them moving no woman with grit could give up when she had children even the others meant to find some future though they all had at least a scrap of the hope the men only pretended to three especially tugged at her nicola was about her age and height a slender darkhaired weaver with big eyes who had been intending to marry until her hyran took it into his head that duty called him to follow the prophet to follow the dragon reborn he would marry her when his duty was seen to duty had been very important to hyran he would have made a good and conscientious husband and father so nicola said only whatever was in his head had not done him much good when someone split it with an axe nicola did not know who or why just that she had to get as far from the prophet as she could somewhere there had to be a place where there was no killing where she would not always be in fear of what might be around the next corner marigan a few years older had been plump once but her frayed brown dress hung on her loosely now and her blunt face looked beyond weary her two sons six and seven stared silently at the world with toobig eyes clinging to each other they seemed frightened of everything and everyone else even their own mother marigan had dealt in cures and herbs in samara though she had some odd ideas about both that was no wonder really a woman who offered healing with amadicia and whitecloaks right across the river had to keep low and even from the first she had had to teach herself all she had ever wanted to do was cure sickness and she claimed to have done it well though she had not been able to save her husband the five years since his death had been hard and the coming of the prophet had certainly not helped her any mobs searching for aes sedai chased her into hiding after she had cured a man of fever and rumor had turned it into bringing him back from the dead that was how little most people knew of aes sedai death was beyond the power to heal even marigan seemed to think it was not she did not know where she was going any more than nicola a village somewhere she hoped where she could dispense herbs again in peace areina was the youngest of the three with steady blue eyes in a face bruised purple and yellow and not from ghealdan at all her clothes would have said that if nothing else did a short dark coat and voluminous trousers not much different from birgittes they were the sum of her possessions she would not say where she was from exactly but she was forthcoming about the road that had led her to riverserpent about some of it nynaeve had to infer in places areina had gone to illian meaning to bring her younger brother home before he could take the oath as a hunter for the horn with thousands in the city however she had never found him but somehow she had found herself taking the oath setting out to see the world while not quite believing the horn of valere existed half hoping that somewhere she would find young gwil and take him home things had been difficult since areina was not precisely reluctant to talk but she made such an effort to put a good face on things she had been chased out of several villages robbed once and beaten several times even so she had no intention of giving up or seeking sanctuary or a peaceful village the world was still out there and areina meant to wrestle it to the ground not that she put it that way but nynaeve knew it was what the woman meant nynaeve knew very well why they touched her most too each story could have been the reflection of a thread in her own life what she did not quite understand was why she liked areina best it was her opinion putting this and that together that nearly all of areinas troubles came from having too free a tongue telling people exactly what she thought it could hardly be coincidence that she was harried out of one village so quickly she had to leave her horse behind after calling the mayor a piefaced loon and telling some village women that drybones kitchen sweepers had no right to question why she was on the road alone that was what she admitted to saying nynaeve thought a few days of herself for example would do areina worlds of good and there had to be something she could do for the other two as well she could understand a desire for safety and peace very well there was an odd exchange the morning of the second day while tempers were still tender and tongues somepeoples tongues still rough nynaeve said something quite mildly about elayne not being in her mother s palace so she need not think nynaeve was going to sleep shoved against the wall every night elayne tilted up her chin but before she could open her mouth birgitte blurted you are the daughterheir of andor she hardly looked around to make sure no one was close enough to hear i am elayne sounded more dignified than nynaeve remembered in some time but there was a hint of could it be satisfaction face completely blank birgitte simply turned away walking up into the bow where she sat on a coil of rope staring at the river ahead elayne frowned after her then finally went to sit beside her they sat talking softly for some time nynaeve would not have joined them even had she been asked whatever they discussed elayne seemed slightly disgruntled as if she had expected some other result but after that there was hardly a cross word between them birgitte resumed her own name later that same day though it was a last flare of temper that did it with moghedien safely behind them she and elayne washed the black out of their hair with pokeleaf and neres seeing one with redgold curls about her shoulders and the other yellowgold in an intricate braid and that one with bow and quiver muttered acridly about birgitte stepping out of the bloody stories it was his misfortune that she overheard that washer name she told him sharply and if he did not like it she would pin his ears to either mast he chose blindfolded he stalked off redfaced and shouting for lines to be tightened that could not have been made any tighter without popping at that point nynaeve would not have cared whether birgitte actually carried out the threat pokeleaf might have left a slight reddish cast to her own hair yet it was close enough to its natural color almost to make her cry for joy unless everyone aboard came down with sore gums and toothaches she had more than enough pokeleaf remaining and sufficient red fennel to keep her stomach in its place she could not help sighing in satisfaction once her hair was dry and in a proper braid again of course with elayne channeling good winds and neres running light or dark thatchroofed villages and farms sped past on either bank marked by people waving in the day and lit windows in the night showing no sign of the turmoil farther upriver broad as the misnamed craft was it made good time rolling along downriver neres seemed torn between pleasure at his good luck at such winds and worry at moving in daylight more than once he gazed longingly at a backwater a treeshrouded stream or a pool cut deep into the bank where riverserpentmight have been moored and hidden occasionally nynaeve remarked where he could hear about how glad he must be that the people from samara would soon be off his ship with a comment thrown in about how well this woman was looking now that she was rested or how energetic that womans children were that was enough to put ideas of stopping right out of his head it might have been easier to threaten him with the shienarans or thom and juilin but those fellows were getting entirely too bigheaded as it was and she certainly had no intention of arguing with a man who still would neither look at her nor talk to her gray dawning of the third day saw the crew manning the sweeps again to draw them in to a dock at boannda it was a considerable town larger than samara on a point of land where the swift river boern coming down from jehannah ran into the slower eldar there were even three towers inside the tall gray walls and a building shining white beneath a red tile roof that could certainly pass for a palace if a small one as riverserpentwas lashed fast to the heavy pilings at the end of one dock half their length across dried mud nynaeve wondered aloud why neres had gone all the way to samara when he could have unloaded his goods here elayne nodded toward a stout man on the dock who wore a chain with some sort of seal hanging across his chest there were several others like him all with the chain and a blue coat intently watching two other broad vessels unload at other docks queen alliandres excisemen i should say drumming his fingers on the rail neres was notlooking at the men just as intently as they were at the other vessels perhaps he had an arrangement with those in samara i dont think he wants to talk to these the men and women from samara marched reluctantly up the gangplank ignored by the excisemen there was no custom duty on people for the samarans it was the beginning of uncertainty they had their lives ahead of them and to begin anew what they stood up in and what nynaeve and elayne had given them before they were halfway down the dock still huddling together some of the women were beginning to look as disheartened as the men some even began to cry vexation painted elaynes face she always wanted to take care of everyone nynaeve hoped elayne did not discover that she had slipped a few more silvers to some of the women not all left the ship areina remained and nicola and marigan tightly clutching her sons who gazed in anxious silence after the other children vanishing toward the town the two lads had not said a word since samara that nynaeve had heard i want to go with you nicola told nynaeve unconsciously wringing her hands i feel safe near you marigan nodded emphatically areina said nothing but she stepped closer to the other two women making herself part of the group even as she looked levelly at nynaeve defying her to send her away thom shook his head slightly and juilin grimaced but it was to elayne and birgitte that nynaeve looked elayne did not hesitate in nodding and the other woman was only a second behind gathering her skirts nynaeve marched to neres standing in the stern i suppose i will have my ship back now he told the air somewhere between the ship and the dock not before time this voyage has been the worst i ever undertook nynaeve smiled broadly for once he did look at her before she was done well he almost did it was not as if neres had much choice he could hardly appeal to the authorities in boannda and if he did not like the fares she offered well he had to sail downriver anyway so riverserpentcast off again heading for ebou dar with one stop to be made that he was not informed of until boannda began falling astern salidar he growled staring over nynaeves head salidars been abandoned since the whitecloak war it would take a fool woman to want to be ashore at salidar even smiling nynaeve was angry enough to embrace the source neres roared slapping at his neck and his hip at the same time the horseflies are very bad this time of year she said sympathetically birgitte roared with laughter before they were halfway down the deck standing in the bows nynaeve inhaled deeply as elayne channeled to bring the wind up again and riverserpentlumbered into the strong current flowing out of the boern she was all but eating red fennel for meals but even if she ran out before salidar she would not care their journey was almost over everything she had been through was worth it for that of course she had not always thought so and elayne and birgittes rasping tongues had not been the only cause that first night lying on the captains bed in her shift while a yawning elayne occupied the chair and birgitte leaned against the door with her head brushing the beams nynaeve had used the twisted stone ring a single rusty gimbalmounted lamp gave light and surprisingly a scent of spice from the oil maybe neres had not liked the stench of must and mold either if she was ostentatious about nestling the ring between her breasts and making sure the others knew it touched skin well she had cause a few hours of superficially reasonable behavior on their parts had not made her less wary the heart of the stone was exactly as it had been every time before pale light coming from everywhere and nowhere the glittering crystal sword callandorthrust into the floorstones beneath the great dome rows of huge polished redstone columns running off into shadow and that sensation of being watched that was so common in telaranrhiod it was all nynaeve could do not to flee or set off on a frantic search through the columns she forced herself to stand in one place beside callandor counting slowly to one thousand and pausing every hundred to call egwenes name truly it was all she could do the control she was so proud of vanished her clothes flickered with her worries about herself and moghedien egwene and rand and lan between one minute and the next stout two rivers woolens became a muffling cloak and deep hood which became a suit of whitecloak mail which became the red silk dress only transparent which became an ever thicker cloak which became she thought her face changed too once she saw her hands with skin darker than juilins perhaps if moghedien could not recognize her egwene the last hoarse call echoed among the columns and nynaeve made herself stand there shivering for one more count of one hundred the great chamber remained empty except for her wishing she could feel more regret than haste she stepped out of the dream and lay fingering the stone ring on its thong staring at the thick beams above the bed and listening to the thousand creaks of the ship rushing downriver through the darkness was she there elayne demanded you were not gone very long but i am tired of being afraid nynaeve said without taking her gaze from the beams i am sso tired of being a ccoward the last words dissolved into tears she could neither stop nor hide no matter how she scrubbed at her eyes elayne was there in an instant holding her and smoothing her hair and an instant later birgitte pressed a cloth dampened in cool water against the back of her neck she cried herself out to the sound of them telling her she was not a coward if i thought moghedien was hunting me birgitte said finally i would run if there was no other place to hide than a badgers hole i would wriggle in and curl into a ball and sweat until she was gone i would not stand in front of one of cerandins sreditif it charged either and neither is cowardice you must choose your own time and your own ground and come at her in the way she least expects i will take my revenge on her if ever i can but that is the only way i will anything else would be foolish that was hardly what nynaeve wanted to hear but her tears and their comfort made another gap in the thorny hedges that had grown up between them i will prove to you that you are no coward taking the dark wooden box from the shelf where she had put it elayne removed the spiralscribed iron disc we will go back together that nynaeve wanted to hear even less but there was no way to avoid it not after they had told her she was not a coward so back they went to the stone of tear where they stared at callandor better than looking over your shoulder and wondering whether moghedien was going to appear then to the royal palace in caemlyn with elayne leading and emonds field under nynaeves guidance nynaeve had seen palaces before with their huge halls and great painted ceilings and marble floors their gilding and fine carpets and elaborate hangings but this was where elayne had grown up seeing it and knowing that made her understand a little of elayne of course the woman expected the world to bend itself to her she had grown up being taught that it would in a place where it did elayne a pale image of herself because of the terangrealshe was using was strangely quiet while they were there but then nynaeve was quiet in emonds field for one thing the village was larger than she remembered with more thatchroofed houses and others wooden frameworks going up someone was building a very big house just outside the village three sprawling stories and a stone plinth five paces high had been erected on the green carved all over with names a good many she recognized they were mostly two rivers names a flagpole stood to either side of the plinth one topped by a banner with a red wolfs head the other one with a red eagle everything looked prosperous and happy as much as she could say with no people there but it made no sense what on earth were those banners and who would be building such a house they flashed to the white tower to elaidas study nothing had changed there except that only half a dozen stools remained in the semicircle in front of elaidas table and the triptych of bonwhin was gone the painting of rand remained with a poorly mended tear in the canvas across rands face as if someone had thrown something at it they rifled the papers in the lacquered box with its golden hawks and those on the keepers table in the anteroom documents and letters changed while they looked at them yet they did learn a little elaida knew that rand had crossed the dragonwall into cairhien but of what she intended to do about it there was no clue an angry demand that all aes sedai return to the tower immediately unless they had specific orders otherwise from her elaida seemed to be angry about a good deal that so few sisters had returned after her offer of amnesty that most of the eyesandears in tarabon were still silent that pedron niall was still calling whitecloaks back to amadicia when she did not know why that davram bashere still could not be found despite having an army with him fury filled every document over her seal none of it seemed of real use or interest except maybe about the whitecloaks not that they should have any difficulty there as long as they were on riverserpent when they returned to their bodies on the ship elayne was silent as she rose from the chair and replaced the disc in the box without thinking nynaeve got up to help her out of her dress birgitte scrambled up the ladder as they climbed into the bed together in their shifts she intended to sleep right at the top of the ladder she said elayne channeled to extinguish the lamp after a time lying in the dark she said the palace seemed so empty nynaeve it felt so empty nynaeve did not know what else a place was supposed to be in telaranrhiod it was the terangrealyou used you looked almost foggy to me well i looked just fine to me there was only a touch of asperity in elaynes voice though and they settled down to sleep nynaeve had remembered the other womans elbows accurately but they could not diminish her good mood and neither could elaynes complaining murmur that she had cold feet she had done it perhaps forgetting to be afraid was not the same as not being afraid but at least she had gone back to the world of dreams perhaps one day she could find the nerve again not to be afraid having begun it was easier to go on than to stop every night after that they entered telaranrhiodtogether always with a visit to the tower to see what they could learn there was not very much besides an order sending an emissary to salidar to invite the aes sedai there to return to the tower except the invitation as much as nynaeve could read before it changed to a report on screening potential novices for proper attitudes whatever that was supposed to mean was more a demand that those aes sedai submit to elaida immediately and be thankful they were allowed to still it was confirmation that they were not chasing a wild hare the trouble with the rest of what they saw in fragments was they did not know enough to fit them together who was this davram bashere and why was elaida so frantic to find him why had elaida forbidden anyone to mention the name of mazrim taim the false dragon with a threat of stiff penalties why had queen tenobia of saldaea and king easar of shienar both written letters politely but stiffly resenting white tower meddling in their affairs it all made elayne murmur one of linis sayings to know two you must first know one nynaeve could only agree that it certainly seemed so aside from the trips to elaidas study they worked at learning control of themselves and their surroundings in the world of dreams nynaeve did not mean to let herself be caught again as she had been by egwene and by the wise ones moghedien she tried not to think about much better to concentrate on the wise ones of egwenes trick of appearing in their dreams as she had in samara they could puzzle out nothing calling her did nothing except increase that uneasy feeling of being watched and she did not make another such appearance trying to hold somebody else in telaranrhiodwas incredibly frustrating even after elayne hit on the trick which was to see the other as just another part of the dream elayne did it finally and nynaeve congratulated her with as good grace as she could muster but for days nynaeve could not elayne might as well have been the near mist she seemed vanishing with a smile whenever she chose when nynaeve finally managed to fasten elayne there she felt the strain as if she were picking up a boulder creating fantastical flowers or shapes by thinking of them was much more fun the effort involved seemed related to both how large the thing was and whether it might really exist trees covered with wildly shaped blossoms in red and gold and purple were harder to make than a standmirror to examine what you had done to your dress or what the other woman had done to it a gleaming crystal palace rising out of the ground was harder still and even if felt solid to the touch it changed whenever the image in your mind wavered and vanished as soon as the image did they quietly decided to leave animals alone after a peculiar thing much like a horse with a horn on its nose chased them both up a hill before they could make it vanish that very nearly sparked a new argument with each of them claiming the other had made it but by that time elayne had recovered enough of her old self to start giggling over how they must have looked racing up the hill with their skirts hauled up shouting at the thing to go away even elaynes stubborn refusal to admit it had been her fault could not stop nynaeves giggles from bubbling up too elayne alternated between the iron disc and the apparently amber plaque with its carving of a sleeping woman but she did not really like using either terangreal as hard as she worked with them she did not feel as fully in telaranrhiodas with the ring and each did have to be worked it was not possible to tie the flow of spirit or you bounced right back out of the world of dreams immediately channeling anything else at the same time seemed all but impossible yet elayne could not understand why she seemed more interested in how they had been made and not at all pleased that they did not yield their secrets as easily as the adam not knowing the why was a burr in her stocking once nynaeve tried one of the pair coincidentally on the night they were to meet egwene the night after leaving boannda she would not have been angry enough if not for the thing that rubbed her wrong so often men neres began it stumping around the deck as the sun began to sink muttering to himself about having his cargo stolen she ignored him of course then thom making up his bed at the foot of the after mast said quietly he has a point it was plain he did not see her in the fading lurid light and neither did juilin squatting beside him hes a smuggler but he did pay for those goods nynaeve had no right to seize them a womans flaming rights are whatever she flaming says they are uno laughed thats what women in shienar say anyway that was when they saw her and fell silent as usual finding wisdom too late uno rubbed at his cheek the one without a scar he had removed his bandages that day and he knew now what had been done she thought he looked embarrassed it was hard to tell in the fastshifting shadows but the other two seemed to have no expression at all she did nothing to them of course only stalked away with a firm grip on her braid she even managed to stalk down the ladder elayne already had the iron disc in her hand the dark wooden box sat open on the table nynaeve picked up the yellowish plaque carved inside with a sleeping woman it felt slick and soft not at all something that would scratch metal with that edge of anger smoldering inside her saidarwas a warm glow just out of sight over her shoulder maybe i can come up with some idea why this thing wont let you channel anything but dribbles which was how she found herself in the heart of the stone channeling a flow of spirit into the plaque which in telaranrhiodwas tucked into her belt pouch as she often did in the world of dreams elayne wore a gown suitable for her mothers court green silk embroidered in gold around the neck with a necklace and bracelets of gold links and moonstones but nynaeve was surprised to discover that she herself had on something not very different though her hair was in a braid and its own color instead of loose about her shoulders her gown was pale blue and silver and if not so low as lucas dresses still lower than she thought she would have chosen still she liked the way the single firedrop on its silver chain looked gleaming between her breasts egwene would not find it easy to bully a woman dressed so certainly not that that could have had anything to do with why she had donned it even unconsciously right away she saw what elayne had meant about looking just fine to herself she appeared no different than the other woman who had the twisted stone ring somehow threaded onto her necklace elayne however said she looked misty misty was how saidarfelt too except for the flow of spirit she had begun to weave while awake the rest was thin and even the neverseen warmth of the true source seemed muted her anger remained just strong enough for her to channel if irritation at the men faded before the puzzle that puzzle was its own irritant steeling herself to confront egwene had no part in it she was not steeling herself at all and there was no reason for the faint taste of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf on her tongue yet producing a single flame dancing in midair one of the first things a novice was taught seemed as difficult as throwing lan over her shoulder the flame looked attenuated even to her and as soon as she tied the weave it began to fade away in seconds it was gone both of you amys said she and egwene were just there on the other side of callandor both in aiel skirts and blouses and shawls at least egwene had not donned so many necklaces and bracelets why do you appear so strange nynaeve have you learned to come waking nynaeve gave a little jump she did so hate people sneaking up on her egwene how did you she began smoothing her skirts at the same time that elayne said egwene we cant understand how you egwene broke in rand and the aiel have won a great victory at cairhien out it all came in a torrent everything she had told them in their dreams from sammael to the seanchan spearhead each word almost tripped over the next and she drove every one home with an intent stare nynaeve exchanged confused glances with elayne surely she hadtold them they could not have imagined it not with every word confirmed now even amys long white hair only emphasizing the not quite aes sedai agelessness of her face looked amazed at the flood matkilled couladin nynaeve exclaimed at one point that had certainly not been in their dreams of her it did not sound like mat at all leading soldiers mat when egwene finally trailed off shifting her shawl and breathing a little quickly she had barely paused for breath along the way elayne said weakly is he well she sounded as if she was almost beginning to doubt her own memories as well as can be expected amys said he drives himself hard and listens to no one except moiraine amys was not pleased aviendha is with him almost all the time egwene said she is taking good care of him for you nynaeve doubted that she did not know much about aiel but she suspected that if amys said hard anyone else would say murderously apparently elayne agreed then why is she letting him push himself what is he doing quite a bit it turned out and clearly too much two hours each day practicing the sword with lan or anyone else he could find that made amys mouth tighten sourly two more studying the aiel way of fighting without weapons egwene might find that strange but nynaeve was all too aware of how helpless you could be when you could not channel still rand certainly should never find himself in that position he had become a king or something more surrounded by far dareis maiguards ordering lords and ladies about in fact he spent so much time ordering them and chasing after them to make sure they did what he said that he would not spare time for meals if the maidens did not bring him food wherever he was for some reason while that seemed to irk egwene almost as much as it did elayne amys looked distinctly amused though her face went back to aiel stoniness once she saw nynaeve notice yet another hour each day was given to a strange school he had founded inviting not only scholars but craftsmen from some fellow who made looking glasses to a woman who had constructed some sort of huge crossbow with pulleys that could hurl a spear a mile he had told no one his purpose there except maybe moiraine but the only answer the aes sedai had given egwene was that the urge to leave something behind was strong in everyone moiraine did not seem to care what rand did what remains of the shaido are retreating north amys said grimly and more slip across the dragonwall to them every day but rand althor seems to have forgotten them he is sending the spears south toward tear half are gone already rhuarc says he has not even told the chiefs why and i do not think rhuarc would lie to me moiraine stands closer to rand althor than any except aviendha yet she refuses to ask him shaking her head she muttered though in her defense i will say that even aviendha has learned nothing the best way to keep a secret is to tell no one elayne told her which earned her a hard stare amys was not far behind bair when it came to stares that made you shift your feet we arent going to reason it out here nynaeve said fixing her gaze on egwene the other woman seemed uneasy if there was any time to begin redressing the balance between them it might as well be now what i want to know you are quite right egwene cut in we are not in sheriams study where we can lounge about and chatter what have you to tell us are you still with master lucas menagerie nynaeves breath caught questions flying right out of her head there was so much to tell and so much not to she claimed she had followed lanfear to the meeting between the forsaken and spoke only of seeing moghedien spying not that she wanted to avoid telling how she had been handled by moghedien not really not exactly but birgitte had not released them from their promise of secrecy of course that meant not telling about birgitte at all that she was with them it was awkward knowing that egwene knew brigitte was helping them and still having to keep pretending that egwene knew nothing at all but nynaeve managed despite stammering when egwene arched her eyebrows the light be thanked elayne helped her present samara as galad and masemas fault which it was in truth if either had simply sent to tell her about the ship none of the rest would have followed when she finished with salidar amys said quietly you are certain they will support the caracarn they must know the prophecies of the dragon as well as elaida elayne said the best way to oppose her is to attach themselves to rand and make it clear to the world that theyintend to support him all the way to tarmon gaidon not the slightest quaver in her voice betrayed that she was not speaking of an absolute stranger otherwise they are just rebels with no claim to legitimacy they need him at least as much as he needs them amys nodded but not as if she was ready to agree yet i think i remember masema egwene said hollow eyes and a sour mouth nynaeve nodded i can hardly imagine him as any sort of prophet but i can see him starting a riot or a war im sure galad only did what he thought was best egwenes cheeks colored slightly even the memory of galads face could do that rand will want to know about masema and salidar if i can make him stand still long enough to listen i want to know how it happens that you are both here amys said she listened to their explanation and turned the plaque over in her hand once nynaeve fished it out having the terangrealtouched by someone else while she was using it made nynaeves skin crawl i believe you are less here than elayne the wise one said finally when a dreamwalker enters the world of dreams in her sleep only a tiny bit of her remains with her body just enough to keep her body alive if she puts herself into a shallow sleep where she can be here and also speak to those around her in the waking world she looks as you do to one who is here fully perhaps it is the same i do not know that i like it any woman who can channel being able to enter telaranrhiod even in this state she returned the terangrealto nynaeve heaving a sigh of relief nynaeve hastily tucked the plaque away again her stomach was still fluttering if you have told everything amys paused while nynaeve and elayne hurriedly said that they had the womans blue eyes were incredibly penetrating then we must go i will admit there is more to be gained from these meetings than i first supposed but i have much to do yet tonight she glanced at egwene and they vanished as one nynaeve and elayne did not hesitate around them the great redstone columns changed in a blink to a small darkpaneled room its furnishings few plain and sturdy nynaeves anger had been wavering and with it her hold on saidar but the mistress of novices study firmed both stubbornly defiant indeed she hoped that sheriam was in salidar it would be a pleasure to face her on an equal footing still she could have wished to be somewhere else elayne was peering into the mirror with its flaking gilt frame nonchalantly adjusting her hair with her hands only she had no need to use her hands here she did not like being in this room either why had egwene suggested meeting here elaidas study might not be the most comfortable place to be but it was better than this a moment later egwene was there on the other side of the broad table eyes icy and hands on her hips as if she was the rooms rightful occupant before nynaeve could open her mouth egwene said have you two brainless flaptongues become witless ninnies if i ask you to keep something to yourselves do you immediately tell the first person you meet did it never occur to you that you dont have to tell everyone everything i thought you two were good at keeping secrets nynaeves cheeks grew warmer at least she could not possibly be as scarlet as elayne egwene was not quite finished as for how i did it i cant teach you you have to be a dreamwalker if you can touch somebodys dreams with the ring i dont know how and i doubt you can with that other thing try to keep your mind on what youre doing salidar may be nothing like you expect now i also have things to do tonight at least try to keep your wits about you and she was gone so suddenly the last word almost seemed to come from empty air embarrassment ate at nynaeves anger she hadnearly burst out with it after egwene asked her not to and birgitte how could you keep a secret when the other woman knew embarrassment won and saidarslipped away like sand through her fingers nynaeve wakened with a jerk the deep yellow terangrealfirmly clutched in one hand the gimbalmounted lamp was turned down to a dim light elayne lay crowded in next to her still asleep the ring on its thong had slid down into the hollow of her throat muttering to herself nynaeve clambered over the other woman to put away the plaque then poured a little water into the washbasin to bathe her face and neck the water was lukewarm but it felt cool in the shadowy light she thought the mirror said she was still blushing so much for redressing the balance if only they had met anywhere else if only she had not flapped her tongue like a brainless girl it would have gone better if she had been using the ring instead of being a wraith as far as the other woman was concerned it was all thom and juilins fault and unos if they had not made her angry no it was neres fault he she took the pitcher in both hands and washed her mouth it was only the taste of sleep she was trying to get rid of nothing like boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf nothing at all when she turned from the washstand elayne was just sitting up untying the leather cord that held the ring i saw you losing saidar so i went by elaidas study but i didnt think i should stay long in case you worried i didnt learn anything except that shemerin is to be arrested and reduced to accepted she got up and tucked the ring into the box they can do that demote an aes sedai i dont know i think elaida is doing anything she wants egwene shouldnt wear those aiel clothes they are not very becoming nynaeve let out the breath she had been holding obviously elayne wanted to ignore what egwene had said nynaeve was willing to let her no they certainly arent climbing onto the bed she scrunched over against the wall they took turns sleeping on the outside i did not even have a chance to send a message to rand elayne got in after and the lamp winked out the small windows let in only dribbles of moonlight and one to aviendha if she is taking care of him for me then she ought to take care of him he isnt a horse elayne you dont own him i never said i did how will you feel if lan takes up with some cairhienin woman dont be silly go to sleep nynaeve burrowed fiercely into her small pillow perhaps she should have sent word to lan all those noblewomen tairen as well as cairhienin feeding a man honey instead of telling him the truth he had better not forget who he belonged to below boannda woods closed in tightly on both sides of the river unbroken tangles of trees and vines villages and farms vanished the eldar might as well have run through wilderness a thousand miles from human habitation five days out of samara early afternoon found riverserpentanchored in the middle of a bend in the river while the ships one boat ferried the remaining passengers to a beach of cracked dry mud bordered by low forested hills even the tall willows and deeprooted oaks showed some brown leaves there was no need to give the man that necklace nynaeve said on the shore watching the rowboat approach crowded with four oarsmen juilin and the last five shienarans she hoped she had not been gullible neres had showed her his map of this stretch of the river pointing out the mark for salidar two miles from the water but nothing else indicated there had ever been a village anywhere near here the forest wall was quite unbroken what i paid him was quite enough not to cover his cargo elayne replied just because hes a smuggler doesnt mean wehave a right to take it from him nynaeve wondered whether she had been talking to juilin probably not it was just the law again besides yellow opals are gaudy especially in that setting anyway it was worth it just to see his face elayne giggled abruptly he looked at me thistime nynaeve tried not to but she could not help giggling too thom was up near the trees trying to amuse marigans two boys by juggling colored balls produced from his sleeves jaril and seve stared at him silently hardly blinking and held on to each other nynaeve had not really been surprised when marigan and nicola asked to accompany her nicola might be watching thom and laughing delightedly now but she would have spent every moment at nynaeves side had the latter allowed it areina wanting to come had been something of a shock though she was sitting off by herself on a fallen log watching birgitte who was stringing her bow all three women might be in for a shock when they discovered what was in salidar at least nicola would find her sanctuary and marigan might even have a chance to dispense herbs if there were not too many yellows about nynaeve have you thought about how were going to be received nynaeve looked at elayne in astonishment they had crossed half the world or near enough and defeated the black ajah twice well they had had help in tear but tanchico had been all their doing they brought news of elaida and the tower she was willing to bet no one in salidar had and most importantly they could help these sisters make contact with rand elayne i wont say they will greet us as heroes but it wouldnt surprise me if they kissed us before today is done rand alone would be worth that two of the barefoot sailors leaped out to hold the rowboat against the current and juilin and the shienarans splashed ashore as the sailors scrambled back aboard on riverserpentmen were already hauling in the anchor clear us a path uno nynaeve said i mean to be there before dark from the look of the forest all vines and dusty undergrowth two miles might take that long if neres had not managed to gull her that worried her more than anything else chapter flame of tar valon to teach and learn some four hours later the sweat running down nynaeves face had very little to do with unseasonable heat and she was wondering whether it might not have been better if neres had gulled them or refused to carry them beyond boannda late afternoon sunlight slanted sharply through windows with mostly cracked panes clutching her skirts in blended irritation and unease she tried to avoid looking at the six aes sedai grouped around one of the sturdy tables near the wall their mouths moved silently as they conferred behind a screen of saidar elayne had her chin high her hands folded calmly at her waist but a tightness about her eyes and the corners of her mouth spoiled her regal air nynaeve was not sure she wanted to know what the aes sedai were saying one stunning blow after another had knocked all her high expectations into a daze one more shock and she thought she might scream and she did not know whether from fury or pure hysteria very nearly everything except their clothes was laid out on that table from birgittes silver arrow in front of stout morvrin to the three terangrealbefore sheriam to the gilded coffers in front of darkeyed myrelle not one of the women looked pleased carlinyas face might have been carved from snow even motherly anaiya wore a stern mask and beonins look of constant wideeyed startlement had a distinctly annoyed cast annoyed and something more sometimes beonin made as if to touch the white cloth spread neatly over the cuendillarseal but her hand always stopped and retreated nynaeves eyes jerked away from the cloth she knew exactly when things had begun to go wrong the warders who surrounded them in the woods had been proper if cool once she made uno and the shienarans put up their swords anyway and mins warm greetings had been all laughter and hugs but the aes sedai and others in the streets caught up in their own errands had scurried along with hardly a glance for the party being escorted in salidar was quite crowded with armed men drilling in nearly every open space the first person aside from the warders and min to pay any attention to them at all had been the lean brown sister they were taken to in what had once been the common room of this inn she and elayne had told the story they had agreed on to phaedrine sedai or tried to five minutes into it they were left standing with strict orders not to move a foot or speak a word even to each other ten more minutes staring at one another in confusion while all around them accepted and whiteclad novices warders and servants and soldiers bustled between tables where aes sedai pored over papers and briskly handed out orders and then they had been hustled before sheriam and the others so quickly nynaeve did not think her shoes had touched the floor twice that was when the grilling had begun more suitable for captured prisoners than returning heroes nynaeve dabbed at the perspiration on her face but as soon as she tucked the handkerchief back up her sleeve her hands returned to their grip on her skirts she and elayne were not alone standing on the colorful silk carpet siuan in a plain dress of fine blue wool might have been there by choice if nynaeve had not known better her face cool utterly composed she seemed lost in untroubled thought leane at least watched the aes sedai yet she appeared equally confident in fact somehow more selfconfident than nynaeve remembered the copperskinned woman looked even more willowy too more supple in some fashion perhaps it was her scandalous dress that pale green silk was every bit as highnecked as siuans but it clung to every curve of her and the material only managed to be opaque by a thin hair it was their faces that truly stunned nynaeve though she had never expected to find either alive and certainly never looking so very young no more than a few years older than she if that they did not so much as glance at one another in truth she thought she detected a distinct chill between them there was another difference about them one that nynaeve was just beginning to recognize if everyone including min had been ginger about it no one made any real secret of the fact that they had been stilled nynaeve could feel that lack perhaps it was being in a room where all the other women could channel or perhaps it was knowing they had been stilled but for the first time she was truly conscious of the ability in elayne and the others and its absence from siuan and leane something had been taken from them cut away it was like a wound perhaps the worst wound a woman could suffer curiosity overcame her what sort of wound would it be what had been cut away she might as well make use of the waiting and the irritation that larded itself through her nervousness she reached out to saidar did anyone grant you permission to channel here accepted sheriam asked and nynaeve gave a start hurriedly releasing the true source the greeneyed aes sedai led the others back to their mismatched chairs arranged on the carpet in a semicircle that had the four standing women as its focus some of them carried things from the table they sat staring at nynaeve earlier emotion swallowed in aes sedai calm none of those ageless faces acknowledged the heat by so much as a single bead of moisture finally anaiya said in a gently chiding voice you have been very long from us child whatever you have learned in the interval you have apparently forgotten much blushing nynaeve curtsied forgive me aes sedai i did not mean to overstep she hoped they thought it was shame that heated her cheeks she had been away from them a long time just one day ago she had given the orders and people jumped when she spoke now she was the one expected to jump it galled you tell an interesting story carlinya obviously believed little of it the white sister turned birgittes silver arrow over in long slender hands and you acquired some strange possessions the panarch amathera gave us many gifts aes sedai elayne said she seemed to think we saved her throne even delivered in a perfectly level voice that speech was a walk on thin ice nynaeve was not the only one irritated by their fall from freedom carlinyas smooth face tightened you come with disturbing news sheriam said and some disturbing things her slightly tilted eyes wandered to the table to the silvery adam and returned firmly to elayne and nynaeve since learning what it was what it was for most of the aes sedai had treated it like a live red adder most had if the thing does what these children claim morvrin said absently we need to study it and if elayne really believes she can make a terangreal the brown sister shook her head her real attention was on the flattened stone ring all flecked and striped in red and blue and brown that she held in one hand the other two terangreallay on her broad lap you say that this came from verin sedai how is it this was never mentioned to us before that was not directed at nynaeve or elayne but at siuan siuan frowned but not the fierce frown nynaeve remembered it held a touch of diffidence as if she knew she was speaking to her superiors and so did her voice that was another change nynaeve could hardly believe verin never told me of it i would very much like to ask her a few questions and ihave questions about this myrelles olive face darkened as she unfolded a familiar paper why had they ever kept that and read aloud what the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority obey and keep silent at my command siuan sanche watcher of the seals flame of tar valon the amyrlin seat she crumpled the paper and its seal in her fist hardly something to be handed out to accepted at the time i did not know who i could trust siuan said smoothly the six aes sedai stared at her it was within my authority then the six aes sedai did not blink her voice took on a thread of exasperated pleading you cannot call me to account for doing what i had to do when i had a perfect right to do it when the boats sinking you plug the hole with what you can find and why did you not tell us sheriam asked quietly but with a hint of steel as mistress of novices she had never raised her voice though sometimes you wished she would three accepted accepted sent out of the tower chasing thirteen full sisters of the black ajah do you use babies to plug the hole in your boat siuan we are hardly babies nynaeve told her heatedly several of those thirteen are dead and we thwarted their plans twice in tear we carlinya cut her off like an icy knife you have told us all about tear child and tanchico and defeating moghedien her mouth twisted wryly she had already said that nynaeve had been a fool to come within a mile of one of the forsaken that she was lucky to have escaped with her life that carlinya did not know how right she was they certainly had not told everything only made nynaeves stomach clench tighter you arechildren and lucky if we decide not to spank you now hold your peace until you are called on to speak nynaeve flushed heavily hoping they took it for embarrassment and held her peace sheriam had never taken her eyes from siuan well why have you never mentioned sending three children out to hunt lions siuan drew a deep breath but folded her hands and ducked her head penitently there seemed no point aes sedai with so much else of importance i have held nothing back when there was the faintest reason for telling every scrap i knew of the black ajah i told ive not known where these two were or what they were up to for some time the important thing is that they are here now and with those three terangreal you must realize what it means to have access to elaidas study to her papers if only in bits youd never have known that she knows where you are until it was too late except for that we realize that anaiya said eyeing morvrin who was still frowning at the ring it is just that perhaps the means of it takes us a little by surprise telaranrhiod myrelle breathed why it has become no more than a matter for scholarly discussion in the tower almost a legend and aiel dreamwalkers who would have imagined that aiel wise ones could channel much less this nynaeve wished they had been able to keep that secret like birgittes true identity and a few other things they had managed to hold back but it was difficult to keep things from slipping out when you were being questioned by women who could bore holes in stone with a look when they wanted well she supposed she should be glad they had managed to hang on to what they had once telaranrhiodhad been mentioned and that they had entered it a mouse would have treed cats before these women stopped asking questions leane took a halfstep forward not looking at siuan the importantthing is that with these terangrealyou can talk to egwene and through her to moiraine between them you can not only keep an eye on rand althor you should be able to influence him even in cairhien where he went from the aiel waste siuan said where i predicted he would be if her eyes and words were directed at the aes sedai her astringent tone was plainly meant for leane who grunted much good that did two aes sedai sent off to the waste chasing ducks oh yes there was very definitely a chill there enough children anaiya said very much as if they really were children and she a mother used to their petty squabbles she eyed the other aes sedai meaningfully it will be a very good thing to be able to talk with egwene if these work as claimed morvrin said bouncing the ring on one palm and fingering the other terangrealon her lap the woman would not believe the sky was blue without proof sheriam nodded yes that will be your first duty elayne nynaeve you will have a chance to teach aes sedai showing us how to use them nynaeve curtsied baring her teeth they could take it for a smile if they chose teach them yes and never get near the ring or the others again after elaynes curtsy was even stiffer her face a cool mask her eyes rolled toward that fool adamalmost longingly the lettersofrights will be useful carlinya said with all that white ajah coolness and logic testiness still showed in the way she clipped her words gareth bryne always wants more gold than we have but with those we may almost be able to satisfy him yes sheriam said and we must take most of the coin too there are more mouths to feed and more backs to clothe every day here and elsewhere elayne gave a gracious nod just as if they would not take the money whatever she said but nynaeve simply waited gold and lettersofrights and even terangrealwere only a part for the rest sheriam went on we are agreed that you left the tower by command however erroneous it was and you cannot be held to account for it now that you are safely back with us you will resume your studies nynaeve only breathed out slowly it was no more than she had expected since the questioning began not that she liked it but for once no one was going to be able to accuse her of having a temper not when in all probability it would do no good elayne though burst out with a sharp but just that before sheriam cut in just as sharply you will resume your studies you are both very strong but you are not aes sedai yet those green eyes held them until she was sure they had taken it and then she spoke again her voice milder milder but still firm you are returned to us and if salidar is not the white tower you may still consider it so from what you have told us in the last hour there is considerably more you have yet to tell nynaeves breath caught but sheriams eyes slid back to the adam a pity you did not bring the seanchan woman with you that you really should have done for some reason elayne blushed bright red and looked angry at the same time for herself nynaeve was only relieved it was the seanchan the woman meant but accepted cannot be called to account for not thinking as aes sedai sheriam went on siuan and leane will have many questions for you you will cooperate with them and answer to the best of your abilities i trust i do not have to remind you not to take advantage of their present condition some accepted and even some novices have thought to lay blame for events and even take punishments into their own hands that mild tone became cold steel those young women are now extremely sorry for themselves need i say more nynaeve was no more hasty than elayne to let her know she did not which was to say they both almost stammered in their haste to get it out nynaeve had not thought of assigning blame to her thinking aes sedai were all to blame but she did not want sheriam angry with her realizing that fact drove the truth home bitterly the days of freedom certainly were gone good now you may take the jewels the panarch gave you and the arrow when there is time you must tell me why she made you a gift like that and go one of the other accepted will find you places to sleep proper dresses may be harder to come by but they will be found i expect you to put your adventures behind you and fit smoothly back into your proper place plain although unspoken was the promise that if they did not fit back in smoothly they would be smoothed until they did sheriam gave a satisfied nod when she saw they understood beonin had not said a word since the shield of saidarwas lowered but as nynaeve and elayne made their curtsies the gray sister rose and strode to the table where their things were laid out and what of this she demanded in heavy taraboner accents whipping aside the white cloth that covered the seal on the dark ones prison for a change her large bluegray eyes looked more angry than startled are there to be no more questions about this do you all mean to ignore it the blackandwhite disc lay there next to the washleather purse in a dozen or more pieces fitted back together as neatly as they could be it was whole when we put it in the purse nynaeve paused to work moisture back into her mouth as much as her eyes had avoided the covering cloth before they could not leave the seal now leane had smirked when she saw the red dress unwrapped from around its cargo and said no she would not run away from it even in her head why should we have thought to take special care its cuendillar we didnt look at it elayne said breathlessly or touch it more than we had to it felt filthy evil it no longer did carlinya had made them each hold a piece demanding to know what evil feeling they were talking about they had said the same things before more than once and no one paid them any heed now sheriam rose and went to stand beside the honeyhaired gray we are ignoring nothing beonin asking these girls more questions will do no good they have told us what they know more questions are always good morvrin said but she had stopped fiddling with the terangrealto stare at the broken seal as hard as anyone else it might be cuendillar she and beonin had each tested it and said it was yet she had broken one fragment with her hands how many of the seven still hold myrelle asked softly as if speaking to herself how long until the dark one breaks free and the last battle comes every aes sedai did some of almost everything according to her talents and inclinations yet each ajah had its own reason for being greens who called themselves the battle ajah held themselves ready to face new dreadlords in the last battle there was almost a hint of eagerness in myrelles voice three anaiya said unsteadily three still hold if we know everything let us pray that we do let us pray three are enough let us pray those three are stronger than this one morvrin muttered cuendillarcannot be broken so not and be cuendillar it cannot we will discuss this in due course sheriam said after more immediate matters that we can do something about taking the cloth from beonin she covered the broken seal once more siuan leane we have reached a decision concerning she stopped short as she turned and saw elayne and nynaeve were you not told to go for all her outward calm the turmoil inside showed in her forgetting their presence nynaeve was more than ready to drop another curtsy blurt a hurried by your leave aes sedai and scurry for the door without moving a muscle the aes sedai and siuan and leane watched her and elayne go nynaeve felt their eyes like a shove elayne stepped not a whit more slowly for all she cast another look at the adam once nynaeve had the door closed and could lean back against its unpainted wood clutching the gilded coffer to her breasts she took her first comfortable breath or so it seemed since entering the old stone inn she did not want to think about the broken seal another broken seal she would not those women could shear sheep with their eyes she could almost look forward to watching their first meeting with the wise ones if she was not likely to be squarely in the middle it had been more than difficult when she first went to the tower learning to do as she was told by others to bend her neck after long months when she gave the orders well once she had consulted elayne usually she did not know how she was going to learn to pull wool and scratch gravel all over again the common room with its illpatched plaster ceiling and cold stone fireplaces near collapsing was the same beehive it had been when she first entered no one gave her more than a glance now and she gave them less a small crowd awaited her and elayne thom and juilin on a rough bench against the flaking plaster wall had their heads together with uno who was squatting in front of them long sword hilt rising over his shoulder areina and nicola both staring amazed at everything and trying not to show it occupied another bench with marigan who was watching birgitte attempt to amuse jan and seve by awkwardly juggling three of thoms colored wooden balls kneeling behind the boys min was tickling them whispering in their ears but they only clung to each other silently staring with those toobig eyes only two others in the entire room were not scurrying about two of myrelles three warders happened to be leaning against the wall in conversation a few paces beyond the benches just this side of the door back to the kitchen corridor croi makin a yellowhaired young splinter of stone from andor with a fine profile and avar hachami hawknosed and squarechinned with a thick graystreaked mustache like downcurved horns no one would call hachami handsome even before his darkeyed stare made them swallow they were not looking at uno or thom or anyone else of course it was only happenstance that they alone had nothing to do and had chosen just that spot to do it of course birgitte dropped one of the balls when she saw nynaeve and elayne what did you tell them she asked quietly barely glancing at the silver arrow in elaynes hand the quiver hung at her belt but her bow was propped against the wall moving closer nynaeve carefully did not look toward makin and hachami just as carefully she lowered her voice and was sparing with emphasis we told them everything they asked for elayne touched birgittes arm they know you are a good friend who has helped us you are welcome to stay here just the same as areina and nicola and marigan only when some of birgittes tension melted did nynaeve realize how much had been there the blueeyed woman scooped up the fallen yellow ball and smoothly tossed all three back to thom who snagged them with one hand and made them vanish in a single motion she wore the faintest of relieved grins i cant tell you how glad i am to see the pair of you min said for at least the fourth or fifth time her hair was longer than it had been though still a dark cap around her head and she looked different in some other way that nynaeve could not put a finger on surprisingly freshly embroidered flowers climbed the lapels of her coat she had always worn quite plain clothes before a friendly face is rare around here her eyes flickered just a fraction toward the two warders we have to settle down alone and have a long talk i cant wait to hear what youve been up to since you left tar valon or to tell what she had been up to as well else nynaeve missed her guess i would like very much to talk to you too elayne said quite seriously min looked at her then sighed and nodded not as eager as a moment before thom and juilin and uno came up behind birgitte and min their faces set in that way men took on when they meant to say things they thought a woman might not like to hear before they could open their mouths though a curlyhaired woman in an accepteds dress pushed between juilin and uno glowering at them and planted herself in front of nynaeve faolains dress with its seven bands of color at the hem for the ajahs was not quite as white as it should have been and her dark face wore a scowl i am surprised to see you here wilder i thought you had gone running back to your village and our fine daughterheir to her mother are you still souring milk for a hobby faolain elayne asked nynaeve kept her face pleasant just barely twice in the tower faolain had been set to teach her something to put her in her place was her own opinion even when teacher and pupil were both accepted the teacher had the status of aes sedai so long as the lesson lasted and faolain took full advantage the curlyhaired woman had spent eight years as a novice and five more as accepted she was not best pleased that nynaeve had never had to be a novice at all or that elayne had worn pure white for less than a year two lessons from faolain and two trips to sheriams study for nynaeve for stubbornness temper a list as long as her arm she made her voice light i heard siuan and leane have been badly treated by someone i think sheriam means to make an example to end it once and for all she kept her eyes steady on the other womans and faolains widened in alarm ive done nothing since sheriam faolains mouth snapped shut and her face colored heavily min hid her mouth behind her hand and faolain jerked her head around studying the other women from birgitte to marigan she motioned brusquely to nicola and areina you two will do i suppose come with me now no dawdling they rose slowly areina staring warily and nicola with fingers fretting at the waist of her dress elayne stepped between them and faolain before nynaeve could chin high and eyes imperious blue ice what do you want with them i am obeying sheriam sedais orders faolain replied i myself think they are too old for first testing but i obey orders a sister accompanies lord brynes recruiting parties testing women even as old as nynaeve her sudden smile could have come from a viper shall i inform sheriam sedai that you disapprove elayne shall i tell her you wont let your retainersbe tested elaynes chin came down somewhat during that but of course she could not simply back down she needed a diversion nynaeve touched faolains shoulder have they found many in spite of herself the womans head turned and when she glanced back elayne was soothing areina and nicola explaining that they would not be hurt or forced into anything nynaeve would not have gone so far when aes sedai found someone with the spark born in her like elayne or egwene someone who would channel eventually whether she wanted to or not they were quite open about bundling her into training whatever her wishes they seemed more lenient about those who could be trained but would never touch saidarwithout it and about wilders those who had survived the oneinfour chance of teaching themselves usually without knowing what they had done and often blocked in some way as nynaeve was supposedly they could choose to come or stay nynaeve had chosen to enter the tower but she suspected that if she had not she still would have gone perhaps even tied hand and foot aes sedai gave women who had the smallest chance of joining them as much choice as a lamb on a feastday three faolain said after a moment all that effort and theyve found three one a wilder she truly did not like wilders i do not know why they are so eager to find new novices the novices we have cant be raised accepted until we regain the tower it is all siuan sanches fault her and leane a muscle in her cheek twitched as if she realized that remark might be thought to harass the former amyrlin and keeper and she seized areina and nicola each by an arm come along i obey orders and if youre to be tested youll be tested waste of time or no waste of time a nasty woman min murmured squinting after faolain as she hurried the other across the common room youd think if there was any justice she would have an unpleasant future ahead of her nynaeve wanted to ask what min had seen in her viewing of the curlyhaired accepted there were a hundred questions she wanted to ask her but thom and the other two men planted themselves firmly in front of her and elayne juilin and uno to either side so among the three they could see in every direction birgitte was leading jaril and seve to their mother keeping her out of it min knew what the men were up to too by the rueful look she gave them she seemed about to say something but in the end she only shrugged and joined birgitte by thoms face he could have been about to comment on the weather or ask what was for supper nothing important this place is full of dangerous fools and dreamers they think they can depose elaida thats why gareth bryne is here to raise an army for them juilins grin almost split his dark face in two not fools madwomen and madmen i dont care if elaida was there the day logain was born theyre mad to think they can pull down an amyrlin sitting in the white tower from here we could reach cairhien in a month maybe ragan and a few of the others already have horses marked out for borrowing uno was grinning too it looked incredibly incongruous with that glaring red eye on his patch the guards are set to watch for people coming in not going out we can lose them in the forest itll be dark soon theyll never find us the womens donning their great serpent rings back by the river had had a remarkable effect on his language though he did seem to make up for it when he thought they could not hear nynaeve looked at elayne who shook her head slightly elayne would put up with anything to be aes sedai and herself small chance that they could influence these aes sedai to support rand if they had decided to try controlling him instead make that no chance she might as well be realistic and yet and yet there was healing she would learn nothing of it in cairhien but here not ten paces from her therva maresis a slender yellow with a long nose was methodically ticking off points on a parchment with her pen a baldheaded warder with a black beard stood conferring with nisao dachen near the door head and shoulders above her despite being no taller than average while dagdara finchey as wide as any man in the room and taller than most addressed a group of novices in front of one of the unlit fireplaces briskly sending them off one by one on errands nisao and dagdara were yellow ajah too it was said that dagdara her graying hair marking considerable age on an aes sedai knew more of healing than any two others it was not as if nynaeve would be able to do anything useful if she did go to rand just watch him go mad if she could progress with healing maybe she could find a way to hold that madness off there was too much that aes sedai were willing to call hopeless and let go at that to suit her all of that flashed through her head in the time it took to look at elayne and turn back to the men we will be staying here uno if you and the others want to go to rand you are free to as far as im concerned i fear i no longer have money to help you the gold the aes sedai had taken was needed just as they said but she could not help wincing at the few silvers left in her purse these men had followed her and elayne of course for all the wrong reasons but that did not lessen her responsibility for them their loyalties were to rand they had no reason to enter a struggle for the white tower with a glance at the gilded coffer she added reluctantly but i do have some things you can sell along the way you must go too thom elayne said and you juilin theres no point in remaining we have no need of you now but rand will she tried to press her casket of jewels into thoms hands but he refused to take it the three men exchanged looks in that irritating way they had uno going so far as to roll his eye nynaeve thought she heard juilin mutter something under his breath about having said they would be stubborn perhaps in a few days thom said a few days juilin agreed uno nodded i could do with a little rest if im going to be running from warders halfway to cairhien nynaeve gave them her flattest stare and deliberately tugged her braid elayne had her chin as high as it had ever been her blue eyes haughty enough to chip ice thom and the others surely knew the signs by now their nonsense was not going to be allowed if you think you are still following rand althors orders to look after us elayne began in frosty tones at the same time that nynaeve said heatedly you promised to do as you were told and i mean to see nothing like that thom broke in brushing back a strand of elaynes hair with a gnarled finger nothing at all like cant an old man with a limp want a little rest to tell the truth juilin said i am just staying because thom owes me money dice do you expect us to steal twenty horses from warders like falling out of bed uno growled he seemed to have forgotten just offering to do exactly that elayne stared at a loss for words and nynaeve was having difficulty finding them herself how far they had fallen not so much as a shifted foot in the three of them the trouble was that she was torn she had determined to send them away she had and not because she didnt want them around watching her curtsy and scrape right and left not at all yet with almost nothing in salidar as she had expected she had to admit however reluctantly that it would be comforting to know she and elayne had more than birgitte to depend on not that she would take up the offer of escape of course if that was what it should be called not under any circumstances their presence would just be comforting certainly not that she would let them know that she would not have to since they were going whatever they thought rand couldfind use for them very probably and they would only get in the way here except the unpainted door opened and siuan stalked out followed by leane they stared at each other coldly before leane sniffed and glided away startlingly sinuous as she vanished around croi and avar into the corridor that led to the kitchens nynaeve frowned slightly in the midst of all that iciness there had been one instant a brief flicker she almost missed with it right in front of her siuan swung toward her then abruptly stopped short her face going blank someone else had joined the small gathering gareth bryne dented breastplate buckled over his plain buffcolored coat and steelbacked gauntlets tucked behind his sword belt radiated command mostly gray hair and a bluff face gave him the appearance of a man who had seen everything endured everything a man who could endure anything elayne smiled nodding graciously a far cry from her astonished stares coming into salidar when she had first recognized him at the length of the street i will not say it is entirely good to see you lord gareth i have heard of some difficulty between mother and you but i am sure it can be mended you know mother is hasty sometimes she will come round and ask you back to your proper place in caemlyn you may be certain of it done is done elayne ignoring her astonishment nynaeve doubted anyone who knew elaynes rank had ever been so curt to her he turned to uno have you thought on what i said shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world and i have lads who are just right for proper training uno frowned his one eye sliding to elayne and nynaeve slowly he nodded ive nothing better to do ill ask the others bryne clapped him on the shoulder well enough and you thom merrilin thom had half turned away at the other mans approach knuckling his mustaches and staring at the floor as if to obscure his face now he met brynes level stare with one of his own i once knew a fellow with a name much like yours bryne said a skilled player of a certain game i once knew a fellow who looked much like you thom replied he tried hard to put me in chains i think hed have cut my head off if he ever laid hands on me a long time ago that would be men do strange things for women sometimes bryne glanced at siuan and shook his head will you join me for a game of stones master merrilin i sometimes find myself wishing for a man who knows the game well the way its played in lofty circles thoms bushy white eyebrows drew down almost as far as unos had but he never took his eyes from bryne i might play a game or two he said finally once i know the stakes as long as you understand i dont intend to spend the rest of my life playing stones with you i dont like staying too long in one place anymore my feet itch sometimes so long as they dont itch in the middle of a crucial game bryne told him dryly the two of you come with me and dont expect much sleep around here everything needs doing yesterday except what should have been done last week pausing he looked at siuan again my shirts came back only half clean today with that he was leading thom and uno off siuan glared at his back then shifted her frown to min and min grimaced and darted off the way leane had gone nynaeve did not understand that last exchange at all and the nerve of those men thinking they could talk over her head or under her nose or whatever without her understanding every word enough of them anyway a good thing he has no need for a thiefcatcher juilin said eyeing siuan sideways and plainly uncomfortable he had not gotten over the shock of learning her name nynaeve was not sure he had taken in about her being stilled and no longer the amyrlin seat he certainly shifted his feet for her this way i can sit and talk ive seen a lot of fellows who look like they might unwind over a mug of ale he practically ignored me elayne said incredulously i dont care what the trouble is between him and mother he has no right well i will tend to lord gareth bryne later i have to talk to min nynaeve nynaeve started to follow as elayne hurried toward that hall to the kitchens min would give straight answers but siuan caught her arm in an iron grip the siuan sanche who had meekly ducked her head before those aes sedai was gone no one here wore the shawl her voice never rose it did not need to she fixed juilin with a stare that had him almost jumping out of his skin you watch what questions you ask thiefcatcher or youll gut yourself for market those cold blue eyes shifted to birgitte and marigan marigans mouth twisted as if she tasted something bad and even birgitte blinked you two find an accepted named theodrin and ask her about somewhere to sleep tonight those children look as if they should be in bed already well move your feet before they had stirred a step and birgitte was moving as quickly as marigan maybe quicker she rounded on nynaeve you i have questions for you were told to cooperate and i suggest you do if you know whats good for you it was like being caught in a high wind before nynaeve knew it siuan was hurrying her up rickety steps with a railing cobbled together from unpainted wood hustling her down a roughfloored corridor to a tiny room with two cramped beds built into the wall one above the other siuan took the only stool motioning her to sit on the lower bed nynaeve chose to stand if only to show she was not going to be pushed there was not much else in the room a washstand with a brick propping up one leg held a chipped pitcher and basin a few dresses hung from pegs and what appeared to be a pallet lay rolled up in one corner nynaeve had fallen far in the space of a day but siuan had fallen farther than she could imagine she did not think she would have too much trouble with the woman even if siuan did still have the same eyes siuan sniffed suit yourself then girl the ring it doesnt require channeling no you heard me tell sheriam anyone can use it a woman who cant channel a man possibly a man terangrealthat did not need the power usually worked for men or women for any woman yes then you are going to teach me to use it nynaeve raised one eyebrow this might be a lever to get what she wanted if not she had another maybe do they know about this all the talk was of showing them how it works you were never mentioned they dont know siuan did not appear shaken at all she even smiled and not pleasantly and they wont else theyll learn you and elayne have been posing as full sisters since you left tar valon moiraine might be letting egwene get away with it if she hasnt tried it too i dont know a bar knot from a running hitch but sheriam carlinya theyll have you squealing like a spawning grunter before theyre done long before thats ridiculous nynaeve realized she was sitting on the edge of the bed she did not remember sitting down thom and juilin would hold their tongues no one else knew she had to talk to elayne we havent pretended anything of the sort dont lie to me girl if i needed confirmation your eyes gave it your stomach is turning somersaults isnt it it most certainly was of course not if i teach you anything its because i want to she was not going to let this woman bully her the last vestige of pity winked out ifi do i want something in return to study you and leane i want to know if stilling can be healed it cant siuan said flatly now anything short of death should be should be isnt is girl leane and i were promised we would be left alone speak to faolain or emara if you want to know what happens to anyone who molests us they werent the first or the worst but they cried the longest her other lever near panic had driven it right out of her head if it existed one glance what would sheriam say if she knew you and leane werent ready to tear out each others hair at all siuan just looked at her they think youre tamed dont they the more you snap at anybody who cant snap back the more they take it for proof when you leap to obey every time an aes sedai coughs was a little cringing all it took to make them forget the two of you had worked handinhand for years or did you convince them stilling had changed everything about you not just your face when they find out youve been scheming behind their backs manipulating them youll howl louder than any grunter whatever thatis not so much as a blink siuan was not going to loose her temper and let any admissions slip out yet there had been something in that brief look nynaeve was sure of it i want to study you and leane whenever i want and logain perhaps she could learn something there as well men were different it would be like looking at the problem from another angle not that she would heal him even if she discovered how rands channeling was necessary she was not about to loose another man on the world who could wield the power if not then you can forget about the ring and telaranrhiod what was siuan after there probably just to revisit something that at least seemed like being aes sedai nynaeve stamped firmly on momentarily rekindled pity and if you make any claims about us pretending to be aes sedai then ill have no choice but to tell about you and leane elayne and i might be uncomfortable until the truth comes out but it will and the truth will make you weep as long as faolain and emara together silence stretched how did the other woman manage to look so cool nynaeve had always thought it had to do with being aes sedai her lips felt dry the only part of her that did if she was wrong if siuan was willing to put it to the test she knew who would be weeping finally siuan muttered i hope moiraine has managed to keep egwenes backbone more supple than this nynaeve did not understand but she hardly had time to consider it the next instant the other woman was leaning forward hand outstretched you keep my secrets and i will keep yours teach me the ring and you can study stilling and gentling to your hearts content nynaeve barely managed to hold in a relieved sigh as she clasped the offered hand she had done it for the first time in what seemed forever someone had tried to bully her and failed she almost felt ready to face moghedien almost elayne caught up with min just outside the back door of the inn and fell in beside her min had what looked like two or three white shirts wadded under one arm the sun sat on the treetops and in the fading light the stableyard had the soft look of dirt not long turned with a huge stump that might have belonged to an oak right in the middle the thatchroofed stone stable had no doors allowing a good look at men moving among filled stalls surprisingly leane was talking to a large man on the edge of the stables shadow roughly dressed he looked a blacksmith or a brawler what was surprising was how close leane stood head tilted as she stared up at him and then she actually patted his cheek before turning away and hurrying back into the inn the big man stared after her a moment then melted into the shadows dont ask me what shes up to min said strange people come to see siuan or her and some of the men she well you saw elayne did not really care what leane did but now that she had min alone she did not know how to bring up what she wanted what are you doing laundry min muttered shifting the shirts irritably i cant tell you how good it is to see siuan the mouse for once she doesnt know whether the eagle is going to eat her or make her a pet but she has the same choice she gives everybody else none elayne quickened her pace to keep up as they crossed the stableyard whatever that was about it gave no opening did you know what thom was going to suggest we are staying i told them you would not a viewing mins step slowed again as they started between the stable and a crumbling stone wall down a dim alley of brush stubble and trampled weeds i just didnt think you would give up the chance to study again you were always eager nynaeve too even if she wont admit it i wish id been wrong id go with you at least i she muttered something furioussounding under her breath those three you brought with you are trouble and that isa viewing there it was the crack she needed but instead of asking what she had intended she said you mean marigan and nicola and areina how can they be trouble only a fool passed over what min saw i dont know exactly i only caught glimpses of aura and just out of the corner of my eye never when i was looking right at them where i might have made something out there arent many who have auras all the time you know trouble maybe theyll carry tales were you up to anything you wouldnt want the aes sedai to know about certainly not elayne said briskly min looked at her sideways and she added well nothing we didnt have to do they cant possibly know about it anyway this was not taking her where she wanted to go drawing a deep breath she leaped off the cliff min you had a viewing about rand and me didnt you she went two steps before she realized the other woman had stopped yes it was a wary word you saw that we were going to fall in love not exactly i saw youd fall in love with him i dont know what he feels for you only that hes tied to you some way elaynes mouth tightened that was about what she had expected but not what she wanted to hear wish and want trip the feet but is makes the path smoother that was what lini said you had to deal with what was not what you wished was and you saw there would be someone else someone id have to share him with two min said hoarsely two others and and im one mouth already open for the next question for a moment elayne could only stare you she got out at last min bristled yes me do you think i cant fall in love i didnt want to but i did and thats that she stalked past elayne down the alleyway and this time elayne was slower to catch up it certainly explained a few things how nervously min had always sidestepped talking about it the embroidery on her lapels and unless she was imagining it min was wearing rouge too how do i feel about itshe wondered she could not sort it out who is the third she asked quietly i dont know min mumbled only that she has a temper not nynaeve thank the light she gave a weak laugh i dont think i could have survived that once more she gave elayne a cautious sidelong look what does this mean between you and me i like you i never had a sister but sometimes i feel like you i want to be your friend elayne and i wont stop liking you whatever happens but i cant stop loving him i dont very much like the idea of having to share a man elayne said stiffly that was certainly an understatement me neither only elayne it shames me to admit it but i will take him any way i can get him not that either of us has much choice light hes scrambled my whole life just thinking about him scrambles my brains min sounded as if she did not know whether to laugh or cry elayne exhaled slowly not mins fault was it better that it was min rather than say berelain or somebody else she could not abide taveren she said he bends the world around him we are chips caught in a whirlpool but i seem to recall you and me and egwene saying wed never let a man come between us being friends we will work it out somehow min and when we find out who the third is well well work that out as well somehow a thirdcould shebe berelain oh blood and ashes somehow min said bleakly meanwhile you and i are caught here in a leg trap i know theres another i know i cant do anything about it but i had enough trouble reconciling myself to you and cairhienin women arent all like moiraine i saw a cairhienin noblewoman in baerlon once on the surface she made moiraine look like leane but sometimes she said things hinting and her auras i dont think a man in the whole town was safe alone with her not unless he was ugly lame and better yet dead elayne sniffed but she managed to make her voice light never you mind about that we have another sister you and i one youve never met aviendha is keeping a close eye on rand and he doesnt go ten steps without a guard of aiel maidens of the spear a cairhienin woman at least she had met berelain knew something of her no she was not going to fret over it like some brainless girl a grown woman dealt with the world as it was and made the best of it who could it be they had come out into an open yard dotted with cold ashes huge kettles most pitted where rust had been scrubbed away stood against the encircling stone wall which had been toppled in several places by trees growing up in it despite the shadows crossing the yard two steaming kettles still sat on flames and three novices hair sweatsoaked and white skirts tied up were hard at work on scrub boards stuck into broad washpots full of soapy water with a glance at the shirts under mins arm elayne embraced saidar let me help you with those channeling to do assigned chores was forbidden physical labor built character so they said but this could not be counted the same if she swirled the shirts around in the water violently enough there should be no reason to get their hands wet tell me everything are siuan and leane as changed as they seem how did you get here is logain reallyhere and why are you laundering some mans shirts everything min laughed plainly pleased to change the subject everything will take a week but ill try first i helped siuan and leane get out of the dungeon elaida had stuck them in and then making appropriate sounds of amazement elayne channeled air to lift one of the boiling kettles clear of its flames she hardly noticed the novices incredulous stares she was used to her own strength now and it rarely occurred to her that she did things without thinking that some full aes sedai could not do at all who was the third woman aviendha had betterbe keeping a close eye on him chapter dice news comes to cairhien a thin thread of blue smoke rising from the plain shortstemmed pipe clenched in his teeth rand rested one hand on the balconys stone railing and looked into the garden below sharp shadows were lengthening the sun was a red ball falling through a cloudless sky ten days in cairhien and this seemed the first moment he had stood still when he was not asleep selande stood close by his side pale face tilted up to watch him not the garden her hair was not so elaborately done as that of a woman of higher rank but it still added half a foot to her height he tried to ignore her but it was difficult to ignore a woman who insisted on pressing her firm bosom against your arm the meeting had gone on long enough for him to want a moments break he had known it for a mistake as soon as selande followed him out i know a secluded pool she said softly where this heat might be escaped a sheltered pool where nothing would disturb us the music of asmodeans harp drifted out through the square arches behind them something light cool sounding rand puffed a little more vigorously the heat nothing compared to the waste but autumn should be coming on yet the afternoon felt like the depths of summer a rainless summer shirtsleeved men in the garden were spreading water from buckets doing it late to avoid evaporation but too much was brown or dying the weather could not be natural the burning sun mocked him moiraine agreed and asmodean but neither knew what to do or how any more than he did sammael sammael he could do something about cool water selande murmured and you and i alone she snuggled closer though he did not see how it was possible he wondered when the next taunt would come no dashing off in a temper whatever sammael did once his methodical buildup in tear was done then he would loose the lightning one crushing stroke to put an end to sammael and add illian to his bag at the same time with illian tear and cairhien plus an army of aiel big enough to overwhelm any nation in weeks he would you not like to swim i do not swim well myself but surely you will teach me rand sighed for a moment he wished aviendha was there no the last thing he wanted was a bruised selande running screaming with her clothes half torn off hooding his eyes he looked down at her and spoke quietly around his pipe i can channel she blinked drawing back without moving a muscle they never understood why he would bring that up for them it was something to be glossed over ignored if possible they say ill go mad but im not mad yet not yet he chuckled from deep in his chest then cut it off abruptly made his face blank teach you to swim ill hold you up in the water with the power saidinis tainted you know the dark ones touch you wont feel it though all around you but youll not feel a thing another chuckle with a hint of a wheeze her dark eyes were as wide and round as they would go her smile a sickly rictus later then i want to be alone to think about he bent as if to kiss her and with a squeak she dropped a curtsy so sudden that at first he thought her legs had collapsed backing away curtsying hurriedly at every other step she babbled about the honor of serving him her deepest wish to serve him all in a voice on the brink of hysteria until she bumped into one of the square arches a final halfbend of her knees and she darted inside with a grimace he turned back to the railing frightening women she would have made excuses had he asked her to leave him would have taken a command as only a temporary setback unless it was to stay out of his sight and even then maybe word would spread this time he had to keep a short rein on his temper it ran away too easily of late it was the drought he could do nothing about the problems that sprang up like weeds wherever he looked a few moments more alone with his pipe who would rule a nation when he could have easier work such as carrying water uphill in a sieve across the garden between two of the royal palaces stepped towers he had a view of cairhien harshly lit and shadowed mastering the hills more than flowing over them his crimson flag with the ancient aes sedai symbol hung limply above one of those two towers a long copy of the dragon banner over the other that one flew a dozen places in the city including the tallest of the great unfinished towers right in front of him shouting had done as little as orders there neither tairens nor cairhienin could believe he really meant that he only wanted one and aiel did not care about banners one way or another even now deep inside the palace be could hear the murmur of a city jammed to bursting refugees from every corner of the land more afraid to return to their homes than they were to have the dragon reborn in their midst merchants seeping in selling whatever people could afford to buy and buying whatever people could not afford to keep lords and armed men rallying to his banner or to someones hunters for the horn thinking it must be found near him a dozen foregaters or a hundred were ready to sell it to any of them ogier stonemasons down from stedding tsofu to see if there was work for their fabled skills adventurers some of whom might have been bandits a week gone come to see what they could pick up there had even been a hundred or so whitecloaks though they had galloped out as soon as it was clear the siege had been lifted did pedron nialls ingathering of the whitecloaks concern him egwene gave him hints of things but she saw matters from the white tower wherever she stood the aes sedai point of view was not his at least the wagon trains full of grain were beginning to arrive from tear with some regularity hungry people could riot he wished he could have simply left it at being glad they were not so hungry anymore but there it was the bandits were fewer and the civil war had not resumed yet more good news he had to make certain it stayed that way before he could leave a hundred things to take care of before he could go after sammael only rhuarc and bael remained of the chiefs he really trusted those who had marched from rhuidean with him but if the four clans who had joined him late could not be trusted on the march to tear could he trust them loose in cairhien indirian and the others had acknowledged him as caracarn but they knew him as little as he knew them the message that morning might be a problem berelain first of mayene was only a few hundred miles south of the city on her way to join him with a small army he had no idea how she had led it across tear oddly her letter had asked if perrin was with him no doubt she feared rand might forget her small country if she did not remind him it might almost be a pleasure to watch her spar with the cairhienin the latest in a long line of firsts who had managed to keep tear from swallowing their country by playing the game of houses perhaps if he put her in charge here he would be taking meilan and the other tairens with him when the time came if it ever came this was no better than what was waiting inside tapping the dottle from his pipe he ground out the tabacs last sparks under his boot no need to risk fire to the garden it would go up like a torch the drought the unnatural weather he realized he was snarling silently first work on what he knew he could do something about it took an effort to smooth his face before he went in asmodean as well dressed as any lord with falls of lace at his neck plucked a soothing melody from his harp in one corner leaning against the dark severe paneling as if lounging at his leisure the others who were sitting bobbed out of their chairs at rands appearance and back down at his sharp gesture meilan torean and aracome occupied carvedandgilded chairs on one side of the deep red and gold carpet each with a young tairen lord at his back mirroring the cairhienin on the other side dobraine and manngil had a young lord apiece behind them too each with the front of his head shaved and powdered like dobraines a whitefaced selande stood at colavaeres shoulder and trembled when rand looked at her schooling his face he strode down the carpet to his own chair that chair alone was reason to control his features it was a new gift from colavaere and the other two in what they imagined was the tairen style he must like tairen gaudiness he ruled tear had sent them here carved dragons held it up all sparkling red and gold with enamel and gilt and great sunstones for their golden eyes two more made the arms and others climbed the tall back countless craftsmen must have gone without sleep since his arrival to make the thing he felt like a fool sitting on it asmodeans music had changed it had a grand sound now a triumphal march and yet there was an added wariness in those dark cairhienin eyes watching him a wariness reflected in the tairens it had been there before he went outside too perhaps in attempting to curry favor they had made a mistake that was only now dawning on them they had all tried to ignore who he was pretend he was simply some young lord who had conquered them who could be dealt with and manipulated that chair that throne held up in front of them who and what he really was are the soldiers moving on schedule lord dobraine the harp faded away as soon as he opened his mouth asmodean apparently absorbed in preening it the leathery man smiled grimly they are my lord dragon no more than that rand had no illusions that dobraine liked him more than any of the others did or that he would not try to gain advantage where he could but dobraine actually seemed ready to hold to the oath he had sworn the colorful slashes down the chest of his coat were worn from a breastplate being buckled over them maringil shifted forward on his chair whipslender and tall for a cairhienin white hair almost touching his shoulders his forehead was not shaved and his coat stripes nearly to his knees bore no visible wear we need those men here my lord dragon hawks eyes blinked at the gilded throne focused on rand again there are many bandits at large in the land yet he shifted again so he did not have to look at the tairens meilan and the other two were smiling faintly i have set aiel to hunting bandits rand said they did have orders to sweep up any brigands in their path and to not go out of their way to find them even aiel could not do that and move quickly im told that three days ago stone dogs killed nearly two hundred near morelle that was near the southernmost line claimed by cairhien in recent years halfway to the river iralell no need to let this lot know that those aiel might be as far as the river by now they could cover long distances faster than horses maringil persisted frowning uneasily there is another reason half of our land west of the alguenya is in the hands of andor he hesitated they all knew rand had grown up in andor a dozen rumors made him a son of one andoran house or another even a son of morgase herself either cast off because he could channel or fled before he could be gentled the slender man went on as if tiptoeing barefoot and blindfolded among daggers morgase does not seem to be reaching for more as yet but what she has already must be taken back her heralds have even proclaimed her right to the he stopped abruptly none of them knew who rand meant the sun throne for maybe it was morgase colavaeres dark gaze had rand on balance scales again she had said little today she would not until she learned why selandes face was so white suddenly rand was tired of nobles balking of all the maneuvering in daes daemar andoran claims to cairhien will be taken care of when i am ready those soldiers will go to tear you will follow the high lord meilans good example of obedience and ill hear no more on it he swung toward the tairens your example is a good one meilan isnt it and yours aracome if i ride out tomorrow i wont find a thousand defenders of the stone camped ten miles south who were supposed to be on their way back to tear two days ago will i or two thousand armsmen from tairen houses those faint smiles faded with each word meilan became very still dark eyes glittering and aracomes narrow face went pale whether from anger or fear it was hard to say torean dabbed at his lumpy face with a silk handkerchief pulled from his sleeve rand ruled in tear and meant to rule callandordriven into the heart of the stone proved that that was why they had not protested against his sending cairhienin soldiers to tear they thought to carve new estates perhaps kingdoms here far from where he ruled you will not my lord dragon meilan said finally tomorrow i will ride with you so you may see for yourself rand did not doubt it a rider would be dispatched south as soon as the man could arrange it and by tomorrow those soldiers would be far on toward tear it would do for now i am done then you may leave me a few starts of surprise masked so quickly they might have been imagined and they were rising bowing and curtsying selande and the young lords backing away they had expected more an audience with the dragon reborn was always long and tortuous as they saw it with him firmly bending them the way he meant them to go whether it was declaring that no tairen could claim lands in cairhien without marrying into a cairhienin house or refusing to allow the expulsion of foregaters or making laws apply to nobles that had never applied to any but commoners before his eyes followed selande for a moment she was not the first in the last ten days nor the tenth or even the twentieth he had been tempted at least at first when he rejected slender plump promptly replaced her as tall or dark for cairhienin anyway replaced short or fair a constant search for the woman who would please him the maidens turned back those who tried to sneak into his quarters at night firmly but more gently than aviendha had handled the one she caught aviendha apparently took elaynes ownership of him with little short of deadly seriousness yet her aiel sense of humor seemed to find tormenting him very satisfying he had seen the satisfaction on her face when he groaned and hid his face as she started undressing for the night thus he could have resented her deadly seriousness if he had not quickly understood what was behind that string of pretty young women my lady colavaere she stopped as soon as he spoke her name cooleyed and calm beneath her ornate tower of dark curls selande had no choice but to remain with her though she was plainly as reluctant to stay as the others were to go meilan and maringil bowed themselves out last so intent on colavaere and trying to puzzle out why she had been called to stay that they did not realize they were side by side their eyes were a perfect match dark and predatory the darkpaneled door closed selande is very pretty young woman rand said but some prefer the company of a more mature more knowledgeable woman you will sup alone with me tonight when second even is rung i look forward to the pleasure he waved her away before she could say anything if she could have her face did not change but her curtsy was a trifle unsteady selande looked purely amazed and infinitely relieved once the door had closed again behind the two women rand threw back his head and laughed a harsh sardonic laugh he was tired of the game of houses so he played it without thinking he was disgusted with himself for frightening one woman so he frightened another it was reason enough to laugh colavaere stood behind that line of young women who had been flinging themselves at him find a bedpartner for the lord dragon a young woman whose strings she pulled and colavaere would have a string tied firmly to rand but it was some other woman she meant to bed and perhaps even marry the dragon reborn now she would sweat all the hours until second even she had to know she was pretty if short of beautiful and if he rebuffed all the young women she sent perhaps it was because he wanted one with another fifteen or so years and she would be certain she did not dare say no to the man who held cairhien in his fist by tonight she should be amenable should stop this idiocy aviendha would very likely slit the throat of any woman she found in his bed besides he had no time for all these easily frightened doves thinking to sacrifice themselves for cairhien and colavaere there were too many problems to deal with and no time light what if colavaere decides its worth the sacrificeshe might she was easily coldblooded enough then ill have to see that its cold with fear it would not be difficult he could sense saidinlike something just beyond the edge of sight he could feel the taint on it sometimes he thought that what he felt was the taint in him now the dregs left by saidin he found that he was glaring at asmodean the man seemed to be studying him face expressionless the music resumed again like water babbling over stones soothing so he needed soothing did he the door opened without a knock admitting moiraine egwene and aviendha together the younger womens aiel garb framing the aes sedais pale blue for anyone else even rhuarc or another chief still near the city or yet another delegation of wise ones a maiden would have entered to announce them these three the maidens sent on in even if he was taking a bath egwene glanced at natael and grimaced and the tune became lower and for a moment intricate perhaps a dance before settling to what might have been the sighing of breezes the man wore a twisted smile directed at his harp im surprised to see you egwene rand said he swung his leg over the arm of the chair what is it six days youve been avoiding me have you brought me more good news has masema sacked amador in my name or have these aes sedai you say support me turned out to be black ajah you notice i dont ask who they are or where not even how you know i dont ask you to divulge aes sedai secrets or wise ones secrets or whatever they are just give me the driblets youre willing to dole out and let me worry whether what you dont care to tell me will stab me in the night she looked at him calmly you know what you need to know and i will not tell you what you do not need to know that was what she had said six days ago she was as much aes sedai as moiraine for all one wore aiel garb and the other pale blue silk there was nothing calm about aviendha she moved to stand shouldertoshoulder with egwene green eyes flashing back so straight it might have been iron he was half surprised moiraine did not join them so they could all three glare at him her vow of obedience left a startling amount of room it seemed and the three seemed to have become close since his argument with egwene not that it had been much of an argument you could not argue very well with a woman who watched with cool eyes never raised her voice and after one refusal to answer declined even to acknowledge your question again what do you want he said these came for you in the last hour moiraine said extending two folded letters her voice seemed to fit asmodeans chimelike tune rand rose to take them suspiciously if theyre for me how did they come into your hands one was addressed to rand althor in an exact angular hand the other to the lord dragon reborn in script flowing yet no less precise the seals were unbroken a second look made him blink the two seals seemed to be the same red wax and one bore the impression of the flame of tar valon the other a tower overlaid on what he recognized as the island of tar valon perhaps because of where they came from moiraine replied and from whom it was no explanation but it was as much as he would get unless he demanded more even then he would have to prod her through every step she kept her vow but in her own way there are no poison needles in the seals and no traps woven he paused with his thumb against the flame of tar valon he had not thought of either then broke it another flame in red wax stood beside the signature elaida do avriny aroihan in a hasty scrawl above her titles the rest was in the angular hand there can be no denial that you are the one prophesied yet many will try to destroy you for what else you are for the sake of the world this can not be allowed two nations have bent knee to you and the savage aiel as well but the power of thrones is as dust beside the one power the white tower will shelter and protect you against those who refuse to see what must be the white tower will see that you live to see tarmon gaidon none else can do this an escort of aes sedai will come to bring you to tar valon with the honor and respect you deserve this i pledge to you she doesnt even ask he said wryly he remembered elaida well for having met her only once a woman hard enough to make moiraine seem a kitten the honor and respect he deserved he would wager that the escort of aes sedai just happened to number thirteen passing elaidas letter back to moiraine he opened the other the page was covered in the same hand that had addressed it with respect i humbly beg to make myself known to the great lord dragon reborn whom the light blesses as savior of the world all the world must stand in awe of you who has conquered cairhien in one day as you did tear yet be wary i beseech you for your splendor will inspire jealousy even in those not toiled in the shadow even here in the white tower are the blind who cannot see your true radiance which will illumine us all yet know that some rejoice in your coming and will delight to serve your glory we are not those who would steal your luster for ourselves but rather those who would kneel to bask in your brilliance you shall save the world according to the prophecies and the world shall be yours to my shame i must beg you to let no one see these words and to destroy them when once read i stand naked of your protection among some who would usurp your power and i cannot know who around you is as faithful as i i am told that moiraine damodred may be with you she may serve you devotedly obeying your words as law as i will yet i cannot know for i remember her as a secretive woman much given to plotting as cairhienin are yet even if you believe she is your creature as i do i beg you to keep this missive secret even from her my life lies beneath your fingers my lord dragon reborn and i am your servant alviarin freidhen he read it through again blinking then handed it to moiraine she barely scanned the page before giving it to egwene who had her head over the other letter with aviendha perhaps moiraine already knew what they contained a good thing you gave your oath he said the way you used to be keeping everything back i might have been ready to suspect you by now a good thing youre more open now she did not react what do you make of it she must have heard about your swelled head egwene said softly he did not think he had been meant to hear shaking her head she said more loudly this doesnt sound like alviarin at all it is her hand moiraine said what do youmake of it rand i think theres a rift in the tower whether elaida knows it or not i assume an aes sedai cant write a lie more easily than she can speak one he did not wait for her nod if alviarin had been less flowery i might have thought they were working together to pull me in i cant see elaida even thinking half of what alviarin wrote and i cant see her having a keeper who could write it not if she knew you are not going to do this thing aviendha said elaidas letter crumpled in her hand it was not a question i am not a fool sometimes you are not she said grudgingly and made it worse by raising a questioning eyebrow to egwene who considered for a moment then shrugged do you see anything else moiraine asked i see white tower spies he told her dryly they know i hold the city for at least two or three days after the battle the shaido would have stopped anything but a pigeon going north even a rider who knew where to change horses no sure thing between cairhien and tar valon could not have reached the tower in time for these letters to come back today moiraine smiled you learn quickly you will do well for a moment she almost looked fond what will you do about it nothing except make sure that elaidas escort doesnt get within a mile of me thirteen of the weakest aes sedai could overwhelm him linked and he did not think elaida would send her weakest that and be aware that the tower knows what i do the day after i do it nothing more until i know more could alviarin be one of your mysterious friends egwene she hesitated and he suddenly wondered whether she had told moiraine any more than she had him was it aes sedai secrets she kept or wise ones at last she said simply i do not know a rap came at the door and somara put her flaxen head into the room matrim cauthon has come caracarn he says that you sent for him four hours ago as soon as he had learned mat was back in the city what would the excuse be this time it was time to be done with excuses stay he told the women wise ones made mat almost as uneasy as aes sedai did these three would put him off balance he did not give a second thought to using them he was going to use mat too send him in somara mat strolled into the room grinning as if it was a common room his green coat hung open and his shirt was half unlaced exposing the silver foxhead dangling on his sweaty chest but the dark silk scarf was draped around his neck to hide his hanging scar in spite of the heat sorry if i took too long there were some cairhienin who thought they knew how to play cards doesnt he know anything livelier he asked jerking his head toward asmodean i hear rand said that every young man who can pick up a sword wants to join the band of the red hand talmanes and nalesean are having to turn them away in droves and daerid has doubled the number of his footmen mat paused in lowering himself into the chair aracome had used its true a fine lot of young fellows wanting to be heroes the band of the red hand moiraine murmured shen an calhar a legendary group of heroes indeed though the men in it must have changed many times in a war that lasted well over three hundred years it is said they were the last to fall to the trollocs guarding aemon himself when manetheren died legend says a spring rose where they fell to mark their passing but i rather think the spring was already there i wouldnt know about that mat touched the foxhead medallion and his voice picked up strength some fool got the name from somewhere and they all started using it moiraine glanced at the medallion dismissively the small blue stone hanging on the forehead seemed to catch the light and glow though the angles were wrong you are very brave it seems mat it was flatly said and the silence that followed stiffened his face very brave she said finally to lead shen an calharacross the alguenya and south against the andorans even braver than that for there are rumors that you went alone to scout the way and talmanes and nalesean had to ride hard to catch up to you egwene sniffed loudly in the background hardly wise for a young lord leading his men mats lip curled im no lord ive more respect for myself than that but very brave moiraine said as if he had not spoken andoran supply wagons burned outposts destroyed and three battles three battles and three victories with small loss to your own men though outnumbered as she fingered a rip in the shoulder of his coat he sank back as far the chair would allow are you drawn to the thick of battles or are they drawn to you i am almost surprised you came back to hear the stories you might have driven the andorans back across the erinin had you stayed do you think this is funny mat snarled if you have something to say say it you can play the cat all you want but im no mouse for an instant his eyes flickered toward egwene and aviendha watching with folded arms and he fingered the silver foxhead again he had to be wondering it had stopped one womans channeling from touching him would it stop three rand only watched watched his friend being softened for what he meant to do to him is there anything left to me but necessityit was a quick thought there and gone he would do what he must the aes sedais voice gained a rime of crystal frost as she spoke almost in an echo we all do as we must as the pattern decrees for some there is less freedom than for others it does not matter whether we choose or are chosen what must be must be mat did not look softened at all wary yes and certainly angry but not softened he could have been a tomcat backed into a corner by three hounds a tomcat who meant to go down hard he seemed to have forgotten anyone was in the room except for himself and the three women you always have to push a man where you want him dont you kick him there if he wont go led by the nose blood and bloody ashes dont glare at me egwene ill speak the way i want burn me all it needs is for nynaeve to be here yanking her braid out of her head and elayne staring down her nose well im glad she isnt to hear the news but even if you had nynaeve id not be shoved what news rand said sharply news elayne shouldnt hear mat looked up at moiraine you mean theres something you havent ferreted out what news mat rand demanded morgase is dead egwene gasped clasping both hands to her mouth below eyes like huge circles moiraine whispered something that might have been a prayer asmodeans fingers never faltered on the harp rand felt as if his belly had been ripped out elayne forgive me and a faint echo altered ilyena forgive me are you certain as certain as i can be without seeing the body it seems gaebril has been named king of andor and cairhien too for that matter supposedly morgase did it something about the times needing a strong mans hand or some such as if anybody could have a stronger than morgase herself only those andorans down south have heard rumors that she hasnt been seen in weeks more than rumors you tell me what it adds up to andors never had a king but now it has one and the queens vanished gaebrils the one wanted elayne killed i tried to tell her that but you know how she always knows more than a mudfooted farmer i dont think hed balk a second at slitting a queens throat rand discovered that he was sitting in one of the chairs across from mat though he did not remember moving aviendha laid a hand on his shoulder concern tightened her eyes i am all right he said roughly theres no need to send for somara her face reddened but he hardly noticed elayne would never be able to forgive him he had known that rahvin gaebril held morgase prisoner but he had ignored it because the forsaken might expect him to help her he had gone his own way to do what they did not expect and ended chasing couladin instead of doing what he planned he had known and concentrated his attention on sammael because the man taunted him morgase could wait while he smashed sammaels trap and sammael with it and so morgase was dead elaynes mother was dead elayne would curse him to her deathbed ill tell you one thing mat was going on there are a lot of queens men down there they are not so sure about fighting for a king you find elayne half of them will flock to you to put her on the shut up rand barked he quivered so hard with fury that egwene stepped back and even moiraine eyed him carefully aviendhas hand tightened on his shoulder but he shook it off as he stood morgase dead because he had done nothing his own hand had been on the knife as surely as rahvins elayne she will be avenged rahvin mat not gaebril rahvin ill lay him by the heels if i never do another thing oh blood and bloody ashes mat groaned this is madness egwene flinched as if realizing what she had said but she kept that firm calm voice you have your hands full with cairhien yet not to mention the shaido to the north and whatever it is youre planning in tear do you mean to start another war with two on your plate already and a ruined land besides not a war me i can be in caemlyn in an hour a raid right mat a raid not a war ill rip rahvins heart out his voice was a hammer he felt as if acid filled his veins i could wish i had elaidas thirteen sisters to take with me to smother him and bring him to justice tried and hung for murder that would be justice but hell just have to die however i can kill him tomorrow moiraine said softly rand glared at her but she was right tomorrow would be better a night to let his rage cool he needed to be cold when he faced rahvin now he wanted to seize saidinand lay about him destroying asmodeans music had changed again to a tune that street musicians in the city had played during the civil war you could still hear it sometimes when a cairhienin noble passed the fool who thought he was king get out natael get out asmodean straightened smoothly bowing but his face could have done for snow and he crossed the room quickly as if uncertain what one second more might bring he always pushed but perhaps this time he had pushed too far as he opened the door rand spoke again i will see you tonight or i will see you dead asmodeans bow was not so graceful this time as my lord dragon commands he said hoarsely and hurriedly pulled the door shut with him on the other side the three women looked at rand expressionless not blinking the rest of you go too mat practically bounded toward the door not you i have things to say to you yet mat stopped short sighing loudly and fiddling with his medallion he was the only one who had moved you do not have thirteen aes sedai aviendha said but you have two and myself i may not know as much as moiraine sedai but i am as strong as egwene and i am no stranger to the dance she meant the dance of spears what the aiel called battle rahvin is mine he told her quietly maybe elayne could forgive him a little if he at least avenged her mother probably not but maybe he could forgive himself a little he forced his hands to stay at his sides to not make fists will you draw a line on the ground for him to step over egwene asked put a chip on your shoulder have you considered that rahvin might not be alone if he calls himself king of andor now much good it will do when you appear if one of his guards puts an arrow through your heart he could remember wishing she would not shout at him but it had been so much easier then did you think i meant to go alone he had he had never thought of anyone to guard his back though now he could hear a small whisper he likes to come from behind or at your flanks he could hardly think clearly at all his anger seemed to have a life of its own stoking the fires that kept it boiling but not you this is dangerous moiraine can come if she wishes egwene and aviendha did not look at one another before stepping forward but they moved as one not stopping until they were so close even aviendha had to tilt her bead back to look up at him moiraine can come if she wishes egwene said if her voice was smooth ice aviendhas was molten stone but it is too dangerous for us have you become my father is your name bran alvere if you have three spears do you put two aside because they are newer made i do not want to risk you he said stiffly egwene arched her eyebrows oh that was all i am not gaishainto you aviendha bared her teeth you will never choose what risks i take rand althor never know it now he could what wrap them in saidinand leave them he still could not shield them so they might well snare him in return a fine mess all because they wanted to be stubborn you have thought of guards moiraine said but what if who is with rahvin is semirhage or graendal or lanfear these two might overwhelm one such but could you face her and rahvin together alone there had been something in her voice when she said lanfears name was she afraid that if lanfear was there he might finally join her what would he do if she was there what could he do they can come he said through clenched teeth now will you go as you command moiraine said but they were in no hurry about it aviendha and egwene took ostentatious care in rearranging their shawls before they started for the door lords and ladies might dart at his word but never them you did not try to talk me out of it he said abruptly he meant it for moiraine but egwene spoke first though to aviendha and with a smile stopping a man from what he wants to do is like taking a sweet from a child sometimes you have to do it but sometimes it just isnt worth the trouble aviendha nodded the wheel weaves as the wheel wills was moiraines reply she stood in the doorway looking more aes sedai than he ever remembered her ageless with dark eyes that seemed ready to swallow him slight and slender yet so regal she could have commanded a roomful of queens if she could not channel a spark that blue stone on her forehead was catching the light again you will do well rand he stared at the door long after it closed behind them it was a scuff of boots that recalled him to mats presence mat was trying to slide toward the door moving slowly so as not to be seen i need to talk to you mat mat grimaced touching the foxhead like a talisman he spun to face rand if you think im going to put my head on the block just because those fool women did you can forget it now im no bloody hero and i dont want to be one morgase was a pretty woman i even liked her as much as you can like a queen but rahvin is rahvin burn you and i shut up and listen you have to stop running burn me if i will this is no game i chose and i wont i said shut up rand drove the foxhead against mats chest with a hard finger i know where you got this i was there remember i cut the rope you were hanging from i dont know exactly what got shoved into your head but whatever it is i need it the clan chiefs know war but somehow you know it too and maybe better i need that so this is what youre going to do you and the band of the red hand be careful tomorrow moiraine said egwene paused at the door to her room of course well be careful her stomach was turning backflips but she kept her voice steady we know how dangerous facing one of the forsaken will be by aviendhas expression they might have been talking about what was for supper but then she was never afraid of anything do you now moiraine murmured be very careful anyway whether you think one of the forsaken is near or not rand will need both of you in the days to come you handle his temper well though i may say your methods are unusual he will need people who cannot be driven away or quelled by his rages who will tell him what he must hear instead of what they think he wants to you do that moiraine egwene told her of course but he will still need you rest well tomorrow will be difficult for us all she glided away down the corridor passing from dimness to pool of lamplight to dimness night was already coming to these shadowed halls and oil was in short supply will you stay with me awhile aviendha egwene asked i feel more like talking than eating i must tell amys what i have promised to do tomorrow and i must be in rand althors sleeping chamber when he comes elayne can never complain that you havent watched rand closely for her did you really drag the lady berwyn down the hall by her hair aviendhas cheeks colored faintly do you think these aes sedai in salidar will help him be careful of that name aviendha rand cannot be allowed to find them without preparation the way he was now they would be more likely to gentle him or at least send thirteen sisters of their own than help him she would have to stand between them in telaranrhiod she and nynaeve and elayne and hope those aes sedai had committed themselves too far to back out before they discovered how near the brink he was i will be careful rest well and eat well tonight in the morning eat nothing it is not good to dance the spears with a full stomach egwene watched her stride away before pressing her hands to her stomach she did not think she would eat tonight or in the morning rahvin and maybe lanfear or one of the others nynaeve had faced moghedien and won but nynaeve was stronger than she or aviendha when she could channel at all there might not be another rand said the forsaken did not trust one another she could almost wish he was wrong or at least that he was not so certain it was frightening when she thought she saw another man looking through his eyes heard another mans words come out of his mouth it should not be so everyone was reborn as the wheel turned but everyone was not the dragon reborn moiraine would not talk of it what would rand do if lanfear was there lanfear had loved lews therin telamon but what had the dragon felt for her how much of rand was still rand you will work yourself into a tizzy this way she said firmly youre not a child act like a woman when a serving woman brought her supper of snapbeans and potatoes and fresh baked bread she made herself eat it tasted like ashes mat strode through the dimly lit corridors of the palace and flung open the door of the rooms that had been set aside for the young hero of the battle against the shaido not that he had spent much time there hardly any servants had lit two of the standlamps hero he was no hero what did a hero get an aes sedai patting you on the head before she sent you out like a hound to do it again a noblewoman condescending to favor you with a kiss or laying a flower on your grave he stalked back and forth in his anteroom for once not pricing the flowered illianer carpet or the chairs and chests and tables gilded and inlaid with ivory the stormy meeting with rand had gone on till the sun set him dodging refusing rand following as doggedly as hawkwing after the rout at cole pass what was he to do if he rode out again talmanes and nalesean would surely follow with as many men as they could put in the saddle expecting him to find another battle and he probably would that was what really put a chill on it much as he hated to admit it the aes sedai was right he was drawn to battle or it to him nobody could have tried harder to avoid one on the other side of the alguenya even talmanes had commented on it until the second time his careful creeping away from one lot of andorans took them where there was no choice but to fight another and every time he could feel the dice rolling in his head it was almost like a warning that a fight was just over the next hill now there was always a ship or might be down at the docks beside the grain barges hard to find yourself in a battle on a ship in the middle of a river except the andorans held one bank of the alguenya for half its length or more below the city the way his luck was running the ship would run aground on the west bank with half the andoran army camped there that left doing what rand wanted he could just see it good morrow high lord weiramon and all you other high lords and ladies im a gambler a farmboy and im here to take command of your bloody army the bloody lord dragon reborn will be with us as soon as he flaming takes care of one bloody little matter snatching his blackhafted spear from the corner he hurled it the length of the room it struck a wall hanging a hunting scene and the stone wall behind with a loud clang then dropped to the floor leaving the hunters neatly sliced in two swearing he hurried to pick it up the twofoot swordblade was not chipped or marred of course not aes sedai work he fingered the ravens on the blade will i ever be free of aes sedai work what was that melindhra asked from the door he eyed her as he propped the spear against the wall and for a change it was not spungold hair or clear blue eyes or a firm body that he thought of it seemed that every aiel went to the river sooner or later to stare silently at so much water in one place but melindhra went every day just about has kadere found ships yet kadere would not be going to tar valon on grain barges the peddlers wagons are still there i do not know about ships she pronounced the unfamiliar word awkwardly why do you wish to know im going away for a while for rand he added hastily her face was too still id take you with me if i could but you wouldnt want to leave the maidens a ship or his own horse and to where that was the question he could reach tear quicker on a fast river ship than on pips if he was fool enough to make that choice if he had any choice melindhras mouth tightened briefly to his surprise it was not over his leaving her so you slip back into rand althors shadow you have gained much honor of your own among the aiel as well as the wetlanders your honor not honor reflected from the caracarn he can keep his honor and take it to caemlyn or the pit of doom for all i care dont you worry ill find plenty of honor i will write you about it from tear tear he would never escape rand or aes sedai if he made that choice he is going to caemlyn mat suppressed a wince he was not supposed to say anything about that whatever he decided about the rest he could do that much just a name pulled from my pocket because of the andorans down south i suppose i wouldnt know where hes he had no warning one instant she was just standing there the next her foot was in his middle driving out breath doubling him over eyes bulging he fought to keep his feet to straighten to think why she spun like a dancer backwards and her other foot against the side of his head drove him staggering without a pause she leaped straight up kicking out her soft bootsole taking him hard flush in the face when his eyes cleared enough to see he was on his back halfway across the room from her he could feel blood on his face his head seemed stuffed with wool and the room seemed to rock that was when he saw her take a knife from her pouch slim blade not much longer than her hand gleaming in the lamplight winding the shoufaaround her head in a quick motion she raised the black veil across her face groggily he moved by instinct without thinking the blade came out of his sleeve left his hand as if floating through jelly only then did he realize what he had done and stretch out desperately trying to snatch it back the hilt bloomed between her breasts she sagged to her knees fell back mat pushed himself up wavering on hands and knees he could not have stood if his life hung on it but he crawled to her muttering wildly why why he jerked her veil aside and those clear blue eyes focused on him she even smiled he did not look at the knifehilt his knifehilt he knew where the heart was in a body why melindhra i always liked your pretty eyes she breathed so faint he had to strain to hear why some oaths are more important than others mat cauthon the slimbladed knife came up swiftly all her remaining strength behind it the point driving the dangling foxhead against his chest the silver medallion should not have stopped a blade but the angle was just that much wrong and some hidden flaw in the steel snapped the blade off right at the hilt just as he caught her hand you have the great lords own luck why he demanded burn you why he knew there would be no answer her mouth remained open as though she might say something more but her eyes were already beginning to glaze he started to pull the veil back up to cover her face and staring eyes then let his hand fall he had killed men and trollocs but never a woman never a woman until now women were glad when he came into their lives it was not boasting women smiled for him even when he left them they smiled as if they would welcome him back that was all he ever really wanted from women a smile a dance a kiss and to be remembered fondly he realized his thoughts were babbling jerking the bladeless hilt from melindhras hand it was goldmounted jade inlaid with golden bees he hurled it into the marble fireplace hoping it shattered he wanted to cry to howl i dont kill women i kiss them i dont he had to think clearly why not because he was leaving surely she had hardly reacted to that besides she thought he was chasing off after honor she had always approved of that something she had said tugged at him and then came back with a chill the great lords own luck he had heard it differently many times the dark ones own luck a darkfriend a question or certainty he wished the thought made what he had done easier in his mind he was going to carry her face to his grave tear he had as much as told her he was going to tear the dagger golden bees in jade he would wager there were nine without looking nine golden bees on a field of green the sign of illian where sammael ruled could sammael be afraid of him how could sammael even know it was only a few hours since rand had asked mat told him and he was not sure himself what he was going to do maybe sammael would not take the chance right one of the forsaken afraid of a gambler however stuffed with other mens battle knowledge his head might be that was ridiculous it all came down to this he could believe that melindhra had not been a darkfriend that she had decided to kill him on a whim that there was no connection between a jade hilt inlaid with golden bees and his maybe going to tear to lead an army against illian he could if he was a bullgoose fool better to err toward caution he always said one of the forsaken had noticed him he certainly was not standing in rands shadow now sliding across the floor he sat with his chin on his knees and his back against the door staring at melindhras face trying to decide what to do when a servant knocked with his supper he shouted for her to go away food was the last thing he wanted what was he going to do he wished he did not feel the dice spinning in his head chapter crescent moon and stars choices laying down his razor rand wiped the last flecks of lather from his face and began doing up his shirtlaces early morning sunlight streamed through the square arches leading to his bedchamber balcony the heavy winter curtains had been hung but tied back to let in a breath of air he would be presentable when he killed rahvin the thought loosed a bubble of rage floating up out of his belly he forced it back down he would be presentable and calm cold no mistakes when he turned from the giltframed mirror aviendha was sitting on her rolledup pallet against the wall beneath a hanging portraying impossibly high gold towers he had offered to have another bed put in the room but she claimed mattresses were too soft for sleeping she was watching him intently her shift forgotten in one hand he had been careful about not looking around from his shaving to give her time to dress but aside from her white stockings she wore not a stitch i would not shame you in front of other men she said abruptly shame me what do you mean she stood in one smooth motion surprisingly pale where the sun had not touched her slender and hardmuscled yet with roundnesses and softnesses that haunted his dreams this was the first time he had allowed himself to look at her openly when she flaunted herself but she did not seem aware of it those big bluegreen eyes were fixed on his i did not ask sulin to include enaila or somara or lamelle that first day nor did i ask them to watch you or to do anything if you faltered that was only their own concern you just let me think they would try to carry me off like a babe if i wavered a fine distinction his wry tone flew right past her it made you take care when you needed to i see he said dryly well i thank you for the promise not to shame me in any case she smiled i did not say that rand althor i said not in front of other men if you require it for your own good her smile deepened do you mean to come like that he gestured irritably taking her in from head to toe she had never shown the slightest embarrassment at being naked in front of him far from it but she glanced down at herself then at him looking at her and her face reddened suddenly she was surrounded by a flurry of dark brown wool and white algode flying into her clothes so quickly that he could have thought she was channeling them on have you arranged everything came from the middle of it have you spoken to the wise ones you were gone late last night who else comes with us how many can you take no wetlanders i hope you cannot trust them especially not treekillers can you truly carry us to caemlyn in one hour is it like what i did the night i mean to say how will you do it i cannot like trusting myself to things i do not know and cannot understand everything is arranged aviendha why was she babbling and refusing to meet his eye he had met with rhuarc and the other chiefs still near the city they had not truly liked his plan but they saw it in terms of jietoh and none thought he had any other choice they discussed it quickly agreed and then turned the talk to other things nothing to do with forsaken or illian or battle at all women hunting whether cairhienin brandy could compare with oosquai or wetlander tabac with what was grown in the waste for an hour he had almost forgotten what lay ahead he hoped that the prophecy of rhuidean was somehow wrong that he would not destroy those men the wise ones had come to him a delegation of more than fifty alerted by aviendha herself and led by amys and melaine and bair or maybe by sorilea with wise ones often it was difficult to tell who was in charge they had not come to talk him out of anything jietohagain but to make sure he understood that his obligation to elayne did not outweigh that to the aiel and they had kept him in the meeting room until they were satisfied it was that or lift them bodily out of his way to reach the door when they wanted to be those women were as good at ignoring shouts as egwene had become well find out how many i can take when i try only aiel with luck meilan and maringil and the rest would not know he was gone until after he went if the tower had spies in cairhien maybe the forsaken did as well and how could he trust people to keep secrets who could not see the sun rise without trying to use the fact in daes daemar by the time he had shrugged into a red coat embroidered in gold a fine wool eminently suitable for a royal palace in caemlyn or cairhien the thought amused him in a bleak sort of way by that time aviendha was almost dressed it was a wonder to him how she could scramble into her clothes so quickly and yet have nothing out of place a woman came last night while you were away lighthe had forgotten colavaere what did you do she paused in tying the laces of her blouse eyes trying to bore a hole in his head but her tone was offhand i took her back to her own chambers where we talked for a time there will be no more treekiller flipskirts scratching at your tent flap rand althor the very end i aimed at aviendha light did you hurt her badly you cant go around beating ladies these people cause me enough trouble without you bringing more she sniffed loudly and went back to her laces ladies a woman is a woman rand althor unless she is a wise one she added judiciously that one sits lightly this morning but her bruises can be hidden and with a days rest she will be able to leave her chambers and she knows the right of matters now i told her if she caused you any bother again anybother i would come talk to her once more a much longer talk she will do as you say when you say it her example will teach others the treekillers understand nothing else rand sighed not a method he would or could have chosen but it might actually work or it might only make colavaere and the others more sly from now on aviendha might not be worried about repercussions against herself in fact he would be surprised if she had even considered the possibility but a woman who was high seat of a powerful house was not the same as a young noblewoman of lesser rank whatever the effect for him aviendha could find herself set upon in some dark hallway and given ten times what she had given colavaere if not worse next time let me handle matters my way i am the caracarn remember you have shaving lather on your ear rand althor muttering to himself he snatched up the striped towel and shouted come to a rap at the door asmodean entered pale lace at the neck and cuffs of his black coat harpcase slung on his back and a sword at his hip it might have been winter for the coolness of his face but his dark eyes were wary what do you want natael rand demanded i gave you your instructions last night asmodean wet his lips and glanced once at aviendha who was frowning at him wise instructions i suppose i might learn something to your advantage remaining here and watching but the talk this morning is all of the shrieks from lady colavaeres apartments last night it is said she displeased you though no one seems to know quite how that uncertainty is making everyone step lightly i doubt anyone will breathe in the next few days without considering what you might make of it aviendhas face was a picture of insufferable selfsatisfaction so you want to come with me rand said softly you want to be at my back when i face rahvin what better place for the lord dragons bard but better yet say under your eye where i can show my loyalty i am not strong asmodeans grimace seemed natural enough in any man making that admission but for an instant rand sensed saidinfilling the other man felt the taint that twisted asmodeans mouth just for an instant but long enough for him to judge if asmodean had drawn as much as he could he would be hard pressed to match one of the wise ones who could channel not strong yet perhaps i can help in some small way rand wished he could see the shield lanfear had woven she had said it would dissipate with time but asmodean did not seem able to channel any more strongly now than he had the first day he was in rands hands perhaps she had lied to give asmodean false hope to make rand believe the man would grow strong enough to teach him more than he ever would it would be like her he was uncertain whether that was his thought or lews therins but he was sure it was true the long pause made asmodean lick his lips again a day or two will not matter here you will be back by then or dead let me prove my loyalty perhaps i can do something a whisker more weight on your side might shift the balance once more saidinpoured into him just for a moment rand felt a sensation of strain yet it was still a feeble flow you know my choices i am clinging to that tuft of grass on the cliffs lip praying for it to hold one more heartbeat if you fail i am worse than dead i must see you win and live suddenly eyeing aviendha he seemed to realize he might have said too much his laugh was a hollow sound else how can i compose the songs of the lord dragons glory a bard must have something to work with the heat never touched asmodean a trick of the mind he claimed not the power but beads of sweat oozed down his forehead now under his eyes or left behind perhaps to run looking for a hiding place when he began wondering what was happening in caemlyn asmodean would be the man he was until he died and was reborn and perhaps even after under my eyes rand said quietly and if i even suspect that where that whisker falls might displease me i put my trust in the lord dragons mercy asmodean murmured bowing with the lord dragons permission i will wait outside rand glanced around the room as the man departed backing away still halfbowed his sword lay on the giltlined chest at the foot of the bed dragonbuckled sword belt wrapped around the scabbard and the seanchan spearhead the killing today would not be with steel not on his part he touched his pocket felt the hard carved shape of the fat little man with his sword that was the only sword he needed today for a moment he considered skimming to tear to take back callandor or even to rhuidean for what was hidden there he could destroy rahvin with either before the man knew he was there he could destroy caemlyn itself with either but could he trust himself so much power so much of the one power saidinhung there just out of sight the taint seemed part of him rage oozed just beneath the surface at rahvin at himself if it broke loose and he held even callandor what would he do he would be invincible with the other he could skim to shayol ghul itself put an end to it all end it now one way or another one way or another no he was not in this alone he could not afford anything but victory the world rides on my shoulders he murmured suddenly he yelped and clapped a hand to his left buttock it felt as though a needle had stabbed him but he did not need the goose bumps fading on his arms to tell him what had happened what was that for he growled at aviendha just to see whether the lord dragonwas still made of flesh like the rest of us mortals i am he said flatly and seized saidin all the sweetness all the filth just long enough to channel briefly her eyes widened but she did not flinch only looked at him as if nothing had occurred at all still as they crossed the anteroom she rubbed furtively at her bottom when she thought he was looking the other way it seemed she was ordinary flesh too burn me i thought id taught her a few manners pulling open the door he stepped out and stood staring mat was leaning on his odd spear with that broadbrimmed hat pulled low a little apart from asmodean but that was not took him aback there were no maidens he should have known something was wrong when asmodean came in unannounced aviendha was looking around in amazement as if she expected to find them behind one of the tapestries melindhra tried to kill me last night mat said and rand stopped thinking about maidens one minute we were talking the next she was trying to kick my head off mat told the story in short sentences the dagger with the golden bees his conclusions he closed his eyes when he told how he had ended it a simple stark i killed her and opened them again quickly as if he saw something behind his eyelids he did not care to see im sorry you had to do that rand said quietly and mat gave a bleak shrug better her than me i suppose she was a darkfriend he did not sound as if it made much difference i will settle sammael just as soon as im ready and how many will that leave the forsaken are not here aviendha snapped and neither are the maidens of the spear where are they what have you done rand althor me there were twenty right here when i came to bed last night and i havent seen one since perhaps it is because mat asmodean began and stopped when mat looked at him a tightmouthed blend of pain and readiness to hit something do not be fools aviendha said in a firm voice far dareis maiwould not claim tohagainst mat cauthon for this she tried to kill him and he killed her even her nearsisters would not if she had had any and no one would claim tohagainst rand althor for what another did unless he ordered it done youhave done something rand althor something great and dark or they would be here ive done nothing he told her sharply and i dont intend to stand here discussing it are you dressed for the ride south mat mat shoved a hand into his coat pocket fingering something he usually kept his dice and dicecup in there caemlyn im tired of them sneaking up on me i want to sneak up on one of them for a change i just hope i get the bloody pat on the head instead of the bloody flower he added with a grimace rand did not ask him what he meant another taveren two together to twist chance perhaps no way to tell how or even if butit seems like well be together a little longer mat looked more resigned than anything else before they had gone far down the tapestrylined corridor moiraine and egwene met them gliding along together as if the day held no more ahead than a walk in one of the gardens egwene cooleyed and calm golden great serpent on her finger really could have been aes sedai despite her aiel clothes and shawl and the folded scarf around her temples while moiraine gold threads caught the light faintly streaking moiraines gown of shimmering blue silk the small blue stone on her forehead hanging from its gold chain fastened in her waves of dark hair shone as brightly as the large goldset sapphires around her neck hardly suitable garb for what they intended yet in his red coat rand could not comment perhaps it was being here where house damodred had once held the sun throne but moiraines graceful carriage was more regal than he remembered ever seeing it not even the presence of jasin natael could spoil that queenly serenity with surprise but amazingly she gave mat a warm smile so you are going too mat learn to trust the pattern do not waste your life attempting to change what cannot be changed from mats face he might have been considering changing his mind about being there at all but the aes sedai turned from him without a trace of worry these are for you rand more letters he said one bore his name in an elegant hand that he recognized immediately from you moiraine the other carried thom merrilins name both had been sealed with blue wax apparently with her great serpent ring impressed with the image of the snake biting its own tail why write me a letter and sealed youve never been afraid to say whatever you wanted to say to my face if i ever forgot it aviendha has been reminding me that im only flesh and blood you have changed from the boy i first saw outside the winespring inn her voice was a soft silver chiming you are hardly the same at all i pray you have changed enough egwene murmured something low rand thought it was i pray you have not changed too much she was frowning at the letters as if she too wondered what was in them so was aviendha moiraine went on more brightly even briskly seals ensure privacy that contains things i wish you to think on not now when you have time for thinking as for thoms letter i know no safer hands than yours in which to place it give it to him when you see him again now there is something you must see at the docks the docks rand said moiraine this morning of all mornings ive no time for but she was already moving down the corridor as if sure he would follow i have had horses readied even one for you mat just in case egwene hesitated only a moment then followed rand opened his mouth to call moiraine back she had sworn to obey whatever she had to show him he could see it another day what could an hour hurt mat muttered perhaps he was reconsidering it would not be amiss for you to be seen this morning asmodean said rahvin might just know of it as soon as it happens if he has any suspicions if he has any spies who may have listened at keyholes it might allay them for today rand looked at aviendha do you also counsel delay i counsel that you listen to moiraine sedai only fools ignore aes sedai what could be at the docks more important than rahvin he growled then shook his head there was a saying in the two rivers not that anybody said it where women could hear the creator made women to please the eye and trouble the mind aes sedai were certainly no different in one respect one hour the sun was not yet high enough to lift the city walls long shadow from the stone quay where kaderes wagons were lined up but he still mopped his face with a large handkerchief it was only partly the heat that made him sweat great gray curtain walls stretching into the river at either end of the row of docks made the quay seem a dim box with him caught in it there were nothing but broad roundbowed grain barges docked here and the same anchored in the river waiting their turn to unload he had considered slipping onto one when it cast off but it meant abandoning most of what he still possessed yet had he thought the slow passage downriver would take him anywhere except to his death he would have lanfear had not returned to his dreams but he had the burns on his chest to remind him of her commands just the thought of disobeying one of the chosen made him shiver even with sweat rolling down his face if only he knew who to trust to the extent it was possible to trust any of his fellow darkfriends the last of his drivers who had sworn the oaths had vanished two days ago very likely on one of the grain barges he still did not know which aiel woman had slipped that note under his wagon door you are not alone among strangers a way has been chosen though he had several possibilities in mind the docks held almost as many aiel as they did workmen come to stare at the river he had seen a few of those faces more often than seemed reasonable and some had looked at him consideringly a few cairhienin had as well and a tairen lord that meant nothing by itself of course but if he could find a few men to work with a mounted party appeared in one of the gateways moiraine and rand althor leading the way with the aes sedais warder as they threaded though the carts hauling grainsacks away a wave of cheers rode with them all glory to the lord dragon and hail the lord dragon and now and again glory to lord matrim glory to the red hand for once the aes sedai turned down toward the tail end of the line of wagons without so much as a glance at kadere he was just as glad even if she had not been aes sedai even if she had not looked at him as if she knew every black corner of his mind he would as soon not have looked too closely at some of the things she had filled his wagons with yesterday evening she had made him strip the canvas off that oddly twisted redstone doorframe in the wagon just behind his she seemed to take a perverse delight in making him help her himself with whatever she wanted to study he would have covered the thing up again if he could bear to go near it or could make any of his drivers do so none with him now had seen herid fall half through it in rhuidean and half disappear herid had been the first to run away once they cleared the jangai the man had not been entirely right in the head after the warder hauled him back but they could look at it see the way the corners did not meet properly how you could not follow it around with your eyes without blinking and growing dizzy kadere ignored the first three riders as much as the aes sedai had ignored him and mat cauthon almost as much the man was wearing hishat he had never been able to find a replacement the aiel wench aviendha rode up behind the young aes sedais saddle both with their skirts pushed up to show their legs if he needed any confirmation that the aiel woman was bedding althor he only had to see the way she looked at him a woman who had taken a man to her bed always looked at him with that light of ownership in her eyes after more importantly natael was with them this was the first time kadere had been this close to him since crossing the spine of the world natael who stood high in the darkfriends if he could get past the maidens to reach natael suddenly kadere blinked where were the maidens althor always had an escort of spearwielding women frowning he realized he could not see a single maiden among the aiel on the quay or the docks arent you going to look at an old friend hadnan that melodious voice jerked kadere around gaping at a hatchetnosed face dark eyes almost hidden by rolls of fat keille it was impossible no one survived alone in the waste except aiel she hadto be dead but there she stood white silk straining over her bulk ivory combs standing tall in her dark curls a faint smile on her lips she turned with a grace that still surprised him in a woman so large and lightly climbed the steps into his wagon for a moment he hesitated then hurried after her he would as soon keille shaogi really had died in the waste the woman was bossy and obnoxious she need not think she was getting a penny of the little he had managed to salvage but she stood as high as jasin natael perhaps she would answer a few questions at the least he would have someone to work with at the worst someone to put blame on power went with standing high but so did blame for the failures of those beneath you more than once he had fed his superiors to those still higher up in order to cover himself carefully closing the door he turned and would have screamed if his throat had not clenched too tight for sound the woman who stood there wore white silk but she was not fat she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen eyes like dark bottomless mountain pools woven silver belting her narrow waist silver crescents in her shimmering black hair kadere knew that face from his dreams his knees thudding to the floor shook breath loose great mistress he said hoarsely how may i serve lanfear might have been looking at an insect one she might crush beneath her slipper or might not by showing your obedience to my commands i have been too busy to watch rand althor myself tell me what he has done aside from conquering cairhien what he plans to do it is difficult great mistress one such as myself cannot come close to such as he an insect those cool eyes said allowed to live so long as it was useful kadere racked his brain for everything he had seen or heard or imagined he is sending aiel south in huge numbers great mistress though i do not know why the tairens and cairhienin do not seem to notice but i dont think they can tell one aiel from another neither could he he would not dare lie to her but if she thought he had more use than he did he has founded a school of some sort in a city palace that belonged to a house with no survivors at first there was no way to tell whether she liked what she was hearing but as he went on her face began to darken what is it you want me to see moiraine rand said impatiently tying jeadeens reins to one wheel of the last wagon in line she was standing on tiptoe to peer over the side of the wagonbed at a pair of casks that seemed familiar unless he was mistaken they held the two cuendillarseals packed in wool for protection now that they were no longer unbreakable he felt the dark ones taint strongly here it almost seemed to come from the casks a faint miasma as from something rotting in a hidden place it will be safe here moiraine murmured lifting her skirts gracefully she started up the line of wagons lan heeled her a halftame wolf the cloak hanging down his back all disturbing ripples of color and nothingness rand glared did she tell you what it was egwene just that you had to see something that you had to come here anyway you must trust aes sedai aviendha said almost as levelly but with a hint of doubt mat snorted well i mean to find out now natael go tell bael ill be with him in at the other end of the line the side of kaderes wagon exploded splinters scything down aiel and townsfolk rand knew he did not need goose bumps prickling his skin to know he raced toward the wagon after moiraine and lan time seemed to slow everything happening at once as if the air were jelly clinging to each moment lanfear stepped out into stunned silence except for the moans and screams of the injured something limp and pale and redstreaked hanging from her hand dragging behind her as she walked down invisible steps her face was a mask carved of ice he told me lews therin she almost screamed flinging the pale thing into the air something caught it inflated it for a moment into a bloody transparent statue of hadnan kadere his skin removed whole the figure collapsed and fell as lanfears voice rose to a screech you let another woman touch you again moments clinging all happening at once before lanfear reached the stones of the quay moiraine lifted her skirts higher and began running straight toward her quick as she was lan was quicker ignoring her shout of no lan sword coming out long legs carried him ahead of her colorshifting cloak waving behind as he charged suddenly he seemed to run into an invisible stone wall bounce back try to stagger forward again one step and as if a giant hand had smashed him aside he flew ten paces through the air crashing to the stones while he was in midair moiraine jerked forward feet skidding along the pavement until she was face to face with lanfear it was only for a moment the forsaken looked at her as though wondering what could have gotten in her way then moiraine was flung to one side so hard she rolled over and over until she disappeared beneath one of the wagons the quayside was in turmoil just moments since kaderes wagon erupted yet only the blind could not know the one power was being wielded by the woman in white along the docks axes flashed cutting ropes freeing barges as their crews desperately fended the craft toward open water and flight barechested dockmen and darkclothed townsfolk struggled to jump aboard in the other direction men and women milled and screamed as they fought to pass through the gates into the city and among them cadinsorclad figures veiled themselves and rushed at lanfear with spears or knives or bare hands there could be no doubt she was the source of the attack no doubt she fought with the power they ran to dance the spears regardless fire rolled over them in waves arrows of it pierced those who came on with their clothes in flames it was not as if lanfear battled them or even paid them any real mind she might have been brushing aside gnats or bitemes those who fled burned as well as those who tried to fight she moved toward rand as if nothing else existed heartbeats only three steps she had taken when rand seized the male half of the true source molten steel and steelshattering ice sweet honey and midden heap deep in the void the fight for survival was distant the battle before him scarcely less as moiraine vanished beneath the wagon he channeled pulling the heat from lanfears fires sinking it into the river flames that a moment before engulfed human forms vanished in the same instant he wove the flows again and a misty gray dome came into being a long oval enclosing him and lanfear and most of the wagons an almost transparent wall that shut out all not already within even as he tied the weave he was not sure what it was or where it had come from some memory of lews therins perhaps but lanfears fires struck it and stopped he could see people outside dimly too many thrashing and flailing he had taken the flames not the searing of flesh that stench still hung in the air but none would burn now that had not already bodies lay inside too mounds of charred cloth some stirring feebly moaning she did not care her channeled flames winked out the gnats were dispelled she never glanced aside heartbeats he was cold in the emptiness of the void and if he felt sorrow for the dead and dying and scarred the feeling was so far off it might not have been he was cold itself emptiness itself only the rage of saidinfilled him movement to either side aviendha and egwene eyes concentrated on lanfear he had meant to shut them out from this they must have raced with him mat and asmodean outside the wall missed the final few wagons in icy calm he channeled air to snare lanfear egwene and aviendha could shield her while he distracted her something severed his flows they snapped back so hard that he grunted one of them lanfear snarled which is aviendha egwene threw her head back and wailed eyes bulging the worlds agony shrieking from her mouth which aviendha rose on tiptoes shuddering howls chasing egwenes as they climbed higher and higher the thought was suddenly there in the emptiness spirit woven so with fire and earth there rand felt something being cut something he could not see and egwene collapsed in a motionless heap aviendha to hands and knees head down and swaying lanfear staggered her eyes going from the women to him dark pools of black fire you are mine lews therin mine no rands voice seemed to come to his ears down a milelong tunnel distract her from the girls he kept moving forward did not look back i was never yours mierin i will always belong to ilyena the void quivered with sorrow and loss and with desperation as he fought something besides the scouring of saidin for a moment he hung balanced i am rand althor and ilyena ever and always my heart balanced on a razor edge i am rand althorother thoughts tried to well up a fountain of them of ilyena of mierin of what he could do to defeat her he forced them down even the last if he came down on the wrong side i am rand althoryour name is lanfear and ill die before i love one of the forsaken something that might have been anguish crossed her face then it was a marble mask once more if you are not mine she said coldly then you are dead agony in his chest as if his heart was about to explode in his head whitehot nails driving into his brain pain so strong that inside the void he wanted to scream death was there and he knew it frantically even in the void frantic emptiness shimmered dwindled he wove spirit and fire and earth flailing it wildly his heart was no longer beating fingers of dark pain crushing the void gray veil falling over his eyes he felt his weave slice raggedly through hers the burn of breath in empty lungs lurch of heart beginning to pump again he could see again silver and black flecks floated between him and a stonefaced lanfear still catching her balance from the rebound of her flows the pain was there in head and chest like wounds but the void firmed and bodily pain was remote well that it was distant for he had no time to recover forcing himself to move forward he struck at her with air a club to knock her senseless she slashed the weave and he struck again again again each time that she sliced through his last weave a furious rain of blows she somehow saw and countered always moving closer if he could keep her occupied for a moment more if one of those invisible cudgels landed on her head if he could get close enough to strike her with his fist unconscious she would be as helpless as anyone else suddenly she seemed to realize what he was doing still blocking his blows as easily as if she could see every one she danced backwards until her shoulders hit the wagon behind her and she smiled like winters heart you will die slowly and beg me to let you love me before you die she said it was not at him directly that she struck this time it was at his link to saidin panic rang the void like a gong at the first knifesharp touch the power diminishing as it slid deeper between him and the source with spirit and fire and earth he cut at the knife blade he knew where to find it he knew where his link was could feel that first nick her attempted shield vanished reappeared returned as fast as he could cut it but always with that momentary ebbing of saidin moments when it almost failed leaving his counterstroke barely enough to foil her attack handling two weaves at once should have been easy he could handle ten or more but not when one was a desperate defense against something he could not know was there until it was almost too late not when another mans thoughts kept trying to surface inside the void trying to tell him how to defeat her if he listened it might be lews therin telamon who walked away with rand althor a voice sometimes floating in his head if that ill make bothof those trulls watch you beg lanfear said but should i make them watch you die first or you them when had she climbed into the open wagonbed he had to watch her watch for any hint that she was tiring her concentration slipping it was a vain hope standing beside the twisted doorframe terangreal she looked down at him a queen about to pass sentence yet she could spare time for chill smiles at a dark ivory bracelet that she turned over and over in her fingers which will hurt you most lews therin i want you to hurt i want you to know pain such as no man has ever known the thicker the flow to him from the source the harder it would be to cut his hand tightened on his coat pocket the fat little stone man with his sword hard against the heron branded into his palm he drew on saidinas deeply as he could till the taint floated in the emptiness with him like misting rain pain lews therin and there was pain the world swallowed in agony not heart or head this time but everywhere every part of him hot needles stabbing into the void he almost thought he could hear a quenching hiss at each thrust and each came deeper than the last her attempts to shield him did not slow they came faster stronger he could not believe she was so strong clinging to the void to searing freezing saidin he defended himself wildly he could end it finish her he could call down lightning or wrap her in the fire she herself had used to kill images darted through the pain a woman in a dark merchants dress toppling from her horse the firered sword light in his hands she had come to kill him with a fistful of other darkfriends mats bleak eyes i killed her a goldenhaired woman lying in a ruined hallway where it seemed the very walls had melted and flowed ilyena forgive meit was a despairing cry he could end it only he could not he was going to die perhaps the world would die but he could not make himself kill another woman somehow it seemed the richest joke the world had ever seen wiping the blood from her mouth moiraine crawled out from beneath the tail of the wagon and rose unsteadily to her feet the sound of a mans laughter in her ears in spite of herself her eyes darted searching for lan found him lying almost against the foggy gray wall of the dome that stretched overhead he twitched perhaps trying to find strength to rise perhaps dying she forced him out of her mind he had saved her life so many times that by rights it should have belonged to him but she had long since done what she could to see that he survived his lone war with the shadow now he must live or die without her it was rand laughing on his knees on the stones of the quay laughing with tears streaming down a face twisted like a man being put to the question moiraine felt a chill if the madness had him it was beyond her she could only do what she could do what she must do the sight of lanfear hit her like a blow not surprise but the shock of seeing what had been in her dreams so often since rhuidean lanfear standing on the wagonbed blazing bright as the sun with saidar framed by the twisted redstone terangrealas she stared down at rand a pitiless smile on her lips she was turning a bracelet in her hands an angreal unless rand had his own angreal she should be able to crush him with that either he did or lanfear was toying with him it did not matter moiraine did not like that circle of carved agedark ivory at first glance it seemed to be an acrobat bending backwards to grip his ankles only a closer look would show that his wrists and ankles were bound together she did not like it but she had brought it out of rhuidean yesterday she had taken the bracelet from a sack of oddsandends and left it lying there at the foot of the doorframe moiraine was slight a small woman her weight did not disturb the wagon at all as she pulled herself up she winced as her dress caught on a splinter and tore but lanfear did not look around the woman had dealt with every threat except rand he was the only corner of the world she acknowledged in the least right then suppressing a small bubble of hope she could not allow herself that luxury moiraine balanced upright a moment on the wagontail then embraced the true source and leaped at lanfear the forsaken had an instants warning enough to turn before moiraine struck her clawing the bracelet away face to face they toppled through the doorframe terangreal white light swallowed everything chapter flame of tar valon fading words in the depths of a shrinking void rand saw moiraine hurtle seemingly out of nowhere to grapple with lanfear the attacks on him ceased as the two women plunged through the doorframe terangrealin a flash of white light that did not end it filled the subtly twisted redstone rectangle as though trying to flood through and striking some invisible barrier lightnings arched silver and blue around the terangreal more and more violently rasping buzzes crackled through the air rand staggered to his feet the pain was not gone really but the pressure was bringing promise that the pain would go his eyes could not leave the terangreal moiraine her name hung in his head sliding across the void lan lurched by him fixed on the wagon leaning as if only by moving forward could he stop from falling more than standing was beyond rand for the moment he channeled caught the warder in flows of air you you cant do anything lan you cant go after her i know lan said hopelessly held in midstep he did not struggle only stared at the terangrealthat had swallowed moiraine the light send me peace i know the wagon itself had caught fire now rand tried to suppress the flames but as soon as he drew the heat from one blaze the lightnings ignited another the doorframe itself was beginning to smoke though it was stone a white acrid smoke that gathered thickly under the gray dome even a whiff burned rands nostrils and made him cough his skin prickled and stung where the smoke brushed hastily he untied the weave of the dome dispelled it rather than wait for it to dissipate and wove around the wagon a tall chimney of air that gleamed like glass to carry the fumes high and away only then did he release lan he would not have put it past the man to follow moiraine anyway if he could have reached the wagon it was all in flames now the redstone doorway as well melting as if it were wax but for a warder that might not matter she is gone i cannot feel her presence the words sounded ripped out of lans chest he turned and began walking down the line of wagons without a backward glance following the warder with his eyes rand saw aviendha on her knees holding egwene releasing saidin he began to run down the quay physical pain that had been distant crashed home but he ran however awkwardly asmodean was there too looking around as if he expected lanfear to leap out from behind a wagon or a toppled graincart and mat squatting with his spear propped across his shoulder fanning egwene with his hat rand skidded to a halt is she i dont know mat said miserably she still breathes aviendha sounded uncertain how long that would continue but egwenes eyes fluttered open as amys and bair pushed roughly past rand with melaine and sorilea the wise ones knelt clustered around the younger women murmuring to themselves and each other as they examined egwene i feel egwene began weakly and stopped to swallow her face was bloodless pale i hurt a tear leaked from one eye of course you do sorilea said briskly that is what happens when you let yourself be caught in a mans schemes she cannot go with you rand althor melaines sunhaired beauty was openly angry but she was not looking at him it could have been anger at him or anger at what had happened i will be right as wellwater with a little rest egwene whispered bair dampened a cloth from a waterskin and laid it across egwenes forehead you will be right with a great deal of rest i fear you will not be meeting nynaeve and elayne tonight you will not go near telaranrhiodfor some days until you are stronger again do not give me that stubborn look girl we will watch your dreams to make sure if need be and give your care to sorilea if you so much as think of disobeying you will not disobey me more than once aes sedai or not sorilea said but with a touch of sympathy at odds with her leatheryfaced grimness frustration was plain in egwenes face i at least am well enough to do what must be done aviendha said in truth she looked not much less haggard than egwene but she managed a defiant stare at rand plainly expecting argument her defiance faded somewhat when she realized the four wise ones were looking at her i am she muttered of course rand said hollowly i am she insisted to him she carefully avoided meeting the wise ones gaze lanfear had me a moment less than she did egwene that was enough to make the difference between us i have tohto you rand althor i do not think we would have survived many moments more she was very strong her eyes darted down to the burning wagon fierce flames had already reduced it to a shapeless charred pile inside the glassy chimney the redstone terangrealwas no longer visible at all i did not see all that happened they are rand cleared his throat they are both gone lanfear is dead and so is moiraine egwene began to cry sobs shaking her in aviendhas clasp aviendha put her head down on the other womans shoulder as if she too might weep you are a fool rand althor amys said standing that surprisingly youthful face beneath her headscarf and white hair was stone hard about this and many other things you are a fool he turned away from the accusation in her eyes moiraine was dead dead because he could not bring himself to kill one of the forsaken he did not know whether he wanted to cry or laugh wildly if he did either he did not think he would be able to stop the dockside that had been emptying when he made the dome was filled again though few came nearer than where that misty gray wall had stood wise ones moved about aiding the burned comforting the dying assisted by whiterobed gaishainand men in the cadinsor moans and cries stabbed at him he had not been quick enough moiraine dead no healing for even the worst injured because he i could not the light help me i could not more aielmen stood watching him some only now unveiling he still did not see one maiden not only aiel were there dobraine bareheaded on a black gelding did not take his eyes from rand and not far off talmanes and nalesean and daerid sat their horses watching mat almost as closely as they did rand people lined the top of the great city wall outlined and cast in shadow by the rising sun and more along the curtain walls two of those shadowed shapes turned away when he looked up saw each other only twenty paces apart and seemed to recoil he would have wagered they were meilan and maringil lan was back with the horses at the last wagon in the line stroking aldiebs white nose moiraines mare rand went to him im sorry lan if id been faster if id he exhaled heavily i couldnt kill one so i killed the other the light burn me blindif it had at that moment he would not have cared the wheel weaves lan went to mandarb busied himself checking the black stallions saddlegirth she was a soldier a warrior in her way as much as i this could have happened two hundred times these past twenty years she knew it and so did i it was a good day to die his voice was as hard as it had ever been but those cold blue eyes were redrimmed still i am sorry i should have the man would not be comforted by shouldhaves and they dug at rands soul i hope you can still be my friend lan after i value your counsel and your swordtraining and ill need both in the days to come i am your friend rand but i cannot stay lan swung up into his saddle moiraine did something to me that has not been done in hundreds of years not since the time when aes sedai still sometimes bonded a warder whether he wanted it or not she altered my bond so it passed to another when she died now i must find that other become one of her warders i am one already i can feel her faintly somewhere far to the west and she can feel me i must go rand it is part of what moiraine did she said she would not allow me time to die avenging her he gripped the reins as if holding mandarb back as if holding himself back from digging his spurs in if you ever see nynaeve again tell her for an instant that stone face crumpled in anguish an instant then it was granite again he muttered under his breath but rand heard a clean wound heals quickest and pains shortest aloud he said tell her ive found someone else green sisters are sometimes as close to their warders as other women are to husbands in every way tell her ive gone to be a green sisters lover as well as her sword these things happen it has been a long time since ive seen her i will tell her whatever you say lan but i dont know that shell believe me lan bent from the saddle to catch rands shoulder in a hard grip rand remembered calling the man halftame wolf but those eyes made a wolf seem a lapdog we are alike in many ways you and i there is a darkness in us darkness pain death they radiate from us if ever you love a woman rand leave her and let her find another it will be the best gift you can give her straightening he raised one hand peace favor your sword taisharmanetheren the ancient salute true blood of manetheren rand lifted his hand taisharmalkier lan heeled mandarbs flanks and the stallion leaped forward scattering aiel and everyone else from his path as if to carry the last of the malkieri wherever he was headed at a gallop the entire way the last embrace of the mother welcome you home lan rand murmured then shivered that was part of the funeral service in shienar and elsewhere in the borderlands they were still watching him the aiel the people atop the walls the tower would know of today or a version of it as soon as a pigeon could fly there if rahvin did have some way of watching as well all it took was one raven in the city one rat here along the river he certainly would not expect anything today elaida would think him weakened perhaps more pliable and rahvin he realized what he was doing and winced stop it for one minute at least stop and mournhe did not want all those eyes on him aiel fell back before him almost as readily as they had before mandarb the dockmasters slateroofed hut was a single windowless stone room lined with shelves full of ledgers and scrolls and papers lit by two lamps on a rough table covered with tax seals and customs stamps rand slammed the door behind him to shut out eyes moiraine dead egwene injured and lan gone a high price to pay for lanfear mourn burn you he growled she deserved that much dont you have any feelings left but mostly he felt numb his body hurt but under it was deadness hunching his shoulders he stuffed his hands into his pockets and felt moiraines letters slowly he drew them out some things he should think on she had said stuffing thoms back he broke the seal on the other the pages were covered thickly with moiraines elegant script these words will fade within moments after this leaves your hands a warding attuned to you so be careful of it that you are reading this means that events have fallen out at the docks as i hoped he stopped staring then read on quickly since the first day i reached rhuidean i have known it need not trouble you how some secrets belong to others and i will not betray them that a day would come in cairhien when news would arrive of morgase i did not know what that would be if what we heard is true the light have mercy on her soul she was willful and stubborn with the temper of a lioness at times but for all that a true good and gracious queen but each time that news led to the docks on the following day there were three branches from the docks but if you are reading this i am gone and so is lanfear rands hands tightened on the pages she had known known and still she brought him here hurriedly he smoothed out the crumpled paper the other two paths were much worse down one lanfear killed you down the other she carried you away and when next we saw you you called yourself lews therin telamon and were her devoted lover i hope that egwene and aviendha have survived unharmed you see i do not know what happens in the world after except perhaps for one small thing which does not concern you i could not tell you for the same reason i could not tell lan even given the choices could not be sure which you would pick men of the two rivers it seems retain much of storied manetheren in them traits shared with men of the borderlands it is said that a borderlander will take a daggers wound to avoid harm to a woman and count it fair trade i dared not risk that you would place my life above your own certain that somehow you could sidestep fate not a risk i fear but a foolish certainty as today has surely proved my choice moiraine he muttered it was my choice a few final points if lan has not already gone tell him that what i did to him i did for the best he will understand one day and i hope bless me for it trust no woman fully who is now aes sedai i do not speak simply of the black ajah though you must always be watchful for them be as suspicious of verin as you are of alviarin we have made the world dance as we sang for three thousand years that is a difficult habit to break as i have learned while dancing to your song you must dance free and even the best intentioned of my sisters may well try to guide your steps as i once did please deliver thom merrilins letter safely when you meet him again there is a small matter that i once told him of which i must make clear for his peace of mind lastly be wary too of master jasin natael i cannot approve wholly but i understand perhaps it was the only way yet be careful of him he is the same man now that he always was remember that always may the light illumine and protect you you will do well it was signed simply moiraine she had almost never used her house name he reread the second last paragraph again closely somehow she had known who asmodean was it had to be that known that one of the forsaken was right there in front of her and never blinked once she had known why too if he read it right he would have thought in a letter that would go blank when he set it down she could have come right out and said what she meant not just concerning asmodean about how she had learned what she had in rhuidean something to do with wise ones or he missed his guess and as much chance of finding out more from the letter as from them about aes sedai was there a reason she mentioned verin and why alviarin instead of elaida even about thom and lan for some reason he did not think she had left a letter for lan the warder was not the only one who believed in clean wounds he almost took thoms letter out and opened it but she might have warded it the same way she had his aes sedai and cairhienin she had wrapped herself in mystery and manipulation to the end to the end that was what he was trying to avoid with all this blather about her keeping secrets she had known what would happen and come as bravely as any aiel come to her death knowing it waited she had died because he could not bring himself to kill lanfear he could not kill one woman so another died his eyes fell on the last words you will do well they cut like a cold razor why do you weep here alone rand althor i have heard that some wetlanders think it is shame to be seen weeping he glared at sulin standing in the doorway she was fully accoutered cased bow on her back quiver at her belt round hide buckler and three spears in hand im not there was dampness on his cheeks he scrubbed it away its hot in here makes me sweat like a what do you want i thought you had all decided to abandon me and go back to the threefold land it is not we who have abandoned you rand althor shutting the door behind her she sat on the floor and laid her buckler and a pair of the spears down you have abandoned us in one motion she put a foot against the last spear between her hands heaved and snapped it in two what are you doing she tossed aside the pieces and picked up another spear i said what are you doing the whitehaired maidens face might have given even lan pause but rand bent and seized the spear between her hands her softbooted foot came to rest against his knuckles not lightly will you put us in skirts and make us marry and tend hearth or are we to lie beside your fire and lick your hand when you give us a scrap of meat her muscles tensed and the spear broke scoring his palm with splinters he snatched his freed hand back with a curse shaking off droplets of blood i dont mean any such thing i thought you understood she took up the last spear set her foot and he channeled weaving air to hold her as she was she only stared at him wordlessly burn me you said nothing so i kept the maidens out of the battle with couladin not everyone fought that day and you never said a word sulins eyes widened in incredulity youkept usfrom the dance of spears wekept youfrom the dance you were like a girl newly wed to the spear ready to rush out and kill couladin with never a thought for the spear you might take from behind you are the caracarn you have no right to risk yourself needlessly her voice flattened now you go to fight the forsaken the secret is well kept but i have heard enough from those who lead the other societies and you want to keep me out of this fight as well he said quietly do not be a fool rand althor any could have danced the spears with couladin for you to risk it was the thinking of a child none among us can face the shadowsouled save you then why he stopped he already knew the answer after that bloodsoaked day against couladin he had convinced himself they would not mind he had wanted to believe they would not those who go with you have been chosen the words came like hurled stones men from every society men there are no maidens rand althor far dareis maicarries your honor and you take ours away he drew a deep breath fumbling for words i do not like to see a woman die i hate it sulin it curdles me up inside i could not kill a woman if my life hung on it the pages of moiraines letter rustled in his hand dead because he could not kill lanfear not always just his own life sulin i would rather go against rahvin alone than see one of you die a foolish thing everyone needs another to watch her back so it is rahvin even roidan of the thunder walkers and turol of the stone dogs held that back she glanced at her upraised foot held against the spear by the same flows that snared her arms release me and we will talk after a moments hesitation he unraveled the weave he was tensed to seize her again if need be but she only crossed her legs and sat bouncing the spear on her palms sometimes i forget you were raised out of our blood rand althor listen to me i am what i am this is what i am she hefted the spear sulin listen rand althor i amthe spear when a lover came between me and the spear i chose the spear some chose the other way some decide they have run with the spears long enough that they want a husband a child i have never wanted anything else no chief would hesitate to send me wherever the dance is hottest if i died there my firstsisters would mourn me but not a fingernail more than when our firstbrother fell a treekiller who stabbed me to the heart in my sleep would do me more honor than you do do you understand now i understand but he did understand she did not want him to make her something other than what she was all he had to do was be willing to watch her die what happens if you break the last spear if i have no honor in this life perhaps in another she said it as if it was just another explanation it took him a moment to comprehend all he had to do was be willing to watch her die you dont leave me any choices do you no more than moiraine had there are always choices rand althor you have a choice and i have one jietohallows no other he wanted to snarl at her to curse jietohand everyone who followed it choose out your maidens sulin i dont know how many i can take but far dareis maiwill have as many as any other society he stalked past her and her sudden smile not relief pleasure pleasure that she would have the chance to die he should have left her wrapped up in saidin left her to be dealt with somehow when he came back from caemlyn slamming the door open he strode out onto the quay and stopped enaila headed a line of maidens each with three spears in her hands a line leading back from the dockmasters door vanishing into the nearest of the gates to the city some of the aielmen on the dockside eyed them curiously but it was obviously something between far dareis maiand the caracarn and no business of any other society amys and three or four other wise ones who had once been maidens were watching more closely most of the nonaiel had gone except for a few men nervously righting overturned grain carts and trying to look elsewhere enaila stepped toward rand then halted and smiled as sulin came out not relief pleasure smiles of pleasure running back down that long line of maidens smiles on those wise ones too and a sharp nod for him from amys as if he had put an end to some idiotic behavior i thought maybe they were going to go in one at a time and kiss you out of your miseries mat said rand frowned at him standing there leaning on his spear and grinning widebrimmed hat tipped back on his head how can you be so cheerful the smell of seared flesh still hung in the air and the moans of burned men and women being cared for by wise ones because im alive mat snarled what do you want me to do cry he shrugged uncomfortably amys says egwene really will be all right in a few days he did look around then but as though he did not want to see what he saw burn me if were going to do this thing lets do it dovieandi se tovya sagain what i said its time to roll the dice did sulin stop up your ears time to roll the dice rand agreed the flames had died inside the glassy chimney of air but the white smoke still rose as though flames yet consumed the terangreal moiraine he should have done was done the maidens were crowding down around sulin as many as would fit onto the quay done was done and he had to live with it death would be a release from what he had to live with lets do it chapter dragon to caemlyn five hundred of the maidens behind sulin accompanied rand back to the royal palace where bael waited in the great court inside the front gates with thunder walkers and black eyes and water seekers and men from every other society their numbers filling the courtyard and crowding back into the palace through every door down to the smallest servants way some watched from lower windows waiting their turn to come out the surrounding stone balconies were empty in the entire courtyard only one man waited who was not aiel tairens and cairhienin especially cairhienin stayed clear when aiel gathered the exception stood above bael on the wide gray steps leading into the place pevin with the crimson banner hanging limply from its staff and no more expression surrounded by aiel than at any other time aviendha behind rands saddle clung tightly to him breasts pressed against his back until the very moment he dismounted there had been an exchange between her and some of the wise ones back at the docks that he did not think he had been supposed to hear go with the light amys had said touching aviendhas face and guard him closely you know how much depends on him much depends on you both bair told aviendha almost at the same time that melaine said irritably it would be easier if you had succeeded by now sorilea snorted even maidens knew how to handle men in my day she has been more successful than you know amys told them aviendha shook her head the rosesandthorns ivory bracelet slid down her arm as she raised a hand to forestall the other woman but amys went on over her halfformed protests i have waited for her to tell us but since she will not she saw him then standing only ten fret away with jeadeens reins in his hand and cut oft sharply aviendha turned to see what amys was staring at when her eyes found him bright crimson suffused her face then drained away so suddenly that even her sundark cheeks looked pale the four wise ones fixed him with flat unreadable gazes asmodean and mat came up behind him leading their horses do women learn that look in the cradle mat muttered do their mothers teach them id say the mightycaracarnwill get his ears singed if he stays around here much longer shaking his head rand reached up as aviendha swung a leg over to slide down and lifted her from the dapples back for a moment he held her by the waist looking down into her clear bluegreen eyes she did not look away and her expression never changed but her hands tightened slowly on his forearms what success was she supposed to have he had thought she was set to spy on him for the wise ones but if she ever asked a question about things he held back from the wise ones it was in open anger at him for keeping secrets from them never slyly never trying to ferret something out bludgeon maybe but never ferret he had considered the possibility that she was like one of colavaeres young women but only for the brief moment it took to think of the notion aviendha would never let herself be used in that way besides even if she had giving him one taste of herself then denying him so much as a kiss afterward not to mention making him chase her halfway around the world was no way to go about it if she was more than casual about being naked in front of him aiel customs were different if his distress at it satisfied her likely it was because she thought it was a great joke to play on him so what was she supposed to be successful at plots all around him was everyone scheming he could see his face in her eyes who had given her that silver necklace i like canoodling as much as the next man mat said but dont you think there are a few too many people watching rand released aviendhas waist and stepped back but no more quickly than she she bent her head fussing with her skirt muttering about how riding had disarrayed it but not before he saw her cheeks redden well he had not meant to embarrass her scowling around the courtyard he said i told you i dont know how many i can take bael with the maidens spilling back through the gates onto the ramp there was barely room to move in the courtyard five hundred from each society meant six thousand aiel the hallways inside must be packed the towering aiel chief shrugged like every other aiel there he had his shoufawrapped around his head ready to veil no crimson headband though it seemed at least half the others wore the blackandwhite disc on their foreheads every spear that can follow you will will the two aes sedai come soon no it was good that aviendha kept her promise not to let him touch her again lanfear had tried to kill her and egwene because she did not know which was aviendha how had kadere found out to tell her no matter lan was right women found pain or death when they came too close to him they will not be coming there are stories of trouble by the river a great victory bael rand said wearily and much honor earned but not by me pevin came down past bael to stand behind rands shoulder with the banner his narrow scarred face absolutely blank does the whole palace know about this then rand asked i heard pevin said his jaw worked chewing for more words rand had found him a replacement for his patched country coat good red wool and the man had had dragons embroidered on it one climbing either side of his chest that you were going somewhere that seemed to exhaust his store rand nodded rumors grew in the palace like mushrooms in the shade but as long as rahvin did not find out he scanned the tile roofs and towertops no ravens he had not seen a raven in some time though he heard of other men killing them perhaps they avoided him now stand ready he seized saidin floated in emptiness emotionless the gateway appeared at the foot of the steps first a bright line that seemed to turn opening into a square hole into blackness four paces wide not a murmur came from the aiel those beyond would be able to see him as through a smoked glass a dusky shimmering in the air but they could as well try walking through one of the palace walls from the side the gateway would be invisible except to the few close enough to see what might seem a long fine hair drawn tight four paces was as large as rand could make it there were limits for one man by himself asmodean claimed it seemed there were always limits the amount of saidinyou drew did not matter the one power had little to do with gateways really only the making beyond was something else a dream of a dream asmodean called it he stepped through onto what appeared to be a paving stone lifted from the courtyard but here the gray square hung in the midst of utter darkness with a sense that in every direction there was nothing nothing forever it was not like night he could see himself and the stone perfectly but everything else everywhere else was blackness it was time to see how large he could make a platform with the thought more stones appeared all at once duplicating the courtyard to an inch he imagined it larger still that quickly gray stone stretched as far as he could see with a start he realized that his boots were beginning to sink into the stone under his feet it looked no different yet it yielded slowly like mud oozing up around his boots hastily he brought everything back to a square the size of what was outside that much stayed solid then began increasing it by one outer row of stones at a time it did not take long to realize he could not make the platform much larger than his first attempt the stone still looked all right it did not sink beneath his feet but the second added row felt insubstantial like a thin shell that might crack at a wrong step was that because this was as large as the thing could be made or because he had not thought of it larger at first we all make our limits the thought slid up surprisingly from somewhere and we set them further out than we have any right rand felt himself shiver in the void it seemed like feeling someone else shiver it was well to be reminded that lews therin was still inside him he had to be careful not to fall into a battle for self while confronting rahvin if not for that he might have no what had happened on the quay was done he would not make a hash of it for breakfast reducing the platform by one outer ring of square stones he turned bael was waiting out there in what seemed a huge square doorway into daylight with the steps beyond at his side pevin looked no more perturbed by what he saw than the aiel chief which was to say not at all pevin would carry that banner wherever rand went even the pit of doom and never blink mat shoved back his hat to scratch his head then jerked it low again muttering something about dice in his head impressive asmodean said quietly quite impressive flatter him some other time harper aviendha said she was the first to step through watching rand not where she put her feet she walked all the way to him without once so much as glancing at anything except his face when she reached him though it was to swing away abruptly settling her shawl over her elbows and study the darkness sometimes women were stranger than anything else the creator could possibly have made bael and pevin came right behind her then asmodean one hand clutching the strap of his harpcase across his chest the other whiteknuckled on his sword hilt and mat swaggering but a trifle reluctant and grumbling as if arguing with himself in the old tongue sulin claimed the honor to be first else but soon a wide stream followed not just maidens of the spear but tain shari true bloods and far aldazar din brothers of the eagle red shields and dawn runners stone dogs and knife hands representatives of every society crowding through as the numbers increased rand moved to the far side of the platform from the gateway there was no need to see where he was going really but he wanted to in truth he could have remained at the other end or gone to one side direction here was mutable whatever way he chose to move would take him to caemlyn if done properly and to the endless black of nowhere if done wrong except for bael and sulin and aviendha of course the aiel left a little space around him and mat asmodean and pevin stay away from the edge rand said the aiel nearest him moved back all of a foot he could not see over the forest of shoufashrouded heads is it full he called the thing might hold half those who wanted to go but not many more is it full yes a womans voice called back finally reluctantly he thought it sounded like lamelle but there was still a milling in the gateway aiel sure there must be room for one more enough rand shouted no more clear the gateway everyone stand well clear he did not want what had happened to the seanchan spear to happen here to living flesh a pause and then it is clear it waslamelle he would have bet his last copper that enaila and somara were back there somewhere too the gateway seemed to turn sideways thinning until it vanished with one final flash of light blood and ashes mat muttered leaning disgustedly on his spear this is worse than the flaming ways which earned him a startled look from asmodean and a considering one from bael mat did not notice he was too busy glaring at the blackness there was no sense of motion no breeze to stir the banner pevin held they could have been standing still but rand knew better he could almost feel the place they were approaching draw nearer if you come out too close to him he will sense it asmodean licked his lips and avoided looking at anyone at least that is what i have heard i know where i am going rand said not too close but not too far he remembered the spot well no movement endless black and them hanging in it motionless half an hour passed perhaps a slight stir ran through the aiel what is it rand asked murmurs came across the platform someone fell a bulky man near him said at last rand recognized him meciar he was cor darei a night spear he wore the red headband not one of the rand began then caught sulin looking at him flateyed he turned to stare out into the darkness anger a stain clinging to the emotionless void so it was not supposed to matter more to him if one of the maidens had fallen was it it did falling forever through endless black would sanity crack before death came from starvation or thirst or fear in that fall even an aiel must eventually find fear strong enough to stop a heart he almost hoped so it must be more merciful than the other burn me what happened to all that hardness i was so proud of a maiden or a stone dog a spear is a spear only thinking it could not make it so iwill be hard he would let the maidens dance the spears where they wished he would and he knew he would search out the name of every one who died that every name would be another knifecut on his soul i will be hard the light help me i will the light help me seemingly motionless hanging in blackness the platform stopped it was hard to say how he knew when he could tell it was moving before but he did he channeled and a gateway opened in the same way it had in the courtyard in cairhien the angle of the sun had hardly changed but here earlymorning light shone on a paved street and a rising slope patched brown with droughtkilled grass and wildflowers a slope topped by a stone wall two spans high or more the stones worked rough so it seemed something natural above that wall he could see the golden domes of the royal palace of andor a few of the pale spires topped with banners rippling the white lion on a breeze on the other side of that wall was the garden where he had first met elayne blue eyes floated accusingly outside the void the darting memory of kisses stolen in tear the memory of a letter laying her heart and soul at his feet of messages borne by egwene professing love what would she say if she ever learned about aviendha about that night together in the snow hut memory of another letter icily spurning him a queen condemning a swineherd to outer darkness it did not matter lan was right but he wanted what who blue eyes and green and dark brown elayne who maybe loved him and maybe could not make up her mind aviendha who taunted him with what she would not let him touch min who laughed at him thought him a woolheaded fool all that flashed along the boundaries of the void he tried to ignore it to ignore anguished memories of another blueeyed woman lying dead in a palace corridor so long ago he had to stand there while aiel dashed out behind bael veiling themselves spreading left and right it was his presence that maintained the platform it would vanish as soon as he stepped through the gateway aviendha waited almost as calmly as pevin though she did occasionally put her head out to frown faintly in one direction or the other down the street asmodean fingered his sword and breathed too quickly rand wondered whether the man knew how to use the thing not that he would have to mat stared up the wall as though at a bad remembrance he had entered the palace this way once too the last veiled aiel went by and rand motioned the others out then followed the gateway winked out of existence leaving him in the middle of a long circle of wary maidens aiel were running down the curving street it followed the line of the hill all the streets of the inner city flowed with the land vanishing around winding corners as they hurried to find and secure anyone who might give alarm more were climbing the slope and some had even begun to scale the wall using tiny knobs and ridges for finger and toeholds suddenly rand stared to his left the street bowed downward and rounded out of sight the decline giving a view past tilecovered towers sparkling in the morning sun with a hundred changing colors across tile roofs all the way to one of the inner citys many parks its white walks and monuments forming a lions head when seen from this angle to his right the street rose a little before curving away more towers topped by spires or domes of various shapes glittering above the rooftops aiel filled the street fanning out quickly into side streets that spiraled away from the palace aiel and not a soul else the sun was high enough for people to be out and about their business even this close to the palace like a nightmare the wall above toppled outward in half a dozen places aiel and stones smashing down on those still climbing before those bouncing sliding chunks of masonry reached the streets trollocs appeared in the openings dropping the treethick battering rams they had used and drawing scythecurved swords more with spiked axes and barbed spears huge manshapes in black mail with spikes at shoulders and elbows huge manfaces distorted by snouts and muzzles beaks and horns and feathers plunging down the slope with eyeless myrddraal like midnight serpents in their midst all along the street howling trollocs and silent myrddraal poured from doorways leaped from windows lightning stabbed from the cloudless sky rand wove fire and air to meet fire and air a slowspreading shield racing lightnings fall too slow one bolt struck the shield directly above his head shattering in a blinding glare but others grounded themselves and his hair lifted as the air itself seemed to hammer him down almost he lost the weave almost the void itself but he wove what he could not see through eyes still filled with coruscating light spread the shield against bolts from the heavens that he could at least feel hammering at it hammering to reach him but that could change drawing saidinthrough the angrealin his pocket he wove the shield until he was sure it must cover half of the inner city then tied it off as he pushed himself to his feet sight began to return watery and painful at first he had to move fast rahvin knew he was here he had to surprisingly little time had passed seemingly rahvin had not cared how many of his own he took stunned trollocs and myrddraal on the slope were falling to spears in the hands of maidens many of whom moved unsteadily themselves some maidens those nearest rand were only now pulling themselves up from where they had been flung and pevin stood spraddlelegged holding himself upright with the red banners staff his scarred face still blank as slate more trollocs boiled through the gaps in the wall above and the din of battle filled the streets in all directions but it might as well have been in another country so far as rand was concerned there had been more than one bolt in that first volley but not all had been aimed at him mats smoking boots lay a dozen paces from where mat himself sprawled on his back tendrils of smoke rose from the black haft of his spear too from his coat even from the silver foxhead hanging out of his shirt that had not saved him from a mans channeling asmodean was a twisted shape of char recognizable only from the blackened harpcase still strapped to his back and aviendha unmarked she could have laid down to rest if she could have rested staring unblinking at the sun rand bent to touch her cheek cooling already it felt not like flesh raaaahviiiin it startled him a little that sound coming from his throat he seemed to be sitting somewhere deep in the back of his own head the void around him vaster emptier than it had ever been before saidinraged through him he did not care if it scoured him away the taint seeped through everything tarnished everything he did not care three trollocs broke past the maidens great spiked axes and oddly hooked spears in hairy hands alltoo human eyes fixing on him standing there apparently unarmed the one with a boars tusked snout went down with enailas spear through its spine eagles beak and bears muzzle raced on toward him one on booted feet the other on paws rand felt himself smile fire burst from the two trollocs a flame at every pore bursting through black mail even as their mouths opened to scream a gateway opened right where they stood bloody halves of burning cleanly sliced trolloc fell but rand was staring through the opening not into blackness but a great columned hall with lioncarved stone panels where a large man with wings of white in his dark hair started up in surprise from a gilded throne a dozen men some dressed as lords some in breastplates turned to see what their master was looking at rand barely noticed them rahvin he said or someone did he was not sure who sending fire and lightning ahead of him he stepped through and let the gateway close behind him he was death nynaeve was having no trouble maintaining the temper that allowed her to channel a flow of spirit to the amber sleeping woman in her pouch even the feel of unseen eyes could not touch her through her anger this morning siuan stood in front of her on a salidar street in telaranrhiod a street empty save for them a few flies and one fox that paused to look at them curiously before trotting on you must concentrate nynaeve barked you had more control than this the first time concentrate i amconcentrating you fool girl siuans plain blue wool dress was suddenly silk the sevenstriped stole of the amyrlin seat hung around her neck and a golden serpent bit its own tail on her finger frowning at nynaeve she did not seem aware of the change though she had already worn the same five times today if theres any difficulty it lies in that foultasting brew you fed me faagh i can still taste it like flatfish gall stole and ring vanished the silk dresss high neck plunged low enough to show the twisted stone ring dangling between her breasts on a fine gold chain if you didnt insist on me teaching you when you needed something to help you sleep you wouldnt need it so there had been a little sheepstongue root and a few other things that were not really necessary in the mix the woman deserved to have her tongue curdled you can hardly teach me when youre teaching sheriam and the others the silk paled the neck was high again surrounded by a white lace ruff and a cap of pearls fitted close on siuans hair or would you rather i came after them you claim you need somesleep undisturbed nynaeve quivered fists clenched at her sides sheriam and the others were not the worst thing stoking her anger she and elayne took turns bringing them to telaranrhiodtwo at a time sometimes all six in one night and even if she was the teacher they never let her forget she was accepted and they aes sedai one sharp word when they made a foolish mistake elayne had only been sent to scrub pots once but nynaeves hands were shriveled from hot soapy water back where her body lay sleeping they were anyway but they were not the worst nor was the fact that she barely had a moment to spare for investigating what if anything could be done about stilling and gentling logain was more cooperative than siuan and leane in any case or at least more eager thank the light he understood about keeping it secret or thought he did he probably believed she would heal him eventually no worse than that was that faolain had been tested and raised not aes sedai not without the oath rod which was tight in the tower but to something more than accepted faolain wore any dress she chose now and if she could not wear the shawl or choose an ajah she had been given other authority nynaeve thought she had fetched more cups of water more books left deliberately she was sure more pins and inkjars and other useless things in the last four days than she had her entire stay in the tower yet even faolain was not the worst of all she did not even want to remember that her anger could have heated a house in winter whats put a hook in your gills today girl siuan had on a gown like those leane wore only more sheer than even leane would ever wear in public so thin it was hard to tell what color it was not the first time she had had that on today either what was perking around in the back of the womans mind in the world of dreams things like these changes of clothing betrayed thoughts you might not even know you had you have been almost decent company until today siuan continued irritably then paused until today i see it now yesterday afternoon sheriam assigned theodrin to begin helping you break down that block youve built up is that what has your shift in a twist you dont like theodrin telling you what to do shes a wilder too girl if anyone can help you learn to channel without eating nettles first she and what has you so jittery you cant hold your dress still theodrin that was what really hurt the failure maybe its something i heard last night theodrin was eventempered goodhumored patient she said it could not be done in one session her own block had taken months to demolish and she had finally realized she was channeling long before going to the tower still failure hurt and worst of all if anyone ever discovered that she had cried like a baby in theodrins comforting arms when she knew she was failing i heard you heaved gareth brynes boots at his head when he told you to sit down and polish them properly he still doesnt know min does the polishing does he so he turned you upside down and siuans fullarmed slap rung her ears for an instant she could only stare at the other woman eyes going wider and wider with a wordless shriek she tried to punch siuan in the eye tried because somehow siuan had tangled a fist in her hair a moment later they were down in the dirt of the street rolling about and screaming flailing wildly grunting nynaeve thought she was getting the better of it even if she did not know whether she was on the top or the bottom half the time siuan was trying to yank her braid out by the roots with one hand while the other pounded at her ribs or anything else it could find but she had the other woman the same way and siuans yanking and punching were definitely growing weaker and she herself was going to pound siuan senseless in another minute then snatch her bald nynaeve yelped as a toe caught her hard on the shin the woman kicked nynaeve tried to knee her but it was not easy in skirts kicking was not fighting fair suddenly nynaeve realized that siuan was shaking at first she thought the woman was crying then she realized it was laughter pushing herself up she brushed strands of hair out of her face her braid was all but undone and glared down at the other woman what are you laughing at me if you are not at you at us still quivering with mirth siuan shoved nynaeve off her siuans hair was in wild disarray and dust covered the plain wool dress she wore now wornlooking and neatly darned in several places she was barefoot too two grown women rolling around like i havent done that since i was twelve i think i started thinking that all we needed would be fat cian snatching me up by an ear to tell me girls dont fight i heard she once knocked down a drunken printer i dont know why something very like giggles took her for a moment then she quieted them and stood brushing dust from her clothes if we have a disagreement we can settle it like adult women and in a careful tone still it might be a good idea not to discuss gareth bryne she gave a start as the worn dress became a gown red with blackandgold embroidery around hem and swooping neckline nynaeve sat there staring at her what would she have done as wisdom if she found two women rolling around in the dirt that way if anything the answer kept her anger at a simmer siuan still did not seem to realize that there was no need to brush away dust with your hands in telaranrhiod snatching away fingers that had been repairing her braid nynaeve got up quickly before she was on her feet again her braid hung perfect over her shoulder and her good two rivers woolens might have just been laundered i agree she said she would have made any two women she caught like that sorry they had been born even before she hauled them before the womens circle what was she doing lashing out with her fists like some fool man first cerandin she did not want to think about that episode but there it was then latelle and now this was she going to get around her block by being angry all the time unfortunately or perhaps fortunately that thought did nothing for her temper if we have disagreements we can discuss them which i suppose means well shout at one another siuan said dryly well better that than the other we would not have to shout if you drawing a deep breath nynaeve jerked her eyes away this was no way to begin anew that breath caught in her throat and she turned her head back to siuan so quickly it seemed she had been shaking it she hoped it did just for an instant there had been a face in a window across the street and there was a flutter in her belly a bubble of fear a burn of anger at being afraid i think we should go back now she said quietly go back you said that vile concoction would put me to sleep for a good two hours and we havent been here much more than half that time works differently here had it been moghedien the face had vanished so quickly it could have been someone dreaming herself here for an instant if it was moghedien they must not must not on any account let her know she had been seen they had to get away bubble of fear burn of anger i told you a day in telaranrhiodcan be an hour in the waking world or the other way round we ive dipped better out of the bilge in a bucket girl you neednt think you can get away with shortchanging me youll teach me everything you teach the others as agreed we can go when i wake up there was no time if it had been moghedien siuans dress was green silk now and the amyrlins stole and her great serpent ring were back but for a wonder the neckline was almost as low as anything she had worn before the ring terangrealhung above her breasts somehow part of a necklace of square emeralds nynaeve moved without thinking her hand lashed out snatched the necklace so hard it tore free from siuans neck siuans eyes widened but as soon as the clasp broke she vanished and necklace and ring melted from nynaeves hand for an instant she stared at her empty fingers what happened to someone sent out of telaranrhiodlike that had she sent siuan back to her sleeping body or to somewhere else to nowhere panic seized her she was just standing there quick as thought she fled the world of dreams seeming to change around her she stood on a dirt street in a small village of wooden houses none more than a single story the white lion of andor waved from a tall staff and a single stone dock stuck out into a broad river where a flock of longbilled birds flapped south low over the water it all looked vaguely familiar but it took her a moment to know where she was jurene in cairhien and that river was the erinin it had been here that she and egwene and elayne had boarded the darter as badly misnamed as the riverserpent to continue their journey to tear that time seemed like something read in a book long ago why had she jumped to jurene that was simple and answered as soon as she thought of it jurene was the one place she knew well enough to leap to in telaranrhiodthat she could be sure moghedien did not know they had been there for an hour before moghedien knew she existed and she was sure neither she nor elayne had ever mentioned it again in telaranrhiodor awake but that left another question the same one in a way why jurene why not step out of the dream wake up in her own bed such as it was if washing dishes and scrubbing floors on top of everything had not left her so weary she slept right on i can still step out moghedien had seen her in salidar if that had been moghedien moghedien knew salidar now i can tell sheriam how admit she was teaching siuan she was not supposed to have her hands on those terangrealexcept with sheriam and the other aes sedai how siuan got hold of them when she wanted nynaeve did not know no she was not afraid of more hours up to her elbows in hot water she was afraid of moghedien anger burned in her belly fiercely she wished she had some goosemint out of her scrip of herbs i am so sobloody tired of being afraid there was a bench in front of one of the houses overlooking dock and river she sat down and considered her situation from every angle it was ridiculous the true source was a pale thing she channeled a flame dancing in air above her hand shemight look solid to herself anyway but she could see the river through that scrap of fire she tied it off and it faded away like mist as soon as the knot was done how could she face moghedien when the weakest novice in salidar could match or better her strength that was why she had fled here instead of leaving telaranrhiod afraid and angry at being afraid too angry to think straight to consider her own weakness she would step out of the dream whatever siuans scheme had been it was done she would have to take her chances right along with nynaeve the thought of more hours scrubbing floors tightened her hand on her braid days more likely and maybe sheriams switch besides they might never let her near one of the dream terangrealagain or any terangreal they would set faolain over her instead of theodrin a finish to studying siuan and leane much less logain maybe a finish to studying healing in a fury she channeled another flame if it was a whit stronger she could not see it so much for trying to crank her anger in hope it would help theres nothing for it but to just tell them i saw moghedien she muttered yanking her braid hard enough to hurt light they willgive me to faolain id almost rather die but you seem to enjoy running little errands for her that mocking voice pulled nynaeve up off the bench like hands on her shoulders moghedien stood in the street all in black shaking her head at what she saw with all her strength nynaeve wove a shield of spirit and hurled it between the other woman and saidar tried to hurl it between it was like chopping at a tree with a paper hatchet moghedien actually smiled before she bothered to slice nynaeves weave and that as casually as brushing a biteme away from her face nynaeve stared at her as though poleaxed after everything it came down to this the one power useless all the anger bubbling inside her useless all her plans her hopes useless moghedien did not bother to strike back she did not even bother to channel a shield of her own that was how much contempt she had i was afraid you had seen me i grew careless when you and siuan started trying to kill each other with your hands moghedien gave a belittling laugh she was weaving something lazily because there was no reason to hurry nynaeve did not know what it was yet she wanted to scream fury seethed inside her but fear dulled her wits rooted her feet to the ground sometimes i think you are all too ignorant even to train you and the former amyrlin seatand all the rest but i cannot allow you to betray me that weave was reaching out for her it is time to collect you at last it seems hold moghedien birgitte shouted nynaeves mouth dropped open it wasbirgitte as she had been in her short white coat and wide yellow trousers intricate golden braid pulled over her shoulder silver arrow drawn on silver bow it was impossible birgitte was no longer part of telaranrhiod she was back in salidar making sure no one discovered nynaeve and siuan asleep with the sun up and began asking questions moghedien was so shocked the flows she had woven vanished shock lasted less than a moment though the gleaming arrow flew from birgittes bow and evaporated the bow evaporated something seemed to seize the archer jerking her arms straight up pulling her clear of the ground almost immediately she was snubbed short pulled tight between wrists and ankles a foot above the ground i should have considered the possibility of you moghedien turned her back on nynaeve to move closer to birgitte do you enjoy your flesh without gaidal cain nynaeve thought of channeling but what a dagger that might not even penetrate the womans skin fire that would not singe her skirts moghedien knew how useless she was she was not even looking at her if she stopped the flow of spirit to the sleeping woman in amber she would wake in salidar she could give warning her face twisted near to tears as she looked at birgitte the goldenhaired woman hung there staring defiantly at moghedien moghedien contemplated her in return as a woodcarver would a block of wood theres only me nynaeve thought i might as well not be able to channel at all theres only me lifting that first foot was like pulling it out of kneedeep mud the second staggering step no easier toward moghedien dont hurt me nynaeve cried please dont hurt me a chill ran through her birgitte was gone a child of perhaps three or four in short white coat and wide yellow trousers stood there playing with a toysized silver bow flipping her golden braid back the child aimed the bow at nynaeve and giggled then stuck a finger in her mouth as though unsure whether she had done something wrong nynaeve sagged to her knees it was hard work crawling in skirts but she did not think she could have remained standing somehow she managed reaching out a pleading hand and whimpering please dont hurt me please dont hurt me over and over as she dragged toward the forsaken a broken beetle scrabbling in the dirt moghedien watched silently until at last she said once i thought you were stronger than this now i find i truly like the sight of you on your knees that is close enough girl not that i think you have courage enough to try tearing myhair out she seemed amused by the notion nynaeves hand wavered a span from moghedien it had to be close enough there was only her and telaranrhiod the image formed in her head and there it was silver bracelet on her outstretched wrist silver leash linking it to the silver collar around moghediens neck it was not just the adamshe fixed in her head but moghedien wearing it moghedien and the adam a part of telaranrhiodthat she held in the form she wanted she knew something of what to expect she had worn an adams bracelet briefly once in falme in a strange way she was aware of moghedien in the same way she was aware of her own body her own emotions two sets each distinct but each in her own head one thing she had only hoped because elayne insisted it was so the thing was indeed a link she could feel the source throughthe other woman moghediens hand leaped to the collar shock rounding her eyes rage and horror rage more than horror at first nynaeve felt them almost as if they were her own moghedien had to know what the leashandcollar was yet she tried to channel anyway at the same time nynaeve felt a slight shifting in herself in the adam as the other woman tried to bend telaranrhiodto herself suppressing moghediens attempt was simple the adamwas a link with her in control knowing that made it easy nynaeve did not want to channel those flows so they were not channeled moghedien might as well have tried to pick up a mountain with her bare hands horror overwhelmed rage getting to her feet nynaeve fastened the proper image in her mind she did not just imagine moghedien leashed in the adam she knewmoghedien was leashed as firmly as she knew her own name the sense of shifting of her skin trying to crawl did not go away though stop that she said sharply the adamdid not move but it seemed to tremble unseen she thought of blackwasp nettles lightly brushing the other woman from shoulders to knees moghedien shuddered exhaled convulsively stop it i said or ill do worse the shifting ceased moghedien watched her warily still clutching the silver collar around her neck and with an air of being poised on her toes for flight birgitte the child who was or had been birgitte stood eyeing them curiously nynaeve formed the image of her as a grown woman concentrated the little girl put her finger back in her mouth and began studying the toy bow nynaeve breathed angrily it was hard changing what someone else was already maintaining and on top of that moghedien had claimed she could make changes permanent but what she could do she could undo restore her if you release me i nynaeve thought of nettles again and not a light brush this time moghedien sucked air through clenched teeth shook like a bedsheet in a high wind that birgitte said was the most frightening thing that has ever happened to me herself once more she wore the short coat and wide trousers but she had no bow or quiver i wasa child but at the same time what was me really me was just some fancy floating in the back of that childs mind and i knew it i knew i was just going to watch what happened and play flipping her golden braid back over her shoulder she gave moghedien a hard look how did you get here nynaeve asked i am grateful you understand but how birgitte gave moghedien a final stony stare then opened her coat to fish in the neck of her blouse pulling up the twisted stone ring on a leather thong siuan woke up just for a moment and not all the way long enough to grumble about you snatching this from her when you didnt wake right behind her i knew something must be wrong so i took the ring and the last of what you mixed for siuan there was hardly any left only the dregs enough to put me to sleep it tastes horrible by the way after that it was as easy as finding featherdancers in shiota in some ways this is almost as if i were still birgitte cut off with another glare for moghedien the silver bow reappeared in her hand and a quiver of silver arrows at her hip yet after one moment they vanished again past is past and the future is ahead she said firmly i was not truly surprised to realize there were two of you who knew they were in telaranrhiod i knew the other must be her and when i arrived and saw the pair of you it seemed as if she had already captured you but i hoped that if i distracted her you might come up with something nynaeve felt a stab of shame she had considered abandoning birgitte that was what she had almost come up with the thought had only been there for a moment rejected as soon as it came but it had come what a coward she was surely birgitte never had even moments when fear almost took control of her i a faint taste of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf i almost ran away she said faintly i was so frightened my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth i almost ran away and left you oh nynaeve writhed inside as birgitte considered her but you did not did you i should have loosed before i called out but ive never felt comfortable shooting anyone from behind even her still it all worked out but what do we do with her now moghedien certainly seemed to have overcome her fear ignoring the silver collar around her throat she watched nynaeve and birgitte as though they were the prisoners not she and she was deliberating what to do with them except for an occasional twitch of her hands as if she wanted to scratch where her skin held the memory of nettles she appeared blackclad serenity only the adamlet nynaeve know there was fear in the woman almost a gibbering but pushed down to a muted buzz she wished the thing let her know what moghedien was thinking as well as feeling then again she was just as glad not to be inside the mind behind those cold dark eyes before you consider anything drastic moghedien said remember that i know much that would be useful to you i have observed the other chosen peeked into their schemes is that not worth something tell me and i will consider whether its worth anything nynaeve said what could she do with the woman lanfear graendal rahvin and sammael are plotting together nynaeve gave the leash a short tug staggering her i know that tell me something new the woman was captive here but the adamonly existed so long as they were in telaranrhiod do you know they are drawing rand althor to attack sammael but when he does he will find the others as well waiting to trap him between them at least he will find graendal and rahvin i think lanfear plays another game one the others know nothing about nynaeve exchanged worried glances with birgitte rand must learn of this he would as soon as she and elayne could speak to egwene tonight if they could manage to put their hands on the terangreallong enough that is moghedien murmured if he lives long enough to find them nynaeve took hold of the silvery leash where it joined the collar and pulled the forsakens face close to hers dark eyes met her gaze flatly but she could feel anger through the adam and fear wriggling up and being stamped down you listen to me do you think i dont know why you are pretending to be so cooperative you think if you keep talking long enough i will make some slip and you can escape you think the longer we talk the harder ill find it to kill you that much was true enough to kill somebody in cold blood even one of the forsaken would be hard maybe harder than she could manage what was she going to do with the woman but you understand this i wont allow hinting at things if you try keeping anything back from me i will do to you everything you ever thought of doing to me dread creeping through the leash like bonechilling shrieks deep in moghediens mind maybe she did not know as much about adamas nynaeve thought maybe she believed nynaeve could read her thoughts if she tried now if you know of some threat to rand something ahead of sammael and the others you tell me now words spilled from moghediens mouth and her tongue flickered out to wet her lips continually althor means to go after rahvin today this morning because he thinks rahvin killed morgase i dont know whether he did or not but althor believes it but rahvin never trusted lanfear he never trusted any of them why should he he thought it all might be some trap set for him so he has laid a trap of his own he has set wards through caemlyn so if a man channels a spark he will know althor will walk right into it he almost certainly already has i think he meant to leave cairhien right after sunrise i had no part of it it was none of it my doing i nynaeve wanted to shut her up the fear sweat glistening on the womans face made her sick but if she had to listen to that pleading voice too she started to channel wondering whether she would be strong enough to hold moghediens tongue then smiled she was linked to moghedien and in control moghediens eyes bulged as she wove flows to stop her own mouth and tied them nynaeve added plugs for her ears too before turning to birgitte what do you think elaynes heart will break she loves her mother i know that nynaeve took a breath i will cry with her and mean every tear but right now i must worry about rand i think she was telling the truth i could almost feel it she caught the silver leash just below her bracelet and shook it maybe its this and maybe it was imagination what do you believe that its the truth she was never very brave unless she clearly had the upper hand or thought she could get it and you certainly put the fear of the light into her nynaeve grimaced birgittes every word put another bubble of anger in her belly she was never very brave except when she clearly had the upper hand that could describe herself she had put the fear of the light into moghedien she had and she had meant every word when she said it boxing somebodys ears when they needed it was one thing threatening torture wanting to torture even moghedien was something else again and here she was trying to avoid what she knew she had to do never very brave except when she clearly had the upper hand this time the bubble of anger was seeded by herself we have to go to caemlyn i do at least with her i may not be able to channel strongly enough to tear paper as i am but with the adami can use her strength you wont be able to affect anything in the waking world from telaranrhiod birgitte said quietly i know i know but i have to do something birgitte threw back her head and laughed oh nynaeve it is such an embarrassment being associated with such a coward as you abruptly her eyes widened in surprise there wasnt much of your potion left i think i am wak in midword she was simply no longer there taking a deep breath nynaeve untied the flows around moghedien or made her do it with the adamit was hard to tell which really she wished birgitte was still there another pair of eyes someone who probably knew telaranrhiodbetter than she ever could someone who was brave we are taking a trip moghedien and you are going to help me with every last scrap of you if anything takes me by surprise suffice it to say anything that happens to the one wearing this bracelet happens to the one wearing the collar only about tenfold the sickly look on moghediens face said she believed which was just as well since it was true another deep breath and nynaeve began forming the image of the one place in caemlyn she knew well enough to remember the royal palace where elayne had taken her rahvin must be there but in the waking world not the world of dreams still she had to do something telaranrhiodchanged around her chapter full aes sedai symbol the threads burn rand stopped a long scorch along the corridor wall marked where half a dozen costly tapestries had gone to ash flames licked upward on another a number of inlaid chests and tables were only charred ruins not his work thirty paces further on redcoated men in breastplates and helmets with barred faceguards lay contorted in death on the white floortiles useless swords in hand not his work either rahvin had been wasteful of his own in attempting to reach rand he had been clever in his attacks clever in his escapes but from the moment he fled the throneroom he had not faced rand for more than the instant it took to strike and flee rahvin was strong perhaps as strong as rand and more knowledgeable but rand had the fatlittleman angrealin his pocket and rahvin had none the corridor was doubly familiar once for having seen it before once for having seen something similar i walked this way with elayne and gawyn the day i met morgase the thought slithered painfully along the boundaries of the void he was cold in there without emotion saidinraged and burned but he was icy calm and another thought like a stab she lay on a floor like this her golden hair spread as though sleeping ilyena sunhair my ilyena elaida had been there that day too she foretold the pain id bring she knew the darkness in me some of it enough ilyena i did not know what i was doing i was mad am mad oh ilyena elaida knew some but she did not tell even all of that better if she had told oh light is there no forgiveness i did what i did in madness is there no mercy gareth bryne would have killed me had he known morgase would have ordered my death morgase would be alive perhaps elaynes mother alive aviendha alive mat moiraine how many alive if i had died i have earned my torment i deserve the final death oh ilyena i deserve death i deserve death bootsteps behind him he turned they came out of a broad crossing corridor not twenty paces from him two dozen men in breastplates and helmets and the whitecollared red coats of the queens guards except that andor had no queen now and these men had not served her while she lived a myrddraal led them pale eyeless face like something found under a rock overlapping plates of black armor heightening the illusion of a serpent as it moved black cloak hanging motionless however it moved the look of the eyeless was fear but fear was a distant thing in the void they hesitated when they saw him then the halfman raised its blackbladed sword men who had not already drawn put hands to hilts rand he thought that was his name channeled in a way he could not remember doing before men and myrddraal stiffened where they stood white frost grew thick on them frost that smoked as mats boots had smoked the myrddraals upraised arm broke off with a loud crack when it hit the floortiles arm and sword shattered rand could feel the cold yes that was his name rand cold like a knife as he walked past and turned the way they had come cold yet warmer than saidin a man and a woman crouched against the wall servants liveried in red and white short of their middle years and holding each other as though for protection seeing rand there was more to the name not just rand the man started to rise from where he had huddled away from the myrddraalled band but the woman hauled him back by his sleeve go in peace rand said putting out a hand althor yes rand althor ill not hurt you but you could be hurt if you stay the womans brown eyes rolled up in her head she would have collapsed in a heap if the man had not caught her and his narrow mouth was working rapidly as if he was praying but could not get the words out rand looked where the man was looking his hand had stretched out of his coatsleeve far enough to bare the dragons golden maned head that was part of his skin i will not hurt you he said and walked on leaving them there he had rahvin to corner yet rahvin to kill and then no sound but the click of his boots on the tiles and deep in his head a faint voice murmuring mournfully of ilyena and forgiveness he strained to feel rahvin channeling to feel the man filled with the true source nothing saidinseared his bones froze his flesh scoured his soul but from without it was not easy to see until you were close a lion in high grass asmodean had said once a rabid lion should asmodean count among those who should not have died or lanfear no not he had only a moments warning to throw himself flat a hairthin slice of time between feeling flows suddenly woven and an armthick bar of white light liquid fire slicing through the wall ripping across like a sword through where his chest had been where that bar slashed on both sides of the hallways wall and friezes doors and tapestries ceased to exist severed wallhangings and chunks of stone and plaster broken free rained to the floor so much for the forsaken fearing to use balefire who had told him that moiraine she surely had deserved to live balefire leaped from his hands a brilliant white shaft streaking toward where that other bar had originated the other failed even as his punched through the wall leaving a purple afterimage fanning across his vision he released his own flow had he done it finally scrambling to his feet he channeled air slamming ruined doors open so hard that the remnants ripped from the hinges inside the room was empty a sitting room with chairs arrayed before a great marble fireplace his balefire had taken a bite out of one of the arches leading to a small courtyard with a fountain and another from one of the fluted columns along the walk beyond rahvin had not gone that way though and he had not died in that blast of balefire a residue hung in the air a fading remnant of woven saidin rand recognized it different from the gateway he had made to skim to caemlyn or the one to travel he knew now that was what he had done into the throne room but he had seen one like this in tear had made one himself he wove another now a gateway an opening at least a hole in reality it was not blackness on the other side in fact if he had not known the way was there if he could not have seen the weave of it he might not have known there before him were the same arches opening onto the same courtyard and fountain the same columned walk for an instant the neatly rounded holes his balefire had made in arch and column wavered filled then were holes again wherever that gateway led it was to somewhere else a reflection of the royal palace as once it had been a reflection of the stone of tear vaguely he regretted not talking to asmodean about it while he had the chance but he had never been able to speak of that day to anyone it did not matter on that day he had carried callandor but the angrealin his pocket had already proved enough to harry rahvin stepping through quickly he loosed the weave and hurried away across the courtyard as the gateway vanished rahvin would have felt that gate if he was close enough and trying the fat little stone man did not mean he could stand and wait to be attacked no sign of life except for himself and one fly that was the way it had been in tear too standlamps in the hallways stood unlit with pale wicks that had never seen a flame yet even in what should have been the dimmest hall there was light seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere sometimes those lamps moved too and other things as well between one glance and the next a tall lamp might have moved a foot a vase in a niche an inch little things as if someone had shifted them in the time his eyes were away wherever this was it was a strange place it came to him as he trotted along another colonnade sensing for rahvin that he had not heard the voice crying over ilyena since he channeled balefire perhaps he had somehow chased lews therin out of his head good he stopped at the edge of one of the palace gardens the roses and whitestar bushes looked as drought bedraggled as they would have in the real palace on some of the white spires rising above the rooftops the white lion banner rippled but which spire could change in the blink of an eye good if i dont have to share my head with he felt odd insubstantial he raised his arm and stared he could see the garden through coatsleeve and arm as through a mist a mist that was thinning when he glanced down he could see the walks paving stones through himself noit was not his thought an image began to coalesce a tall darkeyed man with a worrycreased face and more white in his hair than brown i am lews ther i am rand althor rand broke in he did not know what was happening but the faint dragon was beginning to fade from the misty arm held in front of his face the arm began to look darker the fingers on his hand longer i am me that echoed in the void i am rand althor he fought to picture himself in his own mind struggled to make the image of what he saw in the mirror every day shaving what he saw in a standmirror dressing it was a frantic fight he had never really looked at himself the two images waxed and waned the older darkeyed man and the younger with bluegray eyes slowly the younger image firmed the older faded slowly his arm grew more solid his arm with the dragon twined around it and the heron branded into his palm there had been times he hated those marks but now even enclosed within the emotionless void he almost grinned to see them why had lews therin tried to take him over to make him into lews therin he was sure that was who that darkeyed man with the suffering face had been why now because he could in this place whatever it was wait it had been lews therin who shouted that adamant no not an attack by lews therin by rahvin and not using the power if the man had been able to do this back in caemlyn the real caemlyn he would have it had to be some ability he had gained here and if rahvin had gained it perhaps he had too the image of himself had been what held him brought him back he focused on the nearest rosebush a thing a span high and imagined it growing thin foggy obediently it melted away to nothing but as soon as the picture in his mind was nothing the rosebush was suddenly back just as it had been rand nodded coldly it had limits then there were always limits and rules and he did not know them here but he knew the power as much as asmodean had taught him and he had taught himself and saidinwas still in him all the sweetness of life all the corruption of death rahvin had to have seen him to attack with the power you had to see something to affect it or know exactly where it was in relation to you down to a hair perhaps it was different here but he did not think so he almost wished lews therin had not gone silent again the man might know this place and its rules balconies and windows overlooked the garden in some places four stories high rahvin had tried to unmake him he drew on the raging torrent of saidinthrough the angreal lightnings flashed from the sky a hundred forking silver bolts more stabbing at every window every balcony thunder filled the garden erupting chunks of stone the air itself crackled and the hair on his arms and chest tried to stand under his shirt even the hair on his head began to lift he let the lightnings die here and there bits of shattered stone window frame and balcony broke loose the crash of their fall muted by the echoes of thunder still ringing in his ears gaping holes peered down now where windows had they looked like sockets in some monstrous skull the ruined balconies like a dozen splintered mouths if rahvin had been at any of them he was surely dead rand would not believe it until he saw the corpse he wanted to see rahvin dead wearing a snarl he did not know was there he stalked back into the palace he had wanted to see rahvin die nynaeve hurled herself flat and scrambled along the hall floor as somethingslashed through the nearest wall moghedien slithered as fast as she but if the woman had not she would have hauled her by the adam had that been rand or rahvin she had seen bars of white fire liquid light like that in tanchico and she had no wish to be anywhere near one again she did not know what it was and she did not want to know i want to heal burn both of these fool men not learn a fancy way to kill she levered herself up to a crouch peered back the way they had come nothing an empty palace hallway with a tenfoot long gash through both walls as neat as any stoneworker could have done and bits of tapestry lying on the floor no sign of either man she had not had a glimpse of either so far only their handiwork sometimes that handiwork had almost been her a good thing that she could draw on moghediens anger filter it out of the terror clawing to escape and let it seep into her her own was a pitiful thing that would scarcely have allowed her to sense the true source much less channel the flow of spirit that kept her in telaranrhiod moghedien was hunched over on her knees dry retching nynaeves mouth tightened the woman had tried to remove the adamagain her cooperation had faded quickly when they discovered rand and rahvin actually here in telaranrhiod well trying to unfasten that collar when it was around your neck was its own punishment at least moghedien did not have anything left in her stomach this time please moghedien caught at nynaeves skirt i tell you we must get away stark panic made her voice painful moghediens clawing terror mirrored itself on her face they are here in the flesh the flesh be quiet nynaeve said absently unless youve lied to me that is an advantage for me the other woman claimed that being in the world of dreams physically limited your control of the dream or rather she admitted it after letting a bit of the knowledge slip she had admitted too that rahvin did not know telaranrhiodas well as she nynaeve hoped that meant he did not know it as well as shedid that he knew more than rand she did not doubt that woolheaded man whatever his reason for coming after rahvin he should never have let the man lead him here where he did not know the rules where thoughts could kill why will you not understand what i tell you even if they had only dreamed themselves here either would be stronger than we here in the flesh they could crush us without blinking in the flesh they can draw saidinmore deeply than we can draw saidardreaming we are linked still not paying attention nynaeve gave her braid a sharp pull no way to tell which direction they had gone and no warning of anything until she saw them somehow it still seemed unfair that they could channel without her being able to see or feel the flows a standlamp that had been sliced in two was suddenly whole again then not just as quickly that white fire must be incredibly powerful telaranrhiodusually healed itself rapidly whatever you did to it you brainless fool moghedien sobbed shaking nynaeves skirt with both hands as if wanting to shake nynaeve it does not matter how brave you are we are linked but you contribute nothing the way you are not a shred it is my strength and your madness they are here in the flesh not dreaming they are using things you have never dreamed of they will destroy us if we stay keep your voice down nynaeve snapped do you want to bring one of them down on us she looked both ways hurriedly but the hallway was still empty had that been footsteps boots rand or rahvin one had to be approached as carefully as the other a man in a fight for his life could strike out before he saw they were friends well that she was anyway we must go moghedien insisted but she did lower her voice she got to her feet sullen defiance twisting her mouth fear and anger writhed inside her first one stronger then the other why should i help you any further this is madness would you rather feel the nettles again moghedien flinched yet her dark eyes remained stubborn you think i will let them kill me rather than be hurt by you you aremad i will not stir from this spot until you are ready to take us away from here nynaeve jerked her braid again if moghedien refused to walk she would have to drag her not a very quick way to search with what seemed miles of palace corridors yet to go she should have been harsher when the woman first tried balking in nynaeves place moghedien would have killed without hesitation or if she thought the other useful woven the trick of taking someones will making them worship her nynaeve had tasted that once in tanchico and even had she known how it was done she did not think she could do it to somebody else she despised this woman hated her with all her being but even if she had not needed her she could not have killed her just standing there the trouble was she was afraid that moghedien knew that too now still a wisdom headed the womens circle even if the circle did not always agree and the womens circle dealt out punishments to women who broke the law or offended custom too deeply and to men too for some transgressions she might not have moghediens stomach for killing for crushing peoples minds but moghedien opened her mouth and nynaeve filled it with a gag of air or rather she made moghedien do it with the adamlinking them it was like channeling herself but moghedien knew it was her own abilities being used like a tool in nynaeves hand dark eyes glittered indignantly as moghediens own flows snared her arms to her sides and pulled her skirts tight around her ankles for the rest nynaeve used the adam just as with the nettles creating the sensations she wanted the other woman to feel not the reality the feelof reality moghedien stiffened in her bonds as a leather strap seemed to strike her bottom that was what it would feel like to her outrage and humiliation rolled through the leash and contempt compared to her elaborate ways of hurting people this seemed suitable for a child when you are ready to cooperate again nynaeve said just nod this could not take long she could not just stand there while rand and rahvin tried to kill one another if the wrong one died because she avoided danger by letting moghedien keep her there nynaeve remembered a day when she was sixteen just after she had been judged old enough to put her hair in a braid she had stolen a plum pudding from corin ayellin on a dare from nela thane and walked out the kitchen door right into mistress ayellin adding the aftermath sending it along the leash in a lump made moghediens eyes pop grimly nynaeve did it again she wont stop me shortagain i will help rand whatever she thinksagain even if it kills usagain oh light she could be right rand could kill us both before he knows its me again light i hate being afraidagain i hate heragain i hate heragain abruptly she realized moghedien was jerking frantically in her bonds nodding her head so violently it seemed about to come off for a moment nynaeve gaped at the other womans tearstreaked face then stopped what she was doing and hurriedly unraveled the flows of air light what had she done she was not moghedien i take it you wont give me any more trouble they will kill us the other woman mumbled faintly and nearly unintelligibly through her sobs but at the same time she nodded a hurried acquiescence deliberately nynaeve hardened herself moghedien deserved everything she had gotten and much much more in the tower one of the forsaken would have been stilled and executed as soon as the trial could be concluded and little evidence needed beside who she was good now we thunder shook the entire palace or something very much like thunder except that the walls rattled and dust rose off the floor nynaeve half fell into moghedien and they danced trying to keep their feet before the upheaval had faded completely it was replaced by a roar like some monstrous fire racing up a chimney the size of a mountain that lasted only a moment the silence after seemed deeper than before no there were boots a man running the sound echoed down the hallway from the north nynaeve pushed the other woman away come on moghedien whimpered but did not resist being pulled down the hall her eyes were huge though and her breath came too fast nynaeve thought it was a good thing she had moghedien along and not just for access to the one power after all her years hiding in shadows the spider was such a coward she almost made nynaeve feel brave by comparison almost it was only anger at her own fear that made her able to hold on to that one flow of spirit that kept her in telaranrhiod now moghedien was stark terror to her bones pulling moghedien behind her by the gleaming leash nynaeve quickened her step chasing the fading sound of those other steps rand stepped into the round courtyard warily half of the whitepaved circle cut into the structure rising three stories behind him the other half was bounded by a stone semicircle atop pale columns five paces high sticking out into yet another garden shaded gravel walks beneath low spreading trees marble benches surrounded a pool with lilypads and fish gold and white and red suddenly the benches shifted flowed changed into faceless manshapes still as white and hardlooking as the stone he had already learned the difficulty of changing something that rahvin had altered lightning danced from his fingertips shattering stone men to shards the air became water choking rand struggled to swim toward the columns he could see the garden beyond there must be some kind of barrier to stop all the water pouring out before he could channel gold and red and white shapes were darting around him larger than the fish in the pool had been and with teeth they ripped at him blood curled up in red mist instinctively he flailed at the fish with his hands but the cold part of him deep in the void channeled balefire flared at the barrier if there was one at any place rahvin might be to see this courtyard the water roiled throwing him around violently as it rushed in to fill the empty tunnels carved by balefire flickers of gold and white and red darted at him adding new threads of crimson to the water tossed about he could not see to aim his wild bolts they flashed in every direction no breath left he tried to think of air or the water being air suddenly it was he dropped hard to the paving stones among small fish flopping about rolled over and pushed himself up it was all air again even his clothes were dry the stone ring flickered between standing untouched and lying in ruins with half the columns down some of the trees lay tangled atop their own stumps then stood whole then were fallen again the palace behind him had holes punched in white walls even one through a high gilded dome above and gashes slashed across windows some with piercework stone screens the damage all flickered vanishing and reappearing not the slow sometime shifts of before but constant damage then none then some then none then all again wincing he pressed his hand to his side to the old halfhealed wound it stung as if his exertions had nearly torn it open he stung all over from a dozen or more bleeding bites that had not changed the bloody rips in his coat and breeches were still there had he managed to change the water back to air or had one of his frenzied bolts of balefire driven rahvin off or even killed him it did not matter unless it was the last wiping blood out of his eyes he studied the windows and balconies around the garden the colonnade high on the far side or rather he started to but something else caught his eye below the colonnade he could just make out the fading remnants of a weave from there he could tell it was a gateway but to see what kind and where it led he had to be closer leaping over a jumble of worked stone that vanished while he was above it he darted across the garden dodging around trees fallen on the walkway that residue was almost gone he had to get close enough before it vanished completely abruptly he fell gravel scraping his palms as he caught himself he could not see anything that might have tripped him he felt woozy almost as if he had been hit on the head he tried to scramble to his feet to reach that residue and realized his body was writhing long hair covered his hands his fingers seemed to be shrinking drawing back into his hands they were almost paws a trap rahvin had not fled the gateway had been a trap and he had walked into it desperation clung to the void as he struggled to cling to himself his hands they were hands almost hands he forced himself up his legs seemed to bend wrong the true source receded the void shrank streaks of panic flared beyond the emotionless emptiness whatever rahvin was trying to change him to it could not channel saidinslipping away thinning thin even pulled through the angreal the surrounding balconies stared down at him empty and the colonnade rahvin had to be at one of those stonescreened windows but which he had no strength for a hundred lightning bolts this time one burst he could manage that if he did it quickly which window he fought to be himself fought to draw saidininto him welcomed every stain of the taint as evidence that he still held the power staggering in a crooked circle searching vainly he roared rahvins name it sounded like a beasts roar pulling moghedien behind her nynaeve rounded the corner ahead of her a man vanished around the next turning the sound of his boots echoing behind she did not know how long she had been following those boots sometimes they had gone silent and she had had to wait for them to start again to gain a direction sometimes when they stopped things happened she had not seen any of it but once the palace had rung like a struck bell and another time the hair on her head had tried to stand up as the air seemed to crackle and another it did not matter this was the first time she had caught a glimpse of the man who wore those boots she did not think it was rand in that black coat the height was right but he was too large too heavy in the chest she was running before she knew it her stout shoes had long since become velvet slippers for silence if she could hear him he could hear her moghediens frenzied panting was louder than their footfalls nynaeve reached the turn and stopped peeking cautiously around the corner she held saidar through moghedien but it was hers ready to channel there was no need the hallway was empty a door stood far down a wall with windows filled with arabesquepierced stone but she did not think he could have reached that nearer another corridor ran off to the right she hurried to that looked warily again empty but a staircase spiraled upward just beyond where the hallways met for a moment she hesitated he had been hurrying somewhere this corridor led back the way they had come would he have been running to go back up then drawing moghedien behind her she climbed the steps slowly straining to hear anything except the forsakens nearly hysterical breath and the blood pounding in her own ears if she found herself face to face with him she knew he was there already somewhere ahead surprise had to be on her side at the first landing she paused the hallways here mirrored those below they were just as empty too just as silent had he gone on up the stair quivered faintly beneath her feet as if the palace had been struck by a huge battering ram then another again as a bar of white fire punched through the top of one of the stonescreened windows skewed wildly upward at an angle then winked out as it started to slice into the ceiling nynaeve swallowed blinking in a vain effort to rid herself of the pale violet fan that hung across her vision in memory of the thing that had to be rand trying to strike at rahvin if she was too close to him rand might catch her by accident if he was flailing like that it had had the look of flailing to her he could catch her anywhere without knowing it the quivers had ceased moghediens eyes shone with terror by what nynaeve felt through the adam it was a wonder the woman was not writhing on the floor shrieking and frothing at the mouth nynaeve felt a little like shrieking herself she made herself put her foot on the next step up was as good a way as any the second step was almost as hard slowly though no need to come on him too suddenly surprise had to be on his part moghedien followed like a whipped dog shivering as nynaeve climbed she embraced saidaras fully as she could as much as moghedien could handle to the point where the sweetness of it became almost a pain that was the warning more and she would approach the point where it was more than she could take in the point where she would still herself burn the ability to channel right out of herself or perhaps out of moghedien under the circumstances or both of them any way at all it would be disaster now she held that point though the life filling her a needles light pressure just short of breaking skin it was as much as she could have embraced had she been channeling on her own she and moghedien were much the same strength in the power tanchico had proved that was it enough moghedien insisted the men were stronger rahvin at least moghedien knew him and it did not seem likely rand could have survived this long unless he was just as strong it was not fair that men should have the muscles and greater strength in the power too the aes sedai in the tower had always said they had been equal it just was not she was babbling taking a deep breath she drew moghedien behind her off the staircase this was as high as it went this hall was empty she went to where it met the crossing corridor peeked and there he was a tall blackclad man large with wings of white in his dark hair peering through the curving slots of one of the stone windowscreens at something below there was sweat and effort on his face but he seemed to be smiling a handsome face as handsome as galads but she felt no quickening of her breath for this one whatever he was staring at rand perhaps had his full attention but nynaeve gave him no chance to notice her it might be rand down there she could not tell whether rahvin was channeling or not she filled the corridor around him with fire from wall to wall floor to ceiling pouring into it all of saidarshe held fire so hot the stone itself smoked the heat made her flinch back rahvin screamed in the middle of the flame it was one flame and staggered away from her back to where the hallway became a columned walk a heartbeat less while she still flinched and he stood inside the flame but surrounded by clear air every scrap of saidarshe could channel was going into that inferno but he held it at bay she could see him through the fire it gave everything a red cast but she could see smoke rose from his charred coat his face was a seared ruin one eye milky white but both eyes were malevolent as he turned them on her no emotion reached her along the adams leash only leaden dullness nynaeves stomach fluttered moghedien had given up given up because death was there for them fire thrust through the carved windowscreens above rand fingers of it filling every hole dancing toward the colonnade as it did the struggle within him ceased abruptly he was himself so suddenly it was almost a shock he had been drawing desperately at saidin trying to hold onto some of it now it rushed into him an avalanche of fire and ice that made his knees buckle made the void tremble with pain that shaved at it like a lathe and rahvin stumbled backwards out onto the colonnade face turned to something inside rahvin wreathed in fire yet somehow standing as though untouched if untouched now it had not been so before only the size of the figure the impossibility of it being anyone else told rand it was him the forsaken was a figure of char and cracked red flesh that would have strained any healer to mend the agony of it must have been overwhelming except that rahvin would be inside the void within that burned remnant of a man wrapped in emptiness where the bodys pain was distant and saidinclose at hand saidinraged inside rand and he loosed it all not to heal rahvin he screamed and balefire flew from his hands molten light thicker than a man driven by all the power he could draw it struck the forsaken and rahvin ceased to exist the darkhounds in rhuidean had become motes before they vanished whatever kind of life they had had struggling to continue or the pattern struggling to maintain itself even for them before this rahvin simply ceased rand let the balefire die pushed saidinaway a little trying to blink away the purple afterimage he stared up at the wide hole in the marble balustrade the remains of one column a fang above it stared at the matching hole in the palace roofs they did not flicker as if what he had done was too strong even for this place to mend after everything it seemed almost too easy perhaps there was something up there to convince him rahvin was really dead he ran toward a door frantically nynaeve threw everything into trying to close the flame tight around rahvin once more the thought came that she should have used lightning she was going to die those horrible eyes had fixed on moghedien not her but she was going to die too liquid fire sliced up into the colonnade so hot it made the fire she had made seem cool shock made her release her weaving and she flung up a hand to protect her face yet before it had raised halfway the liquid fire was gone so was rahvin she did not believe he had escaped there had been an instant so brief she could almost have imagined it when that white bar touched him and he became mist just an instant she could have imagined but she did not believe so she drew a shuddering breath moghedien had her face in her hands weeping trembling the one emotion nynaeve sensed through the adamwas relief so powerful it drowned anything else hurried boots grated on the stairs below nynaeve spun took a step toward the spiral staircase she was surprised to realize she was drinking deeply of saidar holding herself ready that surprise faded when rand climbed into sight he was not as she remembered his features were the same but his face was hard blue ice made his eyes the bloody rips in his coat and breeches the blood on his face seemed to suit that face the way he looked she would not be surprised if he killed moghedien on the spot the instant he discovered who she was nynaeve had uses for her yet he would recognize an adam without another thought she changed it let the leash vanish leaving only the silver bracelet on her wrist and the collar on moghedien a moment of panic when she comprehended what she had done then a sigh as she realized that she still felt the other woman it worked exactly as elayne had said it would perhaps he had not seen she was between him and moghedien the leash had trailed behind her he barely glanced at moghedien i thought about those flames coming up here i thought it might have been you or where is this is this where you meet egwene looking up at him nynaeve tried not to swallow so cold that face rand the wise ones say what youve done what you are doing is dangerous even evil they say you lose something of yourself if you come here in the flesh some part of what makes you human do the wise ones know everything he brushed past her and stood staring at the colonnade i used to think aes sedai knew everything it doesnt matter i dont know how human the dragon reborn can afford to be rand i she did not know what to say here let me heal you at least he held still for her to reach up and take his head in her hands for her part she had to suppress a wince his fresh wounds were not serious only numerous what could have bitten him she was sure most of these were bites but the old wound that halfhealed neverhealing wound in his side that was a sinkhole of darkness a well filled with what she thought the taint of saidinmust be like she channeled the complex flows air and water spirit even fire and earth in small amounts that made up healing he did not roar and flail about he did not even blink he shivered that was all then he took her wrists and brought her hands down from his face she was not reluctant his new injuries were gone every bite and scrape and bruise but not the old wound nothing had changed about that anything short of death should be capable of being healed even that anything is he dead he asked quietly did you see him die hes dead rand i saw he nodded but there are others still arent there other chosen nynaeve felt a stabbing sliver of fear from moghedien but she did not glance back rand you must go rahvin is dead and this place is dangerous for you as you are you must go and not come back here in the body i will go he did nothing that she could see or feel of course she could not but for a moment she thought the hallway behind him had turned in some way but it did not look any different except she blinked there was no halfgone column in the colonnade beyond him no hole in the stone railing he went on as if nothing had happened tell elayne ask her not to hate me ask her pain twisted his face for a moment she saw the boy she had known looking as though something precious was being ripped away from him she reached out to comfort him and he stepped back his face stone again and bleak lan was right tell elayne to forget me nynaeve tell her ive found something else to love and theres no room left for her he wanted me to tell you the same thing lan has found someone else too he said for you to forget him better never to have been born than to love us he stepped back again three long steps the hall seemed to turn dizzyingly with him in it or part of the hall did and he was gone nynaeve stared at where he had been and not at the fitfully flickering reappearance of the damage to the colonnade lan had told him to say that a remarkable man moghedien said softly a very very dangerous man nynaeve stared at her something new was coming through the bracelet to her fear was still there but muted by expectation might have been the best way to describe it i have been helpful have i not moghedien said rahvin dead rand althor saved none of it would have been possible without me nynaeve understood now hope more than expectation sooner or later nynaeve would have to wake the adamwould vanish moghedien was trying to remind her of her aid as if it had not had to be wrenched out of her just in case nynaeve might be steeling herself to kill before she went it is time for me to go too nynaeve said moghediens face did not alter but fear strengthened and so did hope a large silver cup appeared in nynaeves hand apparently filled with tea drink this moghedien edged back what not poison i could kill you easily enough without if that was my aim after all what happens to you here is real in the waking world too hope much stronger than fear now it will make you sleep a deep sleep too deep to touch telaranrhiod its called forkroot moghedien took the cup slowly so i cannot follow you i will not argue she tipped back her head and swallowed until the cup was empty nynaeve watched her that much should put her down quickly yet a cruel streak made her speak she knew it was cruel and did not care moghedien should not have any quiet rest at all you knew birgitte was not dead moghediens gaze narrowed slightly you knew who faolain is the other womans eyes tried to widen but she was already drowsy nynaeve could feel the forkroots effects spreading she concentrated on moghedien held there in telaranrhiod no easy sleep for one of the forsaken and you knew who siuan is that she used to be the amyrlin seat ive never mentioned that in telaranrhiod never ill see you very shortly in salidar moghediens eyes rolled up her head nynaeve was not sure whether it was the forkroot or a faint but it did not matter she released the other woman and moghedien winked out the silver collar rang as it hit the floortiles elayne would be happy about that at least nynaeve stepped out of the dream rand trotted along the corridors of the palace there seemed to be less damage than he remembered but he did not really look he strode out into the great courtyard at the front of the palace blasts of air knocked the tall gates half off their hinges beyond lay a huge oval plaza and what he had been searching for trollocs and myrddraal rahvin was dead and the other forsaken were elsewhere but there were trollocs and myrddraal to kill in caemlyn they were fighting a milling mass of hundreds perhaps thousands surrounding something he could not see through their blackmailed numbers as tall as a myrddraal on its horse just barely he could make out his crimson banner deep in their midst some swung round to face the palace as the gates were hurled asunder yet rand stopped dead balls of fire rolled through the packed blackmailed mass and burning trollocs lay everywhere it could not be not daring to hope or think he channeled shafts of balefire leaped from his hands as fast as he could weave them narrower than his little finger precise and cut off as soon as they struck they were much less powerful than the one he had used against rahvin at the end than any he had used against rahvin but he could not risk one slicing through to those trapped in the center of all those trollocs it made little difference the firststruck myrddraal seemed to reverse colors become a whiteclad black shape then it was drifting motes that vanished as its horse fled madly trollocs myrddraal every one that turned toward him went the same and then he began carving into the backs of those still facing the other way so a continuous haze of sparkling dust seemed to fill the air renewed as it evaporated they could not stand against that bestial cries of rage turned to howls of fear and they fled in every direction except toward him he saw one myrddraal try to turn them and be trampled under rider and horse but the rest spurred their animals away rand let them go he was busy staring at the veiled aiel bursting out of their encirclement with spears and heavybladed knives it was one of them carrying the banner aiel did not carry banners but this one a bit of red headband showing beneath his shoufa did there were battles going on down some of the streets leading from the plaza too aiel against trollocs townsfolk against trollocs even armored men in the uniform of the queens guards against trollocs apparently some who were willing to kill a queen could not stomach trollocs rand only barely noticed though he was searching through the aiel there a woman in a white blouse one hand holding up her bulky skirts as she slashed at a fleeing trolloc with a short knife an instant later flames enveloped the bearsnouted figure aviendha rand did not know he was running until he shouted aviendha and there was mat coat torn and blood on his swordblade spearpoint leaning on the black shaft watching the trollocs flee content to let someone else do the fighting now that that was possible and asmodean sword held awkwardly and trying to look every way at once in case any trolloc decided to turn back rand could sense saidinin him though weakly he did not think much of asmodeans fighting had been with that blade balefire balefire that burned a thread out of the pattern the stronger that balefire was the further back that burning went and whatever that person had done no longer had happened he did not care if his blast at rahvin had unraveled half the pattern not if this was the result he became aware of tears on his cheeks and let saidinand the void go he wanted to feel this aviendha snatching her up he whirled her around with her staring down at him as if he had gone mad he did not want to put her down but he did so he could hug mat or try to mat fended him off whats the matter with you youd think you thought we were dead not that we werent almost being a general has to be safer than this youre alive rand laughed he brushed back aviendhas hair she had lost her headscarf and it hung loose around her neck im happy youre alive thats all he took in the plaza again and his joy faded nothing could extinguish it but the bodies lying in heaps where the aiel had made their stand lessened it too many of them were not big enough to be men there was lamelle veil gone and half her throat as well she would never make him soup again pevin both hands clutching the wristthick shaft of the trolloc spear through his chest and the first expression on his face rand had ever seen surprise balefire had cheated death for his friends but not for others too many too many maidens take what you can have rejoice in what you can save and do not mourn your losses too long it was not his thought but he took it it seemed a good way to avoid going mad before the taint on saidindrove him to it where did you go aviendha demanded not angrily if anything she looked relieved one second you were there the next you were gone i had to kill rahvin he said quietly she opened her mouth but he put his fingers over it to silence her then gently pushed her away take what you can have leave it at that hes dead bael came limping up shoufastill around his head but veil hanging down his chest there was blood on his thigh and on the point of his one remaining spear as well the nightrunners and shadowtwisted are running caracarn some of the wetlanders have joined the dance against them even some of the armored men though they danced against us at first sulin was behind him unveiled a nasty red gash across her cheek hunt them down however long it takes rand said he began walking not sure where as long as it was away from aviendha i dont want them loose on the countryside keep an eye on the guards ill find out later which of them were rahvins men and which he walked on talking and not looking back take what you can have chapter serpent and wheel glowing embers the high window had more than enough room for rand to stand in it stretching far above his head and clearing his shoulders by two feet to either side shirtsleeves rolled up he stared down at one of the royal palaces gardens aviendha was trailing her hand in the fountains redstone basin still intrigued by so much water with no purpose but to be looked at and keep ornamental fish alive she had been more than indignant at first when he told her she could not go chasing trollocs through the streets in fact he was not sure she would be down there now if not for a quiet escort of maidens that sulin did not think he had noticed neither was he supposed to have heard the whitehaired maiden remind her that she was far dareis maino longer and not yet a wise one coatless but wearing his hat against the sun mat was sitting on the coping of the basin talking to her no doubt probing for what she knew of whether the aiel were preventing people from leaving even if mat did decide to accept his fate it was unlikely he would ever stop complaining about it asmodean sat on a bench in the shade of a red myrtle tree playing his harp rand wondered whether the man knew what had happened or suspected he should have no memory for him it never happened but who could say what one of the forsaken knew or could reason out a polite cough turned him away from the garden the window where he stood was a span and a half above the floor in the west wall of the throne room the grand hall where queens of andor had received embassies and pronounced judgment for nearly a thousand years it was the only place he had thought he could be sure of watching mat and aviendha unseen and undisturbed rows of white columns twenty paces high marched down the sides of the hall the light from the tall windows in the walls mingled with colored light from great windows set in the arching ceiling windows where the white lion alternated with portraits of early queens of the realm and scenes of great andoran victories enaila and somara did not appear impressed rand let himself down by his fingertips is there news from bael enaila shrugged the hunt for trollocs goes on by her tone the diminutive woman would have liked to be part of that somaras height made her seem even shorter some of the city people give aid most hide the city gates are held none of the shadowtwisted will escape i think but i fear some of the nightrunners may myrddraal were hard to kill and just as hard to corner sometimes it was easy to believe the old tales that they rode shadows and could vanish by turning sideways we brought you some soup somara said nodding her flaxen head toward a silver tray covered with a striped cloth sitting on the dais that held the lion throne carved and gilded with huge lions paws at the ends of its legs the throne was a massive chair at the top of four white marble stairs with a strip of red carpet leading up to it the lion of andor picked out in moonstones on a field of rubies would have stood above morgases head whenever she occupied that seat aviendha says you have not eaten yet today it is the soup lamelle used to make for you i suppose none of the servants have come back rand sighed one of the cooks maybe a helper enaila shook her head scornfully she would serve her time as gaishainwith a good grace if it ever came to that but the idea of anyone spending their entire life serving someone else disgusted her climbing the stairs he squatted to twitch the cloth aside his nose twitched too by the smell whichever of them had made it was no better a cook than lamelle had been the sound of a mans boots coming up the hail gave him an excuse to turn his back on the tray with any luck he would not have to eat it the man approaching up the long redandwhitetiled floor was certainly no andorman in his short gray coat and those baggy trousers stuffed into boots turned down at the knee slender and only a head taller than enaila he had a hooked beak of a nose and dark tilted eyes gray streaked his black hair and a thick mustache like downcurved horns around his wide mouth he paused to make a leg and bow slightly handling the curved sword at his hip gracefully despite the fact that incongruously he carried two silver goblets in one hand and a sealed pottery jar in the other forgive my intrusion he said but there was no one to announce me his clothes might be plain and even travelworn but he had what appeared to be an ivory rod capped with a golden wolfs head thrust behind his sword belt i am davram bashere marshalgeneral of saldaea i am here to speak with the lord dragon who rumors in the city say is here in the royal palace i assume that i address him for an instant his eyes went to the glittering dragons twining redandgold around rands arms i am rand althor lord bashere the dragon reborn enaila and somara had moved between rand and the man each with a hand on the hilt of her longbladed knife poised to veil i am surprised to find a saldaean lord in caemlyn much less wanting to speak to me in truth i rode to caemlyn to speak to morgase but i was put off by lord gaebrils toadies king gaebril i should say or does he still live basheres tone said he doubted it and did not care one way or the other he did not pause many in the city say morgase is dead as well theyre both dead rand said bleakly he sat down on the throne his head resting against the moonstone lion of andor the throne had been sized for women i killed gaebril but not before he killed morgase bashere quirked an eyebrow should i hail king rand of andor then rand leaned forward angrily andor has always had a queen and it still does elayne was daughterheir with her mother dead she is queen maybe she has to be crowned first i dont know the law but she is queen as far as i am concerned i am the dragon reborn that is as much as i want and more what is it you want of me lord bashere if his anger disturbed bashere at all the man gave no outward sign those tilted eyes watched rand carefully but not uneasily the white tower allowed mazrim taim to escape the false dragon he paused then went on when rand said nothing queen tenobia did not want saldaea troubled again so i was sent to hunt him down once more and put an end to him i have followed him south for many weeks you need not fear ive brought a foreign army into andor except for an escort of ten the rest i left camped in braem wood well north of any border andor has claimed in two hundred years but taim is in andor i am sure of it rand leaned back again hesitating you cannot have him lord bashere may i ask why not my lord dragon if you wish to use aiel to hunt him i have no objection my men will remain in braem wood until i return this part of his plan he had not meant to reveal so soon delay could be costly but he had intended to have a firm hold on the nations first yet it might as well begin now i am announcing an amnesty i can channel lord bashere why should another man be hunted down and killed or gentled because he can do what i can i will announce that any man who can touch the true source any man who wants to learn can come to me and have my protection the last battle is coming lord bashere there may not be time for any of us to go mad before and i would not waste one man for the risk anyway when the trollocs came out of the blight in the trolloc wars they marched with dreadlords men and women who wielded the power for the shadow we will face that again at tarmon gaidon i dont know how many aes sedai will be at my side but i wont turn away any man who channels if he will march with me mazrim taim is mine lord bashere not yours i see it was flatly said you have taken caemlyn i hear that tear is yours and cairhien soon will be if it is not already do you mean to conquer the world with your aiel and your army of men channeling the one power if i must rand said it just as levelly ill welcome any ruler as an ally who welcomes me but so far all ive seen is maneuvering for power or outright hostility lord bashere theres anarchy in tarabon and arad doman and not far from it in cairhien amadicia is eyeing altara the seanchan you may have heard rumors of them in saldaea the worst are likely true the seanchan on the other side of the world eyeing us all men fighting their own petty battles with tarmon gaidon on the horizon we need peace time before the trollocs come before the dark one breaks free time to ready ourselves if the only way i can find time and peace for the world is to impose it i will i dont want to but i will i have read the karaethon cycle bashere said putting the goblets under his arm for a moment he broke the wax seal on the jar and filled them with wine more importantly queen tenobia has read the prophecies too i cannot speak for kandor or arafel or shienar i believe they will come to you not a child in the borderlands but knows the shadow waits in the blight to descend on us but i cannot speak for them enaila eyed the goblet he handed her suspiciously but she climbed the stairs to hand it to rand in truth bashere continued i cannot even speak for saldaea tenobia rules i am only her general but i think once i send a fast rider to her with a message the return will be that saldaea marches with the dragon reborn in the meanwhile i offer you my services and those of nine thousand saldaean horse rand swirled the goblet staring down into the dark red wine sammael in illian and other forsaken the light alone knew where seanchan waiting across the aryth ocean and men here ready to leap for their own advantage and profit whatever it cost the world peace is far off yet he said softly it will be blood and death for some time to come it always is bashere replied quietly and rand did not know which statement he was speaking to perhaps both tucking his harp under his arm asmodean drifted away from mat and aviendha he enjoyed playing but not for a pair who did not listen much less appreciate he was not sure what had happened that morning and not sure he wanted to be sure too many aiel had expressed surprise at seeing him had claimed they had seen him dead he did not want details there was a long gash down the wall in front of him he knew what made that sharp edge that surface as slick as ice smoother than any hand could have polished in a hundred years idly but with a shiver too he wondered whether being reborn in this fashion made him a new man he did not think so immortality was gone that was a gift of the great lord he used that name in his head whatever althor demanded on his tongue that was proof enough that he was himself immortality gone he knew it must be imagination yet sometimes he thought he could feel time dragging at him pulling him toward a grave he had never thought to meet and drawing the little of saidinhe could was like drinking sewage he was hardly sorry lanfear was dead rahvin neither but lanfear especially for what she had done to him he would laugh when each of the others died too and most for the last it was not that he had been reborn as a new man at all but he would cling to that tuft of grass on the cliffs brink as long as he could the roots would give way eventually the long fall would come but until then he was still alive he pulled open a small door intending to find his way to the pantry there should be some decent wine one step and he stopped the blood draining from his face you no the word still hung in the air when death took him morgase blotted sweat from her face then tucked the handkerchief back up her sleeve and readjusted her somewhat ragged straw hat at least she had managed to acquire a decent riding dress though even fine gray wool was still uncomfortable in this heat actually tallanvor had acquired it letting her horse walk she eyed the tall young man riding up ahead through the trees basel gills roundness emphasized how tail and fit tallanvor was he had handed the dress to her saying it suited her better than the itchy thing she had fled the palace in looking down at her never blinking never speaking a word of respect of course she herself had decided it was not safe for anyone to know who she was especially after discovering gareth bryne gone from kore springs why did the man have to be off chasing barnburners when she needed him no matter she would do as well without him but there was something disturbing in tallanvors eyes when he called her simply morgase sighing she glanced back over her shoulder hulking lamgwin rode watching the forest breane at his side watching him as much as anything else her army had not grown a whit since caemlyn too many had heard of nobles exiled for no cause and unjust laws in the capital to do more than scoff at the most casual mention of stirring a hand in support of their rightful ruler she doubted that even knowing who spoke to them would have made a difference so here she rode through altara keeping to forest as much as possible because there seemed to be parties of armed men everywhere rode through the forest with a scarfaced street tough a besotted refugee cairhienin noblewoman a stout innkeeper who could hardly keep from kneeling whenever she glanced at him and a young soldier who sometimes looked at her as though she had on one of those dresses she had worn for gaebril and lini of course there was no forgetting lini as if thinking of her had been a summons the old nurse heeled her horse closer better to keep your eyes ahead she said quietly a young lion charges quickest and when you least expect it you think tallanvor is dangerous morgase said sharply and lini gave her a sidelong considering look only the way any man can be dangerous a fine figure of man dont you think more than tall enough strong hands i should think theres no point letting honey age too long before you eat it lini morgase said warningly the old woman had been going on this way too often of late tallanvor was a handsome man his hands did look strong and he had a wellturned calf but he was young and she was his queen the last thing she needed was to start looking at him as a man instead of her subject and soldier she was about to tell lini that and that the woman had lost her wits if she thought she was going to take up with any man ten years her junior he had to be that but tallanvor and gill were turning back you hold your tongue lini if you put foolish ideas into that young mans head i will leave you somewhere linis snort would have earned the highest noble in andor time in a cell to meditate if she still had her throne it would are you sure you want to do this girl its too late to change your mind after youve jumped off the cliff i will find my allies where i can find them morgase told her stiffly tallanvor reined up sitting tall in his saddle sweat rolled down his face but he seemed to ignore the heat master gill tugged at the neck of his disccovered jerkin as though he wished he could have it off the wood gives way to farms just ahead tallanvor said but it isnt likely anyone will recognize you here morgase met his gaze levelly day by day it was becoming increasingly hard to look away when he was looking at her another ten miles should take us to cormaed if that fellow in sehar was not lying there will be a ferry and we can be on the amadicia side before dark are you certain you want to do this morgase the way he said her name no she was letting linis ridiculous fancies take hold of her it was the accursed heat i have made up my mind young tallanvor she said coolly and i do not expect you to question me when i have done so she heeled her mount hard letting the horses leap forward break their gazes apart letting it shove past him he could catch up to her she would find her allies where she found them she would have her throne back and woe to gaebril or anyman who thought he could sit on it in her place and the glory of the light did shine upon him and the peace of the light did he give me binding nations to him making one of many yet the shards of hearts did give wounds and what was once did come again in fire and in storm splitting all in twain for his peace for his peace was the peace was the peace of the sword and the glory of the light did shine upon him the end of the fifth book of the wheel of time
