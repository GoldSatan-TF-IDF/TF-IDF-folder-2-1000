chieftain of the exiled northern people from which they take their surname thasren bears with him the anger of a defeated people and he carries a weapon meant to strike at the heart of the ruling acacian empire and to announce a longplanned war as thasren moves south into the milder climate of the central empire the family he is targeting lives an idyllic life oblivious of the danger creeping toward them the akarans led by king leodan have lived for generations at the center of a prosperous empire the land has been relatively peaceful for years although the nations early rise was the result of chaotic warfare it had been mythologized in tales of the first king edifus his son tinhadin and the legendary band of sorcerers the santoth who were supposed to have helped them win power king leodan rules from the beautiful isle of acacia at the center of an inland sea he is a widower who dotes on his four children aliver a headstrong boy of sixteen corinn the family beauty mena an insightful adolescent and nineyearold dariel a boy with an adventuresome spirit leodan knows that the empire is held together by a number of longstanding crimes in addition to keeping an iron military grip on the provinces for years the acacians have traded with faraway foreigners known as the lothan aklun a naval trading conglomerate the league of vessels handles all the details so that the two sides never interact the acacians send a regular quota of children into some unknown slavery receiving riches and a drug called mist in return the empire then distributes mist among the populace keeping them dull and obedient leodan shelters his children from this wanting them to have happy childhoods full of love but in his solitary moments leodan temporarily forgets his guilt over the empires crimesand his longing for his dead wifeby inhaling mist himself the kings closest friend and confidant his chancellor thaddeus clegg was raised with leodan thaddeus has a secret one that has turned him against his old friend he has recently learnedwith hanish meins scheming assistancethat the akaran family was responsible for the death of his beloved wife and infant child years earlier it was not a crime leodan had any part in but learning of it bitterly twists thaddeus against the king when a soldier arrives to warn the king of troop movements in the far north thaddeus kills the messenger thereby buying his distant ally hanish crucial time to unleash his surprise attack and what a multipronged attack it is thasren stabs king leodan with a poisoned blade during a banquet hanishs other brother maeander leads one army sweeping down from the northwest to the northeast an alien race the numrek fight savagely on the mein side all around the known world meinish soldiers conscripted into the acacian army rebel hanish himself drags a navy across the frozen tundra so that he can launch the boats on springflooded rivers and appear suddenly in the inner sea in the heart of the acacian empire in addition to all this hanish unleashes a contagion that sends the vulnerable acacians into writhing agony and he slaughters them without mercy caught off guard by the sudden fury of the attack acacian authority collapses on his deathbed leodan calls on his old friend thaddeus to enact a plan they had discussed years earlier despite everything thaddeus agrees his love of the children is too great for him to hand them over to hanish mein instead he sends the children out into the far reaches of the empire escorted by lone guardians to be hidden the hope is that they will grow to maturity in safety and one day reunite and win back the empire very little goes as planned only aliver makes it to his intended destination he is raised among the talayan people of the south in a tribal culture of warriors and hunters runners who roam the arid plains of their vast continent he even comes to learn that the mythical sorcerers the santoth are real he meets them and discovers they would very much like to return from their banishment and aid him but feel their magic has been too corrupted by time they ask him if he has the song of elenet the text in which the givers magical language was written he does not so they remain in exile aliver grows to manhood in this challenging environment and learns a great many things that build his character and leadership potential his siblings do not fare quite as well corinn is betrayed by her guardian she is delivered into hanishs hands and forced to live among the new meinish court that has taken over her fathers palace for years she chafes against the luxurious bondage she is kept in but slowly hanishs charisma and charm begin to win her over much against her will she falls in love with her captor mena does not reach her planned destination either her guardian is killed leaving her adrift in a small boat at sea she drifts until she comes ashore on the remote primitive vumu archipelago there she is greeted as the earthly embodiment of one of the islands main deities maeben the eagle goddess of wrath mena is raised in the temple in a position of privilege although bound by the religions strict rituals and formalities for years this is her life until melio sharratta childhood friend of aliversdiscovers her he assures her that the akaran story is not over and secretly trains her in sword craft when dariels guardian cannot find the person he is supposed to deliver the young boy to he abandons him amid the chaos of human migration happening in the mountain passes of senival by chance the prince is found by val a giant of a man whom dariel had met while exploring the servants regions of the palace val had always told the prince tales of his earlier life as a pirate on the gray slopes he proves the truth of it when he takes dariel with him raising the boy as a brigand and sea captain thus the four akaran children grow to adulthood in vastly different environments completely out of touch with one another for years they are brought together through the work of thaddeus clegg the former chancellor still living with the guilt of having betrayed his king works among a network of agents to find and bring the akarans back together hanish mein steps into the role the akarans had occupied he increases the slave quota and continues to suppress the people it is not long before the varied peoples of the known world who had once chafed against acacian rule find themselves in even more dire straits under hanish mein and they dont know the worst of it one of the early acacian kings tinhadin had put a curse on them they are not allowed to pass out of life their bodies mummify and they remain trapped in themnot alive not dead it was a vindictive act of a mad tyrant and tinhadin could not have foreseen that the collective souls of all these meinish ancestors would band together in a group called the tunishnevre they speak to hanish and demand that they be transported to acacia for a ceremony that will finally free them back into life with all the power and rage theyve gained from centuries as the undead the ceremony requires elaborate preparation and the blood of one of the akaran line to succeed aliver begins to rally the vast tribes of talay he speaks of a new dawn for the world with a rule that will be just and fair with power spread among the various peoples he swears he will abolish the trade in child slaves and with the distant help of the santoth he helps the people defeat the mist addiction that has plagued them for so long dariel fresh from skirmishes with the league joins him mena having broken with her adoptive religion reunites with them also together they drive an evergrowing army toward hanishs forces having helped orchestrate the reunion thaddeus takes some solace in seeing the children grown healthy and strong he leaves them and sets off on a mission of his own he realizes he knows where the song of elenet is hidden in the palace of acacia and he knows a secret way to enter and get to it he manages this and plans to return the book to aliver so that he can fully call on the santoth before he leaves he sees corinn and makes contact with her hoping she will flee with him what he doesnt know is that corinn has undergone considerable changes unlike her siblings she has never experienced life among the people she knows only the palace the court wealth and the shrewd manipulation of power she has finally given her heart to hanish but one evening she overhears her lover communicating with the tunishnevre she hears him swear that he will kill her to release them this is the last of many disappointments and it makes her believe she can rely only on herself thaddeus shows her the song of elenet feeling its power corinn makes up her mind instead of fleeing with thaddeus she poisons him she hides the book and quickly works behind the scenes to secure her own power she makes a deal with the league convincing them to sit out the coming war and she forms an alliance with hanishs old allies the numrek promising them the status hanish never granted them she brings in rialus neptos a former acacian governor with a duplicitous nature to help her she never exactly works against her siblings indeed her actions aid them by taking the league and the numrek away as threats but neither is she working in concert with them her sights are set on hanish and she carefully arranges the pieces to strike him even as he puts the finishing touches on his plan to resurrect the tunishnevre meanwhile alivers army meets the meinish forces led by maeander on the plains of northern talay the clash lasts for several days the advantage veering back and forth maeander unleashes savage beasts called antoks that do great damage to the rebellious forces but so does alivers connection with the santoth aid his cause and protect his people then maeander approaches the acacians personally he offers invoking ancient customs to fight aliver in single combat aliver cant resist this chance of ending the contest between them instead of letting so many of the common people hes grown to love die against mena and dariels protests he agrees for a time it seems he might prevail but all too suddenly maeander strikes a fatal blow aliver falls dead in a moment of rage dariel orders the troops to attack maeander thus breaking the oaths given prior to the duel fighting resumes between both armies in earnest and the meinish forces appear to be winning waking on the morning that looks to be the end for the acacian forces mena and dariel are both stunned to see enormous shadowy shapes approaching from the south the shapes shrink to human size as they grow near and reveal themselves to be the santoth theyve come out of exile troubled and angry because they sensed alivers death they know now that their banishment will not be lifted and in rage they unleash their anger against the meinish army they rip apart the land and tear whole groups of soldiers to shreds with their songs and spells once the santoth withdraw to the far south it becomes clear the acacians have won the battle back on acacia corinn has sprung her surprise attack on hanish using her new numrek allies whom she has smuggled into the palace via the same route thaddeus used they attack and kill the mein eventually capturing hanish corinn orders his execution on the very altar on which he had planned to sacrifice her rialus performs the act as the book ends a sort of peace has returned to the known world corinn steps unchallenged into the role of queen receiving her two living siblings with gracious but somewhat cold hospitality it seems her vision of the future might be very different from the idealistic notions aliver had espoused also she is pregnant with hanishs child prologue in luana during the ninth year of hanish meins rule i t should have been him just him ravi shouted this again and again he jumped to be seen above the crowd he pushed through the other children and grabbed at any of the redcloaked soldiers he got near enough to reach they ignored him or shoved him back into place or brought a crop down on his head and shoulders ravi would not stop shouting they were making a mistake he would go with them wherever they wished to take him he would behave he would do whatever they asked but mor should be no part of this she was their parents only other child they needed her their mother could not live without her he had heard her say so more than once please he shouted let her go let her go home a squat soldier rounded on him he was shorter than most of the men thick around the waist with leathery skin and hair that bristled like a spiny rodents his crimson shirt stretched tight across his belly he grabbed ravi by the chin and spoke close to his face the mans onionscented words hot on his skin youre both quota he said his accent strange to ravis ears you understand youve both been given two peas from the same pod two pups from the same litter thats just the way it is lad accept it and your life wont be so bad the man tried to push the boy away when ravi clung to his arm the man growled that he had been patient enough he balled his hand into a fist and smashed the boy on his nose ravi saw black for a moment when his eyes cleared he stood sputtering stunned his lips and chin and chest splattered with blood ravi his sisters voice finally reached him her voice was part of why he had been yelling he feared to hear it he began to move toward another redcloaked man but mor threw her arms around him and would not be shaken off please ravi stop it this helps nothing youll make them angrier angrier ravi thought angrier what did it matter if they were angry he came near to whirling on her with harsh words but her grip on him was tight and in truth he did not really want to break free from her he knew that she was right she was always calmer than he was she never wasted actions as he often did on the farm she worked each day steadily and slowly she moved like an old woman he used to think but somehow she always finished her chores before him no matter that he was faster and stronger than she even now she was more selfassured than he was acknowledging this stilled him more than her grip on him and more than his fatigue and his battered face good ravi come she whispered starting to pull him back into the mass of children better they dont see you theyre not going to let me go you know that and they might separate us if you keep drawing attention to yourself i dont want to be alone ravi neither did he he let her pull him into the group sliding between the others until they were two among many now that he had ceased his commotion he and his sister were little different from the rest he saw a few faces from the neighboring village the rest were strangers but judging by their clothing demeanor and fearfilled eyes they were much the same as he and mor they were farm children too from the fertile but isolated territory north of the lakelands they had been gathered together near a town he had never been to they were like so many sheep brought into one corral and kept in place by wolves in red garments how many of them were there hundreds ravi thought children as young as seven or eight some as old as he and his twin sister at thirteen they all had frightened eyes and often whispered to those nearby trying to gain some understanding of what was happening many had tearstreaked faces smudged and dirty their hair was mostly silver blond their complexions smooth and pale eyes narrow and deep set in a way that foreigners sometimes laughed at thinking them a dim passive people they werent dim though or passive they were far enough north that they had often gone unnoticed by those of the known world that had changed suddenly ravi realized and the change already felt irrevocable the siblings sat down knee to knee among the others mor wiped ravis face with her sleeve instructing him to raise his head he did so sullenly accepting her attentions but not able to look her in the eyes as he knew she wished him to do he had not cried once yet he feared that looking into her face might change that her face was too clear a reminder of things lost a few days ago the world ravi knew had been measured by the rolling miles of farmland and moor around his village north of luana his familys cottage sat on a hill surrounded by fields of the sweet red potatoes that were one of the areas main crops the houses of their nearest neighbors rimmed the horizon spaced out by a half mile or so a lonely landscape damp each morning and cool throughout most days no matter the season it was a simple life he had led daily toil at the tasks that modestly sustained their family of four his father was a quiet man with big hands he limped from some injury of his youth his mother had absurdly crooked teeth which she showed often as laughter peppered all the words that came from her mouth he knew that his mother had lost two children in childbirth before having him and mor this was not unusual perhaps she was sad beneath all those smiles but she made sure that ravi never saw signs of it he had dreamed of escaping to something more exciting sailing on a trading vessel joining the guards that occasionally patrolled the provinces or stealing a neighbors horse and riding out into the world he had found excitement but not in the way he had imagined the redcloaked men had arrived in the dark hours far from either dusk or sun return ravi heard the knock on the door he heard his father grumbling a moment later and he listened to the creak of the door and to the mumbled exchange that followed probably one of the neighboring farmers ravi thought come to ask help for some midnight mishap the farm over by the marshes had been having a problem with sheep thieves perhaps they were organizing a chase ravi mor had whispered from her cot on the other side of the room who is it he shushed her he had started to pull off his sheet planning to tiptoe across the floor and listen through the crack in the door but he got no farther than plucking the cloth between his fingertips a shout came from the main room the sound of somethinga chair he thoughtknocked over the scrabble of feet on the packedearth floor he froze another shout and whispered curses and then sounds he couldnt place for a moment and then he could the dull thuds of fists against flesh he swung his legs free from the bed and set them on the floor the light shining around the door frame shifted and danced and grew brighter he watched it hearing mors sharp inhalation of breath the door to their room flew open kicked by a booted foot torches lit the room cruel in their intensity through the torchlight the bodies of men emerged burly garbed in crimson the first strode across the room and slammed a hand down on ravis neck he leaned in close studying the boy the torch so close to his head that his features were a motley of distorted highlight and shadow a second figure went to mor he was gentler he placed a finger under mors chin and turned her so that the first man could see her face yes he said glancing between them youre two sides of the same coin you two are one together in the womb together in your fate your councilmen told us true come on on your feet both of you well not harm you if you come quiet he was so matteroffact so casually intimidating that before he knew what he was doing ravi was standing he and mor were pushed through the doorway into the main room what ravi saw there stayed in his memory only in fragments disjointed images captured between the jolting motion of being shoved stumbling he saw his mothers face openmouthed her teeth looking like the fangs of a wolf or bear his eyes shot around to find his father he couldnt find him he saw a commotion of men near the cookstove their arms and legs moving like those of some monster he never did see him or pick out his body from among the motion but ravi knew that his father was at the center of it ravi was roughly conveyed through it toward the door his foot caught the side of the doorjamb and he sprawled out into the night he hit the ground hard on his forearms and elbows rolled and had a clear moment of thought as he watched the figures striding out after him red cloaks they wore red cloaks and that meant he and mor were to be taken by the eaters older boys had told stories about such things saying that from time to time the king to the south sent hunters through candovia in search of the children his god loved to devour ravi had never believed it it had never happened in his lifetime and he knew older boys were cruel and liars but now a man was reaching down for him his father was pinned beneath a seething mass of limbs his mother wore a wolfs face his sister was crying out at some roughness the anger was in him complete and instant like oil on a fire he kicked at the man reaching for him a glancing blow off his shin this made him angrier and he kicked again and again his legs churning as he squirmed on the hardpacked ground the man cursed and jumped back then came in again his entire bulk trailing behind the point of his boot toe ravi tried to wrap himself around it and pull the man off balance but the boot tore free and came on again in a moment others joined it that was the first time they beat him senseless because ravi was unconscious he remembered nothing of how they were bundled into a wagon waiting by the road he did not hear his mothers wail or see her appear in the doorway held back by a soldiers arm nor did mor ever tell him of it yet somehow he knew he knew as certainly as if she had lent him her eyes and her ears t wo days after the soldier squashed his nosetwo days of travel of beatings of sleepless nights and numbing daysthe children were herded with other groups from other villages near the coast many of them had been gathered in the coastal towns to celebrate the return of spring perhaps that was why they could be harvested in such great numbers how the redcloaked soldiers dealt with the childrens parents ravi was not sure they could not beat them all could they perhaps this was why they marched the children so mercilessly perhaps but ravi also felt certain there was more to it sometimes he could smell the pungent scent of mist carried on the breeze coming from the towns they skirted it struck him with the melancholy that smoke from burned ruins would have but the towns were not in ruins not at least in the physical sense that was easiest to envision none of the children understood what was happening yes they all knew the stories of the redcloaked men of the vanishings but the stories had never been like this they had heard of a child or two going missing every few years nothing more and the tales had always said it was young children who were taken none as old as ravi and mor whatever was happening now was a thing beyond even the nightmares that the older boys tried to weave into younger minds they were marched through the morning and into the afternoon around dusk they came down through sea bluffs and got their first view of the great league vessels their size was hard to gauge at first ravi thought them no large craft but then he realized they were quite far out they were possibly massive they lay on a shimmering expanse of azure the twins walked hand in hand near the front of the column ravi felt the swish of the tall damp grass against his legs and thought he was lucky to be up front instead of behind where the grass would be trodden down and could not be felt then he thought himself unkind or a fool or both this is not possible he thought not possible but they continued to move forward the world denying his claim without the slightest hesitation ravi squeezed his sisters hand tighter and watched the ships they slept on a narrow ribbon of sand that night hemmed in by crumbly cliffs guarded by watchers some of the children feared the ocean and cried ravi wanted to shout at them to stop but he knew that would be unkind he did not wish to be unkind that would be making a bad thing worse and doing it to others as innocent as he he was angry and he did not want to let that anger fade or be replaced by fear or docility he wanted to do something with it swear to me that youll never give in to them he said these were the first words he had spoken in some time he did not look at his sister but instead gazed unfocused he raked his hands through the damp sand feeling the texture in his fingers when mor did not answer ravi faced her and studied her in the yellowish light of the fires that rimmed the encampment he took her by both wrists and held tightly enough that he knew his grip pained her dont go quiet swear that you wont mor looked miserable ravi how can i you see them he drew close to her face swear it dont give yourself to them dont she began to protest again arguing that she would have to obey alluding to the things they would do to her if she did not ravi cut her off youre not listening he said what i mean is dont ever believe that you are a slave no matter what they make you do the red cloaks say that we belong to some others now they say were not our own masters and that we have no parents but theyre liars thats what im telling you to remember you believe that theyre liars he waited until mor nodded then he continued dont forget that dont let them make their lies into truths never forget that you are mor sister of ravi child of the parents we share promise me that she promised and he finally let go of her wrists why do you say these things mor asked you act as if we are separated but were not just be quiet and dont draw attention and they will leave us with each other ravi said nothing and was glad when she did not ask him to swear as he had done sometime in the middle of the night he decided what he would do and it was the opposite of not drawing attention mor would not understand it but if he managed what he thought he could she would come to understand later he did not know exactly how he would do it but he resolved to try he felt he would know the moment when it showed itself s econd to the league vessels themselves the barges that approached the shore the next morning to transport the children were the largest humanmade structures ravi had ever seen squat rectangular rafts they stretched wide along the shore flattening the waves beneath them they were made of a slategray material dull in a manner that seemed to capture the light of the risen sun ravi could not say what made them move but something did slowly inexorably and there were people aboard them not many and not near enough to make them out clearly but on one of the closer barges a cluster of five figures stood atop a raised platform they did not move and were nothing more than outlines at first but ravi felt certain that each stared directly at him the children on the beach stared as if these silent things and those aboard them were more frightening than anything they had yet faced they began to murmur and whisper a boy near the twins said this is sorcery nobody denied it dont wet your trousers one of the soldiers nearby said guffawing look at the lot of you gape mouthed like so many carp another added a remark about the smell of soiled undergarments still anothera bit farther away and moving forward with his arms outstretched to push the children inmade a joke about the enormous chopping block approaching them why are they doing that ravi wondered aloud why frighten us still more his sister holding his hand did not respond the barges came on the figures standing on the raised platform were more visible now they were cloaked in hooded garments of the same dead gray as the vessels the surf struggling beneath the crafts billowed out grasping at the childrens feet they began to draw back felt the pressure of others behind them and began to panic it spread as quick as touch over the rising confusion ravi heard the soldiers increasing their taunts they knew this would happen they were enjoying it this realization brought a shout to his mouth we are not slaves without knowing he was doing so he yanked his hand free of his sisters he spun around calling out over the heads of the mostly smaller children in all directions do you hear we are not slaves his voice must have carried well for many faces turned and stared at himround faces gaunt ones sunken eyed and grime caked in their eyes he thought he saw hunger agreement he thought he could stir that into certainty just because they say we are doesnt make it true we are not slaves just because they say we are his voice grew stronger he asked them to look around see how many they were they were hundreds down the beach were thousands the soldiers were few how could they enslave so many he answered himself because we let them the soldiers noticed they shouted to one another to him he saw two converging on him from different directions the nearest was a bull his shoulders bulbous and enormous as if all his anger were gathering atop his frame ravi grabbed mor and pulled her away both of them agile as anchovies he slipped through the crowd repeating again and again that they were not slaves he told the others to fight to run to do anything but not give in he couldnt tell if they were really understanding or if the chaos had crashed over them but all around the children jostled and scurried they punched at the men who grabbed them and wrenched themselves free a tide of them had pushed over a fallen man and many small feet were trampling him as they surged down the beach toward freedom ravi thought he knew that mor was beseeching him but it didnt matter he had her by the wrist and he was doing what he had to he was changing everything they cannot stop us all run to your homes he had just spun around once more mouth open ready to flee if the soldier was too near he was thinking it was time to join the others escaping down the beach thats what mor wanted he was sure and they would do it now he turned just in time to receive the full force of a soldiers tossed baton across his forehead it had been thrown from a distance with great force and uncanny accuracy it knocked ravis head back and turned his eyes to the cloudheavy sky suddenly he had no legs his body fell so that the back of his head was the first part of him to hit the hard sand it left him stunned breathless one arm upstretched his hand which had just held mors empty and then a fist closed over his hand and a shape blocked the sky the soldier yanked ravi upward spinning him in the air then drove him facefirst into the sand he pressed his knee into ravis back the full weight of him ravis mouth formed an oval as the air inside him escaped he gasped for more but the man pressed him like he wanted to drive his knee through him into the ground what to do with him he asked end him another of the soldiers answered his voice calm its a waste but well still have her the numbers will be right anyway ravi his head to the side on the damp sand his lungs pressed flat and his eyes rimmed with tears watched a knife cut into view and past it he saw his sister watching him her face heartbreaking desolate a soldier had her by the shoulder though it was clear there was no fight in her ravi wanted to tell her not to look but he could not and he did not have to something else caught her attention someone whom ravi could not see but whom she stared at with no lessening of her distress wait another voice called ravi did not know whose it was but the voice carried authority it was a strange voice inflected with sharp edges even though the speaker was unhurried the blade hung above him waiting hes got the spirit that eats death in him the voice said the speaker paused for a few moments hes got life in greater measure than most i see another use for him i think the auldek will like this one c hapter o ne when the balbara lookout shouted the alarm princess mena akaran was up from her campstool in an instant she broke from the circle where she had been sitting with her officers and climbed the ridge at a run she drew close to the sharpeyed young man sighting down his slim brown arm and out from his pointing finger across the arid expanse that was central talay it took her a moment to see what he did even then it was neither the creature itself she saw nor the party who hunted it they were too far away what marked their progress were the billows of smoke from the torches the runners carriedthat and a yellow smudge at the rim of the world that must have been dust kicked up by their feet they seemed to be as far off as the horizon but the princess knew they would close that distance quickly she half slid down the sandy slope and regrouped with her officers one captain melio sharratt she assigned to the farthest southern beacon to the other kelis of umae went the northern beacon they already knew what to do she told them it was only a matter of seeing it accomplished timing it perfectly and having luck on their side she left it to them to get the others in position and remind them of their instructions but before she dismissed them she urged them both to act with caution do you hear me she asked leaning close to the small group she took melio by the wrist to remind him of this but did not look in his face she knew his grin would hold constant dismissive of the danger moving across the plain toward them he may have become the head of the elite but the role had done nothing to alter him his longish hair would be cast casually across an eye often swept aside only to fall in place again they had wed five years earlier she had never hidden her love of him from others but neither did she let it distract her at moments like this she spoke as if her words were meant for all the hunting party as in truth they were i want nobody dead only the foulthing dies today she said those words coming from you melio asked will you abide by them yourself or will this be like last time with that mena spoke as if she had not heard him nobody else that order falls on each of you personally weve lost too many already her eyes settled on kelis the talayans gaze was as calm as ever his skin dark and smooth his eyes slow moving it was a face she had grown to deeply care for in a strange way this talayan was a living reminder of her eldest brother aliver had grown to manhood with him as his companion kelis had known her brother during the years that she had been separated from him even now after all the evenings they had spent talking about what her brother had been like then she still did not feel they had conversed enough she hoped they would have many evenings more she made a point of not meeting melios eyes as he moved away if they were together again whole at the end of the day she would show him just how much she felt for him with all her body that was the way it had been with them lately distant as they faced danger enraptured with each other in the short reprieves afterward the next half hour was a whirl of preparations moving among soldiers shouting instructions checking everything personally mena was as slim and leanly muscled and sun burnished as she had been during the war with hanish mein she still wore the sword with which she had swum ashore on vumu as a girl but she was far from being that girl only an unobservant eye could fail to see that her lithe form contained within it a coiled energy hardened by loss by war and by an inner struggle with the deadly gifts that seemed to define her there was love within her too but she kept that on a short tether it was a softness that was difficult to spot within the maeben fierceness she so often had to rely upon had she the time and the quiet she would have chosen to settle into the kinder aspects of her nature and come to know them again but the peace that followed the end of the war with hanish mein had hardly allowed it maybe when this work was done she could lay down her sword and rest she caught her breath only when all the preparations that could be made had been she climbed back upon the ridge and stood where the lookout had the chapped skin of talay spread out before her miles upon miles baking under a flawless blue sky she watched the creature take on shape and proportion as it closed the miles the smoke of its pursuers driving it toward the trap mena had laid for it this was not the first of these foulthings she had faced indeed she had been at the work of hunting them for almost four years now she had seen eight of them killed but shed also lost hundreds of her soldiers in the process and each time was different each creature was its own atrocity and had to be dealt with accordingly each trap was an elaborate construction that if it failed needed to be abandoned to prepare for some other opportunity it began not long after the santoth had unleashed their twisted magic upon the mein army nobody could say for sure just how the foulthings came to be but it had something to do with ribbons of the santoths song unleashed on the natural creatures of the world spells that drifted until they lighted upon some living creature in most cases the animals were so corrupted by the touch of the givers tongue that they died lamed malformed burned or battered or torn one part from another many got caught in rips in the fabric of the world that passed through them and left them melded with other objects joined with trees or stuck fast in rocks or half submerged in the earth their carcasses dotted the damaged ground a feast for vultures at first they had believed any creatures touched by the sorcery died because of it and because many human beings were so touched many were led mercifully out of this life and on to the next nobody wished to see their loved ones live with that sort of corruption on them the people of talay in particular had always told tales of the lasting damage left by the santoth during their first angry march into banishment they took it upon themselves to ensure that their people did not spread any contagion among them most of the burden however fell upon the mein as they had received the brunt of the sorcerers fury as the vanquished enemy they had little say in their fate those who showed signs of contamination were killed culled just as one might cull sick animals from a herd of livestock queen corinn was firm in her orders on this and from the first days of her reign few chose to disobey hernot outright at least dariel might have asserted his rights as a male heir but he did not a year after corinn released their fathers ashes and ascended to the throne of acacia she gave birth to the nations heir soon after they began to receive troubling reports at first corinn dismissed them as the nightmares of a frightened fatigued populace the antoks had stirred all sorts of fears in peoples minds she explained and the strange appearance of the santoth had woken old superstitions magic had been unleased upon the world for the first time in twentytwo generations of course the people again trembled at night and concocted stories of beasts that hunted them time would heal corinn said the earth would come to rest again and the natural order would sew creation back into its tight weave but the reports did not fade as time passed the sightings which were sporadic for the first few years grew more frequent the witnesses more reliable what they said differed in the particulars but all their descriptions had made menas skin crawl with growing trepidation in the hills near halaly a herd of goatlike creatures cut a swath of devastation goatlike the people said but in truth only their heads resembled gargantuan likenesses of those animals their bodies were squat with numerous malformed limbs jointed at random places more like a spiders legs than those of any mammal they were each as large as an elephant and insatiable fortunately they ate only vegetation and were near as easy to slaughter as domesticated ruminants other creatures had different tastes and were not so easy to kill the bethuni spread stories of manyfooted serpents that could both slither and run at first the people thought them amusing until they began to grow at a rate that frightened them into action there was a lion with a row of blue eyes along its back doglike creatures large enough to send laryx scurrying in fright vultures so mutated by the bounty they had consumed that many of them could no longer fly instead they waddled following their great beaked noses like bands of the plagued the people came to understand that these beings had been warped rather than killed by the santoth these they called the foulthings once corinn acknowledged them she ordered them hunted and destroyed she charged mena with this mission giving her a small army and presenting the task as yet another way that her younger sister might carve her name into the pantheon of the akaran greats mena suspected that corinn intentionally wished her to be kept busy and kept away from other affairs of the empire but she could not put the unease she felt into enough order to decide what to do about it instead mena had set to the hunt the beasts were real after all and who better than maeben on earth to face them she and her army ranged far and wide across talay from its shores across its grasslands and deserts into its hills and mountain reaches through marshland and even to the great river that marked the boundary with the far south that dry watercourse she did not cross she had no desire to awaken the santoth again nobody wished for that she faced the creatures one at a time as much as possible she fought with the help of those in whose territory the hunt took her it was with bethuni huntsmen that she had set the fires that consumed the writhing manylegged aggregation of snake creatures that had grown large enough to swallow dogs and sheep and even children whole balbara warriors marched beside her as they cleaned the land of vultures so fat their wings were useless and with talayan runners she had tracked the blueeyed lion across the grasslands running it to exhaustion before she killed it herself with an overhand thrust of a long pike it was that act melio had referred to earlier even exhausted and panting the lion had been a fierce thing its mouth a great cavern of fanged fury when it roared its claws five scimitars as they slashed out mena had risked her life to plant the killing blow she had not truly needed to do it herself but sometimes she could not control the impulse to sometimes she needed to offer her life for the one taken just to see if her bill was due somewhere lurking in the back of her mind was the feeling that the many lives she had ended would someday ask for her own to balance the scales she did not run from this indeed at times she wanted to embrace it and accept whatever reckoning the spirits offered her so far they had offered none nine years had passed since the new violence that corinn called peace had begun so many times mena could have died and yet throughout it all she had rarely suffered more than minor cuts and deep bruises and sprained joints perhaps the giver was saving her for something perhaps but if so why was he so completely silent ever absent this thing they hunted nowthis they had put off as long as they could it was the third to the last of the giants she knew of only two others although she did not want to think of them just now she had her hands more than full watching it approach filled her with fear as great as any she had experienced it was not just the brute force of it rather it was the twisting of the natural order the possibilities it suggested about what monsters could exist or might come into existence to plague the future and it was the fact that it had been set upon the world by the very same sorcerers who had twice secured her familys throne because of that she felt she owed it to the world to see the foulthings extinguished what roared toward her driven into her trap by torchcarrying talayan runners was a monstrosity that came with a shrieking entourage of hundreds of other creatures those in the horde were not themselves warped they were what the talayans called tentens primates with long snouts and a carnivores jaws they were fierce and dangerous in their own way but they had long lived on the plains they ran mostly on all fours and were normally as content to eat groundnuts as they were to hunt smaller monkeys and rodents no danger to humans as long as they were left alone the huge beast they followed ran on two legs in a waddling gait that was fast humanlike and more grotesque because of the similarity occasionally it corrected its balance and expressed its outrage by bashing the earth with its knuckled fists it was woollyhaired with a great brownred mane about its neck an ocher and blue snout and a predators forwardfacing eyes it stood three times a mans height at the crown of its head above this rose two circular horns that added yet another mans height these horns were the only part of the creature of true beauty a ridged perfection of form beautiful yes but not when worn as the headdress on the bellowing thing now closing to within a few hundred yards likely the creature had once been a tentenexplaining why the troop followed it some speculated that it had eaten a corrupted corpse of a horned animal and had thus grown horns itself however it had been created it was not natural and could not be left alive melio and kelis had reached their assigned posts earlier they had established a series of piles of brushwood that were spaced in a widemouthed cone shape meant to funnel the foulthing toward a chosen area as soon as the creature passed between the first of these outposts the men touched fire to the pyres instantly they combusted in audible whooshes of flame and black smoke the runners pressed on near enough now that mena could hear their shouts bursts of sound peppered throughout the group meant to further confuse the animals she knew melio and kelis would be joining the runners taking up their torches adding their voices to the din a little closer and another pyre went up and another after that each successive explosion narrowed the pathway the creatures had and directed them toward mena and the fifty crossbowmen she commanded each of them with a second who stood just beside him ready yourselves she called her voice as stern and confident as she could make it the crossbowmen began to extend their line forming a widening u shape they moved gradually as if they were not watching the animals speeding toward them the bowmen walked with their weapons strapped to their bodies over their shoulders and around their waists the bows were heavy meant to fire a single powerful shot a second shot was unlikely since the bolts had to be loaded and the crossbows cranked slowly back to the ready position on the bottom end of the u shape the pairs positioned themselves behind metal rings that had been secured to the earth by long stakes it was into this area that the foulthing and its troop arrived in a cloud of snarling dusty hair and teeth and anger the giant itself was enraged it danced about smacking the ground tearing up clods of dry earth and tossing them in the air it bared its teeth snapping at the sky its yellowed eyes shot rage out of them like a physical force standing on two legs it spread its arms wide and thumped its chest around it hundreds of the tenten followed its lead the cacophony of it the turmoil the nearness of such animal fury was almost too much to stand calmly facing but mena made sure she did she held them there for a few minutes letting them settle into the space asking her soldiers to be calm before they acted now that the animals were inside the u shape the bowmen at the far ends slowly closed the open portion making a great circle with the creatures in the center the men took up positions around the rings nailed in place for them the runners and the rest of the force spread out around the bowmens circle thickening the ranks only when all were in position did mena lift her arm it was nearly time and if they all did as they had planned it would be over in it happened before she had any chance to stop it one of the bowmen shot prematurely the bolt flew dead straight and with all the released energy of its slowly cranked twisted cable work the force of its leaving would have knocked the bowman off his feet except that a second man clasped him about the waist and stood with his feet planted firmly the missile trailed a thin rope it spooled out with a hiss the bolt slammed into the foulthings chest impacting its rib cage and did not sink far the force of it tossed the creature back in a sudden rolling confusion of limbs and horns when the tumble stopped the thing was on its feet once more it stood for a moment confused and breathless tenten bodies all around most of them still howled and bared their teeth a few lay crumpled and broken from its rolling over them the foulthing grasped the bolt by the protruding shaft and yanked it out the barbs tore through its flesh but if it felt that particular pain it gave no sign it focused on the bolt as if it were a living thing that might still harm it and then its eyes played out along the rope that connected it to the cross bowman with a roar it jerked the two men toward it yanking them off their feet and dragging them on their bellies into the raging tentens the fools mena thought they had forgotten what they were supposed to do who were these two what she did then she did with instinctual quickness she ran forward drawing her marah sword yelling as she did so hoping to draw the beasts attention as she neared the first of the tentens she swung her sword in wide arcs that cut clean through fur and skin and bone the animals jumped back from her all teeth and snarls she hacked her way at a dead run toward the fallen men she found them writhing and screaming entangled together beneath a biting scratching mound of tentens the animals did not notice her until she had hacked the heads from two limbs from even more split another down through the skull and spilled the guts of another in a gush that coated the two men a wave of soldiers rushed to help her she stopped them all with a slash of her palm no she yelled she knew that if they continued it would break the formation there would be no order and they would not be able to carry out the rest of the plan it would be chaos and many more than just she would die in it no they stopped tripped over each other stood stunned and unsure until she motioned them back she had barely managed to do so before another tenten leaped at her she ducked beneath it and sliced its leg clean off come on she hissed get loose of it she smacked the bowman with the palm of her free hand and then stood upright with the same hand she drew her short sword the foulthing was some thirty or so strides away it had paused to watch her for a moment it was a statue amid a whirlwind of motion mena saw something like intelligent curiosity on its face its eyebrows seemed to lift slightly the corners of its mouth twitched she had not noticed how human its hands were longfingered and delicate as they caressed the rope she experienced the moment as one of shared silence she almost felt the creature was going to say something do something but the moment was shortlived and the foulthing spoke no words it seemed to grow tired of studying her those humanlike hands yanked on the cord again when the line went taut mena caught it between her two blades and sliced through the rope the beast was thrown off balance and went down again mena turned and pushed dragged and shouted the two men to their feet and back to the safety of the circle remember your rings she shouted every second tie the ropes down with that the princess raised her arm then immediately let it drop before it even reached her side her generals had shouted in answer in the next instant a confusion of bolts and ropes flew at the foulthing from all directions many hit itin the chest and groin deep in its calf and punching right through its other ankle in its lower back and just above in the muscled flesh of its upper torso in the neck several passed through the curve of its horns the ropes tangling in them as the creature spun a few took out the lesser apes skewering three or four at a time before losing momentum and the bolts that missed sped straight toward the opposing bowmen and troops this was when the seconds came into play again they shifted from pressing forward on the bowmen to pulling back against them the ropes snapped taut before reaching the other side and the crossbows even if yanked out of their wielders hands were held fast by the sling straps once the ropes were secured archers stepped between them and lofted ropes attached to blunted arrows over the creature others retrieved them on the opposite side and anchored each end further tightening a web of bonds on the foulthing catching many tentens in the process mena watched until the injured and bound foulthing was pressed tight to the dry ground she turned away as halaly spearmen began to move into the circle their long narrow pikes able to impale the tentens at a distance the auditory chaos was no less than before but she knew the difficult task was over melio found her walking slowly back toward the rock outcropping from which she wished to take in the horizon again to see the largeness of the world and marvel at it you really must let others risk their necks on occasion he said grinning youre lucky your men fear you as much as they fear your death if they didnt they might have stormed in and messed everything up but you know that you managed to pull it off and it still gives you no joy how are the two she asked the two you rescued he tossed his hair out of his face and studied her i believe they are injured but will both live to tell of it any others nothing but minor injuries some bites melio touched her arm turned her toward him and pulled her close mena this went well you should be pleased lets dance tonight as the halaly do and be glad that theres one less foulthing walking the world think of it that way mena accepted his embrace welcomed it and wanted to be folded into it for much longer than she allowed herself in public but she did not think as he suggested not completely at least she would never forget the look in the beasts eyes that night after the celebrations she dreamed of the creatures stare she woke unsure where waking events ended and dreaming began she told herself that it was the dream that made her so uneasy not the reality it was not possible that she had seen intelligence in the creatures eyes she had not heard its thoughts not with her waking mind it had not expressed a hatred for her and her kind that in its reasoned simmering potency went far beyond that of any simple beast that had been only in her dreams of course only in her dreams strange though that so soon after the event she could not easily separate the truth of it from her imaginings she decided to send a letter to the queen declaring that they had one less foulthing to worry about thats all she would say she would keep moving keep believing c hapter t wo in the offices that had once been her fathers queen corinn akaran bent over her desk arms spread wide and palms pressed against the smooth grain of the polished hardwood the flared sleeves of her gown formed an enclosure of sorts a screen that shielded the document from view on two sides she was alone in her offices but she knewbetter than anyone else in the palacethat until she had eyes in the back of her head she could not trust that she was ever as unaccompanied as she believed herself to be she favored this posture when she wished to focus her attention on a particular document above which she would hang like a falcon poised to drop on a held mouse far below nine years had passed since she had wrested the acacian empire from hanish meins grasp nine years of wearing the title of queen nine years of bearing the nations burdens on her shoulders nine years in which she confided fully in no one single person nine years of showing only glimpses of herself to different people never the whole to anybody nine years as a mother nine years of secret study nine years of learning to speak like a god her beauty was such that few noticed the effects of the passing seasons on her she was slim enough to be the envy of women ten years her junior youthful enough to be the ideal for girls who did not yet have to measure themselves against her shapely enough in her carefully tailored gowns that mens eyes followed her of their own accord whether the man himself wished them to or not no man who was attracted to women failed to see beauty in her full mouth in her olive complexion in her rounded shoulders and bosom and in the curve of her hips when had such a form ever embodied so much power and been driven by a mind as calculating when had such a sensuous face ever been so latent with danger she had surprised everyone with her sudden emergence to power and all who had known her in her youth remained shocked by it corinn knew these things as well as anyone she made a point of knowing things she knew that in the lower town the people called her the fanged rose she rather liked the name she knew which nobles were still fool enough to think they might bed her she knew that a movement was afoot in the senate to force her to marry if they had their way she would produce a legitimate heir to displace the son hanish had fathered they would not have their way she knew which senators most hated her for curtailing their power and which clans and tribes most chafed against her recent decision to establish one national currencythe hadinthat the royal reserve exclusively minted she knew which nobles needed to be played against one another during the intricate work of pushing her plans forward she was glad to know all these things added together and weighed one against another the balance always tipped in her favor she was secure in rule and she had plans to become even more so soon if all the scheming complexity of her position had etched fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes so be it if she was fuller in the hips and chest than she had been before childbirth what did that matter if she walked more on her heels and less on the eager balls of her feet that was as it should be she had been lovely as a girl but she knew that there were other ways to be lovely as a woman she was not yet the age her mother was in her memories which meant she had not reached the age to measure herself against her understanding of beauty and of mortality that day would come she knew but not just yet for the time being her physical appearance was a gift to be used as readily as skill with a sword the core of her power now resided in her mind her thoughts and her capacity to outflank others from a place of intellect hidden behind her pleasing facade she had never been the vacuous vessel so many had assumed it just took a great deal of anger to finally awaken the talents she had long let lie dormant for that anger she had hanish mein to thank in her own way she remembered that daily at one corner of her desk sat a letter from the winery of prios their vines were ready it declared they would happily begin the mass production the queen charged them with just as soon as the additive reached them they would begin bottling good she thought the people had been cleareyed too long already she knew they were starting to grumble and with good reason too the document she now studied was the last of the reports she had commissioned on the state of agriculture in northern talay it told a dire story while central talay had always been arid the north had been somewhat more temperate the sea currents and the wind that drove them had brought moisture enough to keep the land fertile well suited to producing grains and fruits and vegetables that could be traded with the floating merchants for goods from throughout the inland sea and from as far away as the vumu archipelago these goods in turn were sent south into central talay which had its own goods to offer in the form of livestock and mineral wealth thus there had been a balance of farming and trade for generations not so any longer the damage done to the plains of talay by the war and by the santoth magic had left them parched something in this had changed the flow of the winds now a scorching breeze swept up from the plains and evaporated the sea moisture before it ever reached land what fog there was they said in bocoum hung offshore temptingly haunting them like a mirage that appeared each morning but would come no nearer northern crops had withered more year by year and this summer looked to be the driest yet even the wheatgrassusually so heartyhad silvered to straw it combusted and fed wildfires that blackened the sky the last time the merchants docked at bocoum they found the talayans had little to trade instead of engaging in commerce the merchants found themselves fighting off assaults from the famished desperate farmers and townspeople considering the way the sea currents whirled trade around the heart of the empire this break in the chain of commerce had farreaching consequences who would have thought that a lack of water in one place would affect the prosperity of nations hundreds of miles away it was corinn knew a threat more formidable than any of the foulthings her sister hunted it required her focused attention and she was now ready to offer it her answer was a simple thing really rooted in a basic need and in her newfound ability to deliver gifts no other living being could if what she had planned worked as she believed it would they would surely find another name for her in talay a name of praise perhaps she would decide upon the name herself and have it whispered among the people until they took it up she would make them think the name was of their own devising there was a power in naming she had come to believe a great power the bone whistle by which her door guards alerted her of arrivals came to her two notes that identified the person entering as her secretary rhrenna a relative of hanish meins who had been something of a friend to her during her captivity in the meinish court corinn chose her over rialus neptos the other nonfamilial holdover from her previous life he was her confidant in many areas yes but she could not stand having him around too often it suited her much better that such an intimate position be filled by a woman and a woman decidedly indebted to her for a time after her sudden rise to power corinn thought rhrenna had been killed during the massacre of mein she had orchestrated with numrek aid it was not until a number of weeks later that the young woman was found hiding aboard a trading vessel off the aushenian coast along with several of her maids when rhrenna was brought back to acacia corinn had welcomed her with something between honest affection and relief it was good to know that not all those she had sentenced to death were lost forever it gave her the opportunity to provide amnesty and she needed that rhrenna entered she was pale and slim attractive in a fineboned way but she looked as if the bounty of acacia never quite nourished her as completely as one might hope she spoke in a pleasant voice one suited to song and often called for late on banquet evenings excuse me your majesty but you have visitors sire dagon and sire neen of the league wish a brief audience with you dagon and neen i didnt even know they were on the island yes they just arrived they beg your forgiveness but swear the matter is urgent by custom the leaguemen should have petitioned her officially for a meeting at least three days ahead of time as much as she would have liked to turn them away corinn knew that if she did she would wonder what had brought them so urgently she would spend her time trying to figure it out better to hear them and know from their mouths then she would search out the truth behind what they said she greeted them in the meeting room adjacent to her main balcony one large chamber open to the air down its whole length instead of enjoying the view however she sat at ease in a highbacked chair the brightness of the day at her back her fingers curled around the knobbed fists of the armrests to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure she asked crossing her legs as dagon and neen approached two sires calling on me at once a rare treat the pleasure is all ours sire dagon said bowing his head in the slow manner of leaguemen we beg forgiveness for the intrusion sire neen added the matter is of considerable import your majesty we could not but bring it to you immediately both men fell into ritual greeting spreading platitudes like rose petals they hoped would scent the room they were dressed in the silken luxurious robes of their sect and moved with a monklike air of reverence they were not from a religious organizationindeed their main doctrine centered on the insatiable appetite for wealthbut they were a closed group with mysterious ways that few outsiders understood outwardly they were always gaunt most often tall with necks elongated by a lifelong stretching process their heads were bound in infancy and squeezed into a conical shape that eventually hardened to permanence it was said they smoked their own distillation of mistone so potent it would kill normal folkthat lengthened their life spans but as no one outside the league knew when any of them was born or when most of them died it was impossible to verify this rumor though they talked as if this visit had no purpose other than social interaction corinn noticed that neither man fingered a mist pipe this more than anything else was an indication they were anxious to get to the point she obliged them sires she broke in sit down please i know your time is valuable i trust you havent had problems with the additive you assured me it was perfected it is sire dagon exclaimed it is even as we speak it is being delivered to prios with careful instructions no its another matter he paused a moment cleared his throat and began we have always been direct with each other you and i direct and completely honest i will be exactly that way with this matter mentally corinn rolled her eyes league directness had a lot in common with the knotted brambles that choked the hills along the rivers in senival one could get tangled in that directness pricked a thousand times by barbs that dug deeper if you fought them it was true that she had known sire dagon longer than sire neen she felt vaguely more comfortable with him it was he with whom she had brokered the arrangement that withdrew league support from hanishs war effort and with whom she had drawn up the basic details of their continued commerce they were not details she was proud of but such were the realities of rule chief among the concessions she had made was deeding the league ownership of the outer isles the chain of white sand islands that had once been dariels haven as a brigand was now a series of plantations for the breeding and raising of quota they deemed it necessary for the entire system to be selfenclosed there could be no outside influence whatsoever nobody could trade or interact with the breeding population whats more the breeders themselves could have no memories of anything other than their life on the islands for this reason they had acquired infant children for several years now it would be some time yet before they were truly producing quota as sire dagon and the others envisioned but it would lead to complete selfsufficiency the slaves themselves would plant and harvest their own food they would trade for goods among themselves within an enclosed system that cost the empire nothing they would know nothing other than the existence the league engineered for themand that sire dagon had promised the queen personally would be an existence of stability and even some measure of comfort once the league set in place a system of apparent selfgovernance for them along with a religious doctrine shaped to the situation the slaves need not even feel themselves slaves at all the result of this all was that they would offer their children up without question different islands would host them at different ages so that parents would not grow to love children children would never know their parents the exact details the league never disclosed to her and she never asked just the fact that she had allowed it was a close enough bond between them it would hold she believed for generations perhaps for another twentytwo as had been the case with the original agreement tinhadin had brokered did it ever trouble her conscience yes but such as she often reminded herself was the burden of rule i would expect nothing less from you dear dagon she said making sure her courteous tone had a bite to it and you will get nothing less from me proceed sire dagon nodded his eyes half closed as if the words were music to him queen corinn you must know by now that the league holds you in the highest regard in truth we havent held such complete faith in an akaran for several generations no insult to your ancestors intended of course its just that we find yours a remarkable reign young though it is so full of promise sire neen slipped in grinning his teeth had been filed not to points but to roundness each of them a gentle curve of measured uniformity when corinn looked at him she kept her gaze pinned to his forehead his eyes had a dead quality to them a reptilian flatness that she could notand to some degree did not wish topenetrate she was not sure which of the leaguemen held greater rank nor did she know where or how sire neen had served the league before taking over management of the outer isles project they never offered the information and she never asked despite their claim of directness a few minutes more passed with both men praising the peace she had brought both of them sure that the empire would soon be more prosperous than ever in its history eventually corinn lifted her finger please you digress again what are you really here to tell me or ask of me the two leaguemen conferred with their eyes and seemed to conclude that the time had come sire neen said there has been an unfortunate development recently last fall to be precise we sought intelligence about the auldek sought intelligence there has never been a more closed maddeningly secretive people than the lothan aklun sire dagon said with no hint that his listener might find this complaint ironic coming from him as you know the lothan aklun are to the auldek what we are to you they are not the market you trade with they are simply the merchants who hold sway in the other lands corinn interrupted this was a detail the league was slow in divulging if we were cautious in divulging our information it was largely because we knew and still know so little ourselves bad information is no better than information surely you agree he paused but not long enough for corinn to answer we know the other lands are vast we know the auldek are powerful but that is all we know as you will understand that is no knowledge at all so we concluded that now as we are entering a new age under your leadership it was essential that we learn more of this nation we are so dependent on you sent spies among them just so but before we learned much of anything sire neen proceeded one of our agents was found out and captured he in turn was convinced to betray other agents several were captured and questioned how many corinn asked oh dagon pursed his lips as if the exact number were of no consequence but then he produced it twentyseven twentyseven are you mad neen fondled his gold neck collar fingering the dolphin shape embossed there it is a large territory one or two spies would have told us nothing it would have been a waste and still a risk at that our spies were finely trained disciplined and looked perfectly the part of grown slaves we were all shocked when one was caught and shocked that he gave up the others so thoroughly it seems the other leagueman said that the lothan aklun took possession of them they have very persuasive forms of torture corinn tapped her fingernails against the hard wood of the armrests waiting for more so youve been caught spying how have the lothan aklun responded put simply sire neen said this has placed us in an awkward position what we believe will help is a direct entreaty from yourself we will make our own apologies directly to both parties but if you could stand strong with us while avowing complete innocence in the matter it will strengthen our position the lothan aklun need to know that the league and the acacian crown are two fingers of the same hand you want me to tell them youre my preferred middlemen is that it but what if they can offer better terms both men looked aghast though she knew it was a show nothing surprised men like these sire dagon said majesty you can have no idea what sort of mistake that would be corinn smiled why dont you tell me then sire dagon showed her the palms of his hands his long fingers crooked it was a rather odd gesture that she had yet to understand fully you and the next several generations of akarans would waste your lives trying to learn all the many branches of lothan aklun duplicity they are vile completely without conscience and they would seek to cheat you in every way possible they huddle on the isles of the barrier ridge scheming new treacheries it is only because wethe leaguehave dealt with their every scheme over the centuries that you are spared such things they would love nothing better than feasting on your ignorance of their ways and sire neen added once more showing his ghastly teeth the league owns the gray slopes without us you can no more get to the aklun than they can get to you only we have successfully navigated that great ocean and all its dangers so ive been told time and again if you like sire dagon said you could see for yourself with your own eyes we have permission from the league council to offer you transport across to meet with them nothing would impress upon the lothan aklun the strength of our partnership like seeing you stand beside us corinn looked between both men trying to read them while not betraying how shocked she was by the proposal in all the years of the quota trade no akaran had met with the lothan aklun the league had guarded their exclusivity jealously if this offer was genuine they must really be worried i cannot leave acacia right now she eventually said but i will send my brother prince dariel with a message from me to the lothan aklun he should be returning to acacia in a few days he will appease them and then get on with business she could not read whether or not they were happy with this pronouncement but for them being hard to read was as essential to life as breathing rising she dismissed them formally promising to sort out the details with them in the coming days alone once more a few minutes later the queen again stood over her desk trying to recall each word spoken and the gestures that accompanied them of course the leaguemen had not told her everything they would never do so anyway but they likely hid some aspects of the affair that she would do better to know about she would have rialus send out his ears his rats to see what more they could learn as for her brother perhaps he really should accompany them there were surely things to be gained it was an opportunity best grasped before the league found a way to squirm out of it she heard somebody enter the room she felt a flare of annoyance but it vanished just as quickly she knewfrom the rapidity of his steps and the lack of a whistle to announce himexactly who it was before he had begun speaking mother watch this a childs voice said see what ive learned corinn straightened looked up and watched her son aaden dash into the room he carried a wooden training sword a small light version designed for children appropriate for a child of eight was what he was watch he ordered ill do the first part of the first form without waiting for affirmation he set his legs and brought the sword to ready position he focused on the imagined foe standing before him corinn grinned her little edifus at carni already imagining carnage he had never known a day of hardship in his life and yet he already hungered for conflict the boy moved with the awkward intense concentration of the young he stepped and swung parried and turned on the balls of his feet he wobbled a few times and corrected missteps on occasion seeming so focused that he barely breathed through his tight lips watching him his mother paid little attention to the form itself or to his performance of it she simply stared at him amazed at the act of creation that had brought him to life she had made this child this complete exquisite human being how was it possible that she possessed the power to draw that small mouth and fill it with those perfect tiny teeth and his eyes well they were gray flecked with brown almost too large for his face but he would grow into them and when he did they would melt all whom he set them upon had she done all this the boy spun in a sudden flourish his long wavy hair sweeping around him corinn always felt she should have it cut short keep it trim and close to his scalp neat but she never had the heart to order it done in his infancy she had held this boy and stroked the hairless crown of his head and run her fingers around the soft indentations in his skull and pressed her palm over the spots he had seemed so vulnerable then he had remained so for nearly a year before his hair began to thicken and lengthen part of her had feared the prospect of his having strawblond meinish hair but as it grew in she loved the look and touch of it how could she help but adore it it was her sons hair true he was hanish meins son as well the proof was there in the gold highlights of his brown hair in the alreadysharp line of his jaw and in the shape of his mouth his features often had something of hanishs dreamy quality a mirthful expression that had often disguised his true thoughts and intentions yes he was hanishs son corinn lived with awareness of that fact every day but he would not bear that traitors name he was officially all akaran corinn was all the parent he needed if one sought to name his fathershe had once snapped at an ambassador impertinent enough to question her on the childs parentagelook no further than the line of akaran itself thats what aaden was the child of edifus and tinhadin and every other akaran who had ever walked across the known world he was named after tinhadins firstborn son corinn thought that appropriate and hopefully prophetic corinn found it disturbing that there were no words to adequately describe the love a parent feels for a child before shed become a mother shed known so little all those years she had understood nothing of what her mother and her father must have gone through raising four children it rankled her to think how foolish she had once been it was a strange unpleasant emotion to follow so quickly on her adoration it concerned her that she might at some point in the future look back from a place of greater wisdom and again find that the self she now wasat thirtythree the mother of a single child the widow to a lover who had planned her murder a sister to two living siblings and one dead an orphan who could no longer look to her parentshad been ignorant on some matter of import she kept such thoughts exclusively to herself of course to the outside world she was a display of statuesque certainty and why shouldnt she be she was the queen of a vast empire and the keeper of the most powerful knowledge the world had ever known she owed it to her people to be certain in all her actions hesitation deliberation second thoughts these were signs of weakness the kind of flaws that kept her father from being a truly great king the failings that temporarily lost the empire no matter she thought acacia now had a great queen the nation would thrive because of it she promised it would a queen to stand strong a mother to raise the nations next king that was what aaden was to be even if the world was not yet as sure of it as she was born outside of an official marriage aaden was not guaranteed the throne he could succeed her but not without challenges and protests from other agnate families those who would rather she marry among them and bear a legitimate child also any child of a marriage of her siblingslike mena and melioswould step before aaden in the line of succession but there was no such child yet and before long corinn would surprise them all as focused as the young swordsman had been when he reached the end of his memorized routine he dropped his role completely his sword arm went limp at his side and he strolled toward his mothers desk a look of sudden boredom on his face thats about all ive learned i wanted to learn the end bit but thotan said i had to begin at the beginning aaden the queen said thats wonderful youll be a fine swordsman someday better than dariel id wager better even than mena the child accepted the praise with a curt nod he assured her that he already was a fine swordsman no someday needed to qualify it still something about the compliment rekindled his focus he turned his attention back to the form determination etched in the lines of his forehead the tip of his tongue pinched between his front teeth i enjoyed watching that corinn said but you should go i have matters to consider all right the boy said and then he lowered his voice went conspiratorial but show me something first an animal make something ive never seen before no make something that nobody has ever seen before glancing around corinn said aaden you know i dont like to do such things here with so many eyes around but theres nobody here aaden said incongruously leaning in and whispering wait until were back at calfa ven mother just one thing and then ill go its been ages since youve shown me something were alone look corinn took a moment to verify that the room was empty that no eyes watched and no one was within hearing she rarely indulged any living person anything not completely to her liking but aaden was difficult to refuse or in truth with him she did not want to refuse seeing pleasure on his face was a joy like none shed known before she said go make sure the door is pulled tight then stepping from around her desk she withdrew into the small alcove in the corner of the room out of sight lest somebody barge in unannounced such an act was strictly forbidden of course but she still chose caution certain that they would not be disturbedand with a portion of her senses able to detect the movement of persons in the hallways nearbycorinn began to sing she did so softly as if she wished to push the words out and into a shallow bowl on the floor before her directing them carefully and so as not to spill over some imagined rim she sang words that were not words sounds that carried in them the ingredients of existence the threads that wove together life she felt aaden return and knew him to be standing wideeyed just beside her she did not shift her gaze from the area above the floor that she sang to if she had been asked to explain just how the givers tongue worked she could not truly have done so it was not a practice that led logically from one point to another it was a language that never held still that changed before her eyes and in her ears there was an order to it yes a manner in which one moved toward greater and greater mastery yes there was learning involved she had labored for years over the song of elenet especially when sheltered away with aaden and a small staff at the hunting lodge of calfa ven countless times the text on those ancient pages had risen to speak to her like spirits trapped on the parchment and unleashed by the touch of her eyes they spoke to her of the givers true language they put her through exercises twisted her tongue around words made of sounds she had never heard uttered despite all this the act of singing remained something of an improvisation that leaped from all those hours of study and took on a life of its own though this frightened hersometimes waking her from dreams in which her song had suddenly turned to nightmarethe act itself was a thing of such enraptured beauty that she could no longer be away from it long aaden wanted her to sing truth be known she hungered for it even more than he and sing she did her wordsunintelligible beautiful and infused with an almost physical powerfilled the alcove sound danced in the air as if the small chamber were laced with invisible ribbons like snakes airborne and slithering circling as corinn continued the circle grew ever smaller she pulled the spell in drew it tighter filled that invisible bowl with sounds that shrank into greater substance soon the words of her song swam like hundreds of sparkling minnows a seething globe of them getting denser and denser within this a form began to take shape something that nobody has ever seen before thats what aaden asked for and that was what she was singing into being she would let it live there before them for a few moments and then she would sing its unmaking c hapter t hree the guards at the lower steps of the palace grounds made the mistake of barring the young mans passage one of them asked him what he was about the other hit the strangers chest with the flat of his palm his knife hand ready to pull his dagger from his waist sheath a third sounded a whistle of alarm they all expressed indignation that a laborer a peasantwhatever the new arrival was in his tattered clothing with unkempt hair calloused hands and bare feetwould dare try to gain entry to the royal residence he could be executed on the spot for it they held this fate off the first guard said only because they wished to know the nature of his insanity before doing the deed in answer the intruder took a step back he set his hands on his hips and stood smiling he knew his garments were worn thin grimed by what looked like years of wearing patched in places and shredded in others his toenails were black crescents and the creases of his elbows neck and forehead were drawn with thin lines of dirt he stood with easy confidence however his whitetoothed smile asked them to see the person behind these outward trappings see the mirth in his eyes and wonder at it see the etched musculature beneath the rags see his face for what it was not what it appeared to be it was a tense moment although everyone but the young man seemed aware of this responding to a blown whistle several other marah approached menacing sword hands ready among them was a face the man knew well but did not much care for rialus neptos hung at the back of the new arrivalsno fighter he but as usual eager to observe anything he could report to the queen he was not her chancellor as he was rumored to think himself but everyone knew that he shared a closeness with corinn akaran that none could fathom he was a councillor she seemed to grant as much access to as she offered her siblings rialus was quicker than the rest to recognize the young man for a moment he looked just as perplexed as the guards draw no swords he shouted pushing forward draw no swords you fools do you not see this is prince dariel the second guardthe one who had touched him but not yet spokensputtered princeprince dariel he glanced at the others his face twisted in puzzlement he moved his hand away from his dagger as if shocked that he had ever gripped it your highness i dont understand ah youve pegged me the young man said holding his mirthful expression a moment longer before breaking into laughter and your lack of comprehension is clear friend your partners here are the more confused have i really been away for so long i thought it just a few months he paused but nobody had a ready response none of you has ever seen a prince in paupers clothing i take it its the man who makes the clothes you know not the other way around he danced in suddenly light on his feet as if fencing nodding toward the councillor he added rialus neptos it seems understands this better than most the second guard continued to sputter while his two companions begged forgiveness several of the newly arrived marah bowed low to the ground rialus tried to form a question about his garb seemed to sense the question was fraught with insult and instead posed a series of queries after none of which he kept quiet long enough to hear the answers to dariel mentioned casually that he was here to see the queen on matters of state he should probably be on his way but should rialus prefer to interrogate him first he sketched his indifference in the air with his hand for that matter he did not mind being delayed by each marah who wished to question him of course the queen might not like to be kept waiting a moment later dariel was striding along rialus shuffled a half step behind him signaling furiously with his hands and arms and face at any soldier or guard that might possibly think to intercept them by the confused looks the men and women sent him it was clear few understood his antics not at least until they recognized dariels face and bearing despite his garb the prince walked with assurance and obvious military fitness all who might have questioned him instead stepped to the side is it true what i hear said about you rialus dariel asked whats that sir dariel did not slacken his pace but looked at the councillor askance one corner of his mouth lifted that youve found love rialus that you found marital harmony in the arms of a woman who was once your servant id no idea you were so liberally minded though i had heard you were on something of a diligent search for a well for a wife to complete you this had been a running joke for the last few years rialus once he had his quarters set up in what had been a meinish compound during hanishs rule had set about staffing it almost entirely with attractive young women it was rumored that not all of them knew much about keeping an officials house in order but most of them made up for it with a propensity toward buxomness a few it was said came directly from houses of prostitution and served entirely to satisfy rialuss considerable carnal appetite who could blame himpent up as he had been in cathgergen for so many of his prime years dariel really felt no superiority to him in this regard he did not even condemn rialus for marrying a servant girl truth be known he envied him the freedom to marry whomever he chose this was not a freedom he himself had as corinn had made abundantly clear no need to explain yourself to me dariel said cutting him off before he got fully up to speed in his sputtering explanation he slapped a hand down on the mans thin shoulder feeling him wince beneath it be a happy man rialus plant a child in her become immortal the princes voice trailed off he had just mounted one of the upper stairs and turned on the patio to take in the view as ever the terraced descent of acacia to the sea was a wonder to behold beneath him the land cascaded down level on level merging together like a maze cut by stairways and fortifying walls with great houses in the higher reaches and smaller structures lower corinn had ordered new paint colors mixed to announce the return of akaran rule and to represent the new age she believed they were entering so the rooftops and spires and globes below him flashed in brilliant hues of sky blue and crimson and orange of brown and silver that shimmered like sun on water dariel found it somewhat garish really he almost remarked once that the colors suited the flamboyant tastes of a sea isle brigand outpost but he had held his tongue sure that corinn would not care for the comparison still garishly clothed or not acacia had weathered the changes of human fortune with quiet resilience he wondered if the island itself would outlive all empires and go on in its beauty long after humans ceased clamoring over it the sea would surround it then just as now the sun would rise from one horizon and set in the other just as now in a way this notion of a lonely acacia was a pleasing thought though dariel was not sure why that should be so he should want his people to rule here without end he did of course but a person he had come to believe can want two conflicting things at the same time after the councillor had vouched for his identity dariel left rialus at the entrance to corinns offices entering the inner chambers the prince was aware of a scent in the air that he often detected around his sister it was something other than the fragrant concoctions that bubbled quietly in small pots throughout the room something other than the blossoms from the flowering bushes kept in great basins on her balcony he thought it an essential oil she must wear dabbed somewhere on her person a scent all her own strange that because he did not exactly find it a pleasant smell sharp and dry as it was corinn waited for him she was alone standing with her arms clasped at her waist her face composed as if she had anticipated the exact moment of his arrival she had developed a tendency toward always seeming completely ready never surprised it was yet another small thing about his sister that left him uneasy the grin that lifted her cheeks could not have been anything but genuine though spontaneous that was another characteristic he had become more aware of in the last few years she could shift from her aloof composure to girlish familiarity and back again so completely that when she was in one state it was impossible to imagine her in the other what a sight you are dariel she exclaimed you come to poke fun at me is that it look at you you sent me out to work among the people like a slave dariel said raising his arms and spinning so that she could take his clothing in and so i return to you looking the part aaden is desperate to see you you know but if you walked in like that hed likely draw his sword and challenge you she moved forward stepped into the embrace of his uplifted arms and hugged him briefly pulling back she studied him let us sit and talk a moment later the two reclined in soft leather chairs sitting across from each other a carved stone table between them in the center of it a small fire glowed giving off considerable heat a servant set two tumblers of mulled wine on the table and then retired tell me corinn said taking up a tumbler and warming her hands around it did you accomplish what you wished he nodded he had his own question to ask and felt it should be dealt with first what word from mena mena is well she has nearly completed the work i asked of her melio is well also and kelis they have performed admirably at their tasks i know part of you wished to be with them hunting the foulthings perhaps protecting your sisterbut mena needs no protection you were right when you brought this charity work proposal to me now tell me of it dariel reached for the wine inhaled the spicy scent and fell into a detailed response to her query for the past year he had found a sort of joy in daily labor that he had never known before it came about because he was so very fatigued with war with piracy with violence with seeing his loved ones die for several years after the war with hanish mein dariel had led forces to hunt down the surviving meinthe ones still in any sort of rebellion at least and he had squashed the flareups of rebellion all over the empire each people trying to find some way to grab more of the known worlds map before things settled again it had amazed him that the peace seemed just as violent as the war it was always this way after wars advisers told him but still it troubled him this hadnt been just any war it was alivers war the war to set the world to rights so that there need be no future wars everyone said they believed this few it seemed to him also acted as if they did when the peace was finally established he found himself just as ill at ease he did not want the throne though he could have claimed it as the male heir that sort of power did not appeal to him he had no desire to loaf about the palace courting noblewomen as corinn seemed to wish him to do nor could he return to the outer isles and again sail those gray slopes of water the isles had been handed over entirely to the league in a deal corinn had struck with it on her own authority the league owned them now their own separate state within the empire it was recompense corinn made it clear for dariels stunt on the league platforms he did not understand until later but she was actually quite angry with him when she fully understood his role in the attack it had crippled the leagues capacity to trade across the gray slopes it had cost them thousands of quota lives and hundreds of their own kind it was such a monstrous success that corinn had to acquiesce to giving them more than she would have liked and she hinted she had needed to give away even more to get them to promise that dariel would not end up dead in some mysterious way poison or accident or mysterious disappearance the fact that she clearly considered them capable of all these things had set his skin crawling also as soon as the quiet settled upon him he began to have dreamsnightmares reallyabout the day aliver was killed at first dariel thought it was some belated way of mourning his brother but as the dreams grew more intense he realized it was not just that he dreamed more and more of the aftermath of the duel more and more about his murder of maeander mein he had ordered it even though aliver had granted maeander protection and agreed to the particulars of the duel dariel could not be sure that his blade had even touched the man but he had whispered for his death and made all his people accomplices to the murder it was a foul way to stain the sacred moments after his brothers passing the shame of it grew within him as time passed more and more fervently he wanted to find a way to live without regret to do enough with the life he still had before him so that he would feel he had been a force for good in the world it was wren who suggested he again find work to occupy him not murderous work though not military why not build she had asked likely youd be as good at that as you were at piracy and sabotage she actually had to suggest it several times before the seed split within him and took root wonderful quiet wren sharp as a razor in more ways than one when he took the proposal of rebuilding to corinn he found her amiable enough with her blessing he set out on the work that had occupied him body and soul as wren had suggested he built he arrived in killintich with a small army of surveyors engineers architects historians and laborers once proud the capital of aushenia had suffered neglect and abuse since the numrek invasion dariel set about rebuilding that damaged city brick by brick he worked right beside laborers digging ditches slopping through canals hefting loads on his back it was toil unlike any he had known before and he loved it the work may have been nothing more than an attempt to busy himself but he hoped it was more and that he was doing good for the right reasons it was important to him that this be true he described for corinn the small moments he felt he would never forget how he enjoyed sitting at fires with villagers and eating stew from wooden bowls talking about such things as the weather and the growth of crops he welcomed the fatigue with which he lay down each night pleased that he had stolen nothing killed no one planned no destruction he loved sleeping on straw mattresses and watching barn cats hunt mice and listeningas he once had in a village near the gradthic rangeto two owls converse through the night on the road outside careven a blondhaired boy had presented him with a crown woven of grass at a commemorative ceremony at aushenguk fell an old woman had approached him silently from behind without a word she pressed her flat chest against his back and wrapped her stick arms around his torso and clung there she had no weight at all he said light as a bird she never said a thing but he was sure the gesture was one of thanks as it should be corinn said i dont know that there was any similar venture done by an akaran in all our generations of rule word is youve done us a great service the people speak well of you ive learned from you brother dariel took a long draft of wine enough to wash down the first thoughts he had on hearing this she always thought foremost of rule and reputation and of the empires fortunes perhaps she had to as queen but he wanted to remember the good he did for the people he served not for the akaran name there is still so much to do he said i barely know what to attend to next there must be some way we can fight the drought in talay and i know it will seem a strange idea but we must convince the mainlanders to begin planting new trees to replace the ones they cut from the eilavan woodlands i passed along the edge of it on the way to aos and i saw miles of stumps and bracken hardly a forest at all anymore he paused for no reason other than something in the patient way corinn watched him indicated that she was humoring him that she had something to say but was letting him ramble on first what i heard something that doesnt please me dariel you have been critical of my policies just like that he felt a cold hand grip his heart he felt the pulse in his palms suddenly strong it was absurd she was his sister there was no danger here no matter that his body seemed to think there was i havent he said i dont know what you mean king grae complained to you about our tax levees on aushenian ports you ive heard saiddo you recall what you said he did but he shook his head shrugged you said you may have a point how could you say that do you understand how that undermines me i didnt mean that its just that they pay us for dont question me they pay us for the very possibility of the prosperitythe peace to trade thats what we give them what we take is no more than our due if we give them their commerce were giving them the first piece of their independence would that be so bad dariel thought but did not dare say we cannot do that we cannot even suggest that its possible grae doesnt know whats good for him hes like a child who would eat only sweets he may be happyuntil his teeth drop out no the only way to prosperity in the known world is my way the akaran way never show doubt about that certainly not before others eyes she inhaled ran her hand over her face and changed her demeanor with warmer more complacent tones in her voice she said its fine that you have already given so much and that you wish to continue with such work father would have been proud aliver would have been proud the delay between now and when you may return to such work will be a small thing im sure she set down her tumbler untasted as far as he could tell and leaned forward in her seat i am proud of you too brother but i have an important assignment for you there has been a mishap in the other lands i will need your help to mend it as he listened dariel teetered between dread and excitement the league had been in contact with the auldek those mystery people to whom so many children had been sent it had not gone well and now the league needed help it was hard for him to fathom corinn was telling him he would travel across the gray slopes he would ride waves as large as mountainsif the tales were trueand see the massive schools of sea wolves the dreaded creatures that only the league had found a way to evade he would set his eyes on the other lands amazing something no known acacian had ever done you will be my ambassador corinn said smiling as if there were something more ironic about this than he knew you will represent me and carry all my authority with you you dariel are charged with the most important mission ive yet asked of anyone the collapse of this foreign trade is a greater threat to us than hanish mein ever was i dont exaggerate hanish could be killed outright and moved beyond easy but if we dont resume the mist trade you dont mean to start that again i do stop i know what you think about it i know what aliver promised but hes not here we cannot go on indefinitely trading quota for gems and metals and trinkets the trade has been pathetic unsustainable we need a return to the stability that kept this nation together for twentytwo generations dariel started to protest but she spoke over him and i mean that in two different ways one we have partnersthe league the lothan aklun even the auldekwho expect things of us are invested in us have so much in place do you want them all as enemies again dariel would have spoken but corinn did not pause no of course not two the people of the provinces are growing disgruntled tell me you dont know this is true they gripe and plot and scheme to cause mischief its only a matter of time dariel until they rebel and that would do no one any good it would be chaos suffering this time she did give him leave to speak words failed him though she was not wrong there was discontent out there he had felt it thinly veiled behind mens eyes even as he worked to help the people he knew they did not accept him or his work as completely as he wished and know this the queen said i will not drug them as we did before it wont be the same dariel i promise that do you promise it wont be worse dariel thought in new ways corinn stood up smoothed her gown and waited for dariel to rise when he did she extended her arms palms down but fingers reaching to clasp his go to them brother and do not fail to assuage them and negotiate a continuation of the peace without it we are truly in jeopardy we are blameless all you have to do is convince them of that and then charm them dariel took a moment to respond part of him wanted to refuse her but that was not easily done and surely he could be a better emissary than anyone else she might send perhaps in seeing the lothan aklun and auldek in the flesh he would learn things about them and find ways to alter the nature of their trade she wished him to go for her reasons but perhaps he could find a way to trade in something other than quota and mist she wouldnt fault him for thatnot if he brought a new arrangement to her that would replace the old perhaps this was a first step toward that he tried to believe he heard these possibilities behind her words but something kept him from mentioning them directly when will i leave he asked surprised that the first thing he uttered indicated acceptance of the mission you sail with sire neen in two days time he began preparations as soon as he knew of your safe arrival here take no distractions with you understand wren does not go with you dariel must have registered his disappointment on his face though he was not aware of doing so very little of what falls on us as leaders is easy you know that much of it challenges us ive no doubt you wont love your time with sire neen but for now we have no choice but to stay allied with the league for a moment dariel felt himself a boy again as confused and helpless as when his guardian spirited him from kidnaban and into years of hiding this in turn made him think of val his protector during those years as much his father as leodan is this the real corinn he asked measuring his voice to keep it even youll send me off again before ive even caught my breath youre a hard taskmaster sister corinn found something about this amusing a smile played across her lips and vanished only when she spoke i have to be brother i am queen and what of my work oh it will go on ill see to it myself dariel despite his disquiet laughed you sister will do charity work among the common people i will corinn said releasing on him the full radiance of her smile not in quite the same way as you but i have things planned i have to as i said i am the queen a little later dariel padded barefoot through his chambers the rooms were fragrant with the heavy incense wren favored the lamps burned low flames not actually lighting the room at all but just allowing the outlines for him to navigate toward the inner rooms he felt a deep need to talk with her to explain what had been presented to him and to plot ways that she could come with him even though he knew she couldnt wren was not a talker not sentimental either but that did not stop him from trying to talk to her from wanting to wring emotion out of her to match with his he found her sitting on the bed waiting for him he cleared his throat to announce himself and she looked up wren stood she wore a satin robe long and intricately embroidered as she walked toward him he prepared several phrases of greeting but the sensuous placement of her feet and the rocking of her hips took the words from his mouth she loosened her belt and shrugged the robe from her shoulders and continued forward slim and marvelously formed she smiled and dariel did too neither spoke c hapter f our the man had spent too many years working in the mines of kidnaban to easily stand straight now knowing he had a few moments more of solitude he did not try he leaned against the warehouse wall hearing the muffled discussion going on beyond it he had been tall even as a boy a head above almost anyone he had ever stood near since adolescence but that was when he stood upright at full height he had few opportunities to do that during the years he worked in the mines he had either crouched low as he shuffled down subterranean corridors or had strained beneath backbreaking loads he had to balance on his shoulders as he climbed the countless ladders that crept from the depths to the surface after twenty years of that his spine crooked in places it had not done in his youth he was comfortable only in one position curled on his side in the moments before sleep found him other than that his physical life was measured in degrees of discomfort he told himself it was better that way this way he would never forget why his work mattered to him above all other things a door nearby swung open abruptly and a thin man appeared blinking in the daylight and casting around with a hand shading his eyes barad there you are come in they will hear you now he motioned for the large man to approach when barad neared the other man grasped him by the elbow and spoke enthusiastically it is safe my friend have no fear while in nesreh we are friends here barad the lesser let himself be led i know that he said his voice was boulder deep and rumbling yours are good people elaz i wouldnt be here if they were not on entering the chamber barad could see little it was lit dimly by high slots in the ceiling and by lamps of smokeblacked glass he could tell immediatelyby the moist heat the scent of bodies and the muffled layer of sound in the airthat the warehouse was filled with people they were waiting silent now that he was finally among them with a great effort to keep his face placid barad drew himself up he raised his chin flaring his nostrils as he took the calming breath he needed to stand at his full height perhaps because it was such an effort the effect of his doing so was considerable he was a tall man with long legs and arms big handed with knuckles that any street brawler would have envied he felt the peoples eyes upon him impressed perhaps wary he had always had this effect on people that was why he did not rush to begin speaking let them see him for a moment let them note the strained purpose on his roughcut features the way his heavy eyes suggested a tranquil melancholy strength within he was never sure that he truly felt this in himself but he knew others saw it there and it suited him that they did after a few words of introduction from elaz he began if you will listen he said i will tell you a story a few voices responded saying they would listen some others clapped their hands against their chests a sign of affirmation barad could pick out individual faces now tired faces overworked faces with the characteristics that marked the relatively isolated coastal people of talay in many ways their flushed faces wide cheekbones and short noses distinguished them among the known worlds races but the curiosity the faint hunger in their eyes was no different from what he had seen in others eyes across the empire that was what he was here to speak to i will tell you my story hoping that in it you will hear your story as well hoping you will understand that we many share the same story and a tragic one it is he explained that he had been born in the camps outside the mines of kidnaban he had been raised in the knowledge that his life was committed to pulling precious metals from the earth that was all there was ever to be of it labor whatever living he was to do would be done in the pauses between labor loving raising children learning of the world all of these things happened only in stolen moments he was a water bearer at five years of age a rubble sifter at seven a wagon helper at eight by ten he was tall and strong enough to haul small sacks at twelve he was a digger taking out any anger he had on the tunnels in the earth and he did so for more years than he liked to count he knew nothing about the outside world but lived day and night under the supervision of guards in great towers whipped by drivers scowled at chained often he did not know why he worked this way did not understand the economics of the world and how the nuggets of metal that he dug up would enrich men a world away how was such a life livable two things made it so one the drug called mist youve heard of that im sure i think you know it well each nightor each day depending on the shift he workedhe could inhale the green smoke into his lungs and dream of a world of real life the other thing that made his labor livable was that he somehow did find the moments to be a man he loved a woman and put a child inside her he saw that child born and live a few precious years stealing moments to feel himself a father i lost this child though barad said lost him and his mother he cleared his throat and held to silence for a moment he always thought beforehand that the next time he spoke he would explain just how he lost them butas had happened a hundred times beforehis throat clenched tight on the words it did not open again until he resolved to move on leaving this one thing unsaid in the months leading up to the second war between the akarans and the mein he began to hear a voice in his dreams he would not have known the war was coming except that word of it came to him like a whisper carried far by a breeze it drifted into his mistsodden mind right there within his own head drugged on the floor of the mines he heard the returning princes words he was miles and miles away yes but aliver had found a way to speak to him what did he say he said the world was set for change he said he was returning from his long exile and that with the power of the empires people behind him and with help from the ancients he was going to not only overthrow hanish mein but also overturn the entire order of the world he would blow away mist like the wind disperses morning fog he would put fire to league ships and drive out the numrek and most important he would never again sell our children into whatever slavery awaits them across the gray slopes i was not the only one who heard such things many came off mist at that time buthe smiled tapping his templethis head of mine is bigger than the norm it is like a bell that rings louder than others and so i heard clearly things that others only had inklings of and he had swallowed it all he admitted he was starved for such possibilities he hungered to believe it why shouldnt he he remembered everything he heard and he took to shouting it to the workers around him at feeding times he spoke to gathered groups as they ate heads down trying to ignore him he bellowed inside tunnels and railed from ladders as he climbed at first nobody paid attention to him guards sometimes punished him but they thought him harmlessly mad slowly though slowly more and more found their mist dreams turning into nightmares eyes began to follow him grimy faces lifted from their food when he spoke eventually the masses came to him hungry for alivers message he gave it to them and felt the hope grow in them thousands and thousands of them opening their eyes with new clarity eager for the future my first mistake was in shouting too loud the people heard me yes but so did the ears of hanish mein the minute we rose in anger he clapped his hand down on us with a rain of arrows and fire with steel blades and unbending anger what were wewho had only hope as a weaponto do against the might of an empire that was my first mistake it would have been my last as well if aliver hadnt launched his war when the prince did hanish had to turn his attention to that greater horde of humanity marching toward him through talay barad escaped the mines during the chaos but was too far away to join aliver before he died he never saw his prince but he did know the moment his voice was silenced that was a tragic day friends barad said exhaling as he did so he let the pain tug at his features he knew this was an orators trick but in this case it was an honest action it did pain him to recall the moment those whispers died in his ears he had never felt a greater loss since ofttimes he was still reminded of it enough so that he sometimes froze in place with his head cocked listening he moved on with his speech talking through the aftermath of the war communication was irregular for the common people then and barad was awandering staying far from the mines finding some joy in the freedom to travel but unsure of his purpose anymore like everyone else he took a while to know what to make of this new queen such a beauty people said so clever to outwit hanish mein to use the numrek against the mein and to somehow convince the league to withdraw their support of him she was in the first half year of her reign adored by the entire populace aliver became an instant legend she became his heir a living female embodiment of the ideals of her martyred brother he had not lived but she had which meant there was yet hope but that wasnt so was it a chorus of voices agreed the queen aint her brother one man said not in any way except in sharing a name and thats nothing a woman added she is a viper that one sold us body and soul the worst of her kind barad let these comments sit and waited through a few more these people were finding their confidence enough to add their voices to grunt affirmation and nod their heads this was usually the way it went it never took them long to learn to trust him why should it everything he said was true he let them speak among themselves for a few minutes when they stopped barad said now that tale is no tale is it it is not makebelieve not a storytellers fancy every word of it is the truth and i believe you all know that chest claps and shouts indicated that they did and its no different for you either the details yes but the substance is the same you coastal folk you were proud once you worked the ocean despite its danger you know this better than i but with corinn as queen youve been changed from fishermen of the gray slopes to farmers of grain in a single generation that truly is sorcery do not mistake me we must plant and tend and harvest grain as well it is not that i say the work is beneath you its just that each people are born knowing how they are knowing what they do best knowing the work of their mothers and fathers knowing the work that will be their sons and daughters that was what it was like here in nesreh for generations but it is not that way anymore instead you pack grain in warehouses and ship it to islands of the lost to that place where they breed our children into slaves to exchange for great wealth in the leagues pockets in the akaran coffers in exchange for the drug that they believe makes us ignorant of our own enslavement am i correct a few in the audience affirmed that he was but they were not all sure how could they know what went on out there i understand that it is hard to be certain of all this so much is withheld from me as well as from you but i think we can all agree that queen corinn may one day be considered a greater evil than hanish mein many think her so already but now i see fear on some of your faces how can i say such a thing you wonder it is a crime and your hearing it makes you a part of my crime i say that is not true if you do not agree you have done no crime if you do agree you have done nothing but acknowledge the truth and there is no crime in that either barad had stepped from the raised platform on which he had been standing and now moved through the crowd he was slow gentle as he pushed between them a head taller than anyone there he liked to see their faces at this point and liked them to see his he dropped his voice slightly as well the warehouse went silent heads craning to follow him as he moved i want you to work with me to make the world as aliver akaran dreamed it for us this is treason i know but i invite each and every one of you to be traitors with me how can i trust you i will be honest with youi ask that question myself each day this goal i havewe have if you are with meis fraught with peril any one of you could be the spy who betrays our cause one of you it would only take one of you so how can i trust you he stopped before a middleaged woman he took her hand between his massive palms he could smell the toil on her the sweat and grime from her labors before coming to this meeting the almost sour scent of grain dust woven in every thread of her simple garments he spoke as if to her alone i trust you because i must only together can we do this only together if i dont have you with me i have nothing i may as well drag myself to kidnaban and offer my back so that it can be broken once and for all but if there is no hope for me there is none for you either i pray to the giver that is not the future before us still looking at the woman he said the part of this that was the hardest for him the only part that felt both true and feigned at the same time he believed it yes but he was never sure whether his belief was founded on its truth or whether the truth had grown out of his belief but i know that is not the future before us the giver has chosen us for greater things we are the chosen ones aliver whispers that to me nightly still he whispers it we are the givers people he says we have only to awaken to it and act what would you have us do then elaz asked casting his question from where he stood on the platform barad released the womans hand and turned back speak the truth each and every day speak it to your wives your husbands speak it to your children speak it to each other so that you hear it again and again and know it by heart and to those you doubt speak only parts of it test them if the entire tree is too much for them to gaze on at once plant seeds of truth in them first till the soil of your neighbors with love and with hope for them as well as yourselves and then be patient seeds do not grow until the soil is ready and rains come and the sun promises them life and when will that time come turning back again barad realized it was the middleaged woman who had asked the question he smiled a wide toothy grin with which he always answered that question indeed he had answered it hundreds of times at meetings like this he had answered it in the hovels in candovia and mountain villages in senival in aushenia and among the blackskinned people of talay he had even traded messages with the dejected remnants of hanish meins people everywhere he found ears hungry to hear him and minds eager to be awakened hearts ready to be stirred to action at these moments he could believe that aliver had spoken to him for a reason he could still help see the princes dreams come true at these moments he forgot the pains of his body and again felt as strong as ever he answered as he always did with what he hoped to be the truth soon he said there will come a day when i will shout for all of the known world to rise up we are all the kindred i will shout but the sound you hear will be that of your own voice and it will sweep away the old world and we will make it anew the queen has no idea whats coming but we do soon my friends soon c hapter f ive rialus neptos knew he should consider it an honor to be included in the envoy but he was not very skilled at feeling honored actually he could think of few things more unpleasant than the prospect of weeks aboard a league vessel heading off to the far side of the world rialus was a curious man certainly but his curiosity had strict boundaries and he had plenty to occupy him within the confines of the known world for that matter he had a good deal to occupy him within the confines of his own bedchamber he suspected corinn had yet to forgive him for his impromptu wedding to gurta why she should care he could not fathom but she seemed annoyed by it surely he was not the only man to ever wed a servant by his accounting it was rather a respectablehonorable actuallything to do especially as he had planted a child within her an heir to the neptos fortune that was something he could not pass up he had long ago resigned himself to the fact that the neptos line would end with him indeed in the frozen exile that had been his life in the mein it seemed a good idea to end the neptos misery but that was then now he was queen corinn akarans councillor famed for having dispatched hanish mein no other act in his life had changed his fortunes more than the few moments it took to make his hand thrust the knife blade into hanishs pale flesh nobody would ever know how long he hesitated or that he needed to grasp the knife in both hands to control his trembling but he had done it he really had hanish was just flesh and blood like other men because of it rialus lived at the center of the world now he had a position of prominence nowthanks to gurta being made a lady overnighthe would have heirs to pass on his good fortune to the giver did reward his worthies sometimes it just took a while for him to get around to it that was what rialus kept reminding himself as he nodded to the guards who stood at the gates of the league compound they were ishtat inspectorate a force that held no real allegiance to the queen they gave rialus the shivers cloaked as they were that and the halberds they held at the ready he had heard they could use the weapons for slashing motions that could disembowel or behead a person from eight feet away or they could break the weapon into two partssword and staff bothand thereby crack your skull with one before slicing you open with the other he could not help feeling they itched to do both which is why their statuelike stillness caused him to quicken his steps once in the outer chambers of sire dagons offices rialus was told to wait he sat on an iron chair that had a delicate beauty but was amazingly uncomfortable that was how it always seemed when he was with the league their offices were sumptuous pleasing to the eye and promising of comfort but he had never sat on a league couch without finding a ridge that poked him in the back or fabric that irritated his skin on the walls hung paintings of their massive ships astride even more massive waves the angles they tilted at the dark shapes beneath the water the way the white fingers of the wave crests reached out for the tiny human figures on deck made rialus queasy he hoped that the images were exaggerations meant to impress or tumultuous aberrations that he was unlikely to witness firsthand he moved his eyes away it would be a brief voyage what was it four weeks across a few weeks there and then four weeks back no more than two and a bit months of his life he could spare that considering that gurta plump with his heir would be waiting for him he did of course have corinns charges to worry about she had laid them out for him just the day before i have three charges for you rialus she had said first keep an eye on my brother i want him safe and nobody has a better nose than you for sniffing out danger whether they come from the league the lothan aklun the auldek or the ocean depths you must spot dangers before they touch him second i want you in the room when the league meets with the lothan aklun and the auldek you speak the numrek tongue better than anyone else i know it just may be you will understand the auldek language as well judge them for yourself and keep your judgment to yourself understand try to find ways to speak with them alone we may one day deal with them without the league between us so we might as well know something about them third of course is that you return to me with a detailed report of everything you witness my brother will do the same but i want to hear separately from you never in our history of trading with the lothan aklun have we had a better opportunity to learn about them use it rialus use it so fully that when you return i dont regret not having gone myself she made each assignment sound both simple and laced with threat she was good at that he would have to keep his wits about him make journal notes regularly and find a way to quell the nausea that roiled in him each time he thought of those ocean waves and the auldek please let them be more refined than the numrek two months though only two months and he would be home again he could handle that when he was finally ushered into sire dagons chambers he found he was late in joining the meeting along with dagon neen and several league navigators sat the bulky and all too familiar forms of calrach and his two seconds the leaguemen sat at repose in their intricate presumably uncomfortable chairs the numrek dwarfed themall hardedged muscle and rough featuresand yet both parties seemed at ease ah rialus neptos sire dagon said speaking through an exhalation of mist you join us at last weve nearly concluded our meeting be prompter in future rialus began an explanation that he had been sitting in the outer offices for nearly an hour but nobody seemed interested calrach rose and greeted him with a crushing hug and then stood back smacking his massive hand down on the frail mans shoulder my friend he said in numrek good to see you you are not so much a rat anymore more of a weasel now he turned to his companions for agreement which they gave each of them in turn inflicted the same chestcrushing embrace on him rialus fumbled through it in terse numrek he still hated the language for the barbarity of it and for the contortions it demanded of his tongue and lips he did speak it well though having learned it during his tenure as hanish meins ambassador to the foreign invaders turned allies not a thing he liked being reminded of for many reasons it had been a humiliating period of his life worse in some ways than his exile in cathgergen actually his wrestling with the numrek language had helped cure him of his stammer he now spoke almost as smoothly as he would like once he was seated railthin servants gave him a sweet plum wine in a glass that would not sit straight when he set it down nobody else seemed to have the same trouble which was odd because their glasses looked just like his it suddenly seemed quite important that he did not spill any of the sugary liquid he sat back in his chair small glass held in his lap with what he hoped passed for composure he wondered what they had discussed before he arrived the best stuff he was sure sire dagon cleared his throat and spoke without a hint of emotion humor or irony so good calrach you see in rialus a loyal servant of the queen hes to shepherd the young prince about keep him safe from harm treachery and such just between us i sometimes suspect the queen thinks we harbor ill intentions toward her brother ive assured her the league can forgive and forget as well as anyone dariel is a prince now not a brigand thief and saboteur anyway rialus will no doubt strive to work in the akaran interests in every way but what of the numrek is it at the queens bidding that you will journey to ushen brae or have you your own purposes i believe queen corinn demanded that they go sire neen offered no doubt to keep an eye on us the numrek too are loyal to her majesty calrach stopped him by snapping forth his arm palm out he looked for a bare spot on the floor to spit and then did so we care nothing about the queen she is not our queen anyway she is a bitch who flaunts her tail but doesnt give it up instead she bares her teeth and snaps we have grown tired of her in the silence after this the two leaguemen exchanged troubled glances sire neen put a hand to his throat as if a cough needed to be soothed down by his fingers it was a reasonable reaction for any not well acquainted with the numrek except that rialus had spent enough time among these foreigners to know that belligerence was the norm in their speech they could not be judged by acacian standards of behavior even as regarded insulting the queen he knew this but so did the leaguemen there was just slightly too much timidity in their reaction noticing it rialus figuratively narrowed his eyes but you are still in her service sire dagon asked we are there is no reason not to be if she through you allows me to see ushen brae again i am happy to serve her i will say the words she asks of me the numrek leaned back yes i will do that she will not be disappointed but i dont do it because i love the smell between her legs a horrible expression rialus thought one that numrek men and women both used without embarrassment it threatened to bring with it a flood of memories but he pushed them back keep your wits rialus he took a sip of the wine and tried to remain as unobtrusive as possible mulat calrachs half brother added we do it because what is good for the akarans is good for the auldek and we as their cousins want only what is good for them sire dagon accepted a pickled plum from a servant and then dismissed himor her it was hard to tellwith a flick of his wrist he held the soft fruit in his fingers sniffing it cousins you say ive never entirely understood the relationship between the auldek and the numrek did they not displace you drive you into the no no no calrach said exasperation flaring he thumped his palm against mulats chest with a force that made rialus cringe though it did not really seem to bother the numrek do not test me again leagueman this thing we dont speak of it does not concern you stop finding ways to ask of it hmm rialus thought so the sires had asked about the connection between the numrek and auldek enough times that calrach had noticed true calrach was sharper than his gruff exterior suggested but if the league had pressed him on it they obviously did not know as much about the auldek as they wished that was interesting or troubling to consider my apologies sire dagon said bowing his head yours are such an interesting people you cannot blame me for being curious in any event you will be an honored member of our delegation invaluable im sure appeased calrach let his large frame fall back against his chair excuse me rialus said but what was that name you used ushebra ushen brae mulat corrected that is the name of our land oh ive not heard that before mulat had a handsome face for a numrek cut of features better proportioned for human eyes to appreciate still the slightest displeasure made his face a creviced mask that was hard not to cringe from that doesnt mean its not so you call our lands the other lands but why should we do so they are not other to us this place here is other now that we are to see our home again we will again call it by its proper name should i do what you wish calrach said it makes no difference sires there are two things more about our going on this ocean voyage one i will bring my son dont protest its no matter of yours but ill take him to see ushen brae two you must bind us sire neens head dipped to one side birdlike and straightened again that rialus thought was the first genuine show of surprise he had seen yet on a leagueman he went to set his glass down fumbling when it wobbled and then reconsidering he took another sip instead bind you instead of answering calrach shifted uneasy suddenly he thrust his chin at his half brother and it was mulat who answered we abhor the water in sight of land as here in the inner sea its not bad but the gray slopes these we dont care for the sires responded warmly enough they understood this well the auldek did not care for the sea either they had in fact never once seen one of them aboard a ship a fact that greatly benefited the lothan aklun this is why you came into the known world over the ice fields hardly an easy route it was a feat to make us immortal calrach said with a bravado that even for him felt a bit forced no other has ever accomplished it we are not so different from gods yes sire neen nodded but did not answer instead he looped back amazing that you fear the sea so much and yet fear fear calrach spat this time without aiming at all i know no fear but the water will not support us so you cannot swim surely you could learn even the smallest child can for a moment rialus was sure calrach was going to smash the leagueman across his toothin jaw indeed the numrek half rose from his seat he grasped neens chair at the armrests and pushed his face close the muscles in his neck quivering his jaw tight we have heavy bones sire neen straightfaced and nonplussed asked heavy bones thats a strange ailment i am iron inside calrach said drop me in the ocean and i will sink to the bottom like an anchor i would not like that i would have to walk along the bottom to return to land i could do it but the very thought of it makes me angry despite the fact that rialus did imagine numrek bones to be nearly as hard and heavy as iron he had to duck his head and clear his throat to keep his amusement from curling his lips angry indeed angry like a child lost in the woods he had not thought the numrek so adept at manipulating language so you say we must bind you sire dagon said with chains you mean calrach loosened his grip and returned to his seat yes if you wish to live i cannot promise wed not go into a rage out of sight of land you wouldnt want that for a moment as sire dagon spoke and calrach detailed the strength of the bonds that would be needed to contain his great power rialus watched the other leagueman sire neens bland visage did not quite hide the amused interest with which he listened his eyes were wide and attentive his cheeks flushed this might have been from staring into calrachs shouting face but he looked pleased his mouth hung open just slightly and the tip of his tongue slipped across the round little nubs that were his teeth a moment later one of the navigators began to brief him on preparations being made for the prince but rialus only half listened and then rialus understood something that had tugged at the edge of his understanding since he arrived at the meeting he knew of course that not even a single word spoken by a leagueman could be taken as truth he had sensed in every question and glance and pleasantry that the two men were so entangled in deceptions that their spoken words had only the semblance of truth to them but all of this was standard anybody with a working knowledge of the league knew these things what rialus saw however was there on the tip of sire neens pink tongue as it slid across his teeth rialus could not have explained exactly how he knew it but an uncanny ability to recognize deceit was his chief skill who can explain the gifts the giver bestows on him neen rialus realized was hiding something plotting something all his own rialus turned away from him before neen noticed him watching but he kept the image locked in his mind studying it c hapter s ix do you ever wonder what the world would be like if aliver had lived melio asked of course mena said you know we all do yeah melio agreed we all do he pulled her closer with the arm he already had wrapped around her shoulders the two of them lay together in the predawn touching along the length of their naked bodies they had just made love the sort of silent spontaneous coupling they were often driven to in the quiet hours before facing danger once again though they had said nothing since wishing each other a good rest the evening before melios question seemed the continuation of an ongoing conversation he continued what if he really had abolished the quota trade what if he had really freed all the races to govern themselves can you imagine that i know it would be a grand confusion in some ways but it might have been beautiful corinn has betrayed it all though your sister the fanged rose she rather scares me mena you know that you dont understand her you do mena shrugged i havent always and no i dont completely but i do know that she tries she tries harder than you know to do whats right it may not look like what aliver would have done but she is no less devoted to us to the empire forgive me mena but she seems mostly devoted to keeping an iron grip on power staying silent for a time mena weighed whether she should answer talking about her sisterno matter whether she was being critical or speaking praisealways felt like a betrayal of sorts certainly corinn herself would have thought of it that way but melio owned part of her heart as well he gave her so much and deserved to know how she felt i need you to understand something about her mena said she started slowly seeking out the right words testing them first to make sure she was speaking truly corinn is strong you know that but she is also very scared the fanged rose scared melio laughed that i dont believe ive seen her look warriors in the face as if she were about to bite off their noses mena stayed him with a hand i said she was strong as well but you have to know that strength well it springs from different sources it has different roots in different people in corinn its fear fear of what of being alone of being unloved of dying no dont laugh i knew some of this about her even as a girl when our mother died corinn felt like part of her died everyone had always said she was our mother reborn her twin she was the beautiful one melio began to make some jibe but she cut him off no listen to me when our mother died corinn felt that she lost part of herself and then well i dont know how i know this but i always felt that she believed father should live for her then that some of the love he held for aleera should be transferred to her just to her i dont know that i can blame her for that i was too young to even remember our mother the loss was different for her but then father died too she took it as a betrayal and then there was igguldan her first love i think he died too and then she didnt even manage to escape acacia like the rest of us her guardian larken betrayed her to hanish mein you see every time she trusted someone every time she put her heart in someones hands and let him decide her fate and then came hanish she fell in love with him only to find out he was planning on sacrificing her to his ancestors for all her beauty shes not lucky in love is she you see the pattern then i do he conceded and i know all these details but we all have tragedies in our lives its no excuse i know she said and corinn would never offer it as one shes the last person who would ever do that but think of the quota aliver would have abolished it corinn just reentrenched it it seems so sad that instead of one monarch we got another instead of one future we melio shhh youre making a complicated thing sound simple dont she wasnt sure that he would believe that it was easier for him to see the black and white of it but there was more to the world than black and white much more he did not share blood with both of them and she could only go so far in explaining her feelings about her siblings at one time it was complicated to her at least its easy to see fault i know fault is there but shes my sister melio i love her shes part of me beneath the skin anyway i would not want her position i pray she lives long and that aaden makes a strong ruler in his time though she did not look at him mena could see the crooked smirk melio likely greeted that thought with never you never i wouldnt want that sort of burden you risk your life you know thats different that suits me what corinn carries is another thing i would not accept the crown even ifmay it never happenit was thrust upon me and dariel what if rule ever went to him i dont know mena said she was quiet for a moment he did not fight corinn for the throne when he could have he has his own demons to wrestle with he does search for a destiny i know he wants to do something grand hes talked about it but i dont know where or how hell find it the world outside their tent started to gray its way back into being stirring others into life mena sat up knowing the time had come to take up her role again her fingers flexed wanting to hold her sword before that though there was something more mundane to take care of she crawled off the sleeping mat and toward the basin she used to wash melios seed from inside her infusing the water with a concoction of herbs prepared for her by a physician back on acacia maybe you shouldnt do that melio said he propped himself on his elbow why not just trust what happens mena measured the herb powder and swirled it into the water dont be silly how would i look fighting foulthings while carrying around a fat belly it would break all sorts of taboos then stop fighting foulthings he answered ignoring her joking tone youre not the only one who can do it give someone else charge not even corinn could fault you weve been wed for five years now mena lets make a child and live like like what like everybody else were not everybody else im maeben on earth remember wrath in raptor form what sort of mother would i make she did not say these things she only half believed them and she knew melio would refute her point by point he had many times before this he started to say something else but mena had had enough of talking for the time being she said come i want to reach halaly by tonight theres work to be done there was always work to be done or so it had felt for months now finally though it looked as if there might be an end in sight to this war against the foulthings as far as she knew there were only two left to face one in halaly one across a large swath of hill region of northwestern talay reports of the latter were scattered and unreliable the word coming out of halaly however was specific and dire it was toward that oncepowerful interior tribe that she had pushed her band once the tenten creature had been vanquished with melio and kelis at her side mena spent her first evening in halaly with oubadal the chieftain and his councilmen they sat on woven mats beneath the coneshaped shelter in which the aging leader held court mena pushed thoughts of homeor rest and calm and time for reflectionto the back of her mind and focused on the matter most immediately at hand the tribesmen were impassioned troubled and anxious the waters that had provided them with fish for all their history had been turned into a liquid desert all because of a foulthings voracious appetite tell me of it mena said sitting crosslegged before the chieftain and the few elder councillors still living she had marched in a few minutes ago but she came with a purpose and wished the halaly to know it around them others of all ages rimmed the semiopen shelter and beyond that standing in the lateday sun still otherswomen and children and the many of menas own hunting partycraned forward to hear oubadal let others tell the tale through a chorus of voices at first they said the thing had been but a rumor two years ago fishermen on the western edge of the lake had started telling tales of large aquatic creatures that would appear to eat the fish they already had on their lines sometimes shredding their kive nets to get at the small silvery fish there had been many of them they said but as they grew larger and easier to spottheir back fins cresting the water when they attackedtheir numbers began to drop once they found a carcass washed ashore a hideous thing longer than a man was tall like a fish but none that they had seen before it had been bitten nearly in half something no fish naturally in the lake could have done they concluded that the monsters had begun to battle one another that war went unseen by human eyes except that still other corpses bits and pieces of malformed piscine body parts washed ashore as testament to the contest beneath the surface eventually only one of the creatures remained but this one fed unchallenged by competitors it became a massive lump of a monster all bulbous protrusions on the outside with one massive circular mouth at its center it sucked the life out of their shallow lake fishermen could stay on shore and watch it pushing through the shallows ravenous too large to be denied the tiny fish that had schooled in the warm waters by the millions had dwindled in one area of the lake and then another it was a collapse of unimagined proportions gone were the tiny kive fish such an important source of protein fried or dried or ground into paste gone were the waterfowl that hunted them fading was the halaly vigorwhich had been so based on their reliable food sourcesand dwindling were the tribute and trade that had made them the beating heart of the continent if all that wasnt bad enough the air swarmed with the mosquitoes and biting flies that now gestated in the lake untroubled by the kive fish that had once thrived on their eggs one of these spread disease while the other left welts on the skin that easily grew infected the darkskinned men telling all this spoke with voices both angry and incredulous they seemed to doubt the tale they told even as they spoke it mighty halaly so weakened by a single fish thing so enfeebled that the bites of an insect laid men low and feverish they barely seemed able to believe their own words and yet here they were has the creature taken any human lives melio asked it has one of the councillors answered it does not hunt us for food but many men have died trying to kill it another added the halaly have not rolled over and accepted defeat no they had tried time and again to trap the creature to poison it to spear it or hook it or something thus far though they had only smashed boats and seen men broken and drowned for the last few months they had put their energies into building a fleet of sailing skimmers light vessels with large sails and compact hulls that could run even through the shallows with nearly a hundred of such craft now they had hemmed the beast in to the inlets of the eastern corner of the lake it had grown so large that it was trapped in the deeper areas and these they had limited by opening the dams to drain the lake more than usual it was an extreme measure but because of it the beastfat and bloated as it washad never been more vulnerable they were ready he said to end it good mena said trying to sound confident and yet respectful of the somber mood of the meeting i am glad we will be here to help you do so i regret it took us so long to aid you but there were many foulthings now thankfully there are only two more one of those well kill tomorrow yes the councilmen answered her with nods a few gruntsnot exactly enthusiasm to match her own unsure whether the response was fatalistic or whether it was a comment on her delay in arriving mena said my family has not forgotten that the halaly joined us in the fight against hanish mein truly you are honored friends in our eyes all of talay is so oubadal cleared his throat the first sound he had yet added to the meeting he looked quite different from when mena had first seen him years before when aliver had summoned the might of all talay to his banner then he had been in his regal years slow moving and powerful heavy and rich and sure of his ownership of his world he had been insolent to the point of insult in his initial response to aliver mena knew that back then younger men had bowed to his authority and behind him a chorus of the aged had praised his wisdom now the younger men did the talking the aged were nowhere to be seen except of course oubadal himself his flesh hung limp around him overripe and flaccid the skin on his face was still rich and dark but the eyes that looked out were fatigued small your words are kind princess oubadal said you remind me of the snow king may he rest forever he bowed his head at this and then righted he set his bloodshot gaze on the princess and studied her as if verifying for himself that he did see the resemblance he had just claimed when i first met your brother i was not as respectful as i should have been he was a cub in my eyes a prince without a people to lead and what is that but delusion i thought him weak and then when he died i thought him unfortunate unlucky i thought he had failed and i felt bad for him though the council shelter was open to the air on all sides it had grown very quiet within and without a few crickets held longdistance conversations but mostly it seemed the night had hushed to listen to the chieftain i know now that i was mistaken on all counts oubadal continued he left this life in a swirl of noble battle he left it a man in his prime lean and strong a lion whose jaws would yet have grown stronger he left this life with the fight still in his breast many say so that is how he will be remembered as a lion you hear me tongues will never tire of his name now princess mena i envy him heroes always die young i should have realized that much earlier mena understanding the old man better now rose from her crosslegged position and moved closer to him she placed a hand on his heroes always die yes but they need not be young i dont believe that oubadal you are a king among your people you will be remembered as such forever when i walk from here i will remind the world how you steered your people through tumultuous times i will tell them that your people had prepared everything to defeat this monster you have already killed it we are fortunate to be able to help complete what you have already all but accomplished in a few days we will hoist it from the water and end it after that the fish will come back prosperity will return to your people oubadal pulled his hand out from under hers and patted her with his fingertips he smiled sadly dear girl you dont understand yes the fish will come back halaly will come back my people may thrive again but ii wont see it all unlike your brother ive had many many days to come to understand this ive had too many days it is not easy he paused seeming choked by emotion but he forced the moment to pass quickly he coughed and then said please princess go with my men and see our new fleet it is all we have left to fight the beast with mena did as requested part of her wanted to stay with the old chieftain wanted to let the others move away so that she could sit with him in solitude for a time here was a man who knew her brother and had sparred with her father when he was a young man she wanted to comfort him like a grown daughter might an ailing father and perhaps she wanted to let him comfort her as well surely tales of the past would help her make sense of the present wasnt that the way it was supposed to be couldnt she talk him through his melancholy and find within his long span of life greater meaning that would be a balm to them both she believed so but that was not the tenor of the moment instead she bade him farewell for the time being and followed the younger men out to inspect the new fleet it was a sad tour the halaly tried hard to demonstrate their resolve but the toll of the months of suffering and food shortages was palpable in every pause in the conversation written in the haggard lines of womens faces and in the hunger contained within the ovals of childrens eyes the skimmer ships were interesting but they looked like vessels meant for youthful recreation not for battling a monster mena went to her tent aware that there was still much to be prepared physically and much to be repaired in the tribes morale c hapter s even on the eve of his departure for the other lands once all the preparations that could be made had been made dariel carved out a few afternoon hours to spend with his nephew aaden he buried any appearance of worry about the coming trip under a string of fanciful tales he was going to sail the gray slopes around the curve of the world and right into the great maelstrom through which the giver had escaped yes thats exactly what he would do he was going to track the wandering god down and talk his ear off until he changed his mind and came back and if he could find elenet along the way he would give the young man a piece of his mind stealing from a god like that mucking about with the givers tongue the cheek of it to do all this he would have to be slipperier than a snake smoother of tongue than a floating merchant more cunning than a sea isle brigand oh wait dariel said a sly grin growing with his realization i am a sea isle brigand thats lucky elenet doesnt have a chance together uncle and nephew ran through the hallways and up and down the stairs that fed out onto the main courtyard of the upper palace they sparred with light wooden swords alternately laughing and threatening at times like this dariels mind was as nimble and fanciful as a childs there was nothing linear about their play no thematic cohesion to it one minute they were shipmates aboard the ballan the next they were edifus and tinhadin unifying the known world and just as quickly they were two laryx fighting for leadership of their pack or an architect conferring with his worker on a great project they were for a few hours two boys dashing through a palace full of servants who jumped out of their way some tutted and scowled most of them smiled for the sight of them was a rare and welcome lightness in a court that corinn tended with a solemn air for his part aaden listened to his uncle with an expression that at times said he was humoring the old fellow and at others betrayed rapt interest he was just a boy dariel knew though his life had shown him no hardship he already had a tendency toward seriousness corinns work there was no doubt that she loved her son deeply but she had begun molding him some time ago she would likely do so with greater and greater pressure as he turned toward adolescence dariel did not envy the boy dariel tried to lead aaden down into the subterranean world he had explored as a boy but the palace walls and passageways defied his memory he was sure that there was a route from his old nursery into these hidden realms but he could not find it he peeked behind wardrobes and reached under wall hangings he kicked at corners and even got on his hands and knees as if close study of the walls intersection with the floor would provide some clue but he found nothing before long aaden grew bored not to mention skeptical another of his uncles jokes no doubt just not an amusing one when i get back well have a proper search dariel said the two of them sat munching cheese from a plate on the floor of aadens room i swear theres a passage to be found here your mother knows about it she had the numrek use it in the last war so what are you really going to do on this voyage aaden asked returning to a line of questioning dariel had fended off earlier does it have to do with the quota drawing back dariel asked what do you know of that aaden held his gaze a moment i know enough mother said that since i am older than the quota children now i am old enough to know about them if theyre brave enough to go into the unknown i should be capable of at least knowing about it corinn told you that yes but dont tell her i told you aaden said sometimes she acts as if im too young to know certain things and at other times youre not supposed to know things that i know does that make sense rising and stepping away from the boy dariel picked up his wooden sword and fenced the air with it the motion was just an excuse for a few moments to think of course corinn had told him some things she knew as well as he that royal children should not be raised in ignorance of the unpleasant workings of the nation as he and his siblings had largely been but he also knew that corinn considered this aspect of her sons education to be her province he needed to be careful what he revealed yes my trip does have something to do with that he said i mean it has to do with the lothan aklun and our dealings with them i should not talk about it though ask your mother if you wish to know more are you so afraid of her you cant even stand still dariel stopped his nervous sparring dance corinn is my sister he said why should i be afraid of my sister dont be silly and dont try to trick me shes my sister but shes your mother if she wishes you to know affairs of state its up to her to tell you about them aaden pierced a grape with the cheese knife he lifted it and studied it as if he had not even heard his uncle its just not right i dont see any way that its right children should not wait aaden be sent off into slavery mother told me she knows its not right and yet she allows it children dariel younger than me they get taken from their parents i know you understand what that means you were sent alone into the world when just a boy right dariel lowered himself to his knees setting the wooden sword to one side yes i was and it was bad yes to be alone like that on your own with the whole world around you dariel remembered the aching fear he had felt when alone in that dilapidated hut at the edge of the abandoned village in the senivalian mountains a chill black night the world like a mouth about to clamp shut and devour him whole he only said yes that was not easy so will you stop it go and see what its about but if its bad promise me youll stop it even if mother gets mad at you for it i would do it myself but im not old enough yet promise me youll do whats right and when im king ill remember it aaden still holding the grape on the tip of the knife slanted his gaze up toward his uncle and waited for an answer the response he gave still rang in his ears the next morning as he made his way through a dock thronging with workers and guards and animals sailors and ishtat inspectorate officers he had heard of the rayfin the league clipper that would transport him on the first leg of his journey but he had seen it only from a distance on reaching it he stood a moment gazing at it unmoving among the commotion around him the ship was a marvel to look at built for speed with the skill the league had been refining for generations the body of it was sleek and dangerous looking covered all over with the shiny brilliantly white coating that all league vessels wore he knew it was made with sap from certain trees in aushenia but the exact formula they used was a carefully guarded secret for that matter just what its function was remained something of a mystery too it covered every beam of the hull the railing and the deck it was as if the craft had been dipped in a vat of the stuff and lifted out shiny slick once the ship was at sea the rows of widearmed masts would unfurl sail he had seen that from a distance and imagined they could set several jibs as well the ship was likely the fastest dariel had ever laid eyes on rialus was there to meet him on deck looking paler than usual the councillor had proposed that they journey by land across the tabith way reaching the port of tabith and sailing from there onto the gray slopes the proposal had made dariel grin though it was a reasonable enough suggestion it was clear from the manner in which rialus proposed it that he was not comfortable with the idea of being so completely in league hands dariel was not either but they were going to have to get used to that sire neen himself would be traveling by sea so it would look awkward if they did not as well plus dariel loved the sea he had loved it when he was hunting league vessels he was sure he would still love it now despite the strangeness of being a guest of his old enemies is that rialus neptos dariel asked grinning or is it his ghost come in his place rialus did not catch or acknowledge the princes humor the captain says we should leave within the hour to have advantage of the tide have you come ready to sail yes yes all my things were loaded yesterday he looked down at his new clothing at the marah sword at his side and at the supple leather boots he now wore as if to say he carried all his possessions on his person im as ready as ill manage and just like that he was thinking of his last moments with wren he knew it would not be the last time he would smell of her still and each morning he would awake thinking of her that was how it had been during his work in aushenia he would wonder if he had at last planted a child in her they had certainly been hoping for one for years now it seemed perhaps he would return to find her rubbing a small bump in her belly he hoped so but he had decided the trip was worth its perils the promise he had made aadenfor he had agreed to the boys requestconvinced him of that perhaps he would accomplish greater things than corinn had planned he would achieve more on this mission than had been asked of him and she would later come to thank him for it that was what happened with his rebuilding projects it could happen with this too you said your farewells to the queen yesterday dariel said a little sharply there had been a small banquet in his honor nice enough corinn wishing him success at strengthening the empires bond with the league as if that were his only mission more than one person had asked veiled questions about his feelings about the league considering his conflicts with them during his youth he had joked in answer his grin and humor seeing him through it inside he harbored the same unease himself for her part corinn seemed completely unconcerned perhaps she was concerned but how to read that possibility dariel was not sure she had embraced him in parting looking into his eyes and saying the kind things one expects a sister to say to her only brother it had felt wonderful at the time as if he were still a boy and her affection for him a balm in the bright light of morningand with aadens request still on his mindhe saw her face but no longer felt the warmth he wished he could i cant wait to get outward bound he said to himself as much as to rialus ocean air thats what i need finally rialus said calrach i was starting to doubt hed come but come he did and he did not seem too happy about it he strode at the front of a small band of numrek his feet smacked audibly on the stone dock his arms swung about him as if they wanted to batter somebody as if he was just hoping an offender would be fool enough to get in his way he snapped his head from side to side looking for an insult that the backingaway crowd did not offer his hair long and black as a courtesans swirled about him as he moved it was an odd display full of agitation that was something dariel had witnessed often enough on numrek faces but this was different whatever had insulted calrach was not to be found in any of the cowering folks around him whats he in a huff about dariel asked thats not anger thats the numrek version of fear the numrek entourage mounted the gangplank like invaders they were up in a few moments calrach shouldered through the ishtat guards who awaited him they milled about several with their hands at their sword hilts but the numrek were no martial threat they carried no weapons and whatever angered calrach had no human form he roared something to his companions they answered back just as belligerently a moment later they had all vanished into one of the hatches leading belowdecks rialus whispered details of the preparations calrach had demanded dariel listened as alarmed as he was amused chains the threat of some bloodrage madness once they were out of the sight of land he had never heard anything like it the numrek fear the sea why dariel asked it makes no sense rialus shrugged theyre strange brutes if it werent for the chance to see their beloved homeland again i doubt theyd ever board an oceanbound vessel they say they cant swim too heavy apparently that could be true although ive never seen one of them so much as try sunning on the beaches of talay suits them but they never actually went in the water anyone can drown rialus left adrift in the open ocean everyone does drown even you my friend but i dont see you shouting to be chained from all ive seen and heard the numrek are fearless they fight to the death for an afternoons amusement whats that game they play where they take turns throwing spears as one of them runs an obstacle course how can you do that on a whim and yet be afraid of the prince paused and studied rialus the small man had gasped something and stood clenching the railing looking queasy are you going to be sick rialus of course not dariel took a half step to the side not trusting the mans selfassessment the councillor sputtered a moment before finding his voice again whowho can explain anothers fears my sister can dariel said wryly or at least she knows how to exploit peoples fears he checked himself and said no more why had he even said that rialus was still corinns trained weasel likely making notes of any slight uttered about her even by her brother dariel excused himself he drifted away without a precise notion of where to go he knew there were many eyes on him ishtat inspectorate officers stood at silent attention at regular intervals around the deck sailors glanced at him as they prepared the ship for departure a small group of leaguemen stopped their conversation with a pilot and watched him with their expressionless faces some even looked downarchers who sat guard in baskets atop the masts dariel would be watched every minute he was aboard so he would try to get used to it to ignore it he could not help taking in the details of the ship and nobody had yet told him not to he ran his hand along the railing feeling the strange yet graspable texture of the white coating it slid beneath his fingers when he moved them but with the slightest pressure the stuff gripped his skin the surface was not entirely easy to walk on andnoting that many of the crewmen went barefoothe decided that helped them keep their footing better than shoes he imagined that water on the other hand must slip along the ships hull without the slightest friction this ship must be fast indeed and it must cut the water with such stealth that the waves might barely note its passing it took him a moment to notice the hush but when he did he looked up and around the ship had gone quiet the workers all paused the group of leaguemen rushed forward on silent feet and lined the railing rialus still stood a way off his eyes fixed on the docks following his gaze dariel picked out the only spot of motion among the suddenly stilled throng sire neen he was perched in a small chair an awkwardlooking metal contraption in which he sat with his arms draped on the armrests his chin raised and his eyes above the crowd two men bore his weight one before and one behind him they were slender but tightly muscled with haughty looks on their faces the crowd had parted to let them through most stood with their heads downturned strange dariel thought but they were league employees this whole section of the docks was a different world in it it seemed sires were met with well with a good deal more deference than a prince not for the first time dariel wondered if corinn had truly ensured his safety she must have of course he was no longer a brigand the league was no longer allied to an enemy whats past is past corinn had said in war crimes are done that must be forgiven during peace that was simply the way of war and peace as he watched sire neen stand and slowly ascend the gangplank dariel hoped the leagueman subscribed to the same doctrine c hapter e ight corinn had been having the dream for weeks now long enough that she had begun to fear it would torment her forever it was always the same it always trapped her in the same manner with roughly the same progression of events the same dreadful realizations it began pleasantly enough aliver had returned the palace buzzed with the news of it he had appeared alive and unscathed he was ready to help corinn rule the empire her waking mind would have balked at this for many reasons but her dream self embraced it nothing seemed more wonderful than to have aliver home and let him take burdens from her she knew that he would forgive her for some things and praise her for others together they would have the power to achieve a truly magnificent rule for everyone she thought all these things as she dashed through the halls and across the plazas and up the flights of stairs to reach him along the way she diverged into other stories conversations travails she changed her cream dress for her red or her green for one of purple velvet these varied from dream to dream but eventually she walked the final length of hallway wearing a simple wrap that left one of her breasts bare in the bethuni manner she stepped into the room and saw a figure sitting with his back to her she called his name without speaking and the man rose and it was not aliver the figure that stood and turned toward her was a lean man golden haired dressed in a black thalba and snugfitting trousers his eyes were an incredible gray glinting like molten silver no eyes of a human being and yet they were his hanish meins she realized that his lips had been sewn shut on her orders and she knew that before the needle and thread pulled them tight she had ordered that a ball of twisted fishhooks be placed in his mouth a rusty mess of a thing she had wanted him to struggle not to swallow it knowing that he would eventually have to and that it would rip a bloody path through his insides when he did she had wanted him to suffer the idea seemed horrific now how could she ever have wanted that at that moment she wanted nothing more than to throw herself into his arms and forgive him everything though hanishs face was tranquil as he gazed at her she ran toward him thinking to cut the thread pry his mouth open and lift out the barbed metal her feet would not move her forward she ran but the space between them did not lessen and then she realized the final dreadful thing the person was not hanish either it was aaden and he was clutching his throat as the barbs pierced through and blood gushed the sight of it the horror of it was too much to bear she awoke thrashing alone and tangled in the sheets of her massive bed for a few seconds she struggled to escape the horror that clung to her afraid that this time it would not let her go it always did though and then she curled on her side pulled her legs tight to her chest and cried it was a nightly torture she faced alone she took no one to bed with herhad not done so since the night she awoke beside hanish mein and heard him speaking with his longdead ancestors promising them her life for their sakes it was a wonder that she managed to sleep at all she made sure all signs of the dream and those raw memories were gone by the time she called her maidens and began her day indeed she hardened herself against whatever hidden import the dream suggested and showed the world a face of utter certainty thats what a queen was supposed to do what a mother was supposed to do she told herself that she was stronger for it perhaps she was the longbow is a royal weapon corinn said she nocked an arrow and pinned the shaft to the bow with the crook of her finger aaden stood besider her the two of them behind a marker set out to measure the distance to a target the servants had set up in the grassy area of one of the upper terraces it was midmorning on a clear day the breeze intermittent and gentle the dream tucked away for the time being i know you like your sword craft and thats fine a king though rarely fights among the throng he must know how to take a wider view to see the entire horizon and all the players understand in the thick of a battlefield you cant see beyond the ranks of soldiers surrounding you like that you are vulnerable as was my brother she pointed the weapon high into the air straightened her bow arm and brought it down to sight drawing the bowstring back to her cheek as she did so you aaden will never be vulnerable in that way she opened her fingers the bow thrummed and the arrow vanished it was in her hand one moment then it was gone only to announce itself the next instant it stuck fast in the yellow central circle of the wooden target two fingers breadths away from the ruby heart that marked the exact center you never miss aaden cried he danced about id like to see you miss just once can you just miss once for me see if you can do it corinn spoke through a smile dont be foolish why would i ever miss what i can hit to make me feel better that would be a reason if it worked but it wouldnt make you feel better would it what would would be if you hit still closer to the jewel try now aaden did as instructed though he took his time about it he selected an arrow with deliberation holding it up before him to gauge its straightness and balance he ran his fingertips over the fletching touched the arrows shaft to his yew bow and fit the bowstring to the nock corinn heard one of the watching servants whisper something to another likely they were commenting on the princes fastidiousness she had trained it into him from the start enough so that he did not seem to conceive of archery without each step of slow preparation when he finally bent the bow he strained to hold it still against the draw weight limit the world corinn said see the heart feel the connection between you and it find that you are not aiming at a distant target you are laying the arrow on the path already created for it his arrow flew but corinn knew from the first instant that it was off course it hit the lower corner of the target at an angle it twisted and hung limply the boy twirled away in childish smiling exasperation what happened i was looking right at it you found the wrong path aaden she let that sit for a moment and then added you werent still when you released your arm was swaying here let me show you again she fell into instruction happy with the way aaden listened the way he tried to understand her notion of paths he was earnest in this even though he did not seem particularly talented as an archer watching his form and posture she tried to remember how skilled she had been at his age but could not as far as she could recall she had always known how to see the path to her targets it had always been there and as long as she waited until she found it she did not miss when she found it and released she was as sure of her aim as if the arrow were zipping through a pipe suspended in the air but when had that begun she had reached for memories from her childhood but she never really went further back than the afternoon she first shot targets with hanish mein at calfa ven she must have learned her skills before that though she was a young lady by then not a child she already had many pains behind her and aaden interrupted her thoughts next time can devlyn and others shoot with us devlyn he is a good shot best in his grouping devlyn she had heard the name on aadens lips several times now devlyn he was from a new agnate family she believed mainlanders she would have to look into his ancestry he might barely be of the upper class at all considering how many new links the recorders had found to allow previously common families into the aristocracy such was the unfortunate necessity since the two wars and hanishs purges had all but destroyed the old families it was not the boys credentials that interested her though rather it was the tone of admiration in aadens voice whenever he mentioned him she would need to determine whether or not this was a good thing we could have an archery day with them he continued like a small tourney but just my friends and me somebody else might win but i dont care its just for fun can we well see corinn said you know aaden that you are not the same as your friends you will one day have this empire to rule i know that is why i should have friends companions devlyn could be my chancellor he already said he would be if i asked him as the boy was busy setting another arrow corinn let her face betray a moment of displeasure it was gone before he looked up again ill have to meet this devlyn it would be a fine thing for you to have companions but the truth is that when im gone youll have nobody but yourself to rely on nobody elsecertainly not devlynwill have to carry the burden of rule as you do understand that theres mena and dariel he said before bending his bow yes of course but you may not always have them to rely on she thought they may fail us they may oppose us one day it felt cold to think this and at first she thought she would say nothing about it but seeing the concentration wrinkling his brow as he shot and watching his gray eyes study the results she felt inclined to push him a little further his arrow had struck at the edge of the center circle that was a fine shot lets leave it there for now come sit with me aaden reluctantly obliged the two sat side by side on a stone bench at the edge of the terrace the balustrade was low allowing a view out over the sea to the islands west the nearer waters were dotted with rocky islands that seemed to sink farther and farther as the sea deepened from turquoise to a darker hue aaden set his hands in his lap his knees bouncing with the balls of his feet he waited and corinn remembering the chattering cacophony that so many children make was proud again of the son she was raising a servant brought them two glasses of the berry drink aaden liked and then retreated out of earshot i know you are still a boy corinn began but i have to prepare you for what your future holds better you know it now than learn it later nobody not even my siblings are as important to this nation as you are you may love them dearly as do i but they both have flaws in their characters that you must never let weaken you mena is gifted and fierce but shes afraid of her nature her true self is as savage and focused as an eagle to her enemies she falls like a bolt from the sky yes youve heard the tales they tell of her her foes cant touch her she pins them to the ground and rips out their hearts as she should she took a sip of the juice its tartness puckered her lips if that was all there was to menas nature she would be an even better weapon than she already is she should be all and only an eagle but there is a dove within her as well while her beak is carving through her victims flesh she starts to cry because of what shes doing thats a mistake i would never allow you to be so conflicted so dont be aaden drew back from his drink and nodded his single sharp nod i understand only i dont think id like it if mena was like an eagle they have cold eyes better the cold eyes of an eagle than the timid ones of a dove ive no use for doves she said this more sharply than she intended she paused for a moment wondering why as for dariel i dont know whats happened to him he used to be fearless they say a raider i didnt know him then but its clear he has a natural gift for leading people i just wish he would use it more he has no stomach anymore for the hard things he still smiles and entertains and knows how to show joy but he carries a weight around in his center he seems to feel he must make amends with the world and all the people in it his building projects i dont deny theyre useful but he goes about them for mistaken reasons is that why you sent him away i didnt send him away i sent him on a mission when its complete hell return better for it you see aaden i am trying to help them both become stronger stronger in ways that truly matter in ways that sharpen them ways that harden them again she did not like the edge in her voice she backed away from it touched aaden on his still bouncing knees he was getting restless she would have to let him go soon go and be a boy for a while free of lessons like these she wished not for the first time that she did not have to say such things to him let him just be the boy he wants to be but if she allowed that she would be committing all the mistakes her father had made dariel had been but a little older than aaden when he was cast out into the world alone everything taken from him such things had happened before they could happen again if they did in his life aaden would never be able to fault her for not preparing him aliver was no better she said you should know that from me because the tales they tell of him make no mention of it he may have dreamed fine notions but what are dreams theyre nothing without the backbone to achieve them your uncle did wonderful things of course but he died with his work unfinished he would have left the world in chaos had i not been here to set things right his flaw aaden was that he let emotion drive him he let notions take the place of deliberate thought akarans have done that for too long tinhadin killed his older brother to secure his throne but he killed his youngest out of fear even my father only half governed as he should have choked as he was by an idealism that made him idle but not any longer i am not of that mold nor will you be i will teach you better than that so what i say is this she paused until he looked up at her with his full grayeyed attention love our family without being weakened by them honor them as infallible in public while noting their flaws to yourself demand the most from friends without expecting it imagine the worst from your enemies so that they cannot surprise you and rely only on yourself smiling and softening her voice she added yourself and your mother i should say she mussed his hair all right aaden enough of this talk i can see youre restless may i go to the marah hall and train yes do that show me what youve learned later aaden handed his glass to a servant who took it lightly bowing and thanking his highness the prince mumbled his own thanks to the servant and then stepped close to corinn and whispered mother do you ever use your singing to make the arrow hit corinn slipped her hand around the back of his head and pulled him close with her lips brushing his ear she said never an hour later the queen was back in her offices sitting straight backed and expressionless as rhrenna introduced paddel the head vintner of prios he was a jowly man squeezed unflatteringly into a silken suit that bulged in all the wrong places he was technically bald but his scalp had been tattooed a dark blueblack the ink followed his natural hairline but the effect was unnervingly peculiar paddel seemed quite pleased with it he regularly touched his scalp with his fingers as if stroking and repositioning his hair corinn decided to keep this meeting short she actually knew most of what the vintner could tell her having received detailed reports from the league for some years now they had done their work hopefully paddel had done his as well how have the trials gone she asked oh wonderfully wonderfully the vintner could barely contain himself he seemed oblivious of the fact that he flung spittle with each excited sentence you could not have asked for greater success all that you wished for your majesty has been made reality all of it corinn sat some distance away behind her desk but she held her hand out before her chest a posture half protective and half a threat that she might smack him he didnt notice this either i hope so sire dagon assured me the product would be worth any wait in order for that to be true your prios vintage will have to be a very fine thing my queen my wine is the balm our thirsty nation needs you will be delighted corinn doubted delight would play any part in her emotions she did however hide a keen interest behind her intentionally bland facade she had waited years for this vintage balm for the thirsty nation that would be a useful thing indeed it had not taken her long after seizing power to realize that her brotherhowever he had managed ithad left her gravely handicapped the people were off mist and their memories of the nightmares the drug had begun to induce must have been vivid for none of them returned to the pipe that was fine in the early days after hanishs demise there was work to be done and more than enough for the people to focus on before long however their cleareyed awareness began to be a problem they set their sights on her and started to grow disgruntled first one nation and then another grumbled for independence complained about being overtaxed claimed that agents in the night still stole their children argued alivers old pledges as if they were words from some holy book corinn was sure that she had to maneuver cajole bribe flatter and punish at a frenetic rate precisely because the people were no longer drugged no akaran monarch since tinhadin had worked as hard as she had if she had clamped down on dissent forcefully it was the peoples own fault the numrek were hers to deploy and use them she did initially she had asked the league to find some way to spread the drug again after all it would upset their trade with the lothan aklun those foreigners still wanted quota that was why the league had taken over the outer isles to make them into a plantation for raising quota but the known world it seemed no longer wanted mist in return for it the league had urged caution patience they said that to simply put the people back on mist would be a mistake even if it were possible it was too easily recognizable too much a sign of their old condition some might take to a slightly altered variation yes but others would chafe and foment against it all still remembered aliver and considered him their deliverer from mist it would not do for corinn to simply reverse that they convinced her to wait for a new product to control the people and in the meantime she accepted payment for the quota in coin and jewel and a variety of other things needed to rebuild the empire that she couldnt argue with it was seven years before they finally came to her saying the new drug had been perfected it was they said made from the same base elements as mist but they had managed to formulate it in such a way that it could be consumed day or night without altering ones ability to work sleep or procreate it had proven difficult to contain it in liquid form and in a substance that did not degrade over time this was important to them though as they were convinced the drug should not be smoked it should seem nothing like mist this time they urged it should be consumed as a beverage a beverage like wine prios had long had a history of wine making with corinns permission and under league supervision the operations had been expanded to cover as much of the island as possible the result finally was this prios vintage a wine with a measure of the formula mixed in before bottling watching the test subjects paddel said one almost wants to throw reason away and join them he leaned forward beads of sweat clinging to his tattooed hairline the vintage it isnt grandiose it isnt unpredictable like mist it doesnt take one over completely instead from the first drink of it one feels the hum of mild bliss a constant happy sense of expectation on the wine they are convinced that something wonderful is about to happen always about to happen the feeling when properly dosed never wears off they never wonder why this wonderful thing hasnt happened they only know that it is going to its coming always coming and yet they still work vigorous nodding they do of course they do why wouldnt they they feel wonderful so whats a few more hours cracking rocks or whatever labor theyre at corinn glanced at rhrenna the only other person in the room her small features did not do justice to the sharp mind behind them but corinn liked that about her with her freckled meinish skin and pale blue eyes she could sit within most rooms without drawing any more attention than an average household servant she was much more though she asked and when they are deprived of it thats another bit of brilliance paddel said addressing the queen as if she had asked the question if we withhold it the test subjects feel only a vague unease like the start of hunger pains or like a chill and what does one do when hungry the vintner paused grinning eats what does one do against a chill puts on a cloak nobody thinks why am i slave to this hunger or damn this chill ill fight it no they do what comes naturally your majesty the same is true of the wine in our trials the patients dont even understand that they crave the vintage theyll do anything to get it but they dont even know they want it and i do mean anything corinn watched him rub his fingertips across his thumbs at some memory of this anything what of our military if our own soldiers drink this stuff will it make them unwilling to fight peaceful not at all theyll rush to battle confident of victory understand that the vintageoh how should i say paddel squinted his entire face as he searched for the words to explain himself they see the world with gilded highlights yes but they still see the world they still walk through the motions of life as before and honor their responsibilities they honor them even better in fact you my queen will rule an empire of happy citizens theyll do whatever you wish and theyll never see their lives for what they arecomplete and total drudgery and how do we control it rhrenna asked much of the empire drinks wine even children drink it diluted how do we control who is on it and who is not paddel responded directly to the queen grinning through his words that is for her majesty to determine but in my opinion well in my opinion each and every person in the land could drink the stuff they would all be happier for it so whats the harm rhrenna catching the queens eye expressed her loathing with quick pursing of her thin lips corinn silently agreed she had never heard of anything worse but she did not say so or let any emotion other than vague displeasure show on her face fine continue production as you will then store it carefully securely of course we do we do the ishtat inspectorate guards the warehouse when your majesty might we begin distribution sire dagon said the league are ready and will aid at your pleasure at my pleasure is correct corinn replied you may go now go he did ushered out by rhrenna although he clearly had to swallow a host of questions and declarations to do so once the two left the room corinn inhaled deeply trying to loosen the tension that had built in her as she spoke with the vintner she smelled hima sweet salty scent as if his sweat were some sort of sugared seawater she would ask rhrenna to have incense lit when she returned a soothing scentthat was what she needed something to let her think clearly on this she loathed the pleasure paddel seemed to take in the venture coming from him the entire project seemed tainted by his vile fingertips but that should not matter she knew it was the result that she cared about and the results by all accounts were as advantageous as she could have hoped she understood now why the league had been willing to wait to see the formula and the means of distribution perfected she had only to give the word the wine would flow through the veins of trade to markets and taverns to sit on tables in every corner of the empire it would wet the lips of laborers and thieves farmers and merchants scholars and officials it would be hard to keep it from the gilded goblets of the aristocracy but they were as troublesome in their simpering ways as ranting prophets like barad were among the masses let them all be deluded let the world rest for a while without strife even aliver could not have objected to that the thought of her siblings nagged at her she would have to decide what to do about them neither seemed to fully understand the dangers of a sober populace sometimes she feared that they did not understand their responsibilities the people could not be trusted they would forever find fault make mistakes and give in to petty jealousies and shortsighted thinking they would destroy themselves if they were allowed to that was what tinhadin had realized that was why he had grasped all power in his hands and ruled with an iron will she would do so as well and yet she would improve on his model she would rule with her brain not her emotions she would use all the tools she could she would make the world safe nobody would lie to her anymore nobody would betray her steal from her or abandon her nobody would die without her permission the world would be as she wished it to be and then she would know peace as well yes she thought then i will know peace if mena and dariel could not understand this she would have to act for them she loved them dearly of course that was why she knew they might have to drink the vintage as well she was not sure yet but that might be for the best rhrenna returned lit the incense as corinn asked and talked through the remaining matters of business there was always more this time it was the merchants of bocoum who harried her their drought had grown dire northern talayand all the food production and trade it drovewas at the brink of collapse your majesty rhrenna said they have really become quite insistent they beseech you to come and see their plight they say you will truly understand it only when you see it with your own eyes fine ive had enough of these offices anyway tell them i will come to them within the fortnight tell aaden as well hell be happy for a trip even a short one c hapter n ine kelis received the messenger outside his tent the youth was barefoot and lean his musculature barely adolescent though he was likely older than he looked the light of the setting sun caught twinkles in the dust that coated him the result of the miles of travel that had brought him to halaly kelis hearing his message and the coded language he used to demonstrate its authenticity stood a moment unsure how to answer he knew a summons when he heard it there was no other word for it sangae umae his chieftain demanded his presence though he was loyal to the akarans and to menas unfinished work he could not ignore the order delay perhaps but not ignore speaking talayan kelis said tell sangae that when i am done here i will come to him in umae tell him i have arrived here with princess mena only a week ago we are to attack the foulthing in the lake but we still have much to prepare once we have killed it i will meet him in umae he began to turn away but the messenger made a clicking sound with his tongue apparently he was not finished the boys left arm was stunted half the size of the other perhaps this was part of why he was a messenger instead of warrior runner he did not seem ashamed of it though and used the small limb to illustrate his words not umae he said sangae awaits you in bocoum he is there now and prays your feet do not grow hot on the sand before you reach him bocoum the bustling city of bocoum was talayan controlled yes but sangae rarely visited there he was a village chieftain not a merchant prince respected as he was for having been alivers surrogate father sangae had as little use for the rich men of bocoum as they had for him he is at the coast even now the youth said one corner of his mouth slightly crooked as if kelis were a disappointment for not knowing this already he stays in the care of sinper of the family ou sangae wishes me to take you there i promised to return with you as quickly as you can run the boy had an attitude of playful condescension he thought too much of his authority as a messengerwhich was no authority at all really kelis decided to ignore this show of selfimportance for now he held to a long silence as he thought sinper ou was his host that made little sense the ous were the most ambitious of the citys merchant families they were wealthy by any standard and in the strange way of it they earned their fortune without ever breaking a sweat they owned the bulk of the rafts the floating merchants leased and took a considerable percentage of their profits they also owned great swaths of the coastal farmlands properties they had acquired piece by piece over the generations and now charged for the use of they controlled more docks than any other family and imposed tariffs on all the goods that crossed themboth those grown on their land and those transported on their rafts the ous were not the type of company sangae usually kept none of this sounded right do you know why he summons me keliss eyes inadvertently lingered on the youths stunted arm why he sent you no i dont know why he wants you the youth answered but he sent me because i am fast this arm does not slow my legs it cuts the wind for me i am sure it does you will have to work to keep up with me the boy said kelis smiled but said nothing the boy had heart at least he told the messenger where to find food and drink and shelter for the evening and he promised that he would run with him as soon as he had helped the princess if she consented to let him go that was alone later on the hard pallet on which he slept kelis could not stop himself from longing for all the possibilities ended by the point of maeanders blade even without outward reminders being near mena meant that memories of aliver were always close they lay like objects beneath a thin skin of water sometimes standing out clearly other times stirred by the current shaded by clouds or reflecting the world above like a moving mirror alivers death had never yet felt real to him he often daydreamed of the boy he had grown strong with the man he had loved in his quiet way he contained within himself images and expressions and bits of recalled conversations that seemed more real than the years separating him from those joyful moments and in his dreams aliver lived he stood before him ironic aware that he had escaped death and somehow embarrassed to have done so beautiful in a way that no other person had ever been in keliss eyes he always awoke from these dreams confounded as a boy he had been a dreamer one of the few who could predict the weather and turns of fortune and make sense of signs brought to him while he slept his father had despised this gift for it meant his firstborn son would not be a warrior and would therefore not secure the familys council seat keliss father had managed to beat it out of the young man jabbing him awake from sleep making dreaming akin to pain belittling him as if the gift were a slight to his manhood kelis had finally broken when his father adopted another youth to be his firstborn to his fathers delight kelis killed the boy reclaimed his position and replaced his vision dreams with images of the way he had thrust his spear into his brothers belly and twisted the organs around the point that is what he had relived for years while sleeping a nightly punishment after alivers death his dreams stopped for a time he could not remember the moment of the princes death either when awake or asleep it was a blank spot into which he could not see an emptiness he was reminded of every night regardless of how filled with life and labor his days were and when he did begin to dream againa few months agoit was of aliver returned to life what could that mean was there a sign in it that he needed to learn how to read might he now become the dreamer that his fathernow also deadhad tried to extinguish surely the prince should not be dead he couldnt be dead there had been some mistake made some meinish treachery that everyone else had been foolish enough to accept the night after getting his summons and watching mena try to comfort the aging chieftain kelis did not sleep instead he lay on his mat with his eyes pinned open imagining journeying south instead of heading north to bocoum what if he crossed the great river and sought out the santoth in the far south perhaps aliver was among them maybe thats why he still seemed to live or perhaps they could bring him back into life maybe they just neededwantedto be asked aliver had been brave enough to seek the sorcerers out perhaps another needed to do the same he was thankful when the new day dawned with the morning breeze and the slant of the sun the world sprang to life mena was a whirlwind of energy in among the halaly men like one of them her voice as loud as theirs and even more in command she was a sensitive being kelis knew troubled by things she rarely spoke of but to the world she was at her best when danger neared all certainty and poise and maybe even a hunger to be facetoface with peril the halaly had effectively formed a blockade to hem the beast in skimmers and other boats were spaced at even intervals anchored in place and connected with ropes that made an unbroken line the early hours were spent shuttling crossbowmen warriors fishermen and others out to the various vessels a steady wind whitecapped the water and buffeted the boats straining them against their anchors they had chosen this day for the wind knowing the rhythm by which the air currents shifted and when they blew strongest once all were as near to being in place as they could be over such bobbing moving expanse the signal to lift anchor and unfurl their sails issued from the mouths of halaly horns the skimmer that kelis rode in jumped to grab the wind the sail snapped as it filled and he had to hold on as the light vessel surged into motion the crafttwo narrow pontoons with a skin platform between and a simple rudderhad a shallow draft and was built for speed the water they zipped over was no more than waist deep he could have rolled into the water and stood half wet risking only to be cut in two by another skimmer indeed they sailed through reeds and marsh grasses sliced over lily pads and spreading green muck it was an impressive sight but it seemed suddenly wrong why hadnt he considered this before there are too many of us how could a hundred ships coordinate an attack on one creature while moving at such speed they would get tangled and crash into one another as they neared it he wanted to shout out that the plan of attack was flawed he wished he were with mena surely she was thinking the same and must be trying to convince the halaly of this but he was just one of a few in this skimmer he did not really even have a role here except to be with the halaly to do as they did and to aid the crossbowmen who would be their main weapon the lookout perched at the prow of one of the pontoons shouted he leaned over the water his arm outstretched and finger pointing kelis tried to follow his direction but he saw only water and a protrusion in the distance that he took to be a small island but it was just a round mound of earth atop which reeds and perhaps a few short shrubs grew why then did it move why did it change shape before his eyes as if the entire island had rolled over and come up with a new topography nobody else seemed as confused as he was they continued to hurtle toward it at all the winds speed shouting to one another their spraysplashed eyes fixed on their target he looked again down the line of moving vessels having no idea anymore where the princess was hating the knowledge that she could die here just like any of them just as her brother had the formation was ragged now with some skimmers ahead of others keliss vessel was soon behind a few others blocking his view of the island that was not an island he wishedalthough he knew it was not a true wish but one sprung from the momentthat mena was content to rule from a safe distance like corinn in one of her palaces a strange thought to have here and not one that he held for long when he next saw the creature it was near enough that he could doubt it no more it dwarfed any living creature he had ever seen it was comparable to nothing that walked or swam or squirmed its girth was like an outcropping of rock like a hillside or like the island he had first thought it to be but it was a flippered scaled mountain of an undulating semiaquatic monster like no fish but with parts of fish in it like no worm and yet wormlike in the grotesque rolling convulsions that propelled it forward it bristled with scales that peeled as if it were diseased no real protection as they opened and closed with its movements the body beneath them as translucent and spotted and slick as the flesh of a squid it did not swim at all for the water was far too shallow it wriggled away from them with the blubbery determination of a seal made huge its speed though was nothing compared to that of the skimmers the foremost of the vessels reached it they raced along either side of it tiny on the nearside and hidden altogether on the other the first crossbowmen launched their barbed missiles made with a hinged construction designed especially for this task strong ropes trailed out behind the missiles it only took a few moments after firing for the lengths of rope to unfurl behind the swift vessels and yank taut to the cleats secured to the skimmers prows the line tugged on the missile but instead of pulling free the prongs carved quick trenches through the foulthings flesh they sank deeper and stuck fast in a matter of seconds the jolt when their boats were jerked to a halt sent several soldiers into the water others pitched from the prows when the ropes snapped in two boats the cleats were ripped out sending splinters of wood flying kelis saw this all in fragments captured by his darting eyes by the time keliss skimmer neared range a slightly greater order had been established more crews were remembering to drop their sails as they set the barbs several boatssails again curved with the windnow strained as the earths breath pressed them forward as more flew past the heaving creature the crossbowmen pierced it and pierced it again rope after rope snapped taut barb after barb set deep before long the beast was being pulled into the shallows behind fifty skimmers with more joining every minute it was even more maddened than before its great cavern of a mouth rose out of the muck it gasped and bared row after row of teeth it looked as if it wished to roar but was instead more ghastly for its lack of a voice kelis aided his vessels crossbowman by steadying him as he aimed and by pulling him back into the boat as his missile hissed out he heard the captain shouting orders to the other crewmembers and he did what he could to aid them the next few minutes passed in a blur of confused motion and noise and wind he was jostled about the boat had to duck the boom and nearly toppled into the water all around them other skimmers cut in and out colliding in a tangle of ropes and flying bolts wind slapping cries about quite a few lost their lives or broke bones or were otherwise injured and through most of it kelis could not tell if their efforts were achieving what they hoped he knew the water was getting shallower and shallower he saw that they were cutting through muck now but it wasnt until the beast itself showed its true fear that kelis believed they had it for some time the foulthing had propelled itself into the shallows fleeing the skimmers when it could no longer sink its mouth down to suck from the water it tried to turn it heaved and undulated and thrashed about sending out muddy waves that swamped the nearest boats it rolled far enough over once that several ships were pulled into the air had it kept rolling it could have killed them all and still they pulled it on toward the shore slower now but steady the wind filling their sails as if it hated the creature as much as they when they could go no farther they anchored the ships jumped into the ankledeep water and muck and trudged back toward it armed with spears and long pikes kelis knew that in thisas in most of the days workhe was but an observer he stood at a distance and watched as the halaly took their revenge the beast was a monster indeed worse because it had eaten itself and the world around it nearly to death there was no form to it that could be made sense of save that the entirety of its bulk seemed built around its great mouth ring after ring of teeth pointed inward toward the pink center of the thing it was with its voracious appetite a bringer of destruction a maker of death by gluttony it lay gasping but slowly slowly it eased toward death despite the wounds in it already and the further ones being made by newly cast spears it was the lack of water to breathe that was to kill it it was a fish after all melio came up beside kelis and shared the spectacle a moment if i made you a necklace from one of those teeth he asked would you wear it kelis turned toward him reminded suddenly that he had forgotten mena but calmed already by his friends joking tone is the princess well of course she is melio gestured with his arm directing keliss gaze toward the tail end of the foulthing there he made out the figure of mena who was using the dangling ropes to scramble her way onto the things back she picked her way over the ridges through the fins and protrusions and around the embedded hooks behind her came a line of shouting halaly their joy obvious in their strides while many others grabbed hold of the ropes on all sides and tried climbing hand over hand to join her you know melio said i tell her all the time to be careful but thats just the man in me that says it that worries for her melio paused when mena did high on the creature she stood with her feet planted wide the wind stirring her hair and garments she set her hands on her hips and silently surveyed the masses churning through the mud all around the island of beast in truth though melio said i feel shell outlive us all shes half a god after all right that night kelis took his leave explaining to mena that he had to answer his chieftains call he would return to her service as soon as he could she let him go without question and in the darkness before the dawn he found the messenger waiting for him outside his tent he had limbered up already but before he spoke he reached down straight legged and pressed his palms to the hardpacked earth what is your name he asked as he came upright again naamen kelis grinned well naamen are you ready to run c hapter t en sire neen took a perverse pleasure in recalling all the things he knew about the world that the akarans did not it was too long a list for him to go through in one sitting but he often tried it soothed him their ignorance was as much a balm to him as mist was although combined with the drugs effects it was an even greater balm leaguemen had never truly come off mist not even when aliver was alive and making the stuff torture peoples dreams for a time they were plagued by nightmares similar to those of the general populace but they pushed through them the drug they used was of much higher quality than what they provided to the masses and with experimentation they distilled a variation they could again use without torment for them the drug was fundamental to every aspect of their lives as important as water food air waking or sleeping for clarity or bliss to focus or lose oneself completely mist aided it all as he sat in the plush banquet room of the ambergris the massive ship they had switched to at the outer isles the thought of lecturing corinn slicked the leaguemans hands with sweat and stiffened him with pentup desire he hated her and he wished her to know it in her final moments when she gave everything to the league and they destroyed her if she had accepted the leagues offer to meet the lothan aklun herself he would be beside himself with expectation luxuriating in the surprise he was about to present her with having to settle for dariel instead was some compensation and he would do his best to relish what awaited him peppering his hatred was the fact that he also hungered to consume the queen often his mist trances were little more than long sessions in which he lectured queen corinn akaran he stood above her taking delicious pleasure out of testifying to all the many ways she was not the power she believed she knelt below him a slackmouthed expression of awe on her lovely face her gestures promises of submissionfaithful subservient pious submission it was no accident that his concubines were chosen for their resemblance to her they were fine models really coiffed and manicured and even altered anatomically at times he loved it that they were each so alike while also tasting and sounding and smelling and being different the same and yet different they were a great pleasure to him shame they never lasted long in his service shame also that he had opted not to bring one along on this trip it would not do for prince dariela whelp he loathed in a different wayto spot her and note the resemblance but you should not complain he thought things are about to change completely sire neen looked around the table in the plush banquet room of the ambergris happy that his thoughts were trapped within his skull and could not be read by the roomful of people they were two weeks out from the isles already well into the gray slopes the ship rocked with the slightest recognition of their waterborne state but the room itself was as formally decorated and numerously staffed as a palace a necessity as few leaguemen really liked the sea a little more patience sire neen thought and all will be made right much will be revealed old scores settled oh some will be surprised some will be shocked saddened but not i not i nothing will surprise me i am the surpriser not the surprised so we are halfway to the other lands he said lifting his voice so that it carried through the noise of conversation and dining what do you make of the trip so far your highness dariel sitting across the round table from him crooked a grin and spoke to the gathered company of leaguemen naval officers imperial officials and concubines ill admit to being impressed he said he played with his food for a moment absently pushing his uneaten morsels around with the point of his knife the range was like nothing id ever imagined to think that the league has sailed through that all these years it is nothing sire neen said nothing for us at least we who truly know the sea the prince showed no sign he caught the insult he shook his head in childlike wonder and those creatures todayjust bizarre ill dream of them tonight im sure sire neen dipped a spoon in his soup a clear broth filled with soft morsels of white fish holding the spoon halfway to his mouth he said if you wake up screaming prince well be sure to send someone to comfort you the young woman to the princes left touched a finger to his wrist and drew a line up his arm id be happy to take care of that she said it wouldnt do for the prince to dream of beasts not when there are more pleasant things to be haunted by dariel cocked his head toward her with solicitous deference but said nothing she returned his gaze with an annoying amount of enthusiasmfrom neens perspective he had instructed the concubines to be gracious and generous to the prince in everything he rather wished they did not perform so willingly he slipped the soup into his mouth feigning rapture at the taste he closed his eyes he needed a few moments free of the sight of the prince by the gods the boy irritated him so selfsatisfied such a pretense of innocence and openness as if he were not a killer of thousands as if they would ever forget those who died at the princes hands on the platforms fortunately there had been a couple of moments when the princes naive composure had been rattled both had been pleasant to witness and were some comfort to remember when they had first sailed out onto the wave peaks of the range had been one such moment in truth the sight still amazed the leagueman even though he had witnessed it scores of times they were not sure what caused them but the captains believed that some change in the features far below the surface of the water affected the currents above nine days out from the outer isles sailing due west with good winds the ambergrismassive as it was to human eyeshad been but a cork bobbing on a grayblack fathomless ocean they had been days riding swells of thirty and forty feet but at that unmarked boundary all had changed far below the bottom dropped or rose or undulated for all they knew whatever caused it the result at the surface was that the swells rose into peaks sheer reaches hundreds of feet high riding up them was like grinding over stone slow and painful the hull of the ship trembled with the effort and each time neen had a momentary fear that the boat would slip backward it never did though cresting the summit the heavy bosom of the ambergris thrust far out into the air spray whipping around those on board like a creature intent on ripping them from the deck and as the ship tilted onto the slope the descent switched to a mad acceleration reaching speeds beyond any seen on land the ambergis became a careening leviathan at the edge of control moving so fast the water around them hissed as if being scorched by the hulls passing they plunged down until the prow dug into the base of the next wave submerging the fore portions of the deck for several long moments before slowly rising righting then it began all over again and again sire neen went on deck only briefly as they entered the range he had the pleasure of seeing the expression of awe on dariels face as he looked at the seething immensity of giants rolling toward them rank after rank for as far as the eye could see he retreated belowdecks just after closing his eyes even as he felt his way toward his cabin keeping the image of the princes tremulous cheeks and loose lips in his mind yes that was a pleasure neen thought still chewing that same mouthful of meat the dinner conversation revolving around him he heard it took in most of what was being said at some level but the focus of his mistenhanced mind moved elsewhere freely today was a pleasure as well how close prince how close you came to being tipped into the mouths of devils if only you knew they had come out of the range the day before the sea had returned to its normal swells though the waves remained high by most standards many gathered on deck to marvel at the relative calm of the ocean compared to what they had passed through the ambergris once more plowed its course in serene control sire neen had stood for a time amusing himself with rialus neptos the adviser was ghostly pale his cheeks sunken and his voice rawthe result no doubt of days of gutchurning seasickness neen made a point of speaking about food with which neptos still seemed to have a troubled relationship it was a small amusement tormenting neptos passing the time the leagueman had expected the creatures to appear that day but the moment of their arrival was so sudden it snatched his breath away he had been standing beside rialus when the lookouts shouted from the crows nests the character of the ocean all around them changed in an instant as far as the eye could see in any direction the water churned and undulated and writhed hundreds of large creatures broke the surface swimming at speed through the waves like dolphins but these were not dolphins are they dariels voice came from behind them wavering and thin the prince reached the railing and grasped it sire neen glanced over at him yes he said answering the incomplete question sea wolves not truly a fitting name theyre not like wolves at all they are like nothing really except themselves when he looked back the creatures were all around the ship they rose from the depths quickly taking shape behind the liquid glass of the green water their heads were great knotted bulbs of waxylooking pink flesh barnacled and gashed and grimed by sea slime it was hard to gauge their size from the deck even from that height it was clear they were larger than any whales seen in the waters around the known world or even out at the vumu archipelago but they were not whales they swam with the combined action of flippers that lined their long bodies and an inhaling and exhaling propulsion of water they swelled and deflated rose and fell so close together that it was hard to tell where each individual began and ended look at them dariel said i can see why theyre feared the giver never created these rialus said theyre monsters perhaps not sire neen said he never did have much imagination anyway there they are no matter how they came to be he motioned toward them with his thin wrist dismissive and casual watch what they do now the sea wolves drew in tighter around the brig so churning the water that it seemed the ambergris plowed through a sea of the creatures they jockeyed for position along the massive wall of the hull they caressed it bumped it tried to slide up out of the water as if they would climb it they slapped at it with tentacled arms that peeled away from their bodies and moved with fluid strength they clearly wished to gain some purchase on the hull but they could not do so they slid off the slick white coating some propelled themselves out of the water slammed the hull with the weight of their bodies these just dropped back into the froth frustrated one creature marked from the rest by an enormous barnacled protrusion on its head squirmed in the water just beneath them keeping pace it rolled to the side and for a moment seemed to study them with one enormous yellow eye the pupil contracted perhaps from the light of the bright sky but even to sire neen it seemed the beast was focusing his attention on him picking him out from the many gaping faces looking over the rail the leagueman had the sudden urge to grab the prince and toss him overboard right toward that eye and waiting mouth it was a fantasy urge for he had no physical strength to match dariels but it came to him so strongly he tasted metal on his tongue but the moment passed the creature rolled away and vanished there are so many of them dariel said his tone had changed gone boyish filled with curiosity what do they eat your majesty how should i know they dont eat us thats the important thing rialuss voice wavered as he asked we are not in danger then sire neen patted him on the back nudging him with just enough force to press his torso against the railing so long as you dont fall in rialus youre in no danger whatsoever on occasion an unwary sailor has been snatched from the deck of a clipper but were well above their reach here on the ambergris in the early years of course we lost many ships of all sizes these creatures seem to hate us or hunger for us which is perhaps the same thing they tore ships apart and devoured whole crews for a time we tried to shoot our way through with ballista mounted around the deck railing we still lost most of our ships but that was before we mastered the skin and this was long ago we are quite safe now this skin dariel said what makes it work is it just a paint of sorts a paint sire neen showed his disdain for the simplicity of that concept paint is like a condiment to sea wolves they eat it with the ship to improve its flavor our skin is no paint butforgive methat is all i can say about it i must know what this skin is dariel said im sure we could put it to use even in the inner sea there are no sea wolves in the inner sea your highness a fact that you should be glad of as to skin itself thats a trade secret the league must humbly hold that information close we are only merchants prince dariel allow us our secrets sire neen opened his eyes again realizing that his name had been called pulling him back from his reverie dariel watched him from across the table a look of amused curiosity on his face im sorry sire neen said what was it you asked dariel said i asked if there were any other surprises in store for me sire the leagueman held back the impulse to run his tongue over the rounded nubs of his teeth he held the princes gaze with a smiling visage while several others offered wry remarks would it surprise you he thought to know that i wake every morning imagining your downfall would it surprise you to know that im not going to make amends with the lothan aklun instead i will destroy them would it surprise you to know that you are to be offered up as a gesture of good faith to a people who will eat your soul as a slave a toy a plaything for monsters would it surprise you to know that once the aklun are gone there will be no greater power in the world than the league would it surprise you if i said right now prepare your knees for bending prince prepare your knees eventually the others quieted and it fell to sire neen to answer he said oh certainly if there is one thing i can promise you with certainty your highness it is that surprises await you c hapter e leven barad was picky about the company he kept he liked honest folk unselfish and moral and capable of empathymothers and fathers who loved brothers and sisters who cared for each other he wanted to know that he was listened to when he spoke and he wanted to believe the words that were spoken to him he liked people who had known some hardship but who still had the capacity to envision a better future for themselves and others for all these reasons he tended to avoid royalty for that matter he had little use for the upper class in general in striving for the greater good for many however one sometimes had to deal with questionable elements that was why barad had agreed to allow the young aushenian king grae to attend the first meeting of the kindred in his early twenties grae was the son of guldan a half brother to igguldan born of the kings second wife he had been young enough to be spared fighting in the war that took his father and older brothers he and his younger brother ganet had lived it out in the remote north of aushenia he had grown to maturity during hanishs rule when numrek roamed his lands at will inflicting all sorts of degradations that must have hurt his heartsore pride he had been a fierce leader during the turmoil of hanishs overthrow after securing his own lands he had even marched through the gradthic gap and laid siege to mein tahalian he would have won it too if corinn had not sent mena with numrek troops to yank him back corinn was content to let him keep his throne for the sake of stability but she would not allow anyone to redraw national boundaries without her consent they pushed him back to aushenia with permission to rule within his borders as he saw fitas long as that was in line with the various things the empire required of him if grae was thankful for having lived to call himself king it did not show on his face or in his demeanor his haughty blue eyes had an edge of disdain in them barad imagined many women would find him quite attractive he was strong jawed his forehead was high and the hair above it strangely disheveled windblown but in a manner that barad suspected was in fashion it troubled barad that anyone with a title was aware of his objectives but many people he trusted had vouched for the kings passionate desire to see the akarans overthrown and so he now sat opposite the prophet at a large low table in the back room of a pub in the port town of denben in northern talay the resistance representatives hailed from all the provinces except vumu which was too distant to be a major force they made for a strange company only grae wore the finery of aristocracy otherwise the men and women dressed as what they were a merchant from bocoum a tribal councilman from palik a blacksmith from elos a dockworker from nesreh a tavern mistress from senival an architect from alecia a huntsman from scatevith and more their complexions and features varied with their races making them a collage of much of the known worlds diversity barad himself looked as he always did more like an aging laborer in coarse clothes than a dissident intent on overthrowing a powerful empire none of them other than grae commanded an army but all of them had been true to the secret objectives they shared they had protected the coded language through which they corresponded often sending communications on the lips of travelers who had no idea they were messengers for most of them it had been a long road to get here to sit in nervous expectation finally meeting facetoface as one group united in a purpose that stretched across borders mountains forests and seas it is a blessed thing barad began in his deep voice that we finally can meet this way it doesnt matter that this room smells of beer and sweat it doesnt matter that this is a poor mans pub and that soon theyll be singing bawdy songs in the rooms beside this one none of that matters look around you the faces that you see are faces of the kindred we have always been so but this meeting marks the day we sit together as one family and drink of the same cup let us do so twice now to begin our partnership and at the end of this meeting to confirm it motioning with his large hands he indicated that he meant this literally on the otherwise bare table before him sat a large silver chalice it was a simple vessel not particularly ornate wide mouthed and tarnished by age a dark rich wine stained the metal as barad lifted it held it for the others to see and then drank he passed it to the woman beside him she was drawfed by his height but she took the cup reverently drank from it then passed it on the chalice moved around in silence until it reached the far side of the table forgive me king grae but before you drink let us hear from you of all the company you are the newest to join confirm please that you are truly one of us barad added smiling to lighten the request you see you could turn us in most readily whisper it right into corinns lovely ear if you wished tell us why you would never do that barad hid behind his smile the fact that this was unlikely the kindred had placed agents in killintich some years ago some of them were quite close to the king close enough to slit his throat while he slept should it seem like he was going to betray them but still much better that such a thing not be necessary it was clear that the monarch young as he was was not used to being evaluated he held the chalice for a moment rolling the stem in his fingers as if he were considering drinking the whole thing down first speaking later he set it down though and met the waiting faces youll have me prove my loyalty to you thats easy because my loyalty to you is twinned with my loyalty to aushenia all that i will ever do will be for my nations good and my nation has suffered too long have you forgotten this we suffered throughout our generations of independence when the akarans did everything they could to break our resolve to impoverish us and yet it was aushenia that first suffered from the meinish and numrek onslaught we suffered the brunt of their attack we the aushenian people we were the first wall they smashed against my brother igguldan died at aushenguk fell while the princes and councillors of acacia fluttered about like upset chickens we died firstand this was just weeks after offering our soul to acacia in partnership i know this is true barad said you were wronged we were wronged grae echoed his voice higher and louder than the large mans once we were beaten hanish mein gave us over to those beasts and yet queen corinn expects us to forget the past shell have us take what scraps she throws our way even as she stands with her dogs at either hand the insult of it is more than i can bear so i will not bear it we are on the same side then barad said the suppression of the many by the few insults us all grae drew himself upright and inhaled through his nose before he spoke he put emphasis on one word thereby stressing the particularity of his agreement with the statement the suppression of the many by the few does insult us all the akarans are the suppressors of this world aushenia will never forget that i as their king will make sure of that the representative from aos a man named hunt said king your conviction on this is clear but i hear dariel is spoken of fondly by your people has he not committed himself to benevolent projects in your kingdom rebuilding much of what was the princes work is nothing to me i let him drop his sweat on the ground of aushenia but i do not love him for it but the people do they not my people are not so easily appeased remember that we went twentytwo generations outside the acacian empire none of my people has forgotten that none of them wants things to remain as they are elaz the warehouse manager who had greeted barad in nesreh asked what do they want then they want what all of us here want the end of acacian rule the return to the power of independent nations the world was shaped better before edifus went mad for power in aushenia we have long memories children are even taught to read using queen elenas decree we know in our bones that all the people of the known world have the right to govern themselves let us return to what he destroyed with his wars of distribution lady shenk a tavern mistress from senival asked do you think that the world was paradise then it was not it was a mess the world was a patchwork of feuding tribes led by petty chieftains dogs fighting for scraps they were is that what you want to have again of course not grae snapped he seemed taken aback by being spoken to thusly by a commoner he had asked to be here though and controlled the temper that flushed his face crimson but much has changed since then we would return to the best of the past and strengthen it with the best of the present each nation will have its own king and queen who will decide what is best for their people not an outsider sitting in her palace in acacia deciding for everyone this is what we all want right silence the others looked about for a moment they heard the commotion of the pub through the wallschatter a tune sung by a melancholy voice their eyes came to rest on barad who eventually answered you are the only one here who wears a crown too much talk of kings and queens does not go down well with this wine remember king grae that no monarch can win against corinn now no nation can overthrow the akarans by force the mein did it yes but the mein have been vanquished and the mein nurtured their plans for years and years before they acted you surely have not the patience to wait overlong no corinn has a firmer grip on the known world than her family has had for years she feeds the nobles of each nation rubies even as she digs diamonds from their land she keeps a court made up not just of the best from all the nations but of the most beloved sons and daughters of all the worlds kings your own sister is among her ladies isnt that so she holds them hostage the first victims to suffer in the event of any attack if there is no such attack all is well the court is pleasure the nobles collect their rubies the kings and queens grae are the only ones in the known world who arent suffering like the rest that is why the rising will not be one of massed armies standing behind banners instead it will be a unity of action among the common people they will rise they will all put down their tools and demand that the world be remade that is what the rising will be based on there will be blood yes there will be turmoil we will be tested but we will win because we are right our cause is just and the world cannot remain blind to it forever we do not even hate the akarans it is aliver who spoke to me and put this mission inside me it is possible when the change has happened that corinn will be a part of the new order if she accepts it all this may be hard for a king to imagine close lipped grae asked do you so doubt me no if we did you would not be here many have vouched for you hunt has watched aushenia for years he believes you are different from most in your class we question you now only because you must understand our objective it is not to wipe away corruption and replace it with new corruption so what sort of system do you foresee when the akarans are gone who will rule the people themselves the people themselves grae checked other faces apparently wondering if any found that as amusing as he did i trust you have a more detailed plan than that barad knew that was a reasonable supposition he had been asked it many times before and he had meditated on it quite often he always returned to the same central conviction what happened after the rising was not his concern the people would have to face that themselves together in many different ways in all the many nations he would be one among them but he had no desire to impose his rule on them or to dictate what they should do with their freedom his chargegiven to him by the giver and through alivers voicewas to break the shackles to clear minds to instill a belief in a better future that was as far as it went he knew there was danger in thinking thusly for some men like this king here would surely grasp for the reins of power themselves but this was as it had to be he answered as he always did the people will do what they will with their freedom they have earned that right many times over and if someone else tries to take corinns throne as his own the people will make this change happen they are tired tired of trading one despot for another i pity the manor womanwho tries to reenslave them grae thought about this for a while he fingered the stem of the chalice i was born a prince of aushenia it fell to me to become my peoples king i would just as soon it had not and that i still had my brother and father but this crown is my fate it is not my fate though to wear any other crown i do not covet corinns empire i want only aushenia my rule of it is a matter between me and my people will the kindred acknowledge that barad shrugged as i said i will not dictate how people should live yes that can be between you and the people of aushenia nobody said anything but several nodded curtly what of your brother might he not wish to be a king a king of aushenia perhaps grae said but only if i venture to the marshes to hunt with kralith lady shenk interrupted him quit the aushenian poetry and speak plain you mean to say only if you die right only then grae said curtly i swear to you that my brother and i are of one mind on this how about this then ill pledge you my peoples support aushenia will join this rising and when its accomplished we will demand only our freedom to live as we will to our benefit i do not acknowledge your right to pledge other peoples support barad said i am already well known to your people many are already friends of the kindred he let this sit a moment but not long enough for grae to respond i will however welcome your personal support and i will welcome you using your influence in whatever ways help the peoples cause do any disagree nobody did good barad said then there is only one other thing i must ask you you should know that there is a reason i want you with us although the kindred will not win by war alone war is to be a part of whats to come we have some warriors in our ranks but we need a leader for them you could be that leader you have been trained for such things when corinn tries to squash us with her marah her army her numrek will you lead our military grae grinned youthful and arrogant and comfortable in himself again he asked the room the queen would never dream that her fate would be sealed in the back room of a grimy pub in denben would she to barad he said i would like nothing more than to lead our warriors all my soldiers will say the same we have an agreement on that then i may want even more of you though lets start by traveling togetherperhaps with your younger brother as well if you truly believe he will join our cause i will show you both some of the world as i see it perhaps you will find the view different from the one seen atop a throne you are an odd man barad the lesser they tell me you were a strong man in your youth perhaps you still are when all this is over you and i should compete together will you run the killintich race against me i do not think thats a race i could win but if you wish drink now king and be one of us barad watched as the young man lifted the chalice and tilted it back the boy was brash perhaps he would be a danger or perhaps he would die like his half brother barad then let his eyes wander around the rest of the company he liked what he saw he did not claim to predict the particulars of the future but he did know at his very core that a great change was coming soon soon they would rise it was he believed all coming together her highness would be dumbfounded when it hit her c hapter t welve dariel had been warned that the isles of the barrier ridgethe home of the lothan aklunmade a horizonlong barricade of stone but his imaginings had not prepared him for the actual sight of them from a distance and with the changing light of the rising sun slanting from behind the ambergris the island chain looked like mountains dusted with a cover of snow that clung to the few flat surfaces he watched them from near the ships bow as he stared the peaks grew in height in a manner that seemed unnatural more motion to it than should be more too than just the lessening of distance on one hand they were a strange solidity viewed by eyes used to the motion of the ocean waves yet for all the graystone hardness of them dariel could not shake the feeling that the entire landmass was moving it seemed to be ever slicing southward like the spine of a surfacing whale its the current that does that dariel pulled his eyes away from the scene long enough to acknowledge sire neen who had just joined him at the railing rialus at his shoulder the current flows strongly to the north this time of year the waves rushing along the coastline make it seem as if the land is moving but i assure you its not its just a trick of the eye the angerwall well have to cross is very real however and a result of the same phenomenon sire neen smiled showing his rounded teeth i imagine that your eyes have not yet seen the islands for what they actually are look again more closely were near enough now dariel looked back at the coastline the rocks rose into a vertical blockade and for most of the ridges dark expanse there was no sign of habitation he almost asked why it seemed empty of life but before he did he realized that the light areas he had thought snow were actually buildings hed had the scale all wrong the peaks were higher and the dustings of snow were actually structures several stories tall built all along the highest points and thrown loosely about the high cliffs was a spidery lacework a combination of nature and architectural design oh he saw something else what he had taken to be one solid landmass was in fact many islands that was why it was so hard to see the scale some of the peaks were far beyond the nearer ones each was a jagged point thrust directly up from the water they were not approaching a continent with mountains they were approaching thousands of separate peaks massive islands that hid the greater part of their bulk in the black depths yes oh is right sire neen said it was not long before dariel observed the next surprise the current rushing to the north got more and more powerful as they drew nearer land it ripped along the coastline as fast as a river in flood a ship tossed against the rocks would certainly be smashed to splinters that was frightening enough but as they approached a wide gap behind the first of the barrier islands through which they obviously intended to sail he saw what must be the angerwall sire neen had referred to clearing the point of land the ocean currents interaction was suddenly that of rushing water against the comparatively slack water marking the dividing line between the two was a seething wall of water several stories high the current moved past while the channel water swirled and roiled bucking up in great heaving swells unevenly timed as if angry creatures were trying to breech but could not break the skin of the water ah rialus said but got no further vocalizing his thoughts than that oh and ah sire neen chuckled you make a fine duo the ambergris approached at speed angling across the current and toward the channel the wind was with them and they plowed through the rising and falling waves with incredible force almost as if they wished to crash directly into the island itself dariel had done some daring things in his career as a brigand but now they were traveling at openocean speed careening either into a wall of rock or over a wall of waterhe wasnt sure which the lookout called something as did the captain and then a bell began to toll sire neen said something but dariel did not hear what it was he was still staring when a crewman grasped him by the shoulder and pulled him hurriedly toward the center of the deck he joined sire neen rialus and others at the benches that encircled the base of one of the masts the crewman shoved him down without ceremony and with a few deft motions secured a rope around his waist tied to the mast dariel looked around to see that the others were likewise secured many crewmen still dashed about the ship but when the tolling of the bell increased in rapidity they all scrambled for something to hold the bell stopped for a few moments the only sounds were the wind and the rush of water and then the bow of the massive ship punched over the current wall and crashed down into the slack water the prow dove and the stern tilted up into the air and then the entire ship began to pitch and roll at the same time the force of it pulled dariel in one direction and then the next smacking his head hard on the wooden mast behind him if he had not been tied down he would certainly have been tossed into the air indeed some of the crewmen were dariel saw sailors dangling sideways in the air holding on to lines for dear life the hull of the ship groaned and quivered there was a tearing sound deep in the vessel and dariel feared the entire ship would be torn to pieces and then he feared it would stay whole but conclude this mad maneuver upside down the ship corkscrewed to starboard in a manner that shoved dariels guts up against his diaphragm pushing the air from his lungs the roiling wraith of the agitated water surged up over the railing the sailors there went completely under water and stayed submerged for some time the ship balanced on its side the tips of the masts sunk deep into the water sails billowing with the current it seemed an impossibly long momenta breath held and held and heldbefore the ambergris finally made up its mind and began the slow roll back upright the sailors who had been submerged gasped as they hit the air dariel felt just as empty of air as they just as hungry for breath a different noise rose from the ships bowels shouts of rage from the chained numrek he had not seen them the entire voyage but they made themselves heard now dariel had to shade his brow to get his bearings they were he concluded in the lee of the island actually they were even moving forward away from the current and into the maze of mountain islands before them he did not try to hide the astonishment on his face in answer sire neen offered weve found forceful penetration to be the best method of entry his voice had the same calm tone he used at the council table and his smile was so incongruous at the moment that the sight of it gave dariel an instant headache or somehow alerted him to the pounding pain already all around his skull there is nothing worse you see than getting trapped between the two currents one has no control at all then well have to explain to the numrek that we couldve had a much rougher ride than that its not for the timid i know but we of the league are not timid dariel stood with rialus as the ambergris spent the next hour threading its way through the islands they progressed at a cautious speed but it was still strange to watch such a large vessel navigate the narrow channels apparently the peaks dove into the water at the same steep angle as they rose above it making the waterways clean routes at times they skimmed so near the submerged slopes that he could see far down through the clear waters the longlegged crabs on the stones gave the depths perspective growing smaller and smaller until they faded into blackness a few times he thought he saw human forms floating among them but the waterclear as it waswas deceiving him watching the crustaceans gave him a queasy feeling almost like vertigo as if he might fall from the deck through the water and down and down into the depths a clipper came out from a harbor as they passed and sliced cleanly through the water toward them it was a small ship built for speed and so dwarfed beside the ambergris that it took dariel a moment to figure out why the sight of it was so remarkable it had no sail nor any oars it dipped and slipped through the water with no visible indication of how it did so there was something to it that he was not seeing perhaps the league had developed some seethrough sailcloth that would be handy in many ways but there were no masts either it was amazing bizarre frightening even to see a ship move so unnaturally dariel leaned over the railing as the clipper drew up alongside the ambergris that surprised him as wellthat a small vessel could dock with a moving shipwhich appeared to be what it was doing it did not hold his complete attention his neck grew sore from craning between the strange craft and the structures perched high and strung across the rock walls they looked like they had been built by some sort of bird people who were in love with the heights he thought of menabirdgoddess that she wasand wished she were with him to see this who were these lothan aklun for that matter where were they he had yet to see any signs of life on the islands they passed several docks complete with buildings and boats and equipment but they were all strangely still he had not seen any boats other than the clipper that made no sense the waters should be teeming with vessels moving between the islands i see aklun architecture impresses you sire neen said he had been away conferring with the other leagueman when he rejoined the prince he seemed to be in uncharacteristically good humor he even rocked on his toes as he spoke a childish energy animating him it should until now weve never figured out just what material the lothan aklun work in they seem to have been able to shape stone as if it were a liquid until now sire neen shrugged oh i suspect we will understand it soon that im very confident of dariel found the leaguemans sudden enthusiasm unnerving he let his eyes roam away its incredible he said speaking honestly i knew we were coming to it but it somehow didnt feel real the lothan aklun its still hard to believe ill finally set eyes on them sire neen made a noise that was hard to read a slight expulsion of air that might have been an indication of amusement that much i know to be true prince you might as well know that we were preceded by another league vessel they should have arrived a fortnight ago bearing a message of our coming oh dariel said though his actual thoughts were somewhat more pointed the leaguemans statement was made casually enough but the hairs on the back of dariels neck bristled why didnt you mention this earlier league vessels travel back and forth at will it would not interest you to know all our shipping itineraries would it with a nod dariel conceded that was true enough why mention it now then just to prepare you for the day what sort of answer is that dariel thought he was about to voice the question but sire neen turned his attention to rialus who was staring at the league clipper it had peeled away from the hull as they spoke it kept perfect pace with them but still used neither sail nor oar nor any other source of propulsion that dariel could make out youre wondering what powers that boat arent you neptos sire neen asked of course you are no doubt youve thought the same question prince perhaps feared to ask it ill tell you its powered by souls he let that sit for a moment in silence and then looked at the two men his face a portrait of good humor souls have power you know your highness should know that as well as anyone you released more souls at one moment than any other person ive known of did you not feel their power there was nothing in his tone or expression to indicate anything other than levity but dariels pulse hammered at his temple a warning alarm so loud he feared the man might hear it leaguemen didnt make jokes they didnt show emotion or they didnt show their true emotions at least he knew sire neen must be feeling something completely different from his outward appearance he had to be if he wasnt what could possibly have brought on this playful barbed mood you refer to the platforms dariel said and saying it he remembered the flash of light at his back when the platforms exploded the fear that the inferno was reaching out for him the knowledge that the man he thought of as a father was riding those flames up to death for many that act of sabotage made him a hero he had never thought of it that way though and the memory filled him with regret there was power in freeing all those souls from all those bodies but not the kind of power he wanted to be reminded of i do i do prince i lost many brothers who were dear to me that horrible day do you know that rialus inhaled a sharp audible breath his nervous eyes darted between the two men dariel began i not just brothers i lost my wife brothers wives dariel had never thought of leaguemens domestic lives youyou had a wife sire neen flashed a look of disgust or did he the very next moment it was gone swept away by incredulous mirth of course we have wives my prince we are men like other men how else would we continue our kind oh prince dariel akaran you amuse me but tell me i have often wondered what it would be like to burn alive my physician tells me that the very horror of it is what makes it bearable he says the pain of burning all over your body would be so intense that you would be overwhelmed it would hurt so much that my wife would no longer feel the hurt as hurt it would become something else something beyond pain like death being something beyond life does that sound true to you surely youve thought about it considering that you made that the fate of so many children even he shuddered and as before he looked briefly dismayed and then instantly at ease again dariel glanced at rialus who seemed just as perplexed by the conversation as he was what were they talking about why were they talking about this why now i dont know dariel eventually said thinking that sounded feeble he attempted a tone of greater certainty i had not thought about it before i have tried to put my memory of that day aside its not the work i do now sire neen seemed disappointed he lifted his chin and studied the prince a moment did you never think to grasp the throne yourself he asked acacias generations have few notable queens in a time of such turmoil you might readily have stepped into power as your brothers heir to some it seems odd that you did not why defer to gentle corinnjust a woman after all why would i consider that the indignation in dariels voice appeared instant and true it choked his words for a moment and then pushed them out with breath of quick anger no i wont have this conversation with you what i did at the platforms i did in war against an agent of my familys enemy any guilt for it is mine to measure thats all ill say dont forget yourself and ask about it again no i dont forget myself the leagueman said he reached out and affectionately squeezed dariels shoulder he paused like that so strangely familiar and pursed his lips in thought all right your highness no more probing questions forgive me if i trod awkwardly he released dariel and turned as if to move away he stopped and turned back touching a finger to his nose as if a thought had just occurred to him one other thing we wont be stopping in the barrier isles today theres no reason to the lothan aklun are all dead every one of them you recall how hanish mein used a contagion to ravage your people weve done something similar here they werent really so hard to kill your tinhadin had said they were like serpents with a thousand heads or something like that as usual with you akarans that was an exaggeration he chuckled so theres no reason to stop no one to talk to you see theyre dead and swimming into their rest so well sail on if you dont mind and soon well dine with the auldek our new friends its they who matter to us anyway like i said surprises abound dont they dariel did not find the words to stop the leagueman as he walked casually away flanked the prince saw by bodyguards who were suddenly more attentive than they had been before he was too stunned to call out to move to demand an explanation sire neens words jostled in his head but he had heard him he had understood him rialus who had turned to the railing as if he might vomit stammered something dariel didnt make out one word of it but somehow he knew what he was saying he just knew he pulled his gaze away from sire neens back and looked down at the sea yes just as he thought there were human bodies in the water after all in fact there were many floating bodies swimming into their rest the prince felt the presence of soldiers approaching him from behind he realized then that he had not seen his marah guards for some time many of them had been belowdecks before the angerwall and those who had been with him were no longer with him he knew without turning that the group gathering behind him was not made up of his soldiers but he did not rush to look at them instead he kept eyes on the graveyard that was the sea there were so many bodies in the waves all of them adrift on the same tide the ambergris rode all of them being pulled toward the other lands c hapter t hirteen a young league apprentice noval sat waiting for sire neen among the plush chairs reserved for leaguemen in their council chambers several other officials and naval officers stood or sat nearby with the exception of a few of neens assistants all of them had newly arrived from the sailless clipper it all went as planned sire neen asked as he stepped into the room you saw the bodies noval said he motioned toward a porthole with a lazy finger up and down the archipelago its the same thing noval had not yet joined the higher ranks of the league and earned the title sire but after this he likely would noval grinned leaning back against his chairs cushions as if he might fall blissfully asleep youll need to learn to hide emotion like that sire neen thought he did not really begrudge him his happiness though in truth he could barely contain his own enthusiasm every lothan aklun is a corpse now said a captain presumably the one who had piloted the clipper a feast for the crabs and sea worms noval nodded and concluded yes it all went as planned you uncle are a genius sire neen pressed his lips together as much as he wanted a share of the young mans satisfaction he could not accept it all without a measure of doubt nothing ever goes entirely as planned he said tell me it all and ill judge noval proceeded to describe what had transpired on the barrier isles over the last few days listening to the report sire neen had to inhale deep breaths his heart raced as if he were joyously running perhaps in the years to come it would be this feeling he relived during mist trances certainly triumph was a sweeter pleasure than anything else he had yet experienced the lothan aklun food for sea worms absolutely amazing could he truly believe it the lothan aklun had seemed invulnerable proud greedy they were aloof in a manner most marked by their well by their simple denial of aloofness he had met their agents on several occasions each time they dressed in loose wraps of white cloth that hung on their leanly muscled frames always bare of foot they were slight men and women healthy looking and tanned sire neen had always felt a knot in his abdomen when meeting them his head tingled in a manner that made him want to flee why it was hard to say they smiled and nodded and conducted their business with courteous efficiency they never invited leaguemen beyond the docks at which they traded their goods but nothing in their outward appearance indicated threat they did not even seem to have guards watching over them this fact alone made neens skin crawl as if with a thousand spiders who other than people so secure in their powerwith unseen weapons ready to unleashwould act as if they gave no thought to it that the lothan aklun had such an effect on him while outwardly feigning harmlessness had planted in him the first seed of personal animus toward them this seed had found ready watering in the years since and now they were dead not so invulnerable after all it seemed now everything that had been theirs belonged to the league sire neen did not know exactly what that meant but he longed to find out you saw the clipper noval asked the captain here has made a quick study of it he cant explain it in the slightest but i believe hes rather taken with the vessel you should see him at the helm the captain did not deny it there is power in that ship like ive never felt before its inside the vessel itself sire truly amazing inside the vessel itself sire neen repeated to himself so its true they had long known that the lothan aklun stole the life force from chosen quota children with a soulcatching device and then transferred the force into other bodies but they had heard only rumors that the lothan also managed to harness the life force to power inanimate objects like their ships now they had proof and if this rumor was true perhaps the others were as well but these things could be explored in time they had other business to see to and have you made contact with the auldek sire neen asked yeesss noval dragged the word out we have i cant say that weve communicated all that effectively with them though they were somewhat agitated by our arrival ill leave it up to you to explain things to them fully in any event weve arranged for you to meet their clan leadership tomorrow we should have the numrek with us from the start we mentioned them to the auldek but they didnt grasp what we were telling them are the numrek well the brutes sire neen blew a dismissive burst of air through his lips who knows i mean yes yes im sure theyre well theyve been bound in their cabins the entire voyage theyre alive and will likely be overjoyed to set foot on dry land again he considered taking a seat but his body tingled with too much energy to sit still instead he paced amazed at the situation he found himself in it was all too perfect he had been too modest in his aspirations by the end of this he would be chief elder in his later years the league would own everything that passed across the gray slopes both what went out and what came in he himself would be a deity while still in the prime of life this thought did in fact cause him to sit down so tomorrow i will broker a new trade agreement with the auldek are they like the numrek noval raised his shoulders dropped them yes and no i really cant tell you much about them they are quite like the numrek and also not that much like them at all you should just see for yourself a bit casual in his mastery of details sire neen thought youth are they rich smiling noval said rich enough rich and strange which together bodes well for us what more do we know about what becomes of the quota about what they do with them nothing i saw known worlders in among the lothan aklun we interrogated the few we captured peculiar creatures they fought like trapped wildcats though they were body servants not warriors strangely loyal to their masters they seemed quite a few of them died along with the lothan aklun for no reason but blind loyalty and the ones i saw among the auldek he began to illustrate something his fingers dancing before his face but he dropped the effort really uncle you should see them for yourself dont let me spoil the amusement sire neen found all this too vague he was about to say as much but a commotion at the far door announced new arrivals several ishtat guards jostled their way into the room all of them focused on a single figure at their center prince dariel but not prince dariel as he had been a few moments ago on deck the small interval of time between then and now had worked a transformation on him his lips were swollen and raw his nose puffy and leaking blood which smeared across his face eyes teary with shock and pain and emotion and anger there was plenty of anger too he wrenched his body and head about fighting the ishtat but they held him firmly his hands were bound behind his back one guard grasped him by a fistful of hair and steadied him the most ignominious feature was a bit that had been shoved inside the royal mouth and fastened by straps that pressed against his cheeks and wrapped around the back of his head he could breathe but not talk sire neen had forgotten the pleasure of running his tongue over his rounded teeth seeing dariel reminded him of it and he indulged oh that looks most uncomfortable prince he said grimacing in a show of commiseration it looks as though you put up a fight commendable i guess but futile he gestured with his fingers the guards dragged the prince closer look here noval this is prince dariel akaran bowing his head noval said honored to meet you your highness i left word for the ishtat to bring him to us but it seems he did not come willingly perhaps he thought he could fight his way through our entire ishtat force he might have thought his marah would aid him alas they wont he dropped his voice and added weve had to kill them dariels eyes bulged he worked his lips and tongue clearly wanting to speak but the apparatus let nothing more than grunts and frustrated exhalations escape his mouththat and the drool that slipped from the corners of his stretched lips he began thrashing about again the sight of him was almost too much for sire neen to bear with composure to keep from showing his mirth he fumbled in his breast pocket for his mist pipe he did not look up again until he had lit it and sucked a quick puff of the green smoke dariel hung panting his gaze positively blazing with hatred i can see your thoughts sire neen said despite the meaning of his words his voice was syrupy sweet playful theyre right there in your eyes youre thinking how can he think he can offend an akaran prince and not regret it later you never were the brightest of your brood were you aliver would not have trusted me for a moment corinn would have figured everything out by now and already be working to undo the damage mena even bound as you are now would likely have found some way to cut my head from my shoulders not you though you had a skill at treachery and murderill grant you thatbut ive always found you rather dull you let your sister be master of the world you could have claimed that lack of ambition mystifies me sire neen reached out as if to smooth a lock of the princes hair back into place but he was not really near enough and did not complete the gesture for a moment he forgot how much he hated the prince he felt something like warmth for him should we explain things to you theres no reason you shouldnt face your future with clear eyes he gestured for one of his secretaries to vacate his seat let the prince sit a kind offer but one that took the guards a moment to convince the prince to accept once he was seated held in place against the chairs cushions sire neen began a casual discourse one he punctuated with pauses to sip from his pipe as you can imagine he said the league has attempted to gain intelligence about the lothan aklun for generations they were annoyingly secretive giving nothing wanting nothing other than to trade mist for quota thats all they wished of us no more or less we sent spies among them but rarely heard back usually they were lone individuals disguised as child slaves they had ordersand the meansto kill themselves if discovered neen pursed his lips why did we spy on them for the same reason that edifus broke the jaw of any man who raised his voice to him for the same reason that tinhadin betrayed hauchmeinish and exiled the santoth because of the very same impulse that drove your sister corinn to see hanish bleed to death upon his ancestral scatevith stone because they were competition prince because the world not even the entire stretch of the gray slopes was wide enough to contain our ambition why share trade with them when we could own it all ourselves noval said as an akaran you should understand such thinking well sire neen slitted his eyes at the young man not exactly a reprimand but nearly so he did not yet feel like sharing his discourse yes well the league is patient and because of our patience we learned some time ago that the lothan aklun were a ceremonial people among their many customs was a yearly ritual a cleansing ceremony in which every lothan took part each and every one prince you can see how that would interest us it was some years later but eventually we gained a sample of the ceremonial purgative that was part of this cleansing from one of the few spies to make it back to us alive again remember that every lothan aklun takes this purgative on the same day of the year during the same hour they but only they this gave my grandfatherhe was the first architect of this venturean idea what he asked if we could find a way to poison that purgative in a way that would wipe out the lothan entirely on a single day he stared at dariel for a moment i see by the way your cheeks are twitching that you acknowledge what a fine idea he had it proved difficult to orchestrate though we simply did not have the agents in place to spread a poison evenly among them never would it seemed so we tried to find another way all the time of course we kept up the trade prospered from it really some of the older leaguemen would have been content to continue like that but most of us wanted more what man doesnt really at some fundamental level want more more of everything more riches more lovers more power more revenge because he remained persistent my fatherwho had taken up my grandfathers missionworked with his physicians until they found a component of the purgative they could separate out this they made into a poison a vastly potent one here neen paused and shared a knowing glance around the room finally returning to dariel do you see where this is heading yet earlier this yearat great expense and riskwe managed to contaminate the purgative a single agent did it with a single vial of our poison mixed in with their purgative it was all manufactured and stored in one place you see security around it was surprisingly lax a weak spot indeed dariel had stopped struggling some time ago his eyes still red with emotion but calmer than before remained fixed on sire neen more bewildered now than angry somebody wipe the boys chin sire neen said its disturbing to see a grown man drool so one of the ishtat actually tried to carry out the order but dariel yanked his chin away lovely to see the fight in him sire neen thought i wonder how long hell manage to keep it up out loud he said noval tell him what you witnessed exactly the same as you told me before the younger man happily obliged sire neen listened to each detail almost as if he had seen the events and not just heard them reported a short time before thus he envisioned the panorama that was the main harbor of melith an the trading port of the lothan aklun he watched as the league schooner the hooktooth nosed its way into the harbor normally the harbor was thriving bustling alive with boat traffic and commerce this time chaos ruled neen watched as whiterobed lothans ran shouting along the harbor chased by their own servants who were trying to hold them back but again and again lothans managed to break free and throw themselves in the water some of them even carried others down to the same fate the waters of the harbor were blocked with corpses and with the dying and with slaves trying either to save their masters or to die beside them once docked and disembarked sire neen imagined himself running through the streets behind an ishtat vanguard trying to find any living lothan or capture one of the fool slaves who seemed intent on fighting to the death out of allegiance to them it was only by piecing together information and by interrogating the few slaves they actually captured that they came to understand the rest the fever had erupted within hours after the lothan aklun had imbibed their ceremonial drinks they dove in the water because the fever inside made their bodies burn those who could not make it to the harbor fell into convulsions on the ground most of it was over by the time we arrived noval concluded but still what we did witness was a sight to see as far as i can tell the lothan aklun are no more sire neen let his pleasure curve his lips a work of fine planning complexity woven in such a way that it made victory terribly simple and just like that the balance of the world shifts he said that directly to noval but then he turned and contemplated dariel prince i see the many questions in your eyes you want to know whats to become of you dont you and theres anger there too i see it i see it in the way you tremble and blink rapidly you want to shout at me with all your akaran outrage dont you how dare we do these things without consulting you just wait until my sister hears about this thats what youd say isnt it sire neen chuckled he leaned forward taking a pull from his pipe before he continued the thing is prince more is about to change than just the extermination of the lothan aklun we dont need them nor do we need akarans i had to argue among my own people to make this point clear but argue it i did it was time i said that the league not simply ride upon the tides of fortune it was time for us to shape them the destruction of the lothan is part of that your people will soon wake to the other part you see there are traitors at the heart of acacia right in the palace prince right in among the royal family they need only hear confirmation that we have succeeded and then your family will finally after all these years get the type of deaths they deserve c hapter f ourteen it was so much worse than when she had last been here even then two years ago the northern talayans had been complaining about the lack of rainfall corinn had thought their fears exaggerated to her eyes the fields looked like well like fields of growing plants rows and rows of short trees fields of golden grasses she understood that this apparent bounty was achieved only because the staple crops that required the most water had already been replaced by sturdier varieties change was not to be feared the skilled agriculturalists of talay she had believed would adjust not so as the scene before her eyes now confirmed it was a vision of devastation as full of death as any battleground in the nearest field withered trees stood naked of leaves or fruit blackly skeletal and twisted like hundreds of demons captured in gestures of agony farther south some grain crop glittered as if the stalks were silvered strings of glass ready to shatter underfoot the horizon to the west was choked with smoke the fires were far distant but the wind carried the scent of them and dropped flakes of ash from the heavens the irrigation channels were completely dry their beds cracked in several spots across the landscape figures moved singly or in small groups they looked more like scavengers than workers perhaps they had been workers corinn thought but could do nothing but scavenge now the queen took this all in from the earthen embankment that paralleled bocoums southern battlements she was on horseback with aaden at her side both of them largely silent as a contingent of bocoums wealthy estate owners buzzed around them each one of these rich men claimed to have suffered more than the others they detailed the withering of crops the irrigation and replanting measures they took to adapt the worsening situation the bleak possibilities they even admitted to praying to the giver and allowing their laborers to call on whatever regional deities they might win favor with a few had taken to sacrificing pigeons chickens even goats none of it had helped and the merchants feared the laborers might take even more desperate measures soon we know the giver forgives but so far he has ignored us said elder anath he sat on his horse with straightbacked grace his bright red robes vibrant against his dark skin he was the head of the main branch of the anath clan the second most powerful of the citys merchant families it showed in the easy grace of his carriage talayans were not natural horsemen so his ease in the saddle was a product of his class or he punishes us sinper ou offered wryly some have grown too rich perhaps for his liking elder anath turned to see who had spoken he studied him a moment and smiled seemingly content that the man meant to slight him but had not managed it one can never grow too rich the ous have proved this can a lions mane be too full never but queen corinn even my fortunenot to mention ousis shriveling under these empty skies corinn knew these men were competitors but she always suspected much of their repartee was a show for her benefit they were both rich they both had married among each others families they both had all the rewards of royalty with none of the responsibilities she spoke crisply as if the scene before her did not affect her at all the giver abandoned us long ago he neither rewards nor punishes thats for me to do come lead me to the heart well you spoke of i will speak with the prince as we ride with that the merchants knew she wished them out of earshot they started offeven elder anath deferring without a wordalong the embankment their assistants and advisers with them the tall sandstone walls and towers of bocoum dwarfed them to one side stark contrast to the flat desolation on the other corinn let them ride well away before touching her mare on the neck and urging her forward a contingent of numrek followed them bare chested and proud their swords in prominent sheaths some with axes in hand they did not ride since horses were nervous around them and their rhinoceros mounts were suited only for warfare their long strides easily kept them in position though corinn had grown as used to them as she was to any servants they were simply a part of her life what do you think of all this corinn indicated the ruined fields with her chin aaden wrinkled his lips it really wasnt like this before no you heard how they described it at dinner last night they exaggerate but these farmlands are what made bocoum the city it is their crops fed mouths all around the empire there was a time you could have ridden south from the city for four days before leaving cultivated lands acacias power came as much from talays crops as from anything else an army can bring death but a farmer can give life fortunately people fear one more than they acknowledge the other why did it change i dont know corinn answered i dont know she repeated the answer for no reason other than that it felt good to admit it she could do so only with aaden for he had always asked her questions that she could not answer why are eggs egg shaped why are sand dunes like ocean waves where does wood go when it burns how does the givers tongue work nobody else of course asked her questions like that and she loved him for it glancing at him she said ill have to fix it though how will you will you use yes its time the world sees some of what i can do the boy considered this a moment his lips pursed and his expression older than his eight years he eventually answered with a curt nod his gesture of approval the merchants turned off the main thoroughfare and descended a ramp to a southrunning road closer to ground level but still elevated enough to provide a vantage they worked their way farther from the city riding on roads and sometimes in the empty irrigation canals the slow rain of falling ash gave the place a surreal hellish aspect it was a wonder that anything had ever grown here all of this because of the lack of something so simple water corinn could still scarcely believe it in calfa ven where she spent as much time as she could showers appeared out of cloudless skies the rivers bubbled with water floods were the concern not drought and a good thing too for it was the bounty of that place that had sparked the idea that led her here this afternoon that and dariels charitable work and of course her study of the song nothing was more central to her life now than the study of the givers tongue from the first moment she held the song of elenet in her hands on the day that thaddeus clegg had brought it to her as a blood gift she had been changed it had awakened strength within her cunning that she had always had but had never used determination that she knew lay within her but that she spent a lifetime shying away from it was because of the book that she was able to ally with the league the numrek rialus neptosall of whom she had needed to destroy hanish mein and the song had promised her that more much more was to come at night with her servants dismissed and her doors barred she had opened the book and fallen again and again into the moving languid words that were not words it was a wonder every time and for the first few years it had been enough just to see the words come alive and to hear them inside her head when they gave her permission to open her mouth and let them out she had discovered new joy like nothing she had known before joy as complete as the moment aaden had slipped free of her and been laid on her chest aaden was part of the song in a way only he had ever witnessed her singing she had called up small things for him glass beads and smooth stones at first gourds that made rattles simple toys and then insects butterflies redbreasted birds and tiny ringnecked snakes the things she had brought to life were but trinkets she knew but singing them into existence exhausted and sometimes frightened her that last creation had been strangely benignly terrifying when her voice faded that afternoon in her chambers on acacia the swirling of sound and shimmering light that had gathered around the object finally dissipated and there it was the thing she had spun out of words a thing that nobody had ever seen before as aaden had requested the two of them had stared at it in silence it was a furry creature the size of a sixmonthold child but it did not have legs or arms it had a trunk but the bulk of it was a head of sorts vaguely feline with no sign of ears no whiskers its fur was so fine it swayed in waves at even the slightest motion changing color as it did so as if each strand had within it yellows and reds and blues and every shade in between for all this its eyes were its most distinct feature they were completely round and when it blinked some sort of lid passed from one side of the eye to the other and then back again a few moments later with each blink it seemed more and more sentient as if it understood something new about them each time that membrane slid from one side to the other the mother and son stood watching the creature for just a few short moments the entire time it watched them as well cocking its head and looking from one to the other waiting when corinn began the song to unmake it she was sure she saw something like disappointment in the creatures eyes but that may have just been the spell for within a few breaths the invisible ribbons of sound moved around it slipping over and through its form and rubbing it from existence aadens voice had seemed inordinately loud when it broke the silence after the unmaking why can we never show anyone because such things are only for you and me to see this is our great secret remember no one else knows no one else can know in the song is all the power we will ever need the knowledge of creation and destruction in the song is power that the world has not truly seen in uncorrupted glory in twentytwo generations its my power mine alone but it will be yours in times to come they were far out into the fields when they again drew up to the contingent of talayan merchants the city was a prominent but distant barricade to the north heat shimmered around them blurring objects even at middle distances they had stopped at the edge of a massive square basin it was elevated above the plains around it hemmed in by thick earthen walls and carved down into the earth there were gates at each of the four sides with plates that could be raised and lowered beyond the gates irrigation channels stretched off in each direction it was meant to hold a great body of water but like the landscape all around it it was completely dry one of the engineersseveral had met the group along with a few laborers even some children who stood at a slight distance nearly naked and silentexplained that a deep spring had once fed the tank she could see the hole in the center of the square it had been a steady source of water for hundreds of years there were a few others like it throughout the fields but those had run dry much earlier corinn asked water from this tank can be distributed throughout the entire irrigation system the engineer began to say that it had never done that but corinn cut him off could water from this tank be distributed throughout the entire system i asked to be brought to a tank that was central to everything is this it as near as there is to that yes the engineer said some channels would have to be modified perhaps embankments reorganized the man looked to his companions for help they offered none i am not sure your majesty what you you have answered me corinn said she slipped down from the saddle and touched the ground she looked immediately composed her creamcolored trousersdeceptively cut to look like a dressas unwrinkled as when she began the ride she bent and plucked a pebble from the ground studied it and then enfolded it in her palm ill have you all wait for me here no one is to approach me while im in the tank no matter what happens understand she was answered first with silence and then with a quick barrage of halfformed questions she cut through them glancing up at her son as she did so aaden that means you numrek you stay here as well ill be back in a moment with that she stepped over the rim and began a careful descent into the tank she had to catch herself from falling several times slamming her palm down against the coarse earth as her feet slipped careful to keep the pebble trapped in her other hand it was a deeper pit than she had realized on reaching the bottom she glanced up at the figures gathered at the rim they seemed very far away aaden raised his arm to wave at her she turned and walked on again it took her longer than she expected to reach the center of the tank she felt the mens eyes on her the entire time the heart spring was a scar in the ground just wide enough that she could have leaped into it and fallen to its depths it was simply a hole with jagged edges that quickly faded to shadow looking at it corinn had the momentary feeling that it was the puckered maw of some wormlike creature stuck fast in the rockhard soil begging for moisture she moved up close to it planted her feet and sang she opened her mouth and exhaled the first words that came to her mind it was as if the song had been in the air already and she had joined it midflow the moment she began she knew the right words the correct notes and the tempo and rhythm and duration and inflection at precisely the moment it came into and left her mouth she did not remember what she had sung once it was past nor did she anticipate what she was going to sing there was no linear progression she was not following the notes or words as written on a page she was the song changing with it each moment and the song was beautiful she knew it was she knew that nothing else since the worlds creation had captured beauty so perfectly in sound she felt her body pulled and swayed with the ribbons of god talk that eddied around her they caressed her tugged at her pulled away bits of her being and floated them on the air and returned them to her changed while she did not control the song she did infuse it with her intentions she explainedusing the words that came to her unbiddenwhat she wished what she asked for what she needed she sang this into the song and she could feel understanding between her and the swirling music grow at the point that she felt the impulse to she lifted her arm opened her hand and let the pebble fall into the well singing the entire time a breath of heated air surged up from the well as if the worm creature were coughing itself to life corinn took a half step back steadied herself and sang through it without faltering a few moments later the well sputtered gurgled coughed again she felt a spray of vapor rise out of it and evaporate instantly in the sun she sang on the water when it finally bubbled out of the hole was thick with soil it seeped into the thirsty ground for a few moments it seemed as if the lip of the hole would drink it all but soon the water began to roll forward carrying dirt and ash before it a stain on the ground that the watchers must have seen clearly it flowed in all directions corinn felt it touch her toes and grab at the hem of her trouser skirt she kept singing she heard the merchants exclaiming up on the rim a numrek shouted her name but she kept singing the water began to gush it surged a few feet into the air it splashed the front of her dress and reached up over her ankles buffeting her feet she sang on not feeling where the end of the song might be she vaguely thought that she might not be able to stop she might be here still with her mouth open when the water poured inside her and she filled with it this was not a frightening thought nothing was frightening when the song was in her there was nothing nothing nothing to fear and then she stopped just like that her lips paused and nothing more came through them and she knew she was finished the water continued to flow growing even stronger she stepped back from it awednow that she could see her work with clear eyesat the wonder of water in this place she could taste it in the air the tang of it was sharp and cold as if she were standing beside a mountain stream a rising mountain stream she turned around and waded toward the merchants with all the grace she could manage she was panting hard as she reached the rim but she did not give them time to study her back away from the edge she commanded back away drop to your knees and bow the men looked startled scared even but one after another did as she commanded several had to dismount but they did so quickly soon the entire company around hermerchants nobles laborers and the ragged childrenpressed their knees to the ground waiting jittery caught between obeying her and their desire to watch the water rise the numrek contingent stood straight backed their weapons in hand looking as if they were ready to attack the merchants slaughtering them not today corinn thought she stood gathering her breath holding the moment using it aaden still sat on his horse she glanced at him long enough to smile away his concern in a gesture meant only for him she rolled her eyes as if acknowledging the silliness of it all the gesture almost knocked her off balance she indicated that he should dismount and stand beside her then she turned her attention to the bowed heads are you true to me corinn asked of course elder anath said why you are our queen are you the only one who thinks so the others spoke then praising her talking over one another some bending forward like worshippers it was what she wanted but the sight of them annoyed her also they were scared now cowards do not ask how i have done this thing but see that it was i alone who did it tell the truth when you speak of this the water will rise and rise and never stop as long as this is my wish it will fill the tank and will replenish itself as you open the gates and feed the fields this heart spring belongs to all bocoum dont let me learn that any of you have called it your own or deprived others of it you may look up now corinns gaze moved from one person to the next pausing at each one speaking to them allold and young rich and poorwith the same authority before there might have been much to read in the hidden thoughts and emotions behind the various faces now though they all looked the same sinper ou shared the same slackmouthed expression as the boy standing a little distance behind him elder anath had a face of wet clay upon which she could write what she wished i am not just the mother of this child i am the mother of acacia say that say that i am the mother of acacia you are the mother of acacia they intoned raggedly in different volumes and pitches of voices say that i am the mother of the empire the kneeling group did and remember to pray each day for my health for should i die this spring will as well betray me corinn said and your world will dry shrivel and burst into flames beneath my sun this water that i giveshe motioned to the rising body behind heri can take away so say i and my son as hard as it was to do she raised aadens arm with hers for a few moments longer her eyes moved from person to person until she was sure that she had made eye contact with them all then she smiled and said soft voiced thats the truth but we are friends here arent we do not think me angry i just enjoy speaking the truth now drink of this water friends it will not cease flowing never grow your crops and spread word of the gift i have given bocoum i am your queen and i give this to you as the merchants rose and moved toward her she had to speak over their adulation to announce that she would return to the city now without the merchant escort though they fawned around her until she moved away it was clear they did not care they rushed toward the edge of the bubbling tank as soon as she turned her back to them on her horse again she rode without looking back aaden did though what are they doing she asked the boy laughed theyre acting like children they are dancing shouting and hugging each other i didnt know you were going to do that you did magic mother and everyone saw he laughed again and corinn knew the child in him would have liked to have joined them to share their giddy enthusiasm maybe even to jump in and swim she needed him though she could not fall from the saddle if she did the numrek would carry her back to the city but that wouldnt do she began to reach out to touch him but just lifting her hand from the pommel made her feel she might fall she returned it gripping hard and trying to find the swaying balance she needed it would not be easy but she knew she could do it if she kept her focus for that reason she rode in silence for several minutes aaden ride close to me watch me carefully why serious now the prince drew up near her doing such a thing as that tires me very much i need you beside me c hapter f ifteen if the tales were to be believed she faced a winged monster a dragon a lizard thing of such massive proportions that the beating of its wings snapped trees and blew roofs off houses and sent unfortunate people swirling into the air it swooped down and grasped cattle two and three at a time flying loops in the air and tossing its prey like a playful cat it swallowed cattle whole in midnight its jaws and neck convulsed with the grotesque gluttony of a river crocodile one farmhouse was destroyed when the thing landed atop it plunging its claws to snatch at the inhabitants within high up the southern basin entire herds of goats and their minders had disappeared it had been spotted as far away as tabith which was grave news indeed if it could travel that far it might soon discover bocoum and the bounty of human life all around the inner sea including the isle of acacia itself while mena had focused her attentions on the tenten creature and on the scourge of the halaly lake small bands of talayan runners had narrowed in on the new creatures lair they compared one sighting with the next slowly piecing together when it was on an outbound journey from its lair it had not been easy to track its movements the thing was aloft and it could travel much faster than a person could run still they managed it and because of their work mena was awakened one morning to the news that it had landed a mile away from her new camp she was up and jogging the distance with her officers immediately melio and the rest of her force followed bearing with them the tools they would need and traveling with stealth they were in a shallow dale west of umae in a land that benefited from the moisture that evaporated from the great lake blew north on the winds and then settled nightly to condense among the orchards and pastures that distinguished the country the marching was easy the cover good the talayan trackers aided by local farmers and herders moved them along in the shade of trees using the lees of hills and the shelter of brushbanked streams in no time at all mena approached the last group of spotters men and boys with their fingers to their full lips they indicated with gestures that they were near the top of a hill another few paces and she should crawl the last few feet and look over the edge she did as they advised awkwardly with her sword at her side and a waist pack of supplies nestled against the small of her back she ended elbow to elbow with a herd boy on one side of her and a talayan tracker on the other look carefully and you will see it the talayan said all she saw at first was a wide vale filled with short rounded evenly spaced trees a stream traced a meandering line through the center of it and here and there she could tell the vegetation had been managed lanes left open ponds dug as water catchments it took her a moment to spot any movement among the tranquillity of the scene but then a serpentine head moved between two trees it was there for a second and then gone and so far away on the other slope of the vale that she was not sure of what she had seen squinting mena followed it and was looking in the right spot to see its head rise above the crown of one tree cock to the side and with gingerly precision nip at the foliage and then it was hidden again something about what she had just seen sent tingles over her flesh there was fear in the reaction but a hint of something else also what are those trees she asked how tall are they the local boy whispered an answer in talayan two words that mena repeated she was quite fluent in the language but she was constantly being thrown by the talayan tendency to name things through descriptive use of other words blood heart she asked the tracker lying on the other side of her cupped his hand to her ear you dont call it blood heart its orange in your language but orange with red inside the trees are two men in height some a little more whats it doing here is its lair near here he creased his darkskinned forehead no i dont think so it just landed here we did not expect it just a coincidence huh mena muttered she squirmed forward a few more inches and looked back at the orchard when she spotted the creature again it was somewhat closer it stepped into a lane and paused raking its head from side to side and then freezing it was lean and light on its four feet in that position it must have been no more than a persons height but that changed when it reared up on its back legs and took in the orchardagain going still as a statuefrom a higher vantage she could see the reptile in it it was there in the sinuous lines of its neck and the blue patches along its back and in the long whiplike expanse of its tail it was she thought akin to the sand lizards that lived right in the huts of talayan villagers its eyes were shaped just like those of the harmless creatures they were larger by many times but their size did not completely obscure their origins she had once thought them curious eyes innocent fearful and yet full of mischief there was an avian quality to the creature as well flares around its neck that seemed like feathers a crest on its forehead that snapped forward and back with a mind of its own like the plumage a peacock displayed when it bobbed its head the motion was comical like both the tiny lizard it reminded her of and the motion of birds it moved into the trees again hunting the juiciest oranges apparently moments later down away from the hill mena tonguelashed the trackers for the absurdity of what she had just seen does it not seem strange that the scourge of talay dines on fruit that thing is the great dragon people have been speaking of the group of men and boys stirred uneasily it eats the fruit of trees and walks around bobbing its head as if to a tune its as dangerous as a hen is that truly the thing we hunt look me in the face and tell me thats the last of the great foulthings eventually several affirmed that it was what they hunted when mena pressed them as to whether that exact creature was the one they had seen time and again over the last few weeks they admitted it was when she asked them why they had not corrected the rumors about its size and ferociousness they let a long silence sit before a man answered that it was still dangerous it was much fiercer than it looked they had seen it in flight and it flies without wings she snapped i saw no wings did you has anyone here fought it have any of you seen it take cattle squash homes terrorize villages when none of them could explain the discrepancy she turned from them and walked away a few paces exasperated melio followed her almost laughing but she hissed this is a farce do they know how weve prepared all the precautions the worry weve lived withall because of a giant sand lizard i should have known dragons have never lived and never will whats happened to our reason well melio said smirking you know i did hear about a group of young men caught poaching near the southern basin might be that poachers people have been poaching while we risk our lives to protect them melio shrugged somebody will always take advantage mena on the day that anything happens in the world without somebody finding a way to cheat a profit out of it ill dance a jig naked before any who will come and watch dont sell tickets though i doubt ill ever be called to make such a show leaning toward him mena exhaled a long fatigued breath she slipped one hand up around his side feeling the flare of his back muscles okay she said that lizard is our last monster its no dragon but we still must do something with it do we toss fruit at it or kill it perhaps we could walk up and put a leash around its neck melio returned her embrace youre funny princess some peoplenot you of course but some sane peoplewould view this as a boon think about it you woke up this morning ready to risk your life battling a terrifying beast instead weve been given a gift its all but over mena we can leave here and get on with our lives i for one will be very happy to go home and warm your bed for weeks on end i hope youll join me think of it we can go home and then you can stop taking those herbs youll do that yes stop and be fertile again ill plant a child in you and dont mena said softly dont talk about that now and we can live our lives he completed why not now now is exactly the time to remember it i have loved you since the afternoon i saw you striding along the dock in vumu bare chested and all a priestess of maeben i loved you then and i love you now you are angry youre not going to die today put that aside mena lets go finish this and then go home the preparations took very little time her officers had been readying the men and supplies from the first news of the sighting by the time mena confirmed they were to proceed the troops were arriving weapons in hand not wanting missiles to end up zinging willynilly through the orchard if the creature bolted she chose her twenty best crossbowmen and explained to them a variation on the original plan she sent the trackers and extra soldiers to ring the entire vale to keep the creature hemmed in with the main group she followed a contingent of excited local boys who led them through a hidden wash and in toward the center of the orchard low enough to remain unseen by the creature they crept with increasing stealth which was no easy task considering the way they were encumbered the bowmen walked with their weapons pointed toward the sky each of them connected by a cord that ran from the bolt and into coils held in their seconds palms the line did not stop there but trailed farther to a third and sometimes fourth assistant these men carried stones cradled to their chests a few had them in slings over their backs some of the rocks were large enough that two men strained to carry them waddling together their muscles taut and brows dripping with sweat each of these stones had a hole through it it was this to which the cords from the bows were secured mena kept them all in a tight group close enough that she could communicate with gestures a raised palm a clenched fist just enough of a beckoning motion with her fingers to move them forward on silent feet when they reached the final rise that separated them from the grove the creature was feeding in she made eye contact with them all touched a finger to her lips and then turned and led them forward she drew her sword carefully as she did she moved into the ordered rows of orange trees smelling the tang of them the sickly ripeness of the split fruit that dotted the ground her hand snapped up without looking she heard the group behind her pause not so much a sound but the sudden absence of whatever sound had been there before to indicate them she had spotted the foulthing it was but fifty yards away on the hillside facing them it moved casually through the trees its long neck curving selectively among the branches and leaves its back was to them mena waved her fingers in the air and the group moved again more stealthily now than ever as they got nearer mena had the hunting party fan out to either side she slowed the center and let the flanks swing forward making the group a crescent that half surrounded the foulthing she knew they could not hope to get much closer but she moved on light feet thankful for every inch gained she could now see that the creature was feathered a close tight coating that revealed the muscled contours and bone structure beneath a slick sheen of light plumage without really realizing she was doing it mena drew to a halt staring curious now instead of angry or excited or frightened the creature had knobby formations high on its back and an indication of violet crest feathers running up its long neck despite these avian features it was equally reptilian its body stretched long and lizardlike with a tail that tapered to a thin point for the first time mena realized she did not feel the stomachturning nausea the other foulthings had always invoked she suddenly wanted to watch this one to study it to call back the slowcreeping crossbowmen and reconsider she did not get to in the end it was not sound that gave them away it was the breeze it shifted mena felt it happen felt a playful arm of the wind reach out and swipe at them and pull their scent and sprinkle it over the creature the others must have sensed it too they stood frozen breathing hushed eyes wide the beast stopped feeding its head sank a few feet and then it lifted its snout and inhaled through a few silent nostril flares without moving its body it turned its head around and looked over the ridgeline of its back its neck as supple as a snake it saw them mena knew it saw them both because it looked right at them and because its eyes grew larger they were near enough mena decided she lifted her hand to signal the crossbowmen but realized they might not see her as focused as they were on the lizard bird they might not see her but the creature did its gaze snapped to her met hers and held her with an intensity that was both animal savage and intelligent again mena wished she could back away she could not have said exactly why this was a foulthing it was unnatural it was a threat that did not belong in the world before each time she had looked into one of these mutated beasts eyes she had seen a perverted malevolence that had to be extinguished that was not what was looking at her now she needed time to the creature responding to the motion of several of the crossbowmen who were setting up to take aim spun around its mouth fell open hissing and the plumes along its neck bristled forward framing its head in a violet feathered mane the creature shook its torso savagely stepping forward as it did so the knobs on its back cracked away and unfurled to either side the motion was so rapid and dramatic that it sucked the words of command out of menas mouth wings it did have wings they rolled out as if the bones were joints of a curled whip unfurling each short length of bone snapped into place with an audible cracking and popping it took only a second or two but in that time the creature was completely transformed its wings stretched out above the tree height enormous and delicate at the same time the wing bones were finger thin a skeletal frame that supported a membrane so diaphanous that mena could see the world through it it leaped into the air shoot mena found her voice again stop it from escaping shoot it now crossbow bolts flew up after it cords trailing behind several missed a few snagged in the trees one punched through the creatures wing membrane two slammed into its belly one sank deep into the flesh of its thigh another nicked its neck the creature lost its upward momentum it hovered for a moment a confused target into which another bolt sank home the creature arched against the pain its mouth gaped as if it were roaring but no sound came out it slammed its wings down with force enough to snap branches and send oranges raining down the one stroke lifted it up pulling the lines secured to it the ropes snapped taut yanking the stones from the ground the anchors crashed through branches and bounced off tree trunks one knocked a soldier from his feet another smashed an arm that had been upraised against it mena yelled for them to fall back but most were already diving for cover running down the hill hiding behind trees and in hollows to wait for the rock anchors to pull the beast down that had been the plan to weight the animal with so many stones that it could not fly or could not fly far they could then kill it at leisure safely when she thought it wingless mena had modified the plan thinking a less numerous team could get close enough and then essentially capture it the same way for a few moments during the wingflapping chaos mena thought the plan was working but with each wingbeat the creature seemed to gain strength and resolve it strained against the ropes yanking them through the branches it would soon clear the trees she shouted for more bolts to be shot but the crossbowmen were struggling to reload while keeping their eyes upon the moving beast she would have taken a shot herself if she had a bow something else caught her eye the creatures tail hung near the ground it snapped and curled and stretched beneath the flying form like a living rope looking for a hand to grab it so thats what mena did she walked forward and grasped it in a clenched fist she did not exactly plan to it was so near so easy to do she did not think but some part of her imagined she might hold the creature down the narrow tip of the tail curled around her wrist almost playfully as if it had a mind of its own and would tickle her she noticed this even amid the motion even though it lasted only a few seconds thats all the time she had before she was yanked into the air she knew thenas the earth fell away beneath her churning legsthat neither the stones nor her body weight was nearly enough to keep the creature earthbound it soared upward taking her with it c hapter s ixteen the messenger sent by sangae umae had surprised kelis every day since they began their overland journey together naamen had dashed out of the camp in halaly at a pace that kelis was sure he would not be able to hold for long but he had kelis had thought himself still in his prime but midway through his first day he had cause to doubt it the older man kept abreast of the younger only by digging deep into his running memory finding the rhythm and searching for the quiet meditative space that he had tapped to help him through his longest runs like the one he took at alivers side in search of the santoth while aliver had been largely a silent companion naamen was inclined to chatter he made observations on the landscape talked of random memories asked questions and then seemed content to answer them himself it had frustrated kelis at first he suspected that the adolescent was purposefully trying to distract him and to demonstrate that the work did not even wind him but by the third or fourth day naamens voice had become a feature of the journey inseparable from the pounding of their feet and swing of their arms and the slow unfurling of the land through which they kicked their dusty progress outside the halaly lake region the plains baked beneath a dry sun that oppressed the land as if the heat were a heavy blanket pressing down on the world umae which they passed near had always been arid but such heat was unusual this early in the season across the flat stretch of land to denben they found water only in a few wells the rivers like dry scars cut in the earth by some meandering knife along the busy route between denben and bocoum it was easier to forget the plains especially as the roads often took them within sight of the inner sea still kelis knew that things were not right in his homeland the foulthings were one sign of it but not the only one naamen was just as adept among the urban bustle of bocoum as he was running across open expanses kelis followed the young man as he slipped through the crowd with the fluidity of an eel through a coral reef the city sprawling along the coastline for buttressed miles was technically the seat of government control of the province of talay although with the regions tribal variation any central control was loose more fundamentally it was the agricultural and commercial hub of talay it thronged with merchants and traders and craftsmen with foodstuffs warehouses and luxurious estates none of these things interested kelis he did not really feel at home hemmed in by walls and buildings and crowds and considered the flaunted wealth of the townsfolk to be obscenely extravagant in the past he had always breezed through the city engaged in some errand or another he did not intend this trip to be any different here it is naamen said motioning with his stunted arm it took kelis a moment to sort out what he meant they had come up one of the high streets of the city center a busy corridor lined with multistoried buildings working their way forward kelis picked out the carved image of a lion on a crest above the gatehouse entrance at the end of the lane it was the ou lion it was hardly an original totem animal but it was distinctive in that the figure stood upright on a body that looked more human than feline the head however was massively maned the cats mouth opened in an everlasting roar it could have been a secondary entrance to an acacian palace such was the grandeur of the carved granite archway two guards stood at attention at either side long pikes set on the ground before them and stretching to spear points well above their heads you would think they were royalty kelis murmured naamen turned and set his mirthful eyes on him oh yes and believe me the ous do think themselves royalty you need not bow before them though not yet at least the guards held them outside the gate for several minutes until a secretary met them he curtly dismissed naamen then led kelis through the elaborate interior gardens around pools of fish and under palms between rows of flowering bushes inside the main building the extravagance continued for keliswho had spent most of the last several years in camps sleeping on mats with bare ground beneath himthe tapestryhung walls the incenseheavy air the rich carpet underfoot and the dark crimson and gold of so much of the furniture closed in on him like some elaborate trap he had to breathe deeply to disguise his racing heartbeat and his desire to run away the secretary left him in a room filled with couches and ornate chairs directing him to sit and relax kelis eyed a couch draped with zebra skins he did not sit instead he moved out onto the balcony and sucked in the salttinged air the inner sea stretched out to the horizon the green waters dotted with sailing vessels of all sizes and shapes in the distance great trading barges sat on the water looking like oddly geometric islands leaning on the railing kelis took in the sweep of the harbor below the coastline crowded with rank upon rank of whiteroofed buildings the structures were built so tightly together they looked like a throng jostling to tilt themselves into the mirror that was the sea how many people lived in this city kelis had no idea likely the number would mean little to him anyway how very different it was from a village like umae where he could name every adult and every child could name him that was the size of community that felt right to him he wondered again why sangae had summoned him here the harbor of bocoum on a summers day a mans voice said startling kelis he turned and saw a man of about his age richly dressed in an anklelength blue robe approaching him it is magnificent dont you think yes kelis said it was not exactly a lie but close good the man smiled his face was handsome and broad featured in the way of northern talayans he was as tall as kelis lean as well although somewhat more bulkily muscled around the chest and shoulders he was not a runner he was fit in a different way and carried himself with confident grace seeming to remember formality all at once he bowed his cleanshaven head he said new friend the sun shines on you but the water is sweet the water is cool new friend and clear to look upon kelis answered the words came to his lips automatically it would be nice if these words were true wouldnt it sometimes i fear our greetings have mostly to do with what we wish the world was and little to do with how it actually is considering the luxury of the building they were in kelis wondered what this man had to complain about i am ioma sinper ou is my father in his name i welcome you kelis of umae my father and sangae will be here shortly along with the one we would have you meet he gestured toward the tray a servant had just laid on a small table please drink the clear glass pitcher contained a chilled juice frozen enough that it clunked as the servant poured some into a glass kelis held the tumbler in his hand watching the vapor rise off it he had no idea how they managed to cool it so nor did he wish to ask he touched it to his lips and sipped it was too cold unnaturally so it is a wonderful view isnt it ioma asked our ancestors looked out upon this harbor for generations before the acacians planted their first fort on acacia whether or not acacia chooses to remember this fully is another matter but we should not forget thats even more important now see over there the merchant extended his robed arm and pointed it only took kelis a moment to pick out the structures he was indicating lower down the cliffs near the eastern rim of the bay was a conglomeration of large richly painted buildings with garish spires like plump sparkling red bulbs of garlic the kings academy ioma said the official name with disgust should be called the queens institute for the forgetting you dont care for it then ioma nudged him in the shoulder it was an act of familiarity that would have seemed rude had his host not made it so casually do not joke with me friend you know the purpose of that place its not education at all its limitation they say they pick the brightest students from each of the provinces so why is it that those brightest students always happen to be children of prominent families why do the children get selected even when the parents have not offered them for consideration i know you serve the akarans i dont wish to make an enemy of you he paused as if considering how at risk of that he was and then shrugged and went on but youre talayan as well that place is a hostage camp first and foremost those children are hostages second their minds are scrubbed clean of the truth and filled with the history of the world as corinn wishes them to know it two of my nephews and a niece attend a cousin also they tell me all about it at least its here in bocoum thats something my family members are hostages only during the day at night we are free to uneducate them kelis did not say anything a fact ioma acknowledged by pursing his lips perhaps i speak too freely you see kelis i feel already i know you but i see that i am not as well known tooh here they are now prepare yourself for a surprise my friend three figures approached them through the maze of furniture that cluttered the room sangae had been an old man for most of keliss life but he wore his age like an unchanging garment he was still a slim mana great runner in his time his simple garment wrapped his torso and was slung over one of his shoulders sangae embraced him it has been too long my son yes father but the giver is kind kelis responded sangae was not actually his father but in the village of umae the terms son and father had always been used liberally the other man was clearly iomas father sinper they had the same facial structure and physique the older man wore his hair cropped short around the ears but it bloomed fuller on top dusted with gray sinper was cordial in greeting him though he did so with his chin raised and eyes heavy lidded in a manner that made it clear he expected kelis to offer him the deference usually reserved for chieftains looking over his shoulder as the old man gripped him kelis saw that a woman had followed the two men seeing her stirred something in him there were things in her face that he remembered the wide smooth forehead the large eyes separated by the gentle bridge of her nose her lips full and shapely held in the pucker that was traditional for talayan women in formal situations part of it as well was that her beauty reminded him of an emotion envy it was that emotion that marked his realization of who she was benabe one of the many young women who had pursued aliver as he grew into a man benabe kelis said the moon hides in your eyes no she said that is the sun in yours which simply reflects in mine the greeting completed ioma took kelis by the arm and led him to a couch they all sat sipping the chilled drink as servants set a table with small bowls of pickled cabbage and tiny squids fish eggs on triangles of hard bread for a while they chatted with no particular direction to the conversation this was normal enough really but kelis could barely contain his curiosity he half wondered if he would have to wait until he was alone to find out and he more than half wondered if the young woman so quiet as the men spoke had some role in whatever had brought him here sinper asked kelis about his battles with the foulthings he seemed honestly interested in the beasts but also in mena akaran was she really as fierce in battle as they say was it true that she had killed a manyeyed lion beast with her own sword could she truly keep pace with talayan runners when on the hunt kelis answered with plainspoken honesty each time so you admire her sinper asked there is much to admire and what of her sister ioma asked queen corinn kelis said i do not know that well ioma grinned she doesnt run barefoot beside our men does she no kelis acknowledged ioma sat back that would be something to see i would pay silver to watch our queen run a footrace she would have to leave her fine dresses at home but i wouldnt mind that either the comment was made lightly but for a moment afterward nobody spoke sinper looked sourly at his son but then seemed to accept that a topic of some import had been reached even if awkwardly so he cleared his throat we are not here for idle chatter you know that nor will we lower ourselves with base jokes about the queen he slanted his eyes at ioma who looked away contrite as a boy for a few seconds at least no i will not trivialize her with such things in truth she is not trivial is she in truth she is a woman of power kelis nodded that fact hardly needed his confirmation sangae has told me that you have no fondness for her policies you see her as clearly as we do and you knowas we dothat she has betrayed talay she has betrayed all the people who followed aliver and defeated hanish mein you agree with all this dont you this time kelis did not nod but neither did he disagree the old man took this as affirmation why then do you serve her i am at peace with my heart i dont determine what the queen does i can only actor notas kelis that is what so you claim that you will only ever do noble work for her sinper asked the slow cadence of his voice becoming faster sharper what of when she asks something else of you how do you refuse how do you say no when you have so long been saying yes yes yes what would you have me do kelis snapped suddenly angry at the old man who was he to lecture and why did sangae allow it this is a world ruled by lions to the greatest lion goes the spoils goes everything that it demands right now corinn akaran is that lion lioness sinper corrected do you never doubt her ioma asked i live with doubt every day i as well sangae said softly drawing keliss eyes up to his do not think me a traitor to aliver because i doubt his sister the prince was a son to me you know that i raised him at his fathers request and i loved him as if his blood were mine sinper cut in but we do not speak of aliver not yet corinn is the one who concerns me she has broken our noble families and tries to poison the minds of our children against their parents she didnt stop the league from taking more of our children away her crimes or oversights are too numerous to name she gave us water yes but that is not enough and it was late in coming my worries about her have become as a tumor lodged in my breast any day it might grow to kill me i would cut it out but i dont have a knife sharp enough at least i did not have such a knife he dropped his voice at the end of the sentence leaving it frayed and incomplete ioma who had stood silent whispered into the pause it may be that we have found that knife kelis stared from him to sangae disbelieving his ears it was not that he disputed that corinns rule was flawed she had inherited a foul system from hanish mein who had taken it from her father who had perpetuated the crimes of the generations before him none of them seemed willing to break the old order of the world corinn perhaps was more like tinhadins daughter than leodans she might yet do great harm but why does this burn like treason in my ears he asked treason is a betrayal of ones accepted ruler ioma said but it is not treason to reject an usurper in truth it is a treason to accept a false rule once you know it is false sinper inched forward on his seat like an anxious youth he pointed at benabe kelis can you confirm that aliver was intimate with this woman you were his closest companion if they were intimate you surely nobody can confirm what another man does in his tent kelis said oh speak truth benabe said i remember quite a bit about what you didand with whom you did it we werent shy back then were we you know i lay with aliver many times benabe had always had a quick tongue she was as easy with anger as she was with laughter that ease was part of what had bothered him about herthat and the fact that aliver had found the same traits so alluring he heard himself say you werent the only one no but i did not keep track like you did if you can name another who was with him you can likewise name that i was with him kelis wiped at the heat that suddenly flushed through his face they would think him bitter jealous perhaps they would be right to think so he controlled his voice as he added i cannot know what happened between these two but if you ask me what i believe then yes they were lovers this seemed to satisfy sinper though he demonstrated that with an expression more like a grimace than a smile so we have a witness not that we needed one ioma said benabes testimony should not be questioned it will be though sangae said it will be benabe stared at kelis so intently that he had to meet her gaze thank you kelis i know you loved him too aliver knew it as well another flash of heat surged across keliss face fortunately his dark skin did not betray it yes aliver knew it but he didnt return itnot at least in the physical manner kelis would have welcomed he had always been careful not to betray the true nature of his feelings for aliver and he did not want to now he spoke as if he had not heard her a witness to what i still dont understand what this is about the others exchanged glances bring the child then sangae eventually said let him see her the child sangae nodded she is a beautiful child kelis she is hope for us all call her benabe and let her come on her two feet hope for all of us kelis felt his fingertips begin to tingle hope for all of us benabe rose and walked to the door at the other side of the room the four men sat in silence as she spoke to somebody in the hallway a few moments later she returned leading a girl of perhaps nine years of age the tingling in keliss fingers became a throb a heartbeat that moved to the center of his palms benabe said this is my daughter she named herself she likes us to call her shen the girl walked with her eyes downcast but as soon as she stopped before them she raised her head and looked candidly at the four men her face was round and gentle her mouth small with thinner lips than her mothers her skin was a rich brown but it had been stirred with a cream that lightened it she looked out at them with remarkably large eyes though she said not a word kelis could not help but think her quite intelligent her features were familiar they were benabes yes but that was only one way in which he knew them had known them since before he ever saw her before she was ever born there was no denying it the girl larashenshenwas aliver akarans daughter how could he have lived those years and not knownfelther living she named herself kelis asked benabe nodded but did not explain kelis umae the girl said her voice was clear and high and the two words on her tongue were neither a greeting nor a question just a statement youyou know me yes theyve told me about you you went as far as the river of the southern basin there you waited as good as your word these people told you that your mother sangae the stones told me she smiled and then lowered her gaze at moments looking no different than a shy girl stones he almost framed a question but let it fade the fine hairs on his forearms and the back of his neck were bristling the pulse in his palms was actually painful now he looked up at benabe who is this girls father you know that already benabe said she is a child of two nations ioma said look at her kelis she is our future she is a trembler but others have been so do not call her a trembler benabe snapped and then rubbed her fingers into the girls shoulders soothingly she has visions she has fits during which she falls on the ground shaking insensible but that is only what we see on the outside her mind goes to another placethat is why she trembles she says that in those moments the stones call her it is they that possess her body and seek to put things inside her you know what stones she speaks of did not aliver first see the santoth as stones he saw them rise and walk toward him my daughter sees the same sangae had moved closer to him leaning in as if he wanted to see her from the same vantage as kelis he whispered what did i tell you nobody told the girl that she told us of it just as she told us her name you ask who her father is but you can see who she is as clearly as i can what man would not recognize his brothers child thats who she is and we think she is in danger word of her could reach agents of the queen ioma said sinper was silent for a moment and then added not whispering this time we should talk of this privately and why does this matter to you kelis said his voice edged by the unease all this stirred into him again that was not one of the pressing questions he had but it was what came out it was ioma who answered because kelis benabe is of the family ou shen is my cousin isnt that right yes cousin the girl nodded she studied kelis a moment then stepped closer she reached out with one hand and touched her fingertips to his forearm i have to go i would like it if you would go with me it would be good that way they will keep me safe they promised so long as you take me benabe took the girl away after that nobody explained what the child was referring to and kelis for some time could not form the words to ask he moved through the rest of the meeting with an outward appearance of dazed indifference giving little indication of what he thought he knew they were talking vaguely understood the things they were saying but before he could engage with any of that he had to stare in the face the realization of what shens existence meant alivers child she was the heir to the acacian throne without a legitimate heir to take precedence rule could have gone to her to be passed down to her line not corinns she was only a girl but the eyes of the world would not see her as that she was enough to set the world at war again and he being witness to her had a role in whatever was to come what did she mean kelis asked breaking back into the conversation that had gone on without him about my going with her with her where oh sangae let out the word as a long breath i thought you would know right away to the santoth she says they are calling her to them c hapter s eventeen the way it happened was strange rialus thought he had lived through it watching the change in their fortune as it occurred but it was all so oddly muted it was sudden yesand dariel had made a fussbut for all that it was cordial as well it barely seemed possible that the civil interactions he and the prince had had with sire neen and the ishtat inspectorate had actually led to him and the prince becoming prisoners there was no other word for it chains manacles that strange bit shoved in the princes mouth and strapped tight they spent a long night together in a cramped cabin and the new morning found them propelled into motion with nothing explained ishtat guards escorted themwith shoves and prods and more threats than the situation called fordown and down into the belly of the ship eventually they emerged through a hatch in the hull near the water level a gangway descended to what appeared to be a floating platform it was already crowded with leaguemen and ishtat all of whom stood apparently waiting for them there were several other figures there numrek rialus had not seen them since the voyage began but he recognized calrach and his entourage of ten or so rialus walked down the gangway on careful feet and landed on the strange surface it was like an enormous slab of gray stone rectangular and smooth but otherwise featureless initially rialus thought they were to wait here for whatever vessel was going to ferry them to land despite the complete uncertainty of what they were heading toward he rather wished it would arrive he disliked the hulking enormity of the ship at his back so huge it could have squashed them if it shifted since he was thinking about that he nearly fell over when the platform beneath him moved the entire thing pulled away from the ambergris and slid toward the shore it was such a strange feeling for the gray slab did not so much float on the water as drive through it like a solid wedge unaffected by the swell of waves and tide you look perplexed prince sire neen said as do you neptos well you should be there are a great many things you dont know about the world even i am surprised by new things on occasion how to explain this to you sire neen searched for the words clicking his tongue he ostensibly spoke to the two acacians but he pitched his voice loud enough for the amused leaguemen around them to hear think about the ways that we harness the natural world he said wind billows against our sails and drives our ships forward we are familiar with that but its no less amazing we can sit in a cabin while the invisible wind drives us across the globe a thing we cant see cant touchthe air itselfcan do work that thousands of laborers couldnt accomplish we can harness the power of flowing water to grind grain or lift loads we can heat a cold room with fire have you never thought how strange that is why does wood burn why does it make heat what happens that turns the log into ash there are so many mysteries but the league has long pondered such questions and we have learned some answers but i speak of our own knowledge not of the lothan akluns magicwhich is what powers this vessel for centuries they told us nothing gave us nothing kept all their secrets to themselves several of the listening leaguemen grumbled at this recently though we had two occasions during which to extract some secrets from them when we negotiated a contract between them and hanish and when we struck new terms between them and your good sister they gave us a barge like this one even as they gave us these things they withheld the secrets of them we dont know how to make a vessel like this its sorcery but a very useful sorcery we will know their secrets soon of course since we can now explore their libraries and warehouses and records at will rialus could see that dariel wished to say something sire neen could too he smiled i know what you would say prince youd curse usthe leagueas treacherous devious beasts and youd be right in commerce its the bold who succeed the league is bold andim sure youre starting to seewe have succeeded incredibly isnt that right friends the leaguemen around them agreed a few of the ishtat guffawed rialus had never seen the company so chipper it was downright unnerving he itched to try speaking to sire neen again how to do so though what words to catch his interest he could think of nothing that the leagueman wouldnt squash before hed even finished his first sentence he knew more was coming more news more revelations likely more horrors he did know that dariel was no longer a person he wished to be too closely associated with he slid a step away from the prince as far as he could get before a guard jabbed him he set his eyes on the approaching shoreif shore it could be called there was no sign of actual earth or beach or other natural features it was a confusion of buildings that together made one continuous barrier several stories high it was undecorated pale hues of tan stone stained by the sea and by weather with few windows or anything else to indicate that the inhabitants could look out it was like the unadorned backs of buildings like warehouses viewed from a rarely trafficked alleyway look at those walls sire neen said our spies told of these but it was hard to credit them on one hand they spoke of the auldek being a military power that no longer fears anyoneneither in the other lands nor among the lothan aklunbut they swore they built massive walls to hide them from the sea i think i understand it better now having listened to the numrek howls theyd be howling right now another leagueman added if they werent so ecstatic about seeing ushen brae again it may simply be that the auldek fear the ocean fear it so much they believe they must hide behind a wall to be safe from it isnt that strange sire neen waited a moment and then turned to dariel all right prince hold your tongue keep your eyes open though theres going to be plenty to see but what of you rialus youve barely said a word all day rialus was surprised neen had noticed no he had not spoken for some time he almost felt his own mouth as stuffed as the princes filled with awed questions that bulged his cheeks as much as a mouthful of stones would have actually it was the fact that he had so many questions that kept him quiet the things his eyes took in the words he heard bantered about by sire neen and the others the long history of things he had believed to be and had expected always would be and was now being told were no longer all struck him dumb sire neen waved his fingers toward him almost flirtatiously say something speak speak ii rialus stammered i dont know where to begin im not surprised there is nothing harder for a mediocre mind to understand than the fact that the world is ever vulnerable to great change people like youand the prince herebelieve that the world is just is some things are there is an order you believe a pattern to things that you never imagine can be changed you only ever see portions of the way things are you are like a soldier on a battlefield you see what is before you you choose right or left and try desperately to stay alive thats you yes youll forever be surprised when you realize you have no control over your fate but the league stands atop a high ridge we look down and see the entirety of it with such a view the world is so much easier to navigate and to reshape there are risks yes surprises surely butlook weve reached our destination the structures that marked the shoreline were but a stones throw away the distance narrowing for a moment the leaguemans eyes scanned the dock and the heights of bare wall above it he looked every bit as transfixed by the sight as rialus felt the league is bold sire neen said musingly and to the bold goes the world all its riches all the power this will be a fine day c hapter e ighteen dariel kept trying to decide what to do he kept trying to take control to act to assert himself to say something but he also kept learning he could do nothing he could not speak with his mouth stuffed assert himself with his hands and legs bound act with the ishtat guards shouldering him on all sides or take control while sire neen so completely held the reins he had not felt this powerless since boyhood since the day his guardian had abandoned him in a brokendown shack in senival since that horrible time when everything he knew of the world had been stripped from him this felt the same the barge floated up to a slot in a stone abutment it slipped into place as if a part of it like a puzzle piece dariel was jostled by the ishtat tugged into motion he tripped on his ankle chains and would have fallen if the guards at his elbow had not held him upright he tried to spit the bit out of his mouth to push it with his tongue he would have yelled for the guards to stop just pause a moment and let him take in the world do him that kindness at least glancing back he noticed that calrach and the other numrek lingered on the barge staring up at the walls looking stunned they were off the barge and trudging toward a gate in the wall a contingent of others met them but dariel was not near enough to make them out in detail nor did he have much time to try soon they were all in motion walking through the gate and into the city they marched down wide stonepaved thoroughfares painted in different shades of green and blue stout buildings lined them they were only two or three stories tall but they were heavy looking thick with rounded contours and painted varying shades of red and orange and maroon here and there massive statues stood in the street forms thirty or so feet in height in postures of combat rage triumph they were strangely familiar looking although also totally bizarre they mixed human and animal forms a bears head on a mans body a standing lizard with two muscled human arms a bulbouseyed frog thing that stood on two legs with its chest inflated a horned vaguely feminine form twisted into an acrobatic posture bent over backward in a sensuous shape trapped in stone dariel was not the only one staring at the statues many an ishtat inspectorate soldier stared gape mouthed at them only the leaguemen managed to seem unimpressed they walked with their chins raised faces calm gestures as languorous as their pace allowed occasionally they spoke to one another in voices meant to be overheard meant to assure the group that they were in control see this new place with open eyes sire neen advised open eyes but not fearful ones it takes bold men to act boldlyand to receive the rewards we come as partners to the auldek they will be pleased dariel despite his hatred of the man found himself hungry to believe him beneath the statues the streets were as clean swept as any place in the high palace of acacia tidier by far than those of other cities like alecia and this citydariel realized he did not even know its namewas alive with inhabitants engaged in all manner of work for a time he only partially glimpsed them there were those tall figures among them but most were a more normal size a mixed population like that in any tradebased city he wanted to see faces to make eye contact and to see if he might convey a message to someone anyone who might help him but he was surrounded by the ishtat soldiers and they moved too swiftly it was not until they had turned onto a narrower street that he got a true glimpse of this citys residents his gaze came to rest on a shirtless mans back he was heavily muscled bulges that quivered as he heaved sacks into the back of a cart the first strange thing about him was the uniformly dark gray of his skin a greater shock came when the man turned to watch the passing strangers dariel drew back in horror momentarily jerking his ishtat handlers to a halt the mans face was barely a mans face at all instead of eyebrows he had knobby ridges long black whiskers ran along his jawline so stiff and straight they were like metal pins driven into the bone worse than that were the golden tusks that protruded from his jaw just beside the corners of his mouth they were thick and curved like a boars the man betrayed no indication that he considered himself a horror in fact his eyes fixed on dariels and studied him as if he were the oddity perhaps dariel was for the next few minutes of stumbling progress through the streets brought one bizarre person after another a woman whose face neck and arms were patterned like a leopards coat two boys with jetblack faces and white whiskers jutting from their cheeks a man whose arms and legs were striped like a zebras though his face was that of a normal man perhaps of candovian origins another man seemed to have a snake coiled around one arm starting at his palm and wrapping around the forearm bicep shoulder up his neck until the head came to rest on his cheek its tongue flicking out toward his eye dariel was near enough to see that the serpent was an elaborate tattoo dariels eyes shot around to take in others again and again he found more strange patterns and accoutrements every human person was tattooed pierced or altered he had seen some odd bodily decorations in his time as a sea island brigand but nothing like this they marched through a thronging outdoor food market the air carried a whirl of scents sweet mixed with peppery pungent enough to make his eyes water with an underpresence of death food stuffs both familiar and new crowded the rows of stalls monkeys hanging beside greenplumed birds next to fruit he had never seen before and live lizards hung by their tails and writhing one of the ishtat overturned a vat of some chunkfilled liquid the man jumped back from it retched at what he saw and hurried to rejoin the procession as one of the leaguemen called him an idiot and a bumbler though he tried to dariel could not get a glimpse of what the soldier had seen they moved on too quickly he was sure of so little and felt himself in a waking nightmare as if in a dream where he was compelled to specific actions and powerless to change course to stop look up or face the thing that pursued him he gasped and fought for breath as the group turned ascended a stone staircase and stepped into the great mouth that was a hall opening they carried on into it dariel stumbling even more in the dim interior when they finally stopped the prince nearly collapsed he sucked breaths in through his nose but seemed to lose the airs effect each time he exhaled his eyes slowly adjusted to the light bringing the dimensions of the chamber into perspective it was a grand rectangular space high ceilinged with squares cut into the roof through which shafts of light fell making a geometric confusion of light and dark standing on his toes to peer over the rows of ishtat around him dariel could see a great host in the shadowed areas hundreds of hulking shapes all the more menacing because he could not see them clearly dark forms they waited silent and menacing he blinked furiously to keep the sweat from blurring his vision sire neen and the other leaguemen stepped forward following the tall figures toward an illumed square between the two groups opposite them several figures came from the shade into the bright light they were similar to the numrek in their size and musculature they were garbed differently though in kneelength leather skirts and sandals with straps that laced up their calves most of them wore loose opennecked shirts that had a look of careful disarray an effect dariel had managed in his brigand days one of them stepped before the others he carried a curved long sword a horror of a blade that dariel doubted he would even be able to swing properly a gasp flew through the league contingent the ishtat archers behind sire neen snapped their free hands back and pinched their arrows ready to pluck them from their quivers the auldek registered them with a flick of his eyes he took a few more steps beyond his looselimbed strength and size there was nothing martial in his demeanor he paused studied the group a little longer and then stabbed the sword down into the stone it was a whipfast motion and he had stepped back from it before the archers could even decide if the gesture was a threat the sword swayed but stayed upright bare chested and powerfully muscled he planted his hands on his hips cocked his head and sniffed the air as he studied the leaguemen he had long wavy hair like the numreks but his was an auburn goldflecked shade that dariel had never seen on them he seemed in no rush to speak to the newcomers he turned and said something over his shoulder to the man there they both laughed as did several others who heard the comment the lead man looked back at sire neen and said something a quick barrage of guttural words to dariels surpriseand the auldekssire neen responded in kind he began a steady discourse punctuated with bows and gestures dariel could not understand a word of it spotting rialus a few guards away he squirmed toward him the ishtat guards barely noticed intent on the interaction before them nudging rialus with his shoulder dariel made sounds low in his throat to get his attention rialus looked at him dazed and seemingly surprised to find him so close dariel wrinkled his nose rolled his eyes about and gestured toward the sire neen and the auldek leader rialus seemed to have no idea what dariel was trying to convey the prince seeing this put his fingers to rialuss lips snapped them opened and closed and then moved them to his own ear ah rialus said looking back at sire neen and the auldek you wish me to translate it is strangely accented numrek or perhaps numrek is really auldek i dont know must i its hard enough just making out what theyre saying he exhaled a fatigued breath dariel wished he could smack him one of the ishtat guards grumbled at rialuss talking but another shushed him let him speak he whispered talk neptos just keep it quiet rialus lifted his chin and cocked his head slightly to hear better but he did not say anything for a while dariel jabbed him with an elbow nothing of interest yet rialus snapped sire neen is making formal greetings thats all in praise of this and that honor and the best intentions for mutual enrichment the usual the one in the center is called devoth the others are herith millwa oh i dont know i cant catch it all something about the clan of snow lions and antoks rialus went silent for some time though sire neen droned on dariel tugged on rialuss arm rialus listened a moment longer and then hurriedly whispered devoth wants to know why neen is here sire neen says hes come offering them a new arrangement new opportunities for trade that will benefit them both and so on devoth turned away from the leagueman and spoke with his companions sire neen folded his hands at his waist and waited composed he was a statue compared to the quick free and expressive motions of the auldek representatives dariel could see only the back of his eggshaped head but he imagined neens face was a mask of composure where did he get such confidence or was it arrogance it surely helped that there were ishtat inspectorate guards and archers just behind him but so too did devoth have a mass of grumbling shadows behind him not to mention the sword still erect in the stones between the two groups devoth turned back he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and snapped it outward as if flicking off moisture it looked like a ritual gesture though then he fell into a barrage of questions rialus picked up immediately this time where are the lothan aklun thats what devoth asked where are they why are they not here he named someone that he wants to speak to one of the auldek who led him here started to answer but devoth wanted the squashed one to answer the squashed one is sire neen hes answering oh thats rich neen says that he is a representative of the greatest power in the known worldthe league of vessels thats us one of the ishtat said grinning the lothan aklun are no more they are finished dragged down by their own greed the league is willing to offer a better trade agreement than the lothan aklun ever allowed i didnt catch what devoth said to that he doesnt seemoh neens mentioned you he offers you as a gift the brother of the socalled queen of acacia those are his wordsso called sire neen turned and pointed toward dariel devoth looked briefly in his direction dariel thought the moment might be his chance he thought of bolting forward through the ishtat while the attention was on him devoth would surely wish to hear from him he might have the bit removed and then dariel would turn the tables on sire neen and show him for the villain he was rialus would speak for him but in the few seconds it took to think this the moment passed devoth looked away uninterested and the leagueman carried on neen says he understands that the auldek will have to learn to trust him but the league is well known to some from ushen brae he has even brought agents to testify to the leagues power and the possibilities for their partnership and then as if on cue the numrek arrived they tramped in shouting out a chant in their language a booming percussion of sound like warring drumbeats everyone turned to watch them even devoth rose on the balls of his feet mouth agape as the numrek approached they jostled their way through the ishtat contingent and arrived before devoth and the other auldek they stopped their singing and fell forward smacking their foreheads on the stones devoth and the other auldek stared at them their faces stunned drained of color the masses behind them edged forward the front ranks of them stepping into the bright light to see better sire neens satisfied voice slithered into the hush rising above it and for a few moments seeming to command the chamber before he had gotten far calrach snapped to his feet the others just after him calrach glanced at the leagueman and silenced neen with a wave of his hand sire neen sputtered to a halt clearly surprised calrach turned to address devoth rialus murmured a translation trancelike now smooth and nearly matched to the speakers themselves we who were banished have returned rialus translated calrachs voice which had boomed to reach beyond devoth into the entire crowd you may slay me now if you wish we give you our souls if you would hear us though we will tell you truths to make you joyful devoth considered this for a moment and then nodded sire neen began to say something but calrach spun on him shut your mouth he said speaking acacian men are speaking you wait sire neen stopped speaking in his booming voice and translated by rialuss thin one calrach carried on with his address to the auldek when they were exiled for their crimes he said they followed the banishment as the clans ordered they did not falter they did not hesitate they marchedmen women childreninto the north and out of the realms of the eight clans they wintered in the bitter regions where no plants grow where white bears hunted them and were hunted by them they learned to eat seal meat at times they walked on ice and heard it crack beneath them at this claim a collective gasp went through the auldek host yes calrach said this is all true we lived years in lands no numrek was made for and yet we learned how to live there we were brave no one can deny it we marched north as you told us to but we marched so far north that it was no longer north it became south instead and we marched down into another land the land from which the divine children come we found that place and we made war there and killed many and took joy in slaughter why have you returned devoth cut in to give you joy these fools calrach said waving toward the league contingent brought us across the black water they brought us home and we came because we can bring you a new world we can take you there why should we go there another auldek asked look that boy is my son dariel could not see the numrek to whom calrach pointed but the effect on the auldek was considerable they stepped forward seemingly awed many of them talking at once so that rialus lost the substance of it for a moment calrachs voice rose above the din declaring in acacian lands our women are fertile again in their lands the curse holds no sway sire neen chose this moment to pipe up again calrach shouted him down furiously and then said the leaguemen have killed the lothan aklun like cowards they poisoned them all there cannot be another soul collection the aklun are no more the grumbling grew the mass of lanky longhaired forms crowded forward many of them yelling angry questions or stamping their feet devoth turned and shouted them down his voice erupted from his abdomen and shot out with force once there was silence he pointed at sire neen this one killed the aklun i dont believe it but i dont like him he is an ant calrach turned studied neen and then spat at his feet he is nothing squash him if you wish his spirit will give you no strength but if he offends you for a moment rialus stopped translating but then as if more afraid of holding the words in than of releasing them he spoke quickly kill him we no longer need his kind kill him and we will lead you to a land ready to be reaped we will have a great hunt devoth did not confirm whether he agreed but he did draw his sword from the stone if draw was the right word for it it was as if at one moment his hand was empty and the next it held the massive curved blade out to his side only in the stillness after the action as devoth let the onlookers study him did dariels mind register that he had in fact watched the entire movement it was no magic trick it was just the smoothest quickest motion he had ever seen no marah was that fast not even mena was that quick no numrek either sire neen found his voice again he dropped his haughty tone and tried a different tack calming devoth dariel hardly needed the translation now but rialus kept at it neen is begging for a moments patience so that they can communicate fully they are misunderstanding one another the numrek are confusing matters none of this is as it should be there have been mistakes made they should all sit and talk to their mutual benefit when devoth took a step toward him the leagueman barked a quick command the rank of bowmen behind him snapped their weapons up devoth paused though similar to the numreks in so many ways his face was more expressive which was why the grin that split it was so disconcerting either he did not understand the threat or he welcomed it he lifted his blade held it out to the side and stepped forward a bowman shot dariel had seen those arrows up close and knew they were weapons crafted to kill the steel head of the missile was pronged in a viciously corkscrewed manner so that the razorsharp metal would carve a twisting expanding course inside its target the single shot fired was perfectly aimed it slammed into devoths chest and buried the shaft to the fletching it must surely have ripped apart his heart and punched right through his back as well he took the impact standing but his face contorted in pain he dropped to one knee and thenas his shouting companions circled himtoppled to his side the masses in the shadows roared the men around devoth alternately bent to care for him or stood to shout what must have been obscenities at the leaguemen sire neen spoke into the confusion ishtat swordsmen closed around him but he would not let them drag him back he seemed sure that he could contain this the archers nocked their arrows the entire company shifted into combat readiness several of the guards near dariel and rialus answered commands ignoring the two prisoners the numrek watched it all without comment calrach crossed his arms and seemed content to wait what happened next sucked what little air dariel had in his lungs right out of him it seemed to have the same effect on sire neen who clutched at the guards around him as if he were about to faint devoth rose he drew great gusts of air into his mouth his companions helped him gain his feet once he had he roared them away and stood swaying the ishtat archers who had a perfect view of him let their bows droop devoth before the eyes of all reached behind him snapped off the arrowhead protruding from his back and then tugged the shaft in his chest out with his other hand he tossed both pieces away it was a casual motion filled with disgust but immediately afterward he went into convulsions he managed to stay on his feet but he shook and jerked and tossed his limbs around he gibbered cried moaned for a few moments his arms spasmed so frantically that he seemed to dariel like more than one being as if there were shadow versions of himself beneath his skin trying to break free angry and twisting him with pain as punishment he seemed so completely driven with anguish that dariel expected him to drop and die finally from the arrow shot that should have already killed him instead devoth came out of the convulsions and moved with the same incredible speed he had shown earlier devoth closed the distance to the ishtat soldiers swung his mighty sword as if it had no weight to it at all and cut down the three guards in front of sire neen he dropped to the floor avoiding the first volley of arrows sent at him then he spun upward sweeping his sword diagonally the blade sliced through sire neens head starting above the lower jaw and angling up when the steel cut free the leaguemans half face twirled in the air above his crumpling body dariel stood as the chamber erupted into chaos the ishtat rushed forward the shadowed masses of auldek poured into the lighted square swords drawn the prince had no idea what to do his hands were bound rialus was no longer beside him in front of him the ishtat and the auldek fell on one another in a wild confusion of blood and gore a hand gripped his shoulder and yanked him around he thought that it must be an ishtat soldier or rialus or a leagueman it was none of these he spun to see a person with a thin whitishblue face and a long nose a woman whose hair sprang from her head like the plumage of some bird the next instant someone wrapped an arm around his torso lifted him off the ground and began running it was not the bird person who carried him however but rather a gray muscled bulk of a being c hapter n ineteen the kindred were to meet again at a village west of danos before they did however barad arrived on the cape of fallon with king grae and his brother ganet the trio traveled inland and together explored the region for several days the areas loamy soil produced bountiful crops of sweet potatoes carrots onions and massive turnips the size of a mans head unlike the plantations of northern talay or the staterun croplands of the mainland the region was too rocky to be sectioned off in a grid pattern the land was irregular broken by hills and stands of recalcitrant short pines and not suited to mass labor forces instead small family farmsteads patchworked the area as they had for centuries and as had been the case for centuries these farmers were forced to pay such a large portion of their crops into the empires coffers that they little more than subsisted from their labor and their lands bounty that was what barad had wanted the aushenians to see for themselves was it not a crime he asked as they toured the area on borrowed mules that these farmers worked their hands into calloused claws they woke before the sun each morning and labored as long as the orb traversed the sky and sometimes into the night they were at the mercy of the vagaries of the weather required to deliver their produce on good and bad years both was it reasonable that after all that laborover all the years these farming families had worked this land and helped feed the worldthat these peoples children were rail thin that their elders died without the care physicians offered the wealthy of alecia and manilnot to mention aos with its school for training in the healing arts these farmers shipped away great wagons of foodstuffs but not one of them grew fat on it not one of them acquired any of the luxuries enjoyed by the merchants of alyth or bocoum disguised in laborers rags the three men pitchforked a wagonload of turnips into a massive storage facility guarded by acacian soldiers they added to the mountain of vegetables already collected there sitting in the back of the wagon as they jolted away barad explained that those stores were for the empire such was the way it always had been such was the way the queen wished it to continue they walked among the rows of kale and greens of sugar hearts and blood beets they saw children thin as waifs met young men strong about the shoulders older men slowed with the weight of work and even older ones stooped by a lifetime of carrying such burdens as their group rode past the corner of one field a small girl looked up at them from a muddy trench just what she was engaged in was unclear but it was not play she was coated in muck her legs sunk up to the ankles in the stuff a bucket in one hand and a hooked tool in the other barad thought to pause and question her but changed his mind just before he spoke she set large lovely brown eyes on him framed by a cascade of unkempt curls she was a small beauty and he deemed her message one best delivered through her eyes how would the years treat her her eyes asked this silently so he did not need to speak out loud he kept the group moving none of these sights were unusual to farmhands but it was not the world most royals ever looked upon both grae and his younger brother took in the scenes with their blue eyes the younger was nearly a twin of his brother a little slimmer of build perhaps but the real difference between them was in his acceptance of deference to his elder clearly the time the two of them spent secluded in the far north of their countryas their older brother and father both died in battlehad made them close as grae had said at the last meeting of the kindred his brother did seem to share his view of the world throughout it all barad studied the young kings face trying to see the mind behind his words beneath that handsome visage he had done this many times in the past few weekswhen he led the aushenian down into an abandoned kidnaban mine and asked him to imagine the labor required to dig such a massive wound as they skirted the wasteland of pig farms along the tabith way even when they toured the slums of alecia on first hearing of the latter the king had asked there are slums in alecia aye barad had said you dont see them from the palaces and government buildings but theyre there outside what most would think of as the walls of the place some of those walls are not a partition that separates inside and out some are just barriers between the rich and the poor of the city youll never hear the alecians speak of it its like they have one gangrenous hand but they keep it hidden in a fancy glove soaked in perfume youll see and the king had seen barad made certain of it the old slave of the mines knew that one could never be sure when judging another person but by the end of their weeks of traveling together he believed grae had a just heart the king had never once flinched after seeing what barad directed him to he had offered no excuses for the empire and he had even spoken to several peasants as if they were actual people something corinn had never done in her years of rule there might be true nobility in his blood something deeper and more full of purpose than the brash young man yet recognized barad saw it though and it pleased him the aushenian would make a fine ally used correctly he could be a tool unlike any he had yet engaged ganet seemed just as useful although in a different way on the scheduled meeting day all the kindred councillors who could be there gathered in a barn behind a farmhouse on the outskirts of a village surrounded by plowed fields the air around the building was heavy with earth scent inside was equally loamy but stuffy and mildewy as well light falling down through spaces in the beams crosshatched the shadows and partially illumed the dark stalls some of which contained farm animals barad joked that the cattle would overhear them but in truth he liked the space well enough the group sat around a wooden table it was set with a display of fresh vegetables arranged in a colorful pattern with a pot of stewmostly tubersand potato bread the farmer who owned the place was friendly to their cause he and his sons carried on with their work outside and with that cover of normalcy to shield them barad invited the travelers to eat and talk as friends before getting to business it wasnt until the conversation eased into a natural lull that he changed the tone what news of the queen he eventually asked she lives hunt said his acacianwith its clipped formality characteristic of the urban residents of aoscontrasted with the coarse farm laborers garb he currently wore he looked almost as out of place in it as king grae and his brother that would be bad enough but she now charms the people with her good works the streets of aos are abuzz with it when i sailed from alyth a troupe of players was acting out her magical deeds i believe they were paid by the city officials to do it but still people were watching street performers lady shenk complained theyre as fickle as the weather yes but theyve voiced our message to the people more often than not barad said elaz you were closest to the queen recently tell us what you observed the former warehouse manager from nesreh set down his spoon before he spoke i did as you asked barad i joined the throng following the queens caravan it was a small group at first sycophants and beggars but their numbers grew as tales of her deeds spread she had made her way across northern talay and everywhere she went she left miracles in her wake she made dry wells gush with water through what trick renold asked he was a scholar newly defected from the academy at bocoum i know not i have seen the water flowing in the bocoum canals its real water not a cloud in the sky the air dry as a desert and yet she filled them the landowners were ecstatic the peasants got drunk on the stuff jumping and swimming the irrigation canals i cant explain it but everything im describing i witnessed if it wasnt the queens work id think it a great blessing to us all if it wasnt the queens work it would be a blessing hunt said but we know she does nothing without her own purpose to fatten a pig a farmer will feed him well the pig must think his life a paradise never knowing he gorges himself so that he will be fatter for the knife later on you compare the queen to a pig farmer then ganet asked hunt shrugged pig farmer or not elaz continued she has worked miracles without a doubt children come out to her caravan as it approaches new towns even old women with tearfilled eyes call out to her ive seen this myself young girls from the villages threw wildflower petals at her feet theyve taken to calling her mother of life she made the title up herself lady shenk said shes wily barad im not sure that youre a match for her after all the large man furrowed his brow it is not a matter of my being a match for her its the will of the people that must best her renold smirked all the worse for us the people are lapping up her gifts and in truth its no small thing that she can make water flow from a dry well she works sorcery think about that it can only be that she has discovered santoth secrets the song of elenet hunt whispered the group fell silent barad opened his mouth to say something dismissive but he was unsure of what to say and chose to share the silence the song of elenet could it be he wondered for the hundredth time that such a book exists and that corinn has it throughout most of his life he had considered santoth lore simply fantasy stories meant to amuse the masses and feed the acacians sense of their past grandeur but that was before aliver and the way he dream whispered the masses off mist before the sorcerers appeared on the fields of talay to destroy hanish meins army and before giant beasts began popping up here and there like weeds something had changed in the world there were old powers at work once again andif that was trueit might also be true that the queen had found a way to tap into them that was a dreadful thought and it was not the only one they had to face to change the subject barad asked renold to detail what he had learned about the leagues plans the scholar said that on most things the league was impenetrable and their specific intentions shrouded as if by the mist they once trafficked in most who sailed the gray slopes believed that the league had burned what remained of their damaged platforms and abandoned the site in exchange for the outer isles league vessels patrolled the archipelagos waters like barracuda seeking prey boarding any ship that blundered too near even sinking a few and leaving the crews bobbing in the waters food for sharks it wasnt possible for him to get to the islands but renold had found out a few things about their doings through barroom interviews along the coastal towns in tendor he had spoken to squatters who had been ousted from the islands by ishtat inspectorate officers several used spyglasses and had seen league engineers surveying the land and a few reported having been hired as laborers on compounds of buildings that dotted the island chain another man claimed to have shuttled a shipload of wooden dowels and thin boards to thrain he had noted the cargo because there were so many of the same objects with no explanation given as to what they were for the sailor had speculated that they were to be made into training swords but renold had a different idea i realized it when i stopped at my sisters house on my way here he said she has four children two of them still young enough that they sleep in cribs the slats that make up the cribs sides are just as the sailor described something about this made him uncomfortable enough that his words choked to a halt the others waited as he took a drink of water then cleared his throat he gestured with his hands that he needed a moment to explain in the past the quota was taken regularly from each province aushenia avoided this for generations but im sure youve felt the insult of it in recent years he glanced at grae and went to sip again from his wooden cup it appeared to be empty you pay the quota now just as any other province aushenia is not a province grae said as you say renold demurred regardless i think a time may come when the league no longer collects quota several began to question him surprised but he spoke through it the isles are to become plantations for the production of one crop children thats what they are building compounds in which mothers will give birth to children thats what those dowels are forfor the cribs they will sleep in thousands of them hunt said as in a factory renold nodded there will be mothers and fathers and children who never know freedom they will live and die on those islands or in the other lands can this be true elaz asked monstrous hunt said worse than monstrous renold added it will look clean to the world the people wont see it but it will go on and on theyll see it if we shout about it lady shenk said perhaps but if they cover their ears barad let them argue for a while renold had confirmed what he had already expected it was good that the group hear such things from one another though he had always known the league was capable of anythinganything at allthat would ensure their profits this business on the islands was a logical progression of sorts why roam the known world rounding up children taking them from parents who then needed to be appeased or quelled it was inefficient and messy how much better to control production themselves to treat the children purely as products and to do it all far from the sight of the masses if it proved feasible the day might indeed come when the queen and the league stopped requiring quota from the provinces corinn could declare that she had freed them from the burden and the known world wouldnt feel the crime if that happened they could shout about it all they wanted people rarely believe what they cannot see not at least when seeing is more frightening than not you understand the murky ground we tread on then barad eventually said cutting in if corinn declares to the masses that she has abolished the quota trade they will hail her as a savior shell put the scholars to work writing new volumes of the akaran myth she will tell the people that she has delivered on the snow kings promises and the people will eat the lie they will not believeor careunless we could take every one of them to see the place obviously we cannot do that barad let this sit a moment shifting his eyes from one to another that is why time is of such importance we should announce the uprising before the winter sets in i proposed we rise at the beginning of the harvest we spoke of this before what better time when the world sees the fruits of a years labor seized and taxed by alecia i mean we rise at the beginning of this years harvest just four months from now we cannot wait longer not with the queen spinning magic and the league about to start this slave factory this is our time do any doubt me none seemed to but elaz did offer there will be many details to see to before then yes yes there will let us not fear details let us make them our friends instead for one there is the issue of the queen and what she is doing has she the book of sorcery if so what other powers might it give her and what powers would it rob from her if we took it barad we dont have anyone to answer those questions elaz said we had an agent within the palacea maid i had great faith inbut she has gone missing and we should not forget the blacksmith of the lower town he was caught outright with an unfortunate document in his hand he died to keep our secrets and even they had no real access to the queen she is not easy to get to especially not when in spying on her were always at risk of bumping into the leaguewho are doing the same with all their considerable resources at present we are blind barad interrupted what if we send the young king elaz froze grae the king who had been considering the selection of carrots before him snapped to alertness me you want me to spy on the queen you are due to visit acacia arent you drop in on them now you would be received as befits your royal status you can get yourself and your servants into areas of the palace we could not gain you would arrive with a particular purpose of course one that would get you close to the queen the young man looked startled for a moment but then resumed a calm air plucking up a thin carrot grae considered it from several angles before he crunched down on the root he spoke while he chewed and what purpose is that he would have us think him calm and collected barad mused he did not fault the young man but he thought bluntness might crack the facade usefully as with most things that barad ever spoke aloud he had considered what he was about to say carefully he said you arrive on acacia as a suitor flowers in hand honeyed words on your lips grae spit out the chunk of carrot youre joking it has been a long time since i felt mirth enough to jest he glanced at hunt winked and looked back at the aushenian i appreciate humor in othersbut no grae i do not joke elaz sucked his teeth a sure sign his mind was turning over the possibilities rapidly there is a movement in the senate to force the queen to marry he said its gaining steam i hear while shes away making water flow from the dry ground the talk in alecia is about who should bed her and how she can be convinced that she needs a man at her side for the benefit of the empire lady shenk laughed she slammed the table with one of her large bigknuckled hands for the benefit of the empire they say more like for the benefit of some lechers cock thats what theyre thinking with its a mass agitation of ambitious cocks believe me ive seen it before lady shenk is not wrong renold said speaking as the scholar he had so recently been but the alecian senate is not a senivalian tavern no lets not jest too readily about this acacian monarchs are bound by the old laws among them is the provision that the ruling monarch should be wed they should endeavor to produce heirs to the throne as many of them as possible to keep the royal line alive corinn has a son yes but a single heir is not enough and aaden is not the child of a legitimate union if the senators push this issue formally they have a case its about cock lady shenk repeated but youre right about the senate being no tavern id not let a senator into a tavern of mine poor tippers they are and always complaining barad placed a hand atop the womans fleshy arm to acknowledge her humor while also silencing it to grae he said it is rumored that before hanishs war corinnthen just a princesswas enamored of your elder brother igguldan had things been different they might have married you might be linked directly to the akarans already i know things are not different they are what they are but there is history here to be exploited i dont just propose this because of graes fine jawline and long legs those things will help but what may entice the queen more are the political factors if i read her correctly she disdains the senate it is a necessary nuisance to her i doubt that she will wish to marry anyone from that gilded chamber a union with aushenia would shut the senators up without giving them any new power actually it would bring her your military might which would make it even harder for the senators to cause her trouble im sure corinn will calculate all these things in the time it takes you to bend your knee in greeting and besides that the queen is a woman still she must have womanly needs just like any other cock lady shenk said looking at grae as if the idea of sending him on this mission no longer seemed quite so absurd lady shenk you have added considerable wisdom to this discourse barad said even if the royal cock does not prove sufficiently enticing grae will still have the time and resources to uncover whatever secrets he canincluding searching for the song of elenetif it exists and if corinn does possess it what if her highness accepts the kings offer lady shenk asked barad leaned back from the table inhaling a long breath through his nose in that case friends we will have to keep a close eye on the young king the lure of imperial power will be great just as the lure of corinn akarans bed will be i trust king grae that the honor of your ancient line and the righteousness of a free world will shield you against temptations to betray us grae aimed his blue eyes at barad and held his gaze a long moment if i betray you it will only be in that i cut the bitchs throat before i deliver her on all else though you may be sure that nothing can tempt me i carry a hope that generations have been denied it is bigger than you and bigger than i i will be true to it to this barad nodded a gesture of finality that he would let stand for words what he did not say was that he would arrange to ensure graes loyalty by keeping ganet close at hand he would teach the prince things mentor him complete his knowledge of the known world or so he would explain it in truth the young prince would be insurance he would be safe and prospering as long as grae stayed true if the king somehow fell under corinns power however well they would face that if they had to c hapter t wenty the morning corinn was scheduled to meet with the queens counciljust a few days since returning from her wellfilling tour of talayshe walked out into the sun of the upper gardens rhrenna at her side though the day was warm she wore a longsleeved dress of teheen cotton elaborately embroidered with overlapping animal figures that cavorted across her chest and back she wore her hair in a tight bun pierced by decorative combs that looked vaguely martial as if she could pull them out and toss them as daggers if she grew angry she found aaden swimming in the maze of canals and pools that cut through the gardens his friend was with him devlyn was his name the one aaden seemed so fond of it was unlikely that the pools had been intended for swimming but corinn had swum in them when she was young it warmed her to see aadens legs and arms sweeping out in the glassclear water he and devlyn dove among gold silver and crimson fish some as large as a mans arm but all of them harmless up until this moment she was still haunted by her nightly torment she now banished the memory of the dream it was a foolishness anyway aliver and hanish were dead aaden was alive and hers and would be forever mother aaden called suddenly discovering he was being watched he treaded water losing his rhythm for a moment so that his mouth dipped below the surface up an instant later he spat then spoke mother devlyn saw a hookfish in the pools as long as a man he said corinn stepped to the raised lip of the pool she gestured for the boys to swim to the edge nearest her a hookfish you say aaden nodded devlyn did not but he swam with a motion somehow more graceful than the princes whats a hookfish you dont know aaden asked though he seemed quite pleased to hear it its one of those long scaly things with barbs down their tails like hooks but sharp as marah swords the queen could not help but bend and wipe the light strands of hair back from the panting boys forehead though the very notion of such a fish swimming below her sons feet stirred a flash of unease through her she knew it was nonsense the pools had been safe since the sixth king built them for his wife generations ago why do boys always wish for monsters she wondered out loud she said really yes and they have teeth sharp enough to cut to the bone if they bite you they dont let go even if theyre taken out of the water right devlyn the other boy did not immediately meet the queens gaze speaking to the stone rim just in front of him he said yes they have green eyes you saw the color of its eyes thats alarming why then are you still in the water to hunt it devlyn answered aaden nodded but corinn kept her eyes on the other boy he was handsome enough in his way with dark eyes and curls of brown hair that glistened with moisture he would be stunning in a few years a notion that did not sit altogether comfortably with her would he in oliveskinned beauty outshine aaden and i suppose you plan to slay the beast yourself she asked to her surprise the boy did not miss a beat in responding no he said his eyes darting up to hers for just a moment aaden will im his second ah so you do know your place and as a second what do you do for aaden whatever he needs me to anything i have to keep him safe ill be the king mother aaden said sounding older a bit weary for a moment he knows that he knows to protect me thats why aaden stopped himself but not before corinn knew what he had almost said he had nearly mentioned his wish that devlyn become his chancellor again he had stopped knowing that she would not welcome the conversation in front of the boy that was wise although it was obvious from the way both boys faces went momentarily blank that they had discussed the matter between themselves that was not as wise or perhaps it was perhaps a prince needed to secure his companions when he was young perhaps aaden would be better off than she with the pack of ambitious fools she had to contend with so thinking she was reminded of the days meeting she bade the boys safe hunting and left them again enlivened and shouting excitement to each other the queens council was just one of the many panels of advisers she consulted unlike the otherswho humbly brought her hard facts on the various subjects important to her rulethe members of the queens council tended to inflate their own import she had accepted that she needed them but she did not trust them if they had not been necessary in order to keep up the appearance that she honored traditions she would have dismissed them and bought advice entirely with coin from agents of her choosing early in her rule she had selected some of the ten councillors herself in an effort to create a truly guiding body she had handpicked jason her former tutor it had not taken her long however to realize that most of her choices were just as selfinterested as those thrust upon her by tradition she had stopped trying to make them friends long ago with the council members her guard was up and senses as alert as they would have been at a meeting of declared enemies none of this however showed on the surface good councillors she declared as she entered the chamber that had once been her fathers do me the service of your knowledge that i may govern with wisdom it was one of the traditional greetings she said it with every appearance of sincerity as she seated herself the councillors answered her just as warmly they could not say enough about the great things they had heard about her trip to talay a triumph sigh saden declared in his nasally aristocratic acacian a voyage of miracles balneaves of the sharratt family pronounced in his subdued way even sire dagon seemed impressed he should be corinn thought impressed and enriched because of it and more than a little discomfited too on the surface they were all praise beneath they had to be wondering how she had managed these miracles they must be stewing over what other powers she might have a reaction she had intended all along deciding to let them worry a little longer she indicated that rhrenna could call the meeting to order she did so by invoking the first five akaran kings calling on their spirits to infuse the gathering with wisdom after that grandiose opening rhrenna directed their conversation to mundane matters as corinn had instructed records and accounts mining production estimates and even an assessment of the vumu archipelagos potential as a source of timber on such things they passed a long boring hour turning to military matters general andeson the commander of the acacian army admitted that there had been a drop in the overall troop numbers but said it was for the best he put forth the opinion that the military would better serve as a slightly smaller force than by recruiting less worthy new soldiers without a foe to fight he said it was dangerous to have too many armed men and women milling about what about security asked talinbeck a bonethin engineer with bushy recalcitrant eyebrows my managers swear theres something afoot among the workersnothing they can put their finger on but something andeson rubbed his thumb over his closecropped black beard show me a foe and ill act but i cant defend against something nobody can put a finger on ive heard rumors of discontent before corinn said are there signs that the dissenters are organizing no your majesty balneaves said its just the lowlevel grumbling of the masses thats nothing new when the mist flowed freely it was nothing but a murmur its still little more than that but the commoners want to be sedated thats why they drink thats why they smoke whatever leaves will blur the world for them thats why they fornicate and breed and brawl drunkenly in taverns he could barely keep the scorn off his jowly face i say get that new wine to them sooner rather than later well all be happier for it sire dagon cleared his throat puckered his lips and held the room a moment the league is ready to distribute when you are your majesty corinn knew they all wanted the empire sloshing in the stuff such a course was likely for the best and would commence soon she told herself that she wasnt delaying she just needed to know the time was right i know she answered and in my time i will allow it baddel the only talayan on the council went into raptures again your trip was such a success he said that i wonder if you plan another talay is big enough you touched the coastal area but in the interior he stopped pursing his full lips as if he had not considered that before his machinations were obvious but corinn almost liked him despite it vast dry mile upon mile another hundred wells between umae and halaly would do such good think what it would mean for the halaly to have their lake back at full level by now mena must have rid the halaly of the beast in the lake rhrenna said i truly hope so saden said it will refill as it always has i was wondering about a different matter the eilavan woodlands were sorely taxed by the harvest of timber firstrate lumber of course and invaluable to a nation that needed to rebuild after war the demand remains high and the replanting efforts have barely begun might youoh i dont knowmake the trees grow back faster inwardly corinn rolled her eyes outwardly she just looked at him when had one of these fools ever proposed anything not meant to benefit himself rhrenna spoke for her i wonder senator saden if you are here as the senates representative or as your own dont you own an interest in the woodlands harvest your family if im not mistaken have been harvesting there for a hundred years or more we are one of the many families yes but so youve had more than enough time to learn to manage it properly the queen does not act to fulfill the personal interests of the few rhrenna glanced at corinn shall we move on to other topics forgive us talinbeck said we just dont know what youre capable of we dont know how you do the things you do if you explain it to us well know and corinn did not like the engineers earnest tone the last thing she wanted was for them to start being honest with her now yes lets move on she waited a moment are there other topics she knew that there was one topic they would likely raise before she dismissed them but as the silence continued she almost believed she would get away with ending the meeting without facing it but then julian the councils most senior member cleared his throat and motioned that he would speak he was the only one of the group who had been a member of leodans council quite notoriously he was on record as having doubted that thasren meins attack on king leodan had really meant hanish was launching a war he had been wrong about that but he had been right in managing to stay alive long enough to see another akaran rise to rule it was for that connection with the past that he was a part of the council i hope you dont mind my mentioning it your majesty julian said his voice tremulous i know its a delicate matter and wholly up to you to consider but i would be remiss if i didnt bring up the topic of your betrothal the topic is discussed openly on alecia openly in truth some have even written asking me to speak with you about it yes corinn thought tap old grayhaired julian for your dirty work as if i can surely find nothing lascivious in the urgings of such a revered elder and what did they bid you say she asked tenting her hands on the granite table and creasing her brow in feigned interest julian blinked for a moment he looked as if he had forgotten but then it came back and he spoke as if surely he had described it all to her beforeas indeed he had why they wish you to wed of course theyve even commissioned a team of scholars to look into the lineages of all the eligible agnates theres quite a list i assure you should you be interested i could have it for you corinn interrupted is that a list of true agnates or does it include the new families new or old it makes no difference saden answered the recent agnate appointments stand as solidly as the old all the same now as it has to be does that strike you as true jason her former tutor started in his seat he had not said a word yet other than reading one of the earlier accounting reports and would probably have been content with that whatever things he had seen during his years of hiding during hanishs rule had crippled him creases carved his face and white strands outnumbered the brown in his hair though he was just past forty sometimes feeling his eyes studying her when she was not looking at him corinn felt he viewed her with a certain amount of uneasy astonishment perhaps he remembered the shallow girl she had been and could not recognize the person she was now she rather liked that jason answered i dont doubt that the old agnates will forever remember that they are in fact more ancient lines but in point of fact in the law senator saden is correct his fingers trembled when he gestured with them your list of possible suitorsshould you choose to consider itis larger this way easier to find a suitable match one that none would contest i see corinn pressed her lips together as if giving the idea renewed thought what i dont see however is why i should marry anyone do any of you think me incapable of rule or is it that you wish to challenge my sons right to the throne you think him a bastard perhaps a cacophony of denials voices raised in complaint so ardent that corinn shared a look with rhrenna a look of amusement although other eyes would not have known it as such the councilmens response was answer enough to things she had already believed so she would go no further with it there were many reasons men wished to wed her none of them were advantageous to her but the issue of aaden was a concern like no other if she did marry and had another child by one of these agnates and if her husband called himself king and appealed to his class to elevate his own child above a bastard fathered by their hated enemy well that was a fight she did not wish to have better that she have no other children better that her rule stay strong and that the people come to love aaden once he reached seventeen she could step aside and see him crowned king after that none would challenge him a ruling queen always had the option to step aside for a mature son corinn had studied the secession laws in detail and likely knew them better than any senator she doubted any of them could imagine her to be planning this but planning it she was they would be waiting for her death to move against him she would act before that though the councillors were still squawking when she decided to change the subject once more cutting in to the conversation she said i will not discuss this anymore today if i choose to wed youll hear about it promptly but my marital situation is not to be decided at council several of the councillors looked ready to take exception to that but she spoke over them here is a thing i wish to speak of we will bring horse culture back to the center of the empire the room fell silent sire dagon plucked his pipe from the corner of his lips horse culture exactly and what horse culture would that be your majesty surely all in this room know of acacias ancient traditions of equine excellence ive been giving it a deal of thought consulting with knowledgeable individuals and ive concluded that we should bring the noble practice back into the mainstream of acacian culture the truth was somewhat simpler than that aaden had given her the idea while they were riding in talay he had observed quite casually one is taller on horseback i like being taller watching him ride away upright and easy in the saddle reins held correctly as he had been taught corinn had been struck with inspiration her people she decided had once been horsemenin some distant past in the time of the early kings perhaps wasnt tinhadin famous for his love of his gray mare yes certainly he was hadnt valeeden once had to ride full out from calfa ven to alyth stopping only long enough to leap upon fresh horses offered by the peasants she was vague on the details of these things but she had not found details very important in convincing people of things they wanted to believe acacians had once been horsemen she decided they would be so again one was taller sitting on horseback just as the future king had said let the people feel taller jason corinn said tell the council about our horse culture the scholar started again he set a somewhat pleading look upon her but when she returned it with an expectant smile he found words tinhadin was a horseman its true and edifus kept a great stable of stallions in the pelos valley some here will have practiced the eighth form in which horses play a part the akaran royals have always ridden saden cut in noticeably annoyed with the change of subject the royal family riding does not make for a horse culture you know that im sure you know that the reason few people in the empire ride is that the royal family didnt want them to simple as that your ancestors forbade horses to talayans outright he nodded at baddel who did not acknowledge the gesture thought riding would cripple them turns out it did nothing of the sort they can run as far and as fast as any horse farther over a span of days at least thats what ive heard tinhadin tried to take them from the mein but never managed it as i understand it general andeson said there are laws in the books expressly forbidding commoners to ride horses may pull carts or carry packs yes but only the militaryand the nobles of coursecan ride corinn said with a tone that suggested she would have said the same thing regardless of what they had said in between the past is behind us and now i look to the future i dont want my people to always walk the earth like peasants not all of them at least i believe well be stronger if more people know horses jason develop a lore for the horse as well something to feed the people elaborate on what you know and put it in writing understand the tutor started to sweep his hand to his chest knocked his tumbler caught it and righted it dexterously your majesty develop a lore develop legends heroes on horseback and such things seek out some of the old tales in the library find stories that include horses if you cant find them insert the horses plant the seeds add another layer to the lore and let it be spoken of in taverns and halls and told to children at night that sort of thing get the people dreaming horses balneaves smiled crookedly noble work jason go to it with gusto i am glad you think so corinn rounded on him i have a part in this for you too indeed she had a part in it for almost everyone here to different individuals she assigned responsibility for acquiring breeding stock finding good pasturelands hiring trainers contracting architects and builders and blacksmiths the list of needs was extensive corinn spoke with enthusiastic seriousness rhrenna duly wrote it all down the councilmen looked about as if each was hoping another would call the whole thing a joke but none did and at the end of the session baddel walked out mumbling as the queen wishes the stallions shall stud the mares shall birth and the people shall ride and the councillors shall scurry about like worker ants she answered although only within the safe confines of her head later that afternoon she had one more meeting this one took place in the privacy of the lower wing of her offices on an open balcony that looked out over the sea it was a small space cut into the rock and hidden from prying eyes from above she chose it because the man she was to meet could ascend an outer stone staircase unnoticed it was that type of meeting clandestine it was possible it was even dangerous but she did not believe so delivegu lemardine her agent was faithful in his own wayfaithful to the coin she paid him and to the knowledge that his service might fund a life of whatever vices he enjoyed he had once aided rialus in his covert designs and rialus had introduced him to her she did not trust delivegu but that was not unusual she did not trust anybody unlike most people delivegu had proved useful on more than one occasion senivalians were not known for walking quietly but in that delivegu differed from his countrymen he was up the stairs and but a few feet from corinn before she knew it he was dressed showily as ever in an opennecked shirt with a brigandlike flare in the sleeves tucked into his snugfitting trousers his kneehigh black leather boots were laced to shape around his calves though he was padded around the belly with a few extra pounds never had a man looked more comfortable with his body indeed he luxuriated in his size and in what appeared to be natural strength his face was composed of an unsettling combination of blocky masculine features and feminine touches as in the petite pucker of his lips he was in his own way frustratingly attractive your majesty he said bowing i am your servant in everything in absolutely everything he held the position a moment and then rose if i may say you are a vision of i dont have time for flattery she snapped she cupped her hand around a stone resting on the balcony tell me and then go delivegu smiled he always smiled he seemed to find the world and everything in it amusinginsults as much as praise the blacksmith was strong ill give him that much not just in his arms though those were formidable for a moment when i first confronted him i thought he might have me ever thought you were about to be skewered on a redhot sword pulled from the flames not a pretty to the point delivegu to the point yes well i lived as you can see and i beat the brute to within an inch of his life and then questioned him by what method delivegu cocked his head demure but when she pressed him he detailed his procedure readily enough the initial beating had been coarse and for the questioning he chose methods meant to coerce the mind as much as the body he started by asking his questions gently why he had asked was the blacksmiths name in a note shot out of the sky by a marah on night patrol the man had watched a messenger bird dispatched from the lower town and rightly guessed it carried some covert correspondence when the missive was detached from the birds leg only one word could be made out on it his name the rest of it was coded gibberish the blacksmith had shut his lips and focused his loathing through his eyes refusing to answer he didnt care for me much delivegu said combing his fingers through his black hair a monkey came loping up the steps and seemed startled to find them there it chirruped a greeting and sauntered past them looking much like a noble out for an evening stroll it stopped some paces beyond them and stood intently scratching its rump the means of coercion had to be improved upon he had flattened the mans hands in a vise and had driven nails through the finger bones he had dunked his head in a bucket of water until he passed out revived him and did it over and over again he had stripped the mans brawny body naked and using a candle burned the hairs from his body dripping hot wax on him the entire time that was amusing delivegu said but not effective nothing was i even put a weight on his manhood and promised to make a little cut if he didnt speak true corinn betrayed no discomfort and and begging your royal pardon but he still didnt speak i kept my promise and that was that he died not long after who wouldnt without a prick the worlds a miserable place he paused a moment glancing at corinn she was not sure if the amusement in his eyes was from speaking to her with such lurid candor or if it was his own recognition that she being a woman was just as prickless as the blacksmith if hed had a family i could have used them but he was a single man friends to many but none who seemed right for that purpose so you learned nothing corinn said i wouldnt say i learned nothing in fact i did learn something something quite important corinn rounded on him as if she might hurl a stone at him tell me then before i get angry she had a notion that she could sing something vile something to undo him right here if she wanted to he seemed to feel that possibility as well delivegu bowed his head backed away a step and took the pleasure out of his voice at the beginning he denied any knowledge of any conspiracy by the end though he did not deny that there was a conspiracy he just refused to tell me anything about it indeed he took his pleasure from spitting his refusal in my face what i mean your majesty is that he proved there is some conspiracy afoot you are not wrong to suspect as much quite the contrary in annoyance she flicked her wrist and sent the stone twirling toward the monkey which had sat down as if it were sharing their conversation the creature jumped nimbly away screeching as it did so contorting its face into an expression very much like human effrontery it grunted and bared its teeth but it also withdrew even farther when corinn bent for another stone delivegu watched it all with amusement corinn glared at him this is foul news why do you take such pleasure in delivering it to me i take no pleasure in the news itself if i am enthusiastic about it it is because i have helped shed light on the presence of rats in the basement oh and i got the bastards name he said the last bit as an afterthought but could barely hide his pleasure with himself what name the blacksmith didnt give it up intentionally he let it slip once when he was babbling to himself ever heard of barad the lesser he used to foment trouble in kidnaban it seems hes expanded his ambitions delivegu grinned again wider this time first the name and then the man tell me the truth i do good work for you dont i may that always be true corinn did not have to respond to this rhrennathe only other person who knew whom she met here on the balconydescended the staircase one hand lifting her dress so that she could move faster the other holding a rolled parchment she glanced at delivegu for just an instant and then focused on the queen a message she said its about mena c hapter t wentyone mena awoke with a hot hand grasping her skull searing her where it squeezed she was on her side and when she tried to swat the thing she realized through a rush of pain that her left forearm was broken in the dim light of the predawn hour she stared at the strange droop of the limb bent where it should have been straight limp where it should have been firm it was most definitely broken realizing that she also knew that no physical being held her it was just the pain from bashing her head on stones in the hillside the burning on her thigh was from an impact abrasion the soreness in her shoulder was from when she had dislocated it she remembered the complete agony of it and the sweetness of relief when the tumbling motion of her fall had reset it the rawness in her throat was from sleeping in the jumbled position in which she landed with her mouth open to the dry rasp of a talayan breeze she knew a lot of things but they were so cluttered in her head that she could not grasp the entirety of it instead she focused on a small thing the little finger of her left hand had snapped at the base and canted off to the side in defiance of its siblings it was red and swollen and did not really seem to belong with the others it was a minor injury in some ways but the unnatural shape of it captured all menas attention forced her to focus through the pounding bands squeezing her skull slowly she reached out and took the finger in the palm of her other hand she held it a long moment awed at how fat it felt then she twisted it back into position as it popped into place she exhaled a jagged cursenot so much at the finger as at the searing splinters of pain that shot up her forearm and into her shoulder and throughout her entire body she lay on her back breathing holding still so that the pain might forget her and slip away the gray sky above her was scalloped with high clouds tinted pink by the rising sun they looked soft they reminded her of something as she tried to think what a few moments passed and then she raised herself awkwardly things to do she had things to do despite and because of her pain she had things to do over the next hour mena limped about gathering the supplies she would need to splint her arm there were no trees nearby and she did not yet want to raise her eyes and look beyond her immediate surroundings instead she found several slim lengths of stone along with ribbons of mossy turf that she sliced onehanded with her short sword she was not far from a small stream its gentle gurgle called to her and she hobbled toward it cringing at the thirsty convulsions of her parched throat she stood beside the stream for a longer moment than she wished unsure whether to drink from it or tend her arm first eventually she did both she unbuckled her sword belt let it drop and contorted her way out of her clothing she stepped into one of the deeper pools wearing only her eel pendant the one she had found gripped in a childs withered hand at the base of maebans aerie the water bit her with cold but that was good she would be wet all over but that was good too good to wash the filth and sweat and blood from her body letting her broken arm float she scooped fingerfuls of water into her mouth with her right hand she did so slowly pausing to breathe between swallows not rushing when she was as numb as she could bear she crawled from the stream andstill naked and grateful for the touch of the morning suntended her arm the flesh was not broken but she could see the misshapen bone beneath her skin which was bruised in blooms of ugly blue and green and red and yellow laying the limb on the ground she worked around it a onearmed being caring for a separate entity to which she was bound she positioned the moss as padding and lined the stones around it to make a splint she used a length of string from her waist to bind it tight a slow slow process that left her fingers aching hard as it was to tie with only one hand she pulled on her left hand as she pressed the splint down with her chin an attempt at straightening the bone and then tightened the strings again by the time she was finisheddressed again with the arm in a sling fashioned from the long ribbon of fabric that had been her beltthe sun was high and strong and she was sweating from her efforts was the bone set straight she could not be sure but it was the best she could do she might have looked to her small injuries as well but that would just be avoidance of the more important thing she knew these actions were small details delays before she faced what she had to face her body would be bruised and battered for some time but with the arm splinted she had no reason not to raise her eyes and look for itfor the foulthing climbing up to a ridgeline and trudging along it toward a higher vantage mena took in the country around her it was a temperate landscape of sharp grasscovered hills the soil was shallow and the rocky frames of the slopes protruded here and there she could not be sure but she thought they had flown west into the hills of northern talay perhaps not far from nesreh and the western coast she remembered glimpsing the sea on the distant horizon that was before the beastand she with ithad crashed to the earth in fatigue what a strange flight that had been it had gripped her hadnt it or had she gripped it had it wanted her with it or had she wanted to be with it she was not sure she would have thought it a dream if the world around her were not so real and the pains in her body were not so acute she remembered the moment it yanked her into the air the way the earth fell away as if she and the beast were motionless but everything and everyone below them had suddenly dropped at least thats one way she remembered it on the other hand she remembered the incredible earbattering sound of it she had clawed up the tail like it was a rope up and before her the foulthing flew the beast itself had been silent but everything else was a confusion of noise and wind of flapping wings and erratic flight the swinging weights smashed into her several times before she got her short sword free and managed to cut several of the ropes this made it easier for the foulthing she knew but any one of those stones could have brained her besides the creature did not truly seem to have much life in it each wingbeat was a display of power but between them came long moments in which the wings seemed on the verge of dropping she clung to the flying creature sure that they would come crashing down any second near enough that her troops would never lose sight of her the creature was more resilient than she knew however the undulating hills of talay passed far below her scrolling beneath them as they flew and flew on acacia trees became tiny blooms rivers like lines on a map her view that of an eagle looking down on a world laid out beneath it she was not sure how much time passed like that hours perhaps a few times she believed it was maeben above her she thought she heard that great goddesss angry screech it didnt make sense not unless she had fallen into a dream but how could she have done that when she was clinging for her life unless the beast really was holding on to her the last moments of the flight had brought them into this high country she thought they were getting lower but in fact the plateau and the hills upon it rose to meet them she saw what she took to be the gray bulk of the sea in the distance and then focused on the hills the rocks the pinnacles that grew closer and closer the creature it seemed did not have the strength to rise higher its flight grew even more erratic frantic one moment and slow the next making them rise and fall she thought she was going to smash into one rock face only to be saved when the beast surged above it passing over it mena touched her feet to the stone in a quick scamper across its surface she loosened her hand considering letting go of the tail before she did she was airborne again the beast had dipped into the next ravine and as it rose to fight its way over the coming slope mena felt her hand slide of course she could not hold on forever perhaps the beast was letting go of her the sleek muscles of the tail grew limp in her hand this time as the creature just managed to clear the knuckle of rock that topped the ridge mena touched her feet to the vertical wall of stone but did not have the strength to hold on the tail slipped from her grip for a moment she was held there her two feet on the stone her body horizontal to the world suspended in brief defiance of the earths pull her last sight of the foulthing was from beneath it as its shadow skimmed across the outcrop of stones and vanished its tail snapping as it disappeared she heard maebens shrill cry again and then the earth remembered her it pulled on her and all was the painful battering of her tumbling fall down the slope had she not been so exhaustedher body as limp as a dollsshe might not have survived it as she took the last steps up to the summit a thought rose in her perhaps she had been the one crying out maebens fury leaping from her mouth she did not consider this long however she crested the peak and took in a panorama of similar hills stretching out all around her until her eyes tilted downward and found it it was there where she suspected it would be the beast lay sprawled in the next ravine its wings flung wide and stained bloody from the many bolt piercings and tears its body twisted and its tail in looping disarray tangled among the ropes and weights still knotted around it it looked broken dead mena felt a knot draw tight in her abdomen she started down toward it approaching slowly trying not to kick stones loose as she neared it she drew her long sword she wasnt truly afraid the action was instinctive in truth the creature seemed much smaller than she remembered it was less bulky when contrasted to some of the foulthings she had fought but it was not a creature whose strength should be measured by its bulk with its lithe torso and the slim extended proportions of its tail and the confusion of fingerthin bones and membranes that were its wings it was hard for her to compare it to anything she had seen before such an awkward position it lay in bent around the stones its head was upside down the soft part of its neck exposed there was so much to it it hurt mena just looking at the wounds the tears the places where blood had smeared or pooled the last of the foulthings dead they told me you were a dragon she said but youre no dragon youre a foulthing but youre not im not sure what you are but youre no monster she had spoken softly without realizing she was doing so in the silence afterward she looked around embarrassed lest she was heard talking to a dead beast but there was nobody around not for miles she thought for the first time of melio and the soldiers who would be frantically searching for her she knew she should do something to help them walk back toward the east perhaps find a settlement or build a signal fire somehow but looking at the lizard bird she did not want to they would find her no matter what she did she had that faith in them instead she let her eyes drift over every inch of the creature it must have been female she thought the curves of her neck were sensual dramatic in her death posture mena stepped close and ran her fingers over her she was soft to the touch warmed by the heat of the sun her coat was close to the skin something like feathered scales hued in soft creamy tones there was a pattern woven across them an intricate interlacing that mena could not get her eyes to fully focus on it seemed to change even as she studied it my sister would have envied this coat she said thinking that she was saddened that she was the one who would deliver it to her corinn would not have envied the damage done to the creature though each wound turned menas stomach she couldnt stand the sight of them and suddenly she couldnt stand the thought that the others would see the creature like this her beauty so fouled by the weapons that mena herself had called into play without really deciding to mena began to do what she could to hide the damage she pulled free the crossbow bolts and flung them away she untangled the ropes and dragged the stone weights down the ravine she cradled the creatures tail and let it flow out to its full length in particular she worked to gently arrange the wondrous wings she remembered them as they had been when they first unfurled so shocking amazing in their breadth and their deceptively delicate power it was hard to twin those images with the ragged things she worked to sort out the bones that framed the wings hardly seemed capable of what she had witnessed they were as limp as a thousand broken finger bones slipped inside a thin tube of skin mena could pick the wings up and arrange them like tattered sheets the membrane of the wings was just as diaphanous as it appeared leathery and supple both it had an oily resin on it the stuff felt funny on her fingers it tingled seemed to course through her fingertips it smelled faintly of she wasnt sure what it smelled of but there was something familiar in it something comforting it made it slightly easier to stick together the ripped fabric of the membrane and to feel it might just mend or at least look like it had mena was at this for some time working onearmed stumbling because of her own injuries and fatigue she could not help but speak to the creature she kept apologizing commenting on her features talking as if she were a nurse and the patient simply holding to silence perhaps she said not all changed creatures should die perhaps she should have taken the time to see this one first she wished she had eventually she had dealt with everything but the creatures head before she turned to it she thought she would touch it with care lift and twist it over set it right she could do that she would she owed it that so thinking she turned and froze at what she saw the creatures headwhich had been upside downwas now right side up her eyes were open she was watching her c hapter t wentytwo dariels eyes snapped open he went from the nothingness of dreamless sleep to complete alertness his heart in its first seconds of wakefulness banged against the cage of his chest like an animal trying to escape where was he he was sitting upright held in position by a band wrapped around his chest hands still bound but his mouth free he had no memory he knew thoughas if pierced physically with the knowledgethat the things he had forgotten were huge his gaze flew about the room taking in individual things one by one a water stain on the rough stone of the ceiling iron rings bolted into the wall a hanging lantern that cast a peculiarly constant light the bare back of a heavily muscled completely gray man sitting on a stool several paces away on this his eyes stopped the man appeared to be eating he made slight huffing sounds interspersed with wet noises and an occasional crack like twigs or bones being broken he was a giant of a man he wasof course it all came back he was the one dariel had seen on the docks of the other lands the one who had lifted him bodily and carried him tucked beneath his arm he was proof that it had all actually happened the lothan aklun killed the sea dotted with bodies the strangeness of the citys inhabitants devoth of the auldek stirred to anger sire neen beheaded giver return escaped dariels lips a pious entreaty for aid unusual to him the gray man must have heard it he stopped eating head cocked and then slowly eased his bulk around to face dariel he let out a low rumble of sound sinister bestial it was hard not hear it that way for the mans appearance could not have been more frightening he was preposterously muscled with two thick legs a thin waist and a torso ridged with neat compartments his bulk flared up and out from there chest muscles bulging beneath his gray skin shoulder joints like two round stones neck as thick as a boars and a boar was what he was a swine in nearhuman form he approached dariel who bucked away from him straining against the strap that held him fast he kicked out with his feet but could neither touch the man nor find purchase enough to move on the slick stone the man brushed the locks of wavy black hair from his face with the wedge of his hand he was just as tusked and horrific as dariel remembered the golden curves punched straight through his cheeks just below the corners of his lips ahhh you awake good to see it thought you was dead on fright he followed this with that same low rumble of sound it took dariel a moment to identify it a chuckle he was laughing you got tan skin the man said in his deep timbre but you looking white just now what you think i going to eat you he reached out and tapped the ball of a large thumb on dariels cheek truth is i more like you than you know just yet hearing acacian coming from this mans mouth was both welcoming and alarming his accent was strange the words were spoken clearly enough but the inflections he used were kin to no one region of the known world still dariel could not help but find some hope they spoke the same language that was something to cling to the man stepped away tugged his stool nearer and returned he sat down facing dariel leaning forward with elbows on his knees and fingers interlaced name tunnel hear it tunnel just when dariel was getting over the surprise of the mans speaking to him in acacian he was shoved back into confusion name a tunnel what tunnel that couldnt be what hed said what the man smacked a palm against his pectoral muscle tunnel name tunnel he bared his teeth seemingly pleased tunnel you mean dariel sputtered your name is tunnel he speak proper words good to hear it dariel shook his head he closed his eyes and opened them and found everything exactly as it had been a moment before tunnel stood grinning at him that he realized was what that ferociouslooking baring of teeth actually was he was smiling he had gold tusks and wire whiskers gray skin and muscles that would have put a bull to shame his name was tunnel simple really what was he acting so perplexed about with all the feigned calm he could muster dariel said hello tunnel very glad to make your acquaintance since youre not going to eat me would you consider loosening these chains this amused the giant more than anything yet listen that how pretty you speak i told her we should keep your tongue in your mouth good we did dariel creased his forehead i wouldnt disagree with you no you wouldnt you be agreeable for sure best that way he inched his stool closer tell me you really a prince akaran for true had he anything to go on dariel would have weighed the pros and cons of answering this question but he knew nothing about what had happened what was happening where he was or in whose power without anything to shape his answer he shrugged and chose the truth yes whats your name then im dariel akaran son of leodan and aleera akaran saying the names dariel felt a tide of indignation sweep up from his guts in leodans name i demand you loosen these chains this minute im a prince of acacia you cannot dariel the man said rolling it around his mouth as he pronounced it dariel akaran son of leodan and aleera i know them names you know we all know them names and the ones before gridulan yes my grandfather thats the one tinhadin and them old devils too we know them all edifus dariel shifted trying to ease the pressure of the strap around his chest he already felt his indignation slipping away though he could not have said why you know much of my family i see i dont know anything of you or of here of where i am or you dont know anything tunnel said this with considerable joy clearly he had suspected as much already but he appeared pleased that dariel confirmed it dont know a knuckles worth and look you a prince could be you more than that could be you rhuin fa rune fay tunnel scowled an expression only slightly more unnerving than his smile thats wrong way to say it rhuin fa he repeated enunciating with exaggerated lip and tongue motions for a long timei mean a long timewe been waiting for rhuin fa rhuin fa is a person its you maybe is the one who will come from the old land and flip the world thats what they say flip the world can you do that tunnel broke into his horrifying smile again rhuin fa supposed to come for his children take them home tell how much he love them understand we been waiting a long time generations you know pass pass pass he waved his thick fingers impatiently indicating these passing generations all the time hoping for rhuin fa all the time thinking he coming knowing he cant go on doing that way forever he drew back pursed his lips and squinted one eye nearly closed you know its wrong dont you what they done to all us children thats why you need to flip it somehow scattered and vague and incomplete as this was dariel knew what crime tunnel was referring to i know its wrong he acknowledged he felt further words running up his throat and out onto his tongue explanations qualifications he had been ignorant for so long he had inherited the quota trade he had been a child too the crime was not his doing but it had been thrust on him he could have said a lot of things it was not as if he hadnt talked it all through with aliver and mena and wren with everyone close to him except corinn with her the subject seemed more dangerous than he had felt ready for he could have said a great deal instead he bit the words back aware that he did not know enough yet of this world to say anything with certainty am i your prisoner what will you do with me and the others whats happened you not my prisoner mor the one she come talk to you real soon he answered that much but did not seem interested in opening himself to further questioning instead he said i should ask you something i ask you answer tale says its that way tale says when rhuin fa come you ask him this question then you know if he is who he is so let me ask you heres the bridge you go under it or over it which one a bridge what kind of bridge tunnel shrugged waited dariel stared blankly for a moment over it i go over that could be right could be dont you know which answer is right you know tunnel said wrapping his fingers around the curve of one of his tusks and tugging tale dont tell believe that tale dont tell you may have answered true i guess we gonna see soon too seeing that tusk in his fingers watching the way tunnel pulled on it and the manner with which it seemed to be embedded directly into his lower jaw dariel closed his eyes he had a million questions to ask where to start and could he really ask them of this strange man what was he anyway dariel opened his eyes tunnel was watching him for the first time dariel noted the color of the other mans eyes brown simple brown he asked you think i am rhuin fa could be you are i tell you what though dont matter what i believe he nodded his head toward the door from which came the sound of a key sliding home she going to be hard to convince tunnel rose but paused and turned back you know senival yes tunnel studied him a moment his eyes looking at dariel but seeing something else i he hooked a stout finger to his chest i senival you understand dariel did he nodded the door began to swing open for some reason it seemed important that whoever walked in see him already on good terms with the giant tunnel how did you get your name is it just a name or is it tunnel as in ah tunnel you know i like tunnels tunnel said always did since i was tiny i like to go through see better than go over for me thats so it looked like he might have had more to say but he shrugged it off flashed his frightening grin and left the room since he was tiny dariel found that hard to imagine what had the tiny tunnel looked like was he gray with baby tusks alone with his chains dariel stoked the embers within him back into a blaze by the giver what was the meaning of all this each portion of itthe league betrayal the lothan aklun slaughter being led a prisoner to the auldek watching sire neen beheaded being abducted and jailed by a tusked man named tunnelwas a different coal that burned where it touched him the fact that it was all confounding and unexplained only made him angrier when he met this mor he would spit in her face coolly and make her know the depths of her mistake in treating him so he would say his name slowly so that she would hear and realize it and understand that these chains did nothing to change who he was or lessen the wrath he could throw down upon her he stirred from daydreams some time later realizing two people had entered the room dariel exhaled a steadying breath he would make a strong impression he would be forceful unafraid confident he would ask the questions and manage to do so without revealing his ignorance quite as he had to tunnel he told himself all these things confident that he was already better prepared than he had been a few minutes earlier he would greet mor by name so decided he turned his head toward the two new arrivals one was the whiteheaded woman he had glimpsed earlier she was dressed in loosefitting trousers and a matching shirt both of them in a sky blue that matched the shading around her eyes and the strange shocks ofwell hair presumablythat screeched back from her forehead as if she were plummeting through the air at high speed the skin of her face was eggshell white and her nose was slightly elongated pointed to a thin tip that looked almost dangerous the other figure was just as striking more so perhaps for she was much more scantily clad with a tightfitting wrap around her chest and another around her hips she was covered from the thighs all the way up with the spotted pattern of a leopard a cat in human form she strode toward him on two sinewy legs as lithe and thin as that animal and looking just as delicately powerful dariel had not known what to expect of his captor but he would never have imagined this still he recognized the air of command in her posture he managed a resigned half smile you must be mor she strode straight toward him without an alteration in her focusas if the entire walk across the room and what was to follow were all part of a single motionshe drew one hand out her fingers crooked in tense hooks she smacked him across the face with all the force she could muster not only did she smack him but she also dragged the stubby clawlike protrusions at her fingertips through his flesh the sudden pain of the blow snapped his head around and sent him reeling in the moments after as he fought to get his breath back he felt the gouges carved across his cheek and nose and lips bloom with blood from just outside the door tunnel said oh not the face he sounded more amused than shocked dariel worked his jaw things were not going well but pain is useful he thought im fully awake now for example is that what passes for a greeting here strange custom if youd be kind enough to loosen my wrist chains id be happy to return the greeting the bird woman said mor dont but not soon enough mor slapped him with her other hand harder if that was possible than the first time it took dariel a moment longer to regain his breath than he would have liked he kept his voice calm though when he said its easy to hit a bound man punish me as much as you like mor get it over with then id like to shut up the woman moved so quickly he could not respond at all he was about to finish the sentence with talk but in the space between the two words mor smacked the heel of her palm against his head driving it back against the stones of the wall he did not even feel the impact as pain he just blacked out the womans patterned face from up close wild with anger was the last thing he saw c hapter t wentythree help yourself its good whiskey isnt it delivegu asked he leaned back in his chair and lifted his booted feet onto his desk it is that his guest a man named yanzen said he did help himself filling his silver mug for the third or fourth time youre not charging this to my debt are you no sir were not gaming anymore this is leisure between friends leisure and pleasure leisure and pleasure he pointed at a pipe and the weed pouch on the table have a smoke as well without preamble or apparent provocation yanzen said youre a bastard delivegu laughed he did not dispute it or take offense he was a bastard after all the child of a young woman who had been raped by a senivalian knight one drunken evening he could not really say the epithet troubled him especially as he had received from his parents qualities that he was rather thankful for his fathers physical stature and his mothers rejection of anything like a moral compass both these things had served him well considering his recent interactions with the queen the traits looked set to help him rise considerably they were in the room that delivegu kept as an office space during the day with the small cot in the corner it was also a place to sleep after particularly overdoing it in the tavern below despite the wear of thirtynine years of life his body still enjoyed debauchery with a youthful frequency even now he took notice of the sounds of the evenings revelries that reached them through the floor and walls yanzen picked up the pipe held it close to his neatly trimmed whiskers and sniffed its not mist tainted is it such distrust whos to say its distrust i wouldnt mind a good mist haze every once in a while yanzen opened the weed pouch pinched out a wad and jammed it in the pipe the motions had a coarse quality that was at odds with his neat garments and manicured fingernails and the aquiline grace of his mature features yanzen like many whom delivegu associated with had more than one face he had been in the service of the saden household since he was a boy of five first as an errand boy later tending the familys horses for a time he trained as second to sigh sadens youngest son before the lad succumbed to a fever in recent years he had risen to be head of the household servants it was this positionwith the great many intimacies it provided him access tothat made him a person of interest to delivegu something his masters surely did not know was that yanzen had an affinity for gambling and a considerable appetite for prostitutes sharing such vices delivegu and yanzen had been on good terms for some time the fact that yanzen owed delivegu an evergrowing sum of money had not dampened their friendship indeed it seemed to warm both men to each other so said yanzen blowing a cloud of smoke between them have you parted the queens thighs yet is she as sweet as she looks or is it all ice inside her opinions differ you know saden boasted the other night that she likes to suck toes is that true nothing in delivegus expression betrayed how close he came to reaching across the desk with a fist he could not have said why he found the comment so infuriating but the notion that any part of sigh sadens body would get near the queens mouth flushed him with angry heat it was a lie of course being a man who never had to lie about his conquests delivegu despised those who did thats how he explained it to himself at least he said i doubt saden has anything else that she could suck on either that or his toes dwarf his manhood just as likely no im not out to bed her he paused to let the lie sit a moment and then continued with something more reasonable sounding that way lies madness i have higher aspirations i intend to be indispensable to her do you now and what does she think about that she already calls on me about delicate matters she has no chancellor you know nor does she want one from among her class you fancy yourself in line for the chancellorship then in a manner of speaking delivegu said he loosened a few buttons on his shirt no matter the tailoring he requested his shirts always cramped his shoulders yes i know there are matters of birth to be considered but you let me worry about that of course ill look kindly on those who aid my endeavors which are in truth the queens endeavors as he finished off his whiskey yanzen watched him over his mug wiping the foam from the sides of his mouth he asked what can i do for you then you want somebody dead in the saden household most anything could be arranged so long as we price it first no i hold the entertaining assignments for myself its just information im after your breadth of knowledge interests me who in your mind is the queens greatest enemy among the nobles yanzen shrugged whos to say flip any of them over and youll see a snakes tail coming out his ass its the truth senator or landowner estate lord ormale and female both mind youthey all speak treason when they speak of the queen do they plot plot naw they dont plot that requires more cunning than most of them have i cant say that any of them are a danger maybe sigh himself but hed as soon marry corinn as anything else drop his old wife in a second he would but so many of the agnates are new blood they dont know how to be nobles yet before hanishback then the court and the senate were rife not just with snakes but with pit vipers these new noblesfew of them have any venom in their bites the hostages for example back before hanish sending off noble sons and daughters never meant much they expected it part of their burden theyd love their heir right enough but they wouldnt lose sleep when thaddeus clegg plucked a child away to stay at court these new agnates though they worry wonder whats going on over at that academy visit whenever they can theyre just not used to their offspring being moved about like game pieces the bitch played that right he leaned back enjoying the smoke and looking ever more at ease anyway they mostly chew their gums for the majority life is better now than it was before corinn ascended they dont want to upset that delivegu had flinched slightly at the word bitch its just a word he thought a coarse word that shouldnt be used in relation to corinn but nothing to comment on as for the rest of his friends counsel he would have to measure it later for he was skeptical that the agnates were as harmless as yanzen thought he had been too long in their company perhaps although that was also why he might be right about them and what about the common people delivegu asked those they all worry about does your master ever talk about barad some call him barad the lesser an agitator from kidnaban heard the name sigh disregards him a man like him cant see any commoner as a threat most of them arent yanzen must have heard some gravity in delivegus voice for he pulled the pipe from his mouth and studied him you think barad might be a threat delivegu tipped the dregs of the flagon into his mug his name has reached my ears he worries me he shouldnt be important and yet i feel he is methinks youre besotted yanzen said what was it you saidindispensable to the queen or some such she is a swan that breaks your neck just as youre about to compliment her on the beauty of her wings mind me on that i dont think shes likely to bed you either not even in the comfort of her own compound from what i hear she hates it that her brother took up with a commoner shes going to hate it even more soon what do you think about the princes bastard to be delivegu had been about to drink he paused squinting one eye what do you mean you dont know when delivegu did not answer immediately yanzen smiled you dont do you that amuses me i know something that you dont came by it easily as well perhaps its worth something some reduction of my debt anything is possible if the information proves sound delivegu said then he added in clipped tones tell me he had already waited an hour on the staircase balcony when delivegu finally heard someone descending toward him as the person rounded the rock wall he saw that it was rhrenna the queens assistant bit of a disappointment she was not exactly pretty a little thin lipped and pallid for his tastes still he liked the lines of her neck and the delicate muscles etched there perhaps more than anything he liked that she was such a close confidante of the queen sleeping with her might pale in comparison but he would not turn her away in the right circumstances he looked her up and down in a manner that conveyed this possibility to her she showed no sign that she acknowledged it but he knew better tell me rhrenna do you ever miss your homeland its a shame dont you think that mein tahalian has been abandoned must be caved in and crushed beneath the snow and ice by now and nearly all meinish men massacred that must trouble you so few left to choose from how is one to maintain racial purity in such circumstances i trust youve learned by now that men of other races can fill in just rhrenna cut in all cold business i will hear your message she kept her chin tilted upward it was a nice chin delivegu decided he thought about nibbling it but that must wait for another time oh i thought you were just here to make small talk with me delivegu said i wrote to you saying to get the queen and saying to make haste he let his eyes drift down from her face and linger on her bosom and slim waist unless my eyes deceive me you are not the queen and ive been kept waiting about as long as i will wait get the queen or youll be sorry you didnt you dont order me much less the queen what is your business if i deem it merits the queens attention ill speak to her about it oh come now you know the queen meets with me im in her trust i am in her trust rhrenna corrected you handle certain business for her when she summons you you do not however summon her if you assumed otherwise be now corrected delivegu stepped nearer close enough that he could smell the fragrant oils scenting her neck its no whim dear girl that brings me here face turned to the side so that he had to study her askance he whispered likely when you think of me at night its as a rogue a bandit who sneaks into your room perhaps and rhrenna jerked her head to turn away his hand shot up and stopped her at the shoulder i wouldnt disavow that therell be time later but right now i swear to you my lady your mistress will want to know what i have to tell her its about her family line tell it to me then corinn said she came around the corner and down the steps toward them and it had better be good if not ill take your impertinence as a sign that business is concluded delivegu stepped away from rhrenna he bowed low holding the position secure in the knowledge that the muscles of his shoulders and back strained against his thin shirt he said before you proclaim my doom your majesty consider my message i could have shared it with your maid i am not a maid rhrenna snapped but the moment you heard it youd call for me nor would you want it committed to paper and id wager youd not want to wait until wed arranged another of those clandestine meetings he straightened enjoying the word clandestine and drawing it out slightly ive only been anticipating your desires the royal visage remained dangerously annoyed she was a viper this one he got to the point the lady your brother shares a bed with wrenshes with child the queens face went blank she looked for a moment as if she were completely devoid of thought her lovely head empty and his to fill delivegu kept his smile from showing i see he said that youre wondering how i come to know so much about the ways of a courtly lady i can detail that for you and he did he left out any mention of yanzen and instead told a tale largely fabricated his information originated with sources far too low and disreputable for corinn even to know their names through these shifty agents he claimed to have learned of a prostituteor whore really for this one was on the lower end of that professionwho had bragged about having certain knowledge about the princes consort apparently her cousin worked in the house of a surgeon whose wife served as midwife to some of the wretched in the lower town its a bit complicatedthe whole webbut bear with me how wren came in contact with such a woman the whore could not say sought her out to keep the whole thing secret he figured far away from the palace the whore swore that her cousin was in the very room when the midwife confirmed the girls pregnancy in her opinion the woman looked healthy and there was no reason to think the child was in any danger at present but there it was the prince had a child on the way the girl is thrilled wants the pup couldnt get enough of rubbing her hands over her belly even though she doesnt show yet this last detail he had made up on the spot but he imagined it wasnt far from true rhrenna was the first to speak this is not possible why not what makes it impossible the queen turned and placed her hands atop the stone railing the sun was low on the horizon and orange highlights touched her features her face was not blank anymore but it was as unreadable as it was beautiful when she spoke she might have been addressing her assistant more than delivegu wren is not supposed to be able to get pregnant a tincture mixed into her tea years ago took the capacity from her or so i was told that may yet be true the secretary said wren has said nothing about this how can we be sure this whore told the truth delivegu crossed one arm over his chest and stroked his beard with the fingers of his other hand could be he said pitching his voice as thoughtful as if he were just now thinking it through with her encouragement that wren doesnt want you to know i dont know why that would be but women have their reasons as for the whore well i interrogated her how rhrenna asked you wouldnt like to hear all of it he almost insisted that be his final answer but he found himself speaking anyway something about shocking themespecially rhrennaexcited him the end was this i took her hand and spread it on the table and said that id take her fingers off one at a time until she told me the truth until i believed her corinn asked coolly was it necessary to take her fingers the threat didnt carry much weight unless i cut her to prove i meant it i took one just a wee one though and did she change her story when you raised the knife again well yeah she did he admitted but id just cut off her finger she mustve figured i didnt want to hear what she was saying so she changed her story you cant fault her for that though like i said shes clever anyway i believed her i let her keep the other nine digits and we were both happy barbaric corinn said still looking out at the setting sun and flawed cutting off fingers is no way to get at truth delivegu could not have disagreed with her more he did not like the word barbaric either or that he was doubted i saw the girl myself he said it just came out the lie leaped off his tongue before he had weighed its usage completely rhrenna asked you saw wren yes i wouldnt trust a whore without seeing for myself of course so i verified it with my own eyes she did visit the midwife to himself he thought if that girl lied losing her fingers will be the least of her concerns corinn said wren was a brigand its natural she would seek out lowborn assistance but it may be that wren suffers some other illness your source may be mistaken about the details rhrenna murmured agreement or it may be that your brothers bedmate has a pup in her the words came out harsher than he intended frustration beginning to heat him thats what id bet on you dont suppose they just sleep in that bed do you like brother and sister he wondered if he had gone too far for some reason his normal assurance seemed a flimsy thing when speaking with the queen it was there yes but he always felt as if a breeze could blow it away at any moment i beg your pardon your majesty i dont mean to be coarse i dont care if youre coarse or not corinn said i care that you serve me well thats yet to really be seen you spoke to the whore but what of her cousin or the midwife herself i didnt want to stir suspicion before bringing it to you best they think youre ignorant of the deceit for the time being the whore wont run to her cousin straightaway or warn wren that some brute was asking after her delivegu frowned did she think him a brute brutal actions dont make a brute hed have to teach her that no i dont think she will he answered believe me i know this sort she cares most about herself and her other nine fingers and other bits after that as well you may doubt me all you like your majesty but it wont change the facts i simply wanted you to know i want to be of use to you i hope you know that the queen turned from the now red sun exhaled and leaned back against the railing you are as helpful to me in your way as mena or dariel or rialus or any other adviser she said the frankness of the statement and the flat manner in which she delivered it caught delivegu off guard he tried to respond with some wry quip but nothing came to him he wanted other things from her things not so noble but he had spoken with unusual honesty when he said he wanted to be of use perhaps she was reciprocating that you know delivegu rule is a burden people believe it a privilege a gift a great luxury none of them know a thing about it im sure your majesty that none is more capable of carrying the burden than you tinhadin would have liked you as daughter that thought caused her to pause for a moment she almost seemed amused by it but whatever melancholy had hold of her now prevailed i get a grip on this over here she continued showing the area she meant with a tented hand only to learn that this over there has gone awry she brought her other hand into play and then wiped both away with a flick of her fingers i get a grip on that and two new problems fall from the sky i deal with those and then five foul weeds sprout beneath my feet why will it never hold still for a moment that time will come rhrenna said her face tight with concern she touched the queen on the arm in a manner that suggested it was time for them to go shes not happy sharing the queens confidence with me delivegu thought get used to it girl its peace you crave he asked were at peace now and still nothing is peaceful your majesty delivegu said again surprised to find himself speaking honestly you set yourself too great a task if you wish to make the entire world peaceful it has never been that wayor not since the giver abandoned us perhaps chaos is the natural order to be embraced tranquillity might not make you as happy as you imagine it might seem a bit like death what about bringing peace to my own family then that should not be too much for a queen to manage what you think we are at peace whybecause i smile and say i love my siblings and they do the same dont you of course i do only they know me she cut her line of thinking with a sharp tick of her head to one side it must have pained her for she touched a hand to her forehead as if suddenly struck with a headache i didnt ask to be the queen all my girlhood it was aliver who was going to rule that was fine with me what troubles you your highness delivegu asked tell me and i will find a way to fix it delivegu i have powers beyond what you can imagine i dont boast when i say that its the truth but that was true of tinhadin toohe whom you would have be my father one day ill explain to you why thats not the compliment you think it is she fixed her eyes on him and for a moment seemed surprised at what she found why am i talking to you like this ill tell you why because ive just recently learned my sister has been snatched from the world by a dragon she may live she may be dead she may fight the beast still i dont know like anyone else i have to wait to learn of her fate i want her here with me now i want dariel here with me instead of on the other side of the world i want both those things yet its i who sent them away and i would do it again the moment they returned you see i cannot be a sister first and then the queen its the other way around so you tell me that i may be aunt to my brothers child but i know that i cannot be an auntnot if the queen forbids it not if the queen decides a bastard born to a brigand girl from candovia will hurt the akaran name maybe even threaten the heir do you understand me he was not sure he understood all of it but he believed he caught the relevant thrust if wrens child will cause problems i will deal with wren and you may well have a part in it delivegu nodded most pious the very fact that you say it fills me with joy with purpose you tell me what to do and i will do it anything do nothing right now corinn said she blinked slowly fatigue on her nothing right now the queen needs to think it through he watched her and rhrenna as they ascended the staircase and moved out of view as the wall curved away a short sweet view it was one day he thought ill walk those steps beside you both may that day come soon c hapter t wentyfour even though he lived every moment of it rialus managed to disbelieve the entire ordeal how could he credit such madness what in all his years of life would have prepared him for the shoving bloodspattered roaring chaos that erupted after devoth beheaded sire neen the ishtat soldier beside him lost his arm at the shoulder his scream was so horrific that rialus felt like it came from his own mouth the flailing man drenched rialus in a spray of blood which he slipped in as he tried to back away there on the floor he was smeared across the stones stepped on and kicked he swam through bodies and severed limbs and once found his fingers entangled in a leaguemans entrails he had retched so hard and long he would happily have coughed up his internal organs to end it if all that was not bad enough when he was yanked up off the floor it was an auldek hand that gripped him auldek hands slapped sense into him auldek eyes probed his as they dragged him from the chamber he saw not one living acacian it was hard for him to remember what he saw but he knew it had to have been a scene of hellish carnage when they left him alone rialuss thoughts flew away from the details of his present horror he thought through the pain to recall gurta he recalled all the things that had been that might have been and that had slipped from his grasp she had loved him really she had she had said so time and again in her plain lowborn acacian he had seen her love on her softfeatured face and felt it in her caresses and known the truth of it when her body welcomed him each eveningas well as during the morning afternoon sometimes in the wee hours of the night he had planted a child in her imagine that a part of him living within her rialus made immortal a boy child to carry his name and build up his fortune a child he alone could educate about the world and shape in his image better than that he could shape him in the image of what rialus dreamed he might have been now that fatherly role was destroyed it seemed so dim and distant a possibility that rialus gave himself over to grief he did not know what was to happen to him but he knew nothing would ever be the same he cried sobbed he writhed on the floor in physical and emotional anguish spitting out the blood that pooled in his mouth he was in just such throes of selfpity when calrach found him the numrek crouched beneath the low door frame and entered the room his bulk immediately made the space seem tiny uncomfortably cramped he stood a moment taking rialus in and then asked whats wrong with you rialus focused on him and despite his misery tried to find a way to answer the question nothing he could come up with seemed the right thing to say to the numrek calrach righted a stool that rialus had overturned and lowered himself onto it he swept back his black hair with both hands squeezed it into a tail and wrapped a leather band around it after tying it he set his bigknuckled hands on his knees and said you have a decision to make in store for you if you displease the auldekthe numrek rolled back his eyes as he considered the possibilitiesoh a poker shoved up your ass thats likely also ive seen times when they bend your shoulder back bend it hard hard like so you feel the bone is going to jump out of the socket thats pain then they pull a knife redhot from the fire a thin thin thin sliver of a blade with it they just touch your flesh tiny touch no more weight behind it than a feather but the blade is so redhot sharp and your skin so taut that that feather touch splits the surface and youll want to avoid that too i think i did nothing you are big stuff now calrach said only acacian they got dariel dead i suppose havent found his body yet though messy in there you know they think youre a leagueman but no matter they have questions for you just answer them youll betray nobody who hasnt already betrayed you mein akarans the league piss on them all play it right neptos and you may outlive them rialus stared at him hating him and completely mystified by him piss on them all did this imbecile really think rialus would betray everything in the known world not that he even could but what have you done his voice was just barely more than a whimper and why why why did you the queen gave you privileges you lived just as you wanted servants and cooks and calrach raised a hand and made a chattering motion with his fingers blah blah neptos stop blathering those things dont matter to you maybe but to us no thats no way to live not for us but you wont understand why waste words enjoy your last days yeah enjoy them and know that you died for a good cause the numrek cause he guffawed crouched forward and smacked rialus on the shoulder with a surfeit of force rialus pulled his knees to his chest and lay like an infant on his side vile he said vile vile vile i hate you shame we liked you neptos remember when we used to make you run and throw spears at you oh you were quick when you needed to be again calrach could barely contain his mirth vile you think so why because we dont speak like you dont eat what you eat you think you know us but deceiving you was like telling tales to children simple boring easy and it was misery thats what it was but you never knew us true some land some servants working for that bitch queen you think we wanted that took pride in that youwho know us better than most acaciansshould have known better those years in acacia exile disgrace you dont care about disgrace do you to a numrek honor is all that and belonging we need to belong understand belong he drew this last word out making sure rialus acknowledged it before he would move past it we didnt over there in your lands not without our totem and our people rialus noting what sounded like melancholy in calrachs voicean unfathomably strange emotion for himlooked up he had thought numrek faces capable of only a few crude expressions of anger but he realized he had been wrong perhaps he had never looked closely enough never wanted to settle his eyes on their craggy features for longer than he had to right now though staring at calrach he saw shades of melancholy and regret and shame and ambition all betrayed in the lines of his eyes and forehead and lips and jagged teeth what are you talking about we could not live as exiles forever they stripped us of our totem they made us beasts instead of men and kicked us to the north in shame who did rialus asked the auldek you fool they are chief among the clans theyand the othersdrove us from ushen brae they called us filth and took our slaves and burned our totem calrach seemed at the verge of one of his cursing tirades but he blew it out of the side of his mouth and kept on did we tell you these things no why should we the mein didnt care about the truth when they bought our blades the akarans hate the truth so we gave them lies instead we let them all think they buy us and order us around what does it matter what they think tilting his head calrach exhaled a long breath we have lived wrong for years now we wish to live right again what terrible thing did you do to be driven from here in the first place calrach shot him a dangerous glance ill get the torturer now he began to rise but rialus blurted no no dont ahh he had spoken too forcefully the pain of it reverberated through him for a few closedeyed seconds when he opened his eyes again calrach sat watching him dont leave he said you came to tell me things please do so i will calrach said after a moment hear these things i wont tell you twice in ushen brae no auldek or numrek or any other clannone of ushad given birth to a child in hundreds of years not a single birth no children you hear thats right i am not the youthful man i look i dont remember my birth year anymore but believe me i have lived long long but you do have children ive seen dont rush it now i will keep this simple for you the lothan aklun arrived here in their boats they looked weak they wanted to lay claim to our barrier isles they were not warriors but they were powerful with magic they trapped us with that magic they showed us tricks made flames erupt in the sky made the ground shake they even killed with nothing more than whispered words they said they would pay for the isles with a great gift they would give us eternal life you hear me rialus they promised to make us immortal and they did rialus said but you are not immortal ive seen numrek die in battle you fear death like any man more than any man perhaps dont interrupt what i am telling you they create immortality by taking souls out of one body and putting them inside another we could contain two three ten lives within us this they had the magic to do the image of the auldek leader with an arrow in his chest twisting and shaking like a thing possessed popped into rialuss head devoth yeah you saw that yeah you thought devoth dead from that arrow good shot true but only one of his souls died because of it thats why he rose again and with the blade of his hand calrach imitated a sword slicing through his neck no he has many souls within him i used to as well you could call it sorcery lothan aklun sorcery its kept us alive all these years but it came at a price at the same time as they made us immortal they took away our fertility we could live forever but we learned we could no longer have children quite a trickgiving one kind of immortality taking another at the same time they did this to the slaves as well none of them grow to birth their own young in ushen brae none of them this is a childless land all these years weve been childless except for the souls inside us and for the quota when the lothan aklun began to trade through the league we had all the souls we could want coming to us from your lands but we wanted more yes for their labor to work for us and take care of our every need but not just that also they became our children slaves but children too and because none of us could bear young either we always needed more understand he asked but did not wait for an answer ill tell fast listen the auldek have many laws too many the numrek broke one we were punished they took our souls from us burned our totems exiled us made us trek into the ice burned your totems rialus asked totems calrach waved his impatience later about that stick to the points neptos we marched north nothing with us but our weapons clothes those were bad times when we first walked into the north many died of the shame of it many thought death was the best escape i felt it myself numrek dont kill themselves but we can wish for it we can take risks hunt snow lions the white bears you ever kill a walrus with an ax its no sure thing i tell you anyway truth is i believed the numrek were doomed to vanish in the ice then something happened you know what rialus did not have a clue and his face indicated as much one of our women got a child in her first in hundreds of years first one and then another he laughed low and obscene and then we screwed like rats we were having children again neptos you have no child so you may not know what this means but it was a wonderful thing we thought to go back to ushen brae show them the children but we were exiled we couldnt and some said that the birthing only returned because we had passed out of ushen brae and had escaped some curse we did not want to go back and lose the gift again and then we met the mein and got better ideas you know the rest or some of it you know is it making more sense now it was starting to but rialus still shook his head which was pounding he put much effort into speaking clearly what of the numrek back in acacia in the palace and in teh they will have it hard but they are ready for that as soon as they know weve made it here they will rise kill the bitch kill others you know he gestured with his fingers that surely rialus could imagine the possible scenes kill kill that sort of thing and then theyll hole up and wait why did it seem the more he knew the less it made sense wait for what they were worlds away they had no ships the numrek back in the known world could cause much bloodshed but they would eventually be defeated the league would not tolerate any of this the lothan aklun were no more and surely their sorcery went with them the numrek may not have planned or intended that but what calrach described was a confusion not a situation that should please him so i still dont understand okay calrach said leaning close last thing i had an idea yeah what if i got back to ushen brae came home and told what we found told all the auldek that a new world awaited them a world full of humans to hunt to enslave a rich world in which all the auldek could again have children what if i promised them that and showed them the proof of it my son you think maybe they would lift the exile maybe they would give us our totem back yeah maybe they would march with us across the ice and down into glorious battle toward the conquest of your known world his grin could not have gotten any wider pretty good idea huh i thought so the league made it even easier by taking me across the gray slopes hated that but good news devoth and the others like the idea too not my fault the league killed the lothan aklun no blame on me no instead i bring them hope i bring them a new world and thats it rialus thought thats the truth of it the things that were happening were not just about him and dariel and sire neen not even about corinn oh how she would rage if she knew but it wasnt about her either it was about everything this is about the entire known world and everyone in it anyway there it is you know ill get somebody to torture you now fun for you fun for him everyones happy no rialus shouted no that wont be necessary crossing his arms calrach grimaced a show of mock confusion that clearly meant he was not confused at all no why not what does devoth want from me calrach smiled i know you neptos i knew i was right i told them as much said always a weasel he is hell turn is that right it pleases me that youre so true to your nature devoth wants everything you can tell him everything hell need to plan his attackthe numrek shook his head at the irony of iton your nation you neptos are an important man play it right and it might be very good for you in answer rialus curled back into his ball lying on his side with his knees tight to his chest herialus neptos so often maligned laughed at joked withwas in a singular position to affect events he would find a way to do so he swore he would talk with devoth he told himself that he would not help destroy his people he also told himself that he would aim at getting back to gurta and seeing his child he did not acknowledge which of these was his greater priority c hapter t wentyfive the play of the sun on the rolling blondgrassed hills was wonderful soothing mena sat with the first rays of light and warmth on her skin taking in the world around her for miles and miles the land buckled away into the distance in smooth mounds of shadow and gold spotted with outcroppings of rock that looked like islands a breeze blew steadily from the south hot air but not unpleasant in some ways mena felt alone in the entire world she wasnt though she most certainly wasnt beside her the lizard bird creature lay in a gentle curve her tail a river meandering through the grasses her head rested on a smooth rock eyes closed but moving beneath the thin membranes of eyelids even in slumberwhich she seemed quite fond ofshe was never entirely insensible to the world her senses seemed to work nostrils flaring on occasion the small protrusions that marked the ears adjusting to slight sounds mena still could not believe the events of the last few days had actually happened but there she was all the feathered reptilian delicate beauty of her and here she was sitting beside the creature inexplicably healed of every injury she had received during her fall she knew that melio and the others would be scouring the countryside for her and she felt bad knowing they would be desperate worried melio especially she sometimes spoke his name wishing that he could hear it on the wind and know she was thinking of him that sadness was a small feature of her mood in truth she was content in a way that she could not explain four days prior when she realized the creature was alive and awake and watching her ministrations over her body her heart had hammered so fiercely in her chest she feared it might explode she could not have said exactly why it was not fear for her life she had just examined the animals shattered form with her own eyes and knew she could be little threat nor was she surprised at being watched once she realized the beasts eyes were on her it felt right that they should be as if she had wished it herself and made it so there was an element of amazement that the creature could live after mena had been so certain she was dead more than anything mena felt a frantic urgency a soaring of possibility that had no specific details but that seemed as important as anything in her life mena withdrew a few steps she sat on a stone and stared at the creature who looked back at her fixedly together they passed the better part of an hour that way the creature had emerald eyes the irises sparkled with a metallic sheen they filled the entirety of the eye sockets they did not show fear they did not betray aggression or hunger either that there was intelligence behind the eyes was palpable but they were just watching mena felt she was being probed as much as she was probing and she found herself hoping the creature liked what she saw they could not remain in this standoff forever though when mena saw the creatures slim tongue taste the air for a moment she had an idea rising slowly she motioned with her good arm that everything was all right stay calm she whispered stay ill be right back just stay she knew she should feel foolish talking to an animal but she did not as she hobbled her way back up the slope that she had earlier descended she wished she had said more if the lizard bird somehow was not there when she returned she would curse herself for not having said more even though she had no idea what that more might have been it seemed to take forever to climb down into the other ravine and reach the river again she was slick with sweat and had to sit for a time panting fighting to push back the fatigue and pain pulsing everywhere in her body opening her pack and rummaging about in it for something that would hold water made for another pathetic routine fortunately she did find the leather bowl that she used to brew healing teas she scooped clear water from the river and drank it then scooped more rising without the use of her damaged arm was hard enough but picking up the floppy bowl was another matter it took her several tries before she finally had it cupped in her palm relatively full when she peered over the ridge again the creature was exactly as she had left her lying in the same shattered posture but the long neck was bowed as she inspected her wings and torso a good bit of the water had splashed out of the bowl by the time mena reached the creature but she offered what remained she set the bowl down as best she could spilling still more and then she backed away the creature did not take her eyes off mena until she had stood some time at a short distance then the creature examined the bowl looked up and considered mena head cocked and then sank the tip of her snout into the water and drank and then the staring match began again they spent most of the afternoon at it again mena felt inclined to speak she could not find the words though and the creature seemed increasingly content with her presence that was enough mena slept that night on the slope a little distance away and awoke to find the creature grooming herself if grooming it could be called she looked much like a cat licking itself but she did not use her tongue everyplace she might have licked she instead rubbed with the flat bottom of her snout she was precise in the motions careful especially when tending the shredded membranes of her wings just looking at them shot mena through with regret that damage was her fault hers she felt it as if in her own body forgetting as she watched it that she was in fact battered and broken herself from her close observation the day before she doubted the creature would ever be able to fly again not with so much of her wings destroyed when mena approached the creature drew semiupright she sent waves of tension out through her wing frames lifting them partially off the ground the fingerthin bones were still amazing to behold so flexible so powerful and so delicate at the same time it should have required bulges of muscle tissue and sinew to create the power mena had felt snatch her from the ground but instead the creatures wings remained works of thinlined art menas eyes drifted over them the wing membranes did not look as damaged as they had yesterday some of the spots that she thought had been pierced clean through had not been and some of the tears that had looked so ghastly the day before did not seem quite as horrible she wondered if she had been mistaken youre not as bad off as i thought she mused well obviously not id thought you dead before feathered plumes on the creatures neck rose for a moment and then settled back into position the creature pushed up on her forelegs lifted them from the ground and stood unsteadily on her hind legs shaking out her wings as she did so she looked up at the hill that separated them from the river studied it and set out walking toward it her steps were tentative at first her body swaying like a drunken persons she paused and after a few steadying moments drew her wings in first the left then the right the curl started at the tips and rolled tight as it neared the body somehow the motion tucked the membrane in with it and in the space of a few seconds she was wingless again with only two swirled nubs on the shoulders to indicate where the wings now nestled she loped up the slope and climbed over into the next valley she was in the river when mena joined her shivering like a child from the cold she danced in the small stream dipped the full length of her neck and tail in she puffed her plumage so that for seconds at a time she was covered with a bristling coat that then snapped back to smooth in the blink of an eye the wing nubs flexed a little but did not unfurl you are a bird arent you mena said she climbed out of the river turned back to it and thrust her snout into the water she drank deep and long green eyes flicking to mena occasionally the creature seemed at ease with her now not studying her as she had the previous day watching her mena felt as pleased as a cat lover watching her favorite feline she wanted to reach out and feel that soft strangely scaled plumage again before she realized it she had done just that her fingers tingled at the touch and she drew them back immediately she touched her nose smelling the citrus scent of the substance that seemed a part of the plumage it was not unpleasant not exactly oily but it was hard to know how else to describe it she was aware that the tingling in her fingertips continued and that she had passed the sensation on to her face it almost felt like she had inhaled it and now held it in her lungs she nervously wiped her fingers on her tunic still the creature drank having taken no notice of her touch or reaction to it sorry that drink yesterday wasnt much i tried though you know that now if we just had something to eat wed not be so bad off as if in answer the creature stretched her neck high and opened her nostrils with a few deep inhalations she rotated and tried the air to the south seemed to like what she found there and began to stride away more energy in her motions than just a moment before a little way down she turned and studied mena walked on a few steps and then bent her neck back and met her gaze again mena pressed the fingers of her good hand to her chest you want me to follow the creature did not answer of course but mena did exactly that it was no easy thing hobbling along over the uneven terrain early on she spent several frantic moments thinking she had lost the creature over a rise or behind a rock outcropping but each time she was there waiting looking back for her a few times the creature even seemed to respond to sighting her by raising the plumes on her neck a sign ofof what pleasure encouragement so the day passed they alone on a windblown landscape the two were still together that evening they spent the night in a small cluster of date trees a tiny ruin showed ancient inhabitation but whoever lived here had not done so for ages mena did not crowd the creature but she stayed near enough to be able to speak without raising her voice she told her about melio and the others who were likely hunting them right now theyre excellent trackers she explained theyll find us soon i dont know why but it seems very important to me that no more harm befalls you that seems like the most important thing in the world right now that you be safe perhaps im just tired of killing i should be i didnt mean to harm you though i just didnt expect you mena cut herself off she looked away shaking her head and then looked back at the creature those eyes were just as intent on her her mouth mena realized tilted near the back hinge of the jaw why is it that i want to talk to you so much you cant understand me its absurd you cant understand me right the creature stared at her stared of course she could not understand mena exhaled and reached for another date as she did so the creature nodded just a tiny dip of the head but enough to make mena pause was that an affirmation had the creature answered that she could understand or had she merely followed the motion of menas hand she wanted to ask but again staring into those round large innocent eyes it seemed a complete absurdity perhaps i bumped my head worse than i remembered mena had that same thought on waking the next morning before she knew what she was doing she moved to push herself up with both arms finding one encumbered by her stone splint she gave the arm a shake trying to dislodge the thing only after she had tugged at the knot in the cord that held it fast did she realize what she was doing and that snapped her fully awake the armher formerly broken battered armdid not hurt anymore she flexed her fingers and they moved without pain there was stiffness there was a memory of pain still in the tissue but there was no mistaking it her arm was nearly healed she loosened the splint and lifted the limb free and moved it in the air she sat staring at it utterly confused wondering if she had been crazy when she splinted a healthy arm or if she was crazy now for believing it healed and then she thought of the creature she jumped to her feet spun around until she found the familiar shape atop a nearby hillock the creature stood shuffling her feet impatiently waiting for mena she could have remained there disbelieving her sudden healing but it was as it was the creature had done it somehow because of herbeing with her touching her inhaling that citrus scentmena had healed just as the creature had come back from the brink of death and now showed only faint scars from the attack and this same creature wanted menas company just as she wanted to stay longer with her and so began another day of travel she already knew how it would go they searched for fruit and water the only two things the creature seemed to consume either she knew where the groves of trees grew and what fruit was ripe by memory or she smelled them on the air and followed her nose once when she scented something that excited her the creature tried to get mena to pick up the pace she ran forward and back churning up dust urging her on menas human gait was clearly not sufficient the creature bumped menas side and lowered her shoulder mena understood what she offered and was stunned she kicked her leg over the creatures spine and slowly slipped on top for a moment she clung there spreadeagled on the back the creature looked at her amused mena tried to find a better arrangement and there was one sitting upright straddling the creatures neck snug between the nubs of the wings with her positioned like that the creature moved forward falling into a loping reptilian run that mena would never forget the creature must also have known how to avoid humans for they saw nobody the entire day once they pillaged an apple orchard that showed signs of tending but evaded whatever souls might have been about atop a bluff on another occasion mena spotted a cluster of houses in the distance she could have walked to them in an hour and named herself and been among people again though she was hungry having eaten only fruit even lightheaded at times she did not yet want human company indeed she often scanned the horizon knowing that searchers were combing the countryside for her people she cared for and trusted who had fought beside her many a day the daily journey she and the creature kept at would be making it hard for the trackers but she was not sure she wanted to be found even by them even by melio not yet not until she understood this better as mena walked beside the creature on the afternoon of their third day together she said you need a name i mean a name for me to call you i cant think of you as lizard or bird or dragon mena stroked the creatures neck youre no dragon anyway youre gentler than that you need a real name she walked on in thought nibbling her thumbnail as she did so the creatures head rose and fell beside her bobbing on the curve of her neck my father once told me a tale about a boy who had a pet lizard its a bethuni tale i think the boy called the lizard elya he hatched it from an egg they were together always though the boys father did not at first like the animal being in his hut in bethuni lore orphans of any species are sacred good luck to those who care for them but the father was a selfish man who wanted to control all things and didnt like the love his son showed a mere reptile mena cut her eyes over to her companion no offense meant anyway he disliked it so much that one night when the boy was sleeping he grasped the lizard and carried it out into the night he tied it to a tree and used a spade to dig a hole the hole was to be the lizards grave and he was going to kill it before he finished digging his shovel struck something he reached in and pulled out a sack of gold coins ancient coins buried there long ago coins that nobody had a claim to and just like that he was a rich and important man it would never have happened if not for the lizard and he saw it as a sign from the gods that the creature was special he didnt kill it after all instead he took it home and woke his village with shouts of joy thats the tale my father told it better than i but thats most of it you know its a tale and not the truth because the selfish father became generous ive not seen that happen anywhere but in tales but i guess we need things to aspire to what do you think about elya as a name i believe it would suit you if i call you elya will you answer to it the creature perhaps noting the questioning rise in menas voice looked at her elya mena repeated adding a singsong quality to it elya how do i explain naming to you she tried several ways she was glad there was no one around to hear for she knew she would sound a fool or mad or both but she made a game of it she touched her nose and said mena and then touched the creatures snout and pronounced elyaaaa nothing not that mena knew what she expected what would indicate acceptance of the name she walked off a little distance and facing away began calling the name on turning around and seeing the creature her face lit with pleasure elya there you are mena named thing after thing touching ground and stone and grass and sky and mena and elya the creature narrowed her eyes at this the first look of suspicion she had made since mena had found and cleaned her body you think im mad mena said you may be right elya my elya not your elya but mine she found a rhythm in the lines and repeated it singsong and again and then she skipped away singing it loud dancing her arms swooping like wings the mirth came upon her complete like a serious father suddenly playing the fool for a childs amusement it worked the creature bent back her neck opened her mouth and coughed a quick barrage her neck rolled in jerky undulations so forceful that mena feared she was choking but then she stopped and looked back at mena relaxed and mirthful her eyes twinkled with amusement does that mean youll be my elya you will you already are i feel it mena tapped her chest with her fingers and then moved them to her collarbone and then as if unsure which spot she meant up to her head where she touched a finger to her temple inside me youre here she tapped again how can that be as usual the creature offered no answer but mena did not need one she knew elya was elya that night they slept within touching distance of each other and the next morning was the one on which she awoke beside elya with that strange feeling of contentment firmly lodged in her heart she sat taking in the rising sun to the east the rest of the human world seemed far off indeed blissfully so on that she was mistaken elyas head snapped to attention all relaxed slumber gone in an instant she stared over menas head to the north head cocked first to one side and then the other as she listened to something mena calmed the creature with a few soothing words with steadying motions of her hands she asked her to stay put and then on impulse she thought the same instructions she really did not understand it but she could not shake the feeling that she could send elya her thoughtsnot words or sentences but the import of a thing that was what she tried to pass silently to her stay when it seemed elya would do so mena turned and ran up the slope to get a better view she crested the hill and as the undulating landscape on the other side came fully into view she dropped flat bellied to the ground she had seen something shapes where she hoped there would not be shapes inching forward she peeked over the rise more carefully and saw exactly what she feared a wide wedge of humanity crawled across the hills hundreds of people spread out far to east and west many carrying torches that spit clots of slowrising smoke into the air from this vantage they were the main feature of the world a blight on it they were also she knew her people near the center of the front ranks a banner hung limp from a long pole she knew by its colors that it was the insignia of acacia the same one she had seen at kidnaban years ago as on that occasion this sighting filled her with dread she crawled backward when she reached elya she nearly said lets go part of her wanted to flee and knew that elya would do so with her but she did not say those words instead she stroked the creatures neck and rubbed under her chin and brushed the flat of her hand over the flare of her nostrils i cant run its not fair to them and it solves nothing just prolongs it theyre my people elya they love me you understand thats why theyve come she cradled the creatures head in the palms of her hands elya you can leave me why dont you do that run or fly if you can ill tell them not to hunt you anymore no one will hunt you i promise the minute she said this she knew it was a lie even if she could stop the akaranled hunting parties she would never be able to stop otherstribesmen trophy hunters any villain looking to make a profit from killing the last of the foulthings when word got out that elya was harmless it would be even worse still mena said you should just go not believing it but feeling she must say it she had to offer it had to make elya understand that she was free to choose her fate elya moved her head closer tilted it and touched the soft flat of her crown to menas forehead that was her answer you should just go the creature tapped her head against menas several times again her answer relief washed through mena suffusing her with warmth from head to toe even as worry wrapped her chest like iron ribbons trying to squeeze the air from her lungs okay love she said lets go introduce you to the world lets make an impression there was one way she hoped to present herself and elya in a manner that could stun her brave soldiers into the moment of hesitation she would need that was why she rode toward them with her legs over elyas shoulders and her thighs clenched tight and her arms wrapped around her neck for a time she rode blind letting her mount direct them she pressed her face against the plumage and loved the touch as greatly as any intimacy she had ever experienced but when she felt a tremor in the creatures muscles she drew herself up so that the eyes of everyone they rushed toward would see her elya carried right on toward the soldiers as they formed defensive lines and reached for weapons she did not slow until just before them it was hard to tell whether most of the party saw the creature or saw mena as well mena shouted her name telling them to drop their weapons but confusion surged through them so thick and loud she was afraid they did not hear she found melios face locked eyes with him and saw the frantic intensity there he could not have looked more perplexed still he shouted for the bowmen to be ready this elya did not like at all so quickly that mena could do nothing but gasp as it happened elya rose on her hind legs she unfurled her wings with the speed of two whips cracking the muscles in her neck stiffened to a steely flowing hardness her chest expanded with a great inhalation of air and then she smacked her wings down as if to break the earth they were airborne the force of it smashed mena against elyas back and knocked the wind from her lungs she clutched the creatures neck and as they hovered she fought to draw in enough breath to speak she saw how close melio was to ruining everything with a single command she did not have the breath yet so she mouthed the first words that came to her and hoped he would see them and understand silently she said i love her c hapter t wentysix early one evening in southern talay kelis lay staring at the stars amazed at how his life had taken this new direction so suddenly he had lived through the string of events but he had yet to catch up with them completely in his mind he had been summoned to bocoum to meet with sangae and sinper ou things had still been normal then he had enjoyed running to the city beside naamen in a vague way that he tried not to think about too clearly it had reminded him of running with aliver when they were both young and bursting with vigor and then he had met ioma ou and benabe and shen alivers daughter after that nothing was the same he was still stunned by it he saw in her features that aliver went on in living flesh she was not him of course she was shen yet some part of him looked out from her eyes he could not deny it nor did he want to just a girl but on meeting her he felt that his purpose in life and all his allegiances were tossed into the air they still had not yet landed back on the earth nor had he sorted out why the various players had brought her to him sangaes motives could not be questioned but the ous were different creatures with different aspirations even though he had not opposed the plan in his presence kelis had felt that sinper did not want to let the girl leave his control kelis was sure that if it were not for the mythic reverence talayans felt for the santoth sinper would never have let them leave would have found some way to claim that shen would be safer in his compound and then what could he possibly intend to play the girl in a dance for the throne why did rich men always crave more it would take an army to win shen the throne an entire war against corinns might that should have made it seem improbable destructive mad but instead the thought filled him with dread all of talay would fight in the name of alivers child though she be a girl though she had been born outside of marriage neither fact would dissuade the people if they believed shen was alivers child they would fight they would say she was of talay and that her triumph would be their triumph the madness might begin again for this reason kelis was relieved to get the girl out of the ous control they left bocoum the very next day ioma had offered a small corps of guards to accompany them but kelis had argued for the stealth of small numbers sangae wished naamen to accompany shen and her mother when shen approved of him the partys number was decided they shed clothes and jewelry and any accoutrements that would suggest their true identity dressing instead as a family of migrant laborers they walked to a trade depot to the east and there booked passage on the deck of a fishing boat heading around the teh coast in search of yellow fish they disembarked at palik in balbara territory before they left that city they traded their clothes again looking more like goat herders now if anyone asked they were returning from having sold their flock or were on the way to pick up new stockdepending on the circumstances of who was asking shen seemed to accept all this with equanimity at times kelis was nervous in the girls presence she was a child what did he know of children what did naamen know they were two men both of them childless who suddenly found themselves charged with the fate of a nineyearold girl he had been less nervous in the company of angry chieftains like oubadal how strange that he had never imagined what a burden of responsibility caring for a child was though in ways he felt benabe was harsh always looking for fault he was glad she was there that was what he felt when he stood at a distance and saw only the situation when he sat beside shen in the morning preparing food for her over a tiny fire when she asked him of animal things or of plants when she found ways to poke fun at him by mimicking the manner in which he chewed so furiously or the way he held his chin high as he looked into the distance or when she pulled on her earlobe as he sometimes did in thoughtwell then he forgot his apprehension and felt himself a child one time a weeks journey into the interior of talay they had run into the night to put distance between themselves and the laughing howls of a laryx pack kelis had needed to carry the girl benabe kept pace with them shen was draped around his back and gripped him he had further tied a wrap around her to help hold her in place for some time he had been conscious of the weight of her unnerved by the touch of her skin and innocent intimacy with which her legs wrapped around him by the friction between their bodies as he ran but again that was only when he thought about it soon he gave himself over to running watching the land move beneath him entranced by the motion of his legs over the world watching the stars hung in the black sky when the moon rose it lit the land with bonewhite highlights especially catching in the flowers at bloom on the acacia trees it was a magnificent country his legs and arms and lungs and heart were one with it he forgot completely about shen and realized he still bore her only when they stopped their flight and naamen reached to untie the wrap that held her in place thats a lion isnt it shen asked the first of them to speak for a long time yes child benabe whispered why does she bellow like that not she only the males roar that way her mother said who can say why men complain bellyache naamen said belly too full and dragging on the ground kelis smiled the embers of a fading fire murmured beside him crackling and shifting occasionally he liked listening to it during moments of silence those moments never lasted long though shens lion made sure of that from the warped lonely ferocity of its roar kelis could tell it was several miles away in the back of his mind he had been tracking its movements but in many ways he would rather have ignored it he had no fondness for lions he said it roars so that all the world knows it exists lions are proud but they are also fearful shen propped herself up on her elbow she lay on a blanket with her mother it was unlikely that she had spent many nights sleeping in the bush before but just three weeks of travel beneath the dome of the talayan sky and she already seemed at home on the hardpacked earth in simple clothes eating the frugal fare talayan runners survived on out here what do they fear she asked laryx yes laryx attack lions kelis said they also fear people though they dont like to admit it benabe huffed they fear us then why dont they shut up instead they announce exactly where they are in the world if i were a hunter i would set off from here and tell that oneshe paused pointing in the direction of the most recent blast of soundto shut it thats what i would do she jabbed her fingers under shens arms to punctuate this the girl writhed a moment laughing that would be something to fear kelis said but its not that sort of fear i mean lions hunger for glory they would die in battle gladly so long as they took a few with them into the night they forever worry that they will be forgotten or not honored or laughed at that is why they spend so much of their lives punishing other creatures they are petty animals they steal kills from other hunters they slay the young of lesser cats and leave the bodies for the mothers to find kelis pulled his light robe over his chest not because he was cold but to fill in the moment when he could have named still more crimes they are tyrants that is why they are such a lure to petty men sinper ou has a lion crest the girl said do you think him petty yes benabe said grinning tell us kelis do you think the magnificent rich sinper ou is a petty man kelis cleared his throat he was not yet used to the many ways shen caught him off guard but he had come to believe she meant no mischief by it he could not say the same about benabe but shens questions were asked because she wished to know the answers she received whatever answer he gave with the same focused interest in fact he had already changed the way he spoke to her he called her child but increasingly he did not think of her as kin to others of her age are other children like her he wondered have i not noticed or is she just different he said i do not think father ou knows lions as i do lions were not always the ruffians they are now naamen said he sat crosslegged on the other side of the fire chewing on peppergrass to clean his teeth whatever import hung at the edges of keliss interactions with the girl did not seem to affect him at all he spoke lightly falling into the heightened delivery of a storyteller shen sat up to listen when the giver was yet on earth lions and laryx and all other animals had peace together they all knew that hush kelis said she has heard these tales before she should sleep now no shen protested tell me i want to hear it in naamens voice go ahead benabe said youve got a good voice for tales grinning with triumph the young man continued they were the givers creations they felt his love and knew he shared it equally among them that was a time of wonder he described the wonders in imaginative detail drawing scenes with both his normal arm and his stunted one all sorts of animals bounded along in the givers wake singing to praise him all creatures were newly minted and glistened with the freshness of creation everything was just born and in those first days no creature thought of eating another instead they leaped in the air to pull ripe fruit down from the trees shiviths raced with gazelles for the pure joy of it elephants fenced with rhinoceroses like playful friends eagles lifted mice into the air cupped gently in their talons so that the small creatures might have the joy of seeing from the heights lions wrestled with laryx in brotherly competition can you see these things naamen asked i can shen answered well good that you have eyes to imagine it for it did not last naamen explained that elenet the first man was born into this for a time he shared in the rejoicing but soon he learned enough of the givers tongue that he became vain he tried to make his own creations but because he was not the giver nothing he tried came out right it was always twisted wanting to make warmth he made the sun burn too strongly fleeing he sang to cool himself and froze portions of the world in ice to warm himself he made fire not noticing until later that fire consumes all it touches to put out the fire he lifted water from the rivers and created storms to quell the storms he blew the sky clean and found he had created deserts you see naamen asked everything he did created chaos nothing he intended came into being as he intended wanting to make himself immortal he opened the door to disease he created death the moment he thought to fear it and to escape it nobody had died before that shen asked no naamen said this is the time of the first generation of everything there was first nothing and then there was life it might always have been so if elenet had not acted so wrongly but he had acted wrongly and the giver lost faith in his creatures he turned away and abandoned his creations fearing that any of them might be the next to betray him in no time at all the world changed the goodness that was the giver went with him and the world was left a different place creatures who had been friends began to squabble strong ones took to bullying weak ones and it was not long before some creatures began to feast on the flesh of others eagles pressed their talons into the mice that had been their friends snakes used their stealth to hunt lions ate anything they wished fearing that they would all vanish the hunted creatures learned how to mate and make children but then the hunters learned these things too painful and dangerous as it was they had their own young whom they taught to hunt as well elenet fled from this chaos though nobody knows to where in his absence the lions announced that they were supreme of the creatures of the land the laryx hearing this cackled with laughter for they disdained the lions and thought themselves supreme that is why lions and laryx still shout at one another today the lions roar their supremacy the laryx shout back in hysterics at the lions foolishness their blood feud goes on naamen said and perhaps always will at least until the giver returns and sets the world right again the storyteller bowed his head indicating that his tale was concluded shen had lain with her head in the crook of her arm for a moment kelis suspected she had fallen asleep but then she said i thought the santoth made the laryx with the touch of their eyeswhen they were angry i mean because of being banished that is sometimes said kelis admitted but naamen said laryx were there in the first days naamen said sometimes two things are said that dont agree which is true or are both true i cannot say i just speak what was spoken to me the girl yawned i will have to ask the stones they will tell me the truth shen said this with childish matteroffactness with no hint that any might find the notion fantastic or unlikely or frightening it returned kelis to the whirl of his worried thoughts this was no normal hunting trip or ramble or night camped under the stars to tell old tales for the second time in his life he was going in search of the banished sorcerers the god talkers the santoththe ones shen referred to as the stones they were beings he had seen only once on one furious horrible afternoon it was a glorious event in that it marked hanish meins military defeat but it was wrapped in the emotion of alivers death and remembered in scenes so terrible he prayed he would never see their like again even so he was trying now to find these same sorcerers nobody could say why save that a girl swore it had to be done he was taking that child a woman and a youth with him and he was doing so covertly so that the queen he was sworn to serve would not know of the existence of a niece one who might challenge her own child for the throne benabes voice interrupted his thoughts what do they want with my girl can you tell me she lay alongside her nowsleeping daughter propped on an elbow and gazing at kelis her face was lit more by the stars than by the weak glow of the dying fire seen thus in highlight and shadow she could have been either very old or very young either way she had a beauty that artists would want to capture in stone me cousin i dont have that wisdom benabe exhaled and looked out at the dark expanse of the plains around them the lion had stopped its roaring but in its place a thousand tiny creatures chirped and whirred and rustled and yapped shen hasnt trembled since we left bocoum benabe said usually she falls every couple of weeks i have always hated those moments it can strike her anywhere anytime one moment she is walking the next she is flailing on the ground eyes back in her head and mouth sucking sucking the air it happens more when she is agitated she doesnt seem agitated naamen said no she doesnt benabe said sounding almost bitter almost resigned were walking across a continent into a desert to meet sorcerers who should have died two hundred years ago and shes never seemed happier never healthier its like when she wakes up from trembling her face goes so calm peaceful she smiles and is happy me each time my heart is pounding each time i think the fit has destroyed her but each time it fills her with more joy than i ever have i should love them for that but sometimes i hate them instead she brought her gaze to study kelis then naamen and then kelis again i dont know if i am doing right to let her go kelis youve seen them tell me that they are good in answer he adjusted his cloak snugging it tighter around his torso he forced a yawn and held it long and then adjusted his position as if on the verge of sleeping there is nothing to fear he said hoping the lie would be enough to end the conversation the next afternoon kelis noticed something strange on the southern horizon he said nothing about it not that day or the next but on the third day naamen tried to make eye contact with him as they walked he shot concerned glances that kelis did not return kelis was glad that his companion did not voice his thoughts for he still hoped he might awake the next morning and find the shapes had been but clouds mirages tricks the heated vapors played but in the clear air of the fourth morning he could no longer avoid the truth near now so suddenly nearas if they had crept on their toes forward during the nightstood a horizonwide wall of mountain peaks foothills fronted slanting slabs of granite behind which dark slopes ramped toward the sky fading into the haze so that one could only guess their true heights rank upon rank of them shouldering their way around the curve of the world they were a range like nothing he had seen in the known world and they most certainly had not been here the last time he ventured into the far south benabe asked i see those and you see those we each see those right so i ask why are there mountains before us nobody said anything about climbing mountains i do not know these mountains was all kelis could say in answer what do you mean benabe asked you have been this way before i have but the mountains were not there before he stared a long time as the others shot questions at him what did it mean were they so lost as that how can there be mountains so large that they had never heard of them how could he not have seen them if he had really come this way before must they cross them or go around them or to each he shook his head and repeated i do not know these mountains he glanced at shen who was watching him she was the only one who was unconcerned by the massive barrier facing them she just cocked her head and smiled as if untroubled and seemingly ready to carry on c hapter t wentyseven he had said her name mor it rolled off his tongue like he knew her like they were old friends or comrades like he was a master about to chastise her for slack work as if he had the right to know her name and to shape it in his mouth she was not sure which of these she most heard when he spoke but it included all of them it was a simple thing but so unexpected that it ignited more anger in her than she had anticipated the moment she had waited a lifetime for the moment when she would spit in the face of an akaran prince a vile contemptible akaran a despot a criminal an abomination that deserved to live only until it understood the full extent of the crimes done in its name she had gone to that chamber ready to revel in finally seeing one of these akarans one hated more even than the auldek or the lothan aklun or the league instead she lost control of herself and why maybe she thought as she sat in a windowless room in the maze of tunnels below the capital city it was his accent his damned acacian accent he spoke as they had all once spokenall of them in some variation or anotherbefore years in ushen brae speaking acacian secretly while the official language of the auldek bent and twisted their pronunciation so that they did not recall how they were supposed to sound anymore the language of defiance that the people spoke to one another was a sad imitation of the language of the ones who had sold them as slaves it all held a terrible irony it was that now that she thought about it that had driven her to slash him so forcefully or well there was another thing she hated admitting it but the cadence of his voice shot her through with the memory of her brother she would never have expected that a few seconds in his presence a few words and the weight of longing for ravi crashed down upon her it was not a particular memory just the entirety of awareness of how much she missed him how incomplete she was without him the akaran bastard to have brought that on her with just a few words it must have been some sort of acacian magic who could blame her for smashing his head against the wall he deserved worse as far as she was concerned he would receive worse she lowered her head farther and tilted the knobby implants that protruded from the tips of her fingers into her scalp pressing them in until they were painful she would do better next time she saw him that was her responsibility the elders trusted her with this and she would not let them down ravi would want better of her she would not fail him wherever in ushen brae his soul was she eased her claws from her scalp exhaling and drawing herself upright her eyes drifted to the small mirror on the table across from her it was angled away and she could not see her image in it but she knew what she would see if she turned it toward her the visage she had come to think of as her own from her chest and shoulders up across her face and even into her hairline she was spotted like a shivith ink of black and yellow and shadings in between embedded into her skin trapped in her living tissue shivith her current visage would forever be a merging of human features and feline patterning as with everything in ushen brae the irony was that she could not imagine herself any other way she did not know herself without the tattoos that defined placed her gave her station and marked her as property in this world she did remember ravi as he had been she had last seen him as a child unaltered everyone had said they wore the same face so perhaps remembering him was remembering herself as well his eyes had been deceptively tranquil with upper eyelids that lay heavy in the candovian way beautiful she thought wise eyes in a wise rounded face ravi how she had clung to him on the ship that ripped them from the known world and brought them into slavery even in the hull of the league ship ravi had chafed at the injustice his eyes may have looked tranquil but the mind behind them was sharp and brave he had whispered schemes of escape in her ears first one plan and then another and revised to yet another as each was proven impossible he sought to win others over he left her for short periods and spoke to the other captives at night when the guards left them alone he tried to stir their fear and anger into something useful there had to be a way he had claimed had to be remember they were thousands few listened he had been marked by his outburst on the beach though none understood what the leagueman had in store for ravi all suspected it was a fate worse than theirs hadnt the leagueman said something about being eaten what monster awaited him and why let him lead them to a similar fate the few who had watched him with nervous eyes hungry for escape backed away from him after the leaguemen brought them out of the hold to show them a view of the world that only the league could offer them the children were led up in groups gripping one another and afraid of the sea spray and the wind whipping about and the tilting deck the ship massive as it was rose and fell on even more colossal mountains of water all around them as far as the eye could see nothing but the chaos of raging walls of dark gray water as solid as stone and just as cold leaguemen railed at them they were madmen perched high up in baskets on the masts they shouted and flailed their arms and laughed as if nothing in the world was as grand as the fury of the sea nothing except their mastery over it mor had thought that she would never see a sight more frightening she was wrong horror takes many forms it was horror that flowed in her veins when the redcloaked men returned for them they came in the morning striding through the sleeping children spread around belowdecks they kicked and punched as they went shouting obscenities and vile threats and finding mirth in every cringing face they knew where ravi was and they came for him for her ravi fought them but it was not a fight he could win watching as he kicked and twisted and as the soldiers fists snapped out again and again mor wanted to shout but not just as the vile men at ravi too stop fighting them stop doing just what they want you to do the redcloaked soldiers pulled mor and ravi away from the others hauled them up onto the deck and shoved them here and there led them down a long narrow ramp from the middle of the behemoth hull of the ship to a dock and then the cloaked men with their elongated heads and fragile bodies were beside them she remembered that one of them had fingernails several inches long curving things curling back on themselves after that they were on the strangest of boats sleek and white and propelled by some power within it the vessel cut against the currents and against the wind though she had been at sea for weeks mors stomach churned and spat out her insides splattering foulness down her front ravi clenched her hand all the harder but it didnt help the cloaked menleaguemen of coursedelivered them into the hands of a woman who waited for them on a stone pier she was the first woman mor had seen since they boarded the league ship she walked toward them like some princess thats what mor had thought like a princess she wore a sparkling gown snug on her slim form a dress that flared out around her ankles and disguised the motion of her legs she seemed to be propelled toward them as if on wheels her features were delicate pale only when she stopped before them did mor realize that the shapes beside her head that she had assumed were some sort of hat were actually her ears on both sides they stretched up into points several inches higher than the norm curving and twisting so that at their peaks they protruded to the side perhaps it was the sight of themor maybe it was the unnerving sensation of having firm ground under her feet again or because she had eaten so little and then vomited and was weakened by itfor whichever or all of these reasons mor fainted she awoke a moment later with the bigeared woman huddled over her studying her in the years to come mor often thought of her face looking down the first time she made eye contact with a lothan aklun the woman grinned i hear your thoughts she said in a language that was not candovian it was like acacian which mor understood a little but different as well though she heard the strange words of the language she also understood their meaning the lothan aklun cocked her head and tugged on one of her elongated ears with a thin finger we do this for beauty and to hear better it was an almost comforting memory the womans voice kind her words close to whispers it was the first thing a lothan aklun had ever said to her and it was the last thing she would ever mistakenly believe was kind about them then came another boat ride once the leaguemen had departed a small vessel but so fast skimming the waves that mor felt like screaming it cut between islands swaying back and forth so that within a few minutes the view behind them became a maze of land and water they passed for some time along the coastline of one large island thickly treed and wild looking eventually the boat docked at a small pier near an outcropping of rock the woman led them out and up a stone staircase cut into the cliff ravi still clenched mors hand and when the woman stopped before a darkened doorway and motioned for them to enter they stepped inside together side by side that was how she entered the chamber that she would remember every day for the rest of her life thats how she walked on her own two feet into the soul catchers mouth skylene appeared in the doorway she stood there a moment frowning at mor her eyes soft even as her thin lips were pursed in judgment beneath her pale skyblue face were features born of the eilavan woodlands of the known world it was unlikely that any living in that place would recognize her as their kin not behind that unnatural hue not behind a nose stretched by an implant that made it beaklike not beneath the jagged plumage jutting up like a crown anchored in her hairline she may have been mainland born but now she was marked as a slave of the kern the clan that called the southern delta their ancestral homeland and took the blue crane as their totem divinity more beautiful than any crane mor thought and then hated the fact that she had thought that once again just as on so many occasions before how frustrating that the tortures the auldek put them through were also changes they grew to love she looked away from her skylene closed the space between them she slid her arms around mors neck she pressed her smallbreasted body against her lovers back you shouldnt have hit him like that she said i know he may be useful to us yoen and the other elders said are you here to chastise me skylene took mors chin in her fingers and turned her head around she leaned in and kissed her full on the mouth mor opened to her hungry for her thinking for a few moments of nothing save the texture of her lovers lips and feel of her teeth she drove her tongue between them and found the answering luxury beyond too soon skylene pulled back she ran her fingers up her forehead and over the tufts that jutted from her hairline no im here to tell you hes awake again and sensible i left tunnel with him he seems to like talking with him that wont help his recovery any mor said wryly did you question him he tells a strange story he claims he was betrayed claims he came as an envoy from his sister the queen says the leaguemen chained him says they poisoned the lothan aklun somehow and tried to make a new deal with the auldek says the league was going to give him to the auldek but then something happened and the numrek betrayed them all it does seem to match what i witnessed and you heard what the spotters said of the waters theyre empty of aklun ships whatever happened whatever happened is still a confusion none of it makes sense yet the numrekwhat are those vile ones doing back here skylene did not dispute the point or try to answer the question dariel says that he did not support the quota says he was going to find a way to break it to trade in other thingsnot slaves mor leaned her head back against skylenes chest you call him by his first name now dont tell me you believe him how many years have they sold us into slavery how many thousands gone generations and he expects us to believe that the first one of them we catch wished only to deliver us they lie better than you skylene dont be fooled by it tunnel likes him skylene said after a moment of silence he already thinks hes rhuin fa based on what facts based on the fact that hes been waiting his entire life for it just like everybody mor just like all of us not me skylene squeezed her shoulder and then stepped away so you say im not so sure sometimes i think you pray for the rhuin fa more than any of us before mor could respond skylene clicked her tongue next time you see him keep your claws to yourself and you must remember that you are not an elder youre just their chosen agent you cannot harm this man without their permission to do so would doom you as much as him were to talk to him talk and tell yoen what we learn let him and the others decide what comes from it im not a child mor said no youre a brilliant and brave leader who sometimes forgets her senses mor closed her eyes i wasnt always like that i wasnt always that day in the soul catcherwhose name and purpose she did not understand until latershe certainly had not been a brave leader she had been a child who stood against the wall as directed by the largeeared woman mor stared wideeyed around a room she could not comprehend lothan aklun men and women moved about all dressed in loosefitting gowns that trailed on the white stone floor they were uniformly thin no laborers bodies theirs they were busy with tasks that for a few moments mor thought had nothing to do with ravi and her they bustled about talking and pressing their hands against panels in the stone at least she assumed the substance was stone it was as hard as stone and it made up the walls other objects around the room seemed to have been carved from same material toward the center of the oblong room were two raised rectangles like beds but so flat and cold no one would sleep on them some distance above hanging from the ceiling were still larger rectangular shapes the lothan aklun ignored them so completely that for a short space of time she tingled with the notion that they had forgotten all about her she still held ravis hand mightnt they both slip away the door was open she could feel ravi thinking the same thing his excitement making his fingers twitch it was just there daylight shining through ravi moved he clamped his fingers around her hand painfully tight and yanked her into motion just as she had thought they ran for the door they were nearly there in just a few steps the lothan aklun did not notice the woman who had escorted them had her back to them mor did not think about what they would do on the other side of the threshold other than dash down those steps running running a mans form cut the brilliance of the day he strode in his feet heavy on the stone both children abruptly stopped ravi fell and let go of his sisters hand mor had never seen so tall a man long legged and long armed and with a torso muscled in bulging ridged compartments though he wore only a short black skirt and though his hair was long in the manner of candovian brides he seemed a warrior about to kill his fists clenched and released hungry for the weapons that belonged in them the strength of him was obscenethat was how she would remember itand yet she could not look away a body built for war designed for no other purpose suited to no other purpose an auldek she would later learn she thought that he had entered just to stop them but it was clear from the look of casual interest on his face that he was surprised to see the children flailing at his feet several more like him in size and bearing followed him companions chatting as they stepped across the threshold while she was still stunned and stumbling back the lothan aklun rushed forward snatched up ravi and dragged him with more strength in them than she had imagined toward one of the stone slabs mors gaze snapped back and forth from ravi to the auldek thus she saw the lothan aklun strap ravi down to a slab she saw him wrestling to be free she saw that once he was strapped down the rectangular box dangling from the ceiling lowered to cover him she heard him scream her name just before the stone cover touched the floor and the cry was cut off the moment passed and lothan aklun hands pulled mor out of the auldeks way mor was shoved against the wall once more and there she screamed ravi was inside that box pale stone sharp edges the shirtless auldek exchanged words with the lothan aklun he seemed to want to see under the box that covered ravi but they would not let him instead one of them pointed to mor he spoke in a guttural tongue she could not understand her breath escaped her completely when the auldek turned and stared at her he walked closer his hand came out and touched her chin she flinched but his grip pinned her to the spot he turned her face upward and studied her even as she stared at him his visage was a mask for a long moment creviced and sharp with eyes as unreadable as a snakes and then he smiled and said something that stirred laughter in his comrades he released her spun away and climbed onto the second slab of stone he slapped the sides with the palms of his hands as if urging the lothan aklun to hurry the other auldek moved to the far side of the room and stood in a spot one of the lothan aklun gestured them to the lothan aklun busied themselves again soon the rectangular cover above the auldek also lowered closing around him and cutting off the last few remarks he shouted out mor stood transfixed her hands clenched together now working nervously at each other she remembered the moment but she could not recall what she had felt it was a blank space about which the frantic motion of her hands and the things witnessed by her eyes told her little ravi was encased in stone she knew why now but what had she thought then it troubled her greatly that she did not remember and that whatever ravi went through he faced alone while she stood wringing her hands and the moment passed there was no loud noise no blast of light no roar or blood or confusion there might have been a sound that she felt through her feet something like music but she was not even sure of this she watched the cover above the auldek rise the lothan aklun hurried to him when they stepped back a moment later he rolled off the platform he planted his feet and growled he pumped his fist in the air a grin splitting his face he was the same save his skin now glowed as if a light burned in his chest and illumed him from the inside out the other auldek howled back at him all of them animated as they swarmed around him smacking him with their palms the lothan aklun carried on whatever it was they were working at their backs turned to the auldek as if they were no longer there the other lidthe one that covered raviremained closed she never saw ravis face or knew what was left of him after his soul was pulled from his body and thrust into that auldeks for that was what had happened she would not understand this completely until sometime later when yoen explained it all to her in his gentle honest way that was why she knew the truth now that was why her mind had come to accept what her spirit had told her ravi was not yet gone he was a prisoner in another beings flesh there was one other thing she did know for sure she had never forgotten the name of the auldek who received her brothers soul she heard it on lothan aklun lips and recognized it to be a name something different from the rest of the foreign words devoth his name was devoth one day she would get to him find him unprotected then she would kill him and let her brother free c hapter t wentyeight standing in her private chambers as her servants made her up for the blood moon banquet corinn mulled over the strange letter she had received from her sister it pleased her to learn that mena had been found alive and well corinn did not however care for the flippant tone of mystery in the note mena had dispatched to acacia via messenger bird it said simply i am found sister all well im winged will fly to you look up what in the known world did that mean perhaps mena had suffered an injury after all one to the head even if she remained of sound mind corinn did not like the triumphant tone of it all well never in corinns experience of rule was all well mena might have dealt with all the foulthings but there would be something else to occupy them soon enough she would have to drill this into her sister when she returned please mistress a thinlimbed servant said would you lift your arms the queen did so and the servant wrapped her vest around her and fastened it in place technically the gown was a version of the garment that tradition dictated her to wear at the blood moon banquet which commemorated the fifth kingsstandishssuppression of the first mine revolt in crall a cruel act though one the histories praised as with her other clothes corinn had had the tailors cut the dress to the contours of her body this changed the look of the garment considerably corinn would hardly be able to eat or drink anything at the banquet so snug was the fit but that did not matter the maroon dress displayed her breasts and the slimness of her torso and the flare of her hips all to startling effect an unnerving combination of ancient authority and sensuous beauty her sisters were not the only words written by one of her siblings that roiled around in corinns head she had also spent part of the morning with several volumes open on the great wooden tables in the library she had gone there as she had several times before to read in solitude about the ancients edifus like a wolf fighting for dominance among a pack a snarling competitors his son tinhadin who built upon his fathers shaky legacy with a mastery of god talk so complete that he came to fear he might utter it in his sleep and wake to find the world altered queen rabella four generations after tinhadin who rose to power and held it until her death no king to rule her she outlived six male consorts but never agreed to wed a smart woman corinn thought and a documented argument against the conniving climbers who wished to bed her on their way to the throne she read these old texts to try to discern who her ancestors had really been how they had succeeded and what they could teach her ironic but increasingly she reached back to those long dead for guidance while shielding her thoughts from those around her she also read searching for insights on the santoth though she came across passages about them often she never felt she understood them any better they remained shadowy figures like beings standing at the edge of her peripheral vision this morning though it had been a newer volume one on her brother aliver that drew her in strange to read words that were supposed to be his the transcripts of his speeches had about them a hint of the same formality that flavored the old texts though the book purported to be a transcription of his words the shaping of scholarly hands was all over them rarely did she catch in them any hint of the brother she had known but of course she had not known this adult aliver this warrior prince leading an army and stirring the masses to revolt and the content oh such dreams such morals he would remake the world as if it were moist clay that he could mold in his hands throw out the quota sweep away the league unclench the akaran fist and let all nations rise free and equal partners in the workings of the world how could he ever think that such idealism could survive a minute in the brawl that was life it was folly of the highest order the fact that so many had followed him just served as further proof of that fools folly the snow king the text called him corinn could not help but scoff she remembered the night aliver had proclaimed himself that did the scholars in their studies and the peasants in their hovels telling tales of the snow king not realize that aliver had been but a boy talking about a snowball fight when he spoke those words though at times his idealism struck chords within her she could not forget the reality of things long enough to fall under his spell there was a difference she believed between the words in books and the manner in which the living must move through the world she had no intention of forgetting this when rhrenna approached her clicking her tongue in praise of corinns appearance the queen turned her thoughts back to the letter still in her hand what do you make of this rhrenna took the document and scanned it though she had read it already she sounds pleased with herself it makes me wonder mistress lean forward please corinn did as instructed funny that a hairdressing servant at times commanded her in ways that generals and senators and soldiers never could makes you wonder what corinn asked rhrenna pressed her thin lips together i dont know if we should credit it but sinper ou sent a message saying hed heard mena had captured the last foulthing instead of killing it it took corinn a moment to answer she waited for the hairdresser to finish the braid work around her forehead it was painfully elaborate but corinn liked a certain amount of discomfort while at official functions it kept her from relaxing which was useful why would she do that she asked once her head was her own again rhrenna shrugged i dont know as i said theres no reason to credit it the people like to make up tales about your sister given the slightest opportunity they embellish corinn snorted in agreement maeben on earth she is yes well i came to tell you that king grae has just arrived has he surprise visit apparently hes asked to attend the banquet just as an observer he says hes content to stand to the side and watch why has he come he didnt say to show off his freckles perhaps and the dimple in his chin rhrenna grinned hes not hard to look at corinn did not recall she had seen him a few times since she ascended to the throne but had been content to keep him at a distance she did recall that he favored his brother igguldan and something about this had displeased her he may attend she said but keep him at a far table even a king should provide us fair warning of his arrival as you wish rhrenna said although i might need to wander over to the far tables myself smiling she nudged aside the servant who had just lifted corinns slim crown she slipped it in place herself made of white gold shaped like delicately thorned branches it had a ruby at the center that was so dark it appeared black acacian royals wore crowns on occasion though they could just as easily demonstrate their rank with necklaces earrings or bracelets even with garments of a style made only for them for centuries now but corinn had taken to this piece since the jeweler first presented it to her there was a rough texture to the gold and the stone itself seemed to hide secrets within its depths there rhrenna said backing up and studying corinn as if she had worked the transformation herself youre cruel corinn youll have the men sweaty with lust and the women sick with envy most of them at least a few might go sick with lust as well when corinn arrived at the crowded outdoor courtyard in which the banquet was already in full swing she remembered vaguely that she had once thrived on adolescent courtly intrigue in her early teen years she had cared about nothing so much as the jockeying for status and favor among her peers handsome boys rival girls older mens lingering gazes and solicitous flattery who bested whom on the training grounds who wore the finest garments and howit had all for a time been the very stuff of life how foreign that girl was to corinn now how maddening that her father had let her live in that illusion for as long as he had although what am i truly doing differently the queen wondered as she nodded and smiled and accepted the lips pressed to her hand again i walk through a maze of illusion one of my own making perhaps some evening just like this one some raving lunatic from the fringes will strike me down just as befell my father much as befell aliver its a fools game but what choice have i should i lock aaden and myself up in the palace or in calfa ven the latter was an appealing idea but it would not do such a course was perhaps more dangerous anyway no she thought better that i see where the snakes lie than that i find myself stepping on them at least this way i can weed them out she moved through the gathered people with a cool detachment guided by a bevy of maidens who flanked her as persistently as her numrek guards unlike the taciturn guardswho she noted had grown more somber in recent weeks almost as if they were displeased with their workher maidens were all mirth the court was a galaxy of many constellations corinn was master of them all but before her floated representatives from around the empireroyal children rich younger brothers and sisters tribal princes and princesseseach the sun of some allys heart each surrounded by his or her own attendants and through this patrolled the ambitious and the arrogant senators and nobles agnates and landowners shipbuilders and leaguemen mistresses and lovers guards and escorts sycophants all liars most some loved her but these she suspected of their own sort of weakness her mind only really engaged when she felt a need to calculate study observe particular others to see what they might betray in unguarded moments she sat in the chair prepared for her a throne on a dais a low table laden with food in front of her a few chairs on either side for the chosen ones fortunate enough to spend some of the evening near her as a vadayan priest mumbled at her ear corinn took in the room it sometimes surprised even her that her understanding of what was really going on around her was so at odds with the appearance of things on the surface she sat above a party of people sumptuously dressed smiling and gay torches lit the place they were sheathed in tall glass tubes that funneled the smoke up above the revelers and cast blue and red and green and yellow light depending on the tint of the glass musicians lined the walls and the railings that hemmed the space playing tunes that danced from one portion of the courtyard to another like a chorus of birds at play everywhere there were smiling faces laughter conversation flirtation between them servants wove with food and drink liberally belched up from the kitchens in one small area performers enticed the guests to dance she spotted aaden at play with his friends they were like silver fish swimming amid the adults in some complicated game of tag and above it all the night sky mild and clear stars twinkling into being as the sun slipped over the western horizon as if all of that were not enough corinn had woven a spell from the song of elenet a small work of her own creation that would enchant a few hours before fading it was a mild euphoria let loose in the air of the courtyard circling unseen just the thing to make the revelers feel themselves especially attractive to make jokes sure to succeed to make the light sparkle a bit brighter and to make food and drink taste even better than it was so it was another festive evening in acacia what could be more pleasant it never took her long to spot the things slithering beneath the surface parasites at work despite the evenings pleasures delivegu was a reminder of it she spotted him conversing with the party from the prios mines how he had gotten in and what those men thought he was she had no idea but in a strange way she was glad to have him near at hand eyes that lit with smiles when she made contact with them were misleading she could sense the same eyes go malevolent when she was not looking she could tell when conversation was amiable and when the whispered words where unkind to her she noted small things to examine further later senator saden while haranguing the woman beside him about something avoided making eye contact with the newly enriched land speculator from alyth the man who passed beside him might have uttered something but saden did not acknowledge him until the two were some distance apart then he looked back and exchanged a knowing glance some petty treachery in the works between them likely she would have rhrenna look into it later corinns eyes drifted away from saden to settle on a young man who stood at the far side of the courtyard nearly atop the staircase that led to the lower terraces he was flanked by several men with the firmjawed look of trained guards the mans reddishblond hair was tousled as if an older brother had just mussed it up yet his facewhich corinn sensed to be handsome even at a distancetook in the crowd with a confident composure who is that corinn asked gesturing with her chin her maid answered that this was king grae of aushenia the woman continued to explain that he would have been announced more formally but he had arrived just a few hours earlier and asked to be in attendance this evening even if just to watch the court from the i know she said summon him she glanced at the priest smiling im sure the vadayan will offer his seat to foreign royalty as she sat watching the messenger sent by the maid make his way through the crowd corinn wondered why she had done that the words just came out of her mouth she had claimed indifference to grae to rhrenna earlier now she called him to her after a glance the meinish woman would find ways to poke fun at her for this she was sure it was done now so she sat straight backed and waited making a point of not watching the messenger interact with the king and just like that before she knew it a maid announced the monarch with a whisper in her ear corinn looked down the steps leading up to the dais and there he was head bowed his turbulent hair sported no crown but that was a reasonable deference here in the heart of the empire it wasnt that he really looked like igguldan had years before when corinn first met him but the sight of grae came bearing more import than she had expected first love she thought thats what it was foolishness so thinking she cursed herself for asking him over what emotions would show on her face if she thought of such things here with all the courts eyes on her but she could do nothing now but go forward composed the aushenian straightened tall then his shoulders broad and his form slim beneath them he wore the loosefitting shirt his nation favored open at the collar partially revealing the lean muscle beneath his coppery chest hairs your majesty he said smiling i am honored i did not wish to disturb you only to watch this wonderful occasion from the fringes ah that aushenian accent she had heard it often over the years but it still had a strange effect on her its bold tones and clipped edges had poetry in their very nature she felt her cheeks threatening to flush but quelled it it wouldnt do to have a king sit among the merchant class there are so few kings of note these days i couldnt help but ask you to sit beside me please do im honored he pressed his lips to the rings of her proffered hand and then took the seat recently vacated by the priest graes face was dangerously reminiscent of igguldans though of slightly more masculine cut just a little bit heavier in the jaw and bolder in the cheekbones even his freckles contributed as if they had been splashed there playfully intentionally he was handsome corinn admitted rhrenna was right about that he passed a few moments spouting the usual expressions of respect and then sat grinning at the gathering before them your majesty he said im ever amazed at the spectacle that is an acacian banquet the food alone is amazing the music entrancing the guests both dignified and courteous the women are the most beautiful ive yet discovered in the world have you made a thorough survey of beauty in the world i have traveled and i have eyes certainly you do corinn thought the kind of blue eyes that adolescent girls swoon over detail your findings for me then grae laughed and moved to dismiss the subject with a motion of his fingers no i mean it sir tell me she held him to the point until he began an awkward description of the empires races and descriptions of their womens qualities he fumbled at first but picking up on corinns projected good humor he soon made a game of it halfway through his discourse corinn joked that he seemed to have found beauty everywhere he looked he did not dispute it but by the end he circled back to where he had begun he concluded that acacian beauty is superior because it contained so much of the world within it all the virtues of the races none of the flaws your beauty my queen is that of the center point of the world corinns brow wrinkled with skepticism indeed she took a wineglass offered her by a servant grae did the same wheres your brother she asked i heard you two travel together frequently we do grae said but hes off studying agricultural techniques on the mainland he likes to be industrious my little brother i know the type you were close to him when you were young they were grae agreed at corinns prompting he told her several tales of their youth hiding in the far north of aushenia such a wild country he made it seem though that might have been because he still imagined it with a frightened childs eyes she could picture those mountains and thick forests and white bears and snowstorms and swarms of insects as thick as flocks of migrating birds we could not hide forever though grae said so i did eventually come back into the world only it was a world in which my father and older brother no longer lived it was a world in which my nation was overrun with foreigners carved up a playground for the numrek dire times better that they are behind us now you didnt fight for my brother did you for aliver grae looked uneasy but then regained his composure and answered with what appeared to be simple honesty no i didnt but i would have proudly i would have when he was massing to press his battle against maeander in talay i was fighting for the life of my nation i fought the remnants of the numrek still on my soil and i expelled the mein and closed the gradthic gap it was bloody and well i would argue that aliver and i were fighting common enemies even if we did not do so together corinn did not comment on the later statement tell me when you say that you fought what does that mean exactly i mean i fought hanish himself right here in acacia but that doesnt mean i actually drew his blood with my own blade my sister does that sort of thing not me but you when you fight do you fight yourself or do you instruct others to fight in your name my sword is no virgin blade grae said corinn noted a flare of arrogance held back i never sent men into battle i led them into battle i will not brag to you your majesty that would be unseemly but i invite you to ask others of my character i think you will find my reputation is sound no doubt corinn thought he did look the part of a leader of men she could imagine him in armor sword in hand inspiring others to acts of bravery outwardly he was the type of man both men and women would follow she made a note mentally to look into his reputation as he himself had suggested beneath them the banquet continued at some point wren entered corinn followed her with her eyes for some time believing she could just see the first signs of her pregnancy at her waist not enough that others would notice but it was there lady wren secretly carrying dariels child what did she intend delivegu had learned that she planned to announce the child once the prince had returned doesnt trust me to react with joy to the news is that it corinn wondered you may be shrewder than i credit ill figure out what to do with you yet different courses came and went from the tables the musicians played on several occasions corinn and grae had to pause to acknowledge some toast or to chat briefly with those who had the temerity to approach the dais once a storyteller told of how king standish put down the revolt and kept peace in the world an elaborate tale that corinn knew had little truth in it she had enough of the early kings private journals to know how much the official record differed from the confessions of the monarch behind the myth she was not listening much for grae made for diverting company praise for her horse culture plans rolled off his tongue aushenians he said considered their equine traditions part of what had nurtured their independent spirit to imagine such a connection with noble beasts near the heart of mighty empire like acacia excited him greatly he offered his countrymens expertise if acacia had use for it corinn said she likely did half forgetting that she had started the whole business just to keep her ambitious councillors busy grae was almost too diverting she sensed something held back in him an arrogance that hid beneath his genial facade it wasnt exactly unattractiveespecially as he controlled itbut it did make her wonder perhaps she had absorbed too many breaths of her own spell for she asked king grae just what is it youre really after grae jerked his glass of wine away from his lips in midsip spilling a bit my lady feeling as playful about it as she appeared she leaned close and knowing the posture pressed her breasts together and that grae had to keep his eyes from straying to them asked no man comes to me without wanting somethingnot even a king what is it you want i wont try to hide the truth from you grae said losing his relaxed demeanor for a moment id fail if i did im an admirer i always have been but perhaps ive matured enough to understand it and become brave enough to voice it at least vaguely grae dipped his head but kept his eyes on her ill happily get more specific if you would like well i would indulge me she stretched out the last sentence using her lips and the tilt of her head to add allure she still did not know quite what had gotten into her when was the last time she had flirted with a man ages since hanish but what sort of flirting was that mostly she had attacked him with her sharp tongue strange method of courting no she had not batted her eyes at a man since adolescence since igguldan but whereas that had seemed a memory too painful to approach before grae seemed a version of the same things she had admired in his brothera living version sitting beside her you really wish to know he asked for me to say it outright thats not aushenian style normally id have to compose a poem which would be very entertaining im sure do compose one and recite it for me later at present though be direct the king sat a minute looking like a perplexed child and then he shrugged and regained his charm as you wish your majesty the truth is ive come in the hope that i might court you and that if the signs seemed favorable i might offer myself for marriage with all the respect due your elevated position ah so there it is at least he speaks plainly you want to make me your wife id be content for you to make me your husband your majesty he leaned toward her look i am a proud man content to fight for my honor to rebuff any insult and aushenia is a proud nation but im also a reasonable man you queen corinn are a womanand rulerof both grace and immense power you cant be surprised that id wish us and our nations joined i trust this doesnt offend you you did ask for me to be straightforward no no im not so easily offended certainly not by such reasonable flattery you do catch me off guard though i had no idea my marital status was so much on the mind of aushenia oh it is believe me at least in so far as i am aushenia corinn remembered then that she once professed no fondness for blue eyes who wants to look into water she had teased rhrenna she would hardly be able to say that now with graes eyes so intent on her so refreshing thats what they were the promise of a cool drink of water to a thirsty mouth she almost laughed outright at the metaphor it was the aushenians who gamed at poetry she should leave it to them you know that no such union would be on equal terms she said straightening and speaking with the hint of royal detachment we would swallow you i dont say there arent advantages to that but weve trod near this path before i know grae said responding with a similarly aloof tone and i know you won my brothers heart before mine but that was not to be we who remain however still have our lives to live my father and brother both wanted an acacianaushenian union it is usually the case that great ideas are delayed the early prophets are slain or maligned often we see the full wisdom of visionaries only in retrospect and the retrospective view of your queen elena she would not bless this union you propose would she corinn did not get the chance to hear his answer someone shouted a rough bark that had no place at a banquet a second later a screamhighpitched and femininecut through the revelry and left silence in its place that did not last long as people began to point and murmur and exclaim what is that about grae asked he followed the pointing fingersthere were more each momentand corinn did the same for a few long seconds she did not believe what she saw and then when she believed that her eyes did see the thing she wondered if it was not some elaborate hoax and then she knew it was not just as the crowd knew it and erupted in chaos what she saw was a winged creature its wings enormous lit from underneath by the torchlight and bright against the screen of the night sky behind it descending toward them its body was sinewy and curved its head that of a reptilian beast its tail whipping audibly beneath it hind legs lashed the air and for a moment corinn was certain the monster was going to fall on her a dragon she whispered and knew in that instant how quickly death could fall from the sky archers grae called on his feet now shielding corinn there were no archers though there never were at banquets guests were forbidden weapons and the only arms allowed inside were those of highranked marah and of her numrek bodyguards both forces peeled away from the walls and pushed toward her drawing their weapons and shouting for the crowd to make way they surrounded her shoving grae aside they formed a bristling buttress with their swords pointed skyward the creature circled a few times above them in one turn corinn thought she sawbut that couldnt be and then the creature landed its feet settled on the courtyard stones with a surprising lightness with a strange rolling of its shoulders and quick clicking sound it drew its wings in blinking its large round eyes it took in the cowering people and the sudden disarray it had caused the creature held its two thin upper arms delicately before it claw tips touching and eyes darting about with the nervous energy of a child who suspects she has done something either wonderful or punishable but awaits confirmation of which it is in that stillness corinn saw the figure on the creatures back mena her sister had ridden the beast now she slid down and hit the stones merrily she grinned ear to ear and fixing her eyes on her older sister asked as if it were the most natural question in the world did you get my letter c hapter t wentynine mena had known there were considerable risks but she thought she and elya could pull it off the night sky would provide cover they would leave melio and the others in northern talay and fly high over bocoum then low across the inner sea they would approach acacia from the east flying over the crags at the back of the palace she knew the blood moon banquet would be in full swing and that no bows were allowed there would be no weapons at all among the guests and the guards were not overnumerous she had sat through enough of these events herself to know that anyway the guards would rush to protect corinn before launching any attack that she figured would give her time to make an entrance that would be written down in acacian official histories that was how she had planned it and that was the way it had played out a good bit of confusion and shouting and brandished weapons and indignation yes but nothing she had not expected just why it felt so important to make such an entrance was a complicated thing she had not sorted out in her mind she did have one answer that justified it as she explained to her sister early the next morning when she was summoned to her what was the meaning of that corinn asked in lieu of a greeting when they were apart mena had difficulty remembering corinn as a child or thinking of her as a sibling it was only the somewhat distant somewhat frightening queen whom she recalled but when they were together there were moments when mena saw corinn as the sister she once knew moments when mena recognized the pursing of corinns lips as an insecure gesture made when she felt her beauty was not enough mena chose not to let this official summons become as official as corinn likely wanted she strode in with a pleasant expression on her face and plopped down on the nearest comfortable seat she stretched and in so doing discovered that a yawn resided in her throat and wished to be let free corinn watched her standing with her arms folded and her face wearing a scowl of undisguised annoyance nice to see you as well sister mena said once the long yawn had slipped away i cant believe dariel has truly sailed to the other lands any word from him no corinn said no there couldnt be not yet no messenger birds fly the gray slopes we wont hear from him until he arrives back at the outer isles just a few weeks though if all has gone well you will be told about it later now what was the meaning of last nights show i do wish he were here i thought about him often while i was hunting and so looked forward to seeing him she paused a moment exhaled and finally acknowledged corinns question though with no more solemnity than before what was the meaning of it thats a funny question really i mean imagine if some adult said that when we were girls she put on a gruff voice whats the meaning of this young lady we would have laughed him out of the room have you lost your wits no not at all mena said just the opposite ive gained some wit corinn i didnt mean to upstage you i just wanted people to see elya before they heard tales of her just see with their own eyes and realize how gentle she is word of it is probably halfway around the empire by now and im glad of it i want her safe i want every fool with a bow or with delusions of grandeur about dragon slaying to know that she is not a target shes under the protection ofwell of the queen of acacia right tell me you dont think shes lovely you must come and see her she slept the night in the courtyard off my chambers its so funny to see her here beside household items you should see how she acted the first time she saw a mirror youre not making sense corinns anger had slipped just a fraction toward perplexity what is that thing that thing is my good friend no harm can come to her none at all youre to put word out to that effect a royal decree let everybody know it corinn began to protest but mena calmed her with a somber change in her tone weve started this from the wrong end sit with me let me explain it all from the beginning and then come and meet her with me properly i mean not with all the confusion of last night to menas relief corinn only held her pressedlip expression for a few more seconds then she called for a pot of tea and sat across from her sister as a servant entered with it when the servant left them with steaming cups mena began her tale she told it all just as she remembered corinn had heard reports of their progress with the foulthings at every stage but reports were dry things with no emotion to them the emotion was what mena wanted corinn to understand she wanted her to know how hard it was for her seeking out monsters and seeing all their foulness and killing them one by one she may have been marvelously skilled at it she may have taken risks and planted fatal blows when others would readily have done so in her place but none of that meant it was easy satisfying enjoyable thrilling or any such nonsense just the opposite the fact that she had a natural gift for slaughter was a great burden to her we all have burdens corinn said you dont doubt the rightness of what you did no mena did not she described the bloated vultures and the foraging creatures the lion with the eyes down its back the snakes on legs the monstrosity that had once been a fish but became a ravening mouth the tenten beast she said had stared at her with malevolence different from a mere animals it had been changed not just in size and shape but inside its mind as well the givers tongue is a foulness she said all traces of it have to be wiped out youre mistaken corinn said its not the givers tongue thats foul its the corruptions of the santoth they were banished for a reason mena and the years in exile have done nothing but make them dangerous ogres if they made the foulthings its because they are foul themselves remember though if there is truth in any of the givers story it begins with him creating the entire earth and all the many good things in it mena eyed her as she sipped her tea you seem surer of this than you were before i know more than i did before youve been away but i trust youve heard rumors of the work i performed in talay i heard tales about you bringing water from the ground wherever you pleased i didnt know what to make of it make of it that ive been learning ancient wisdom sorcery if you must call it something although its not so exciting as that may sound how who is teaching you im teaching myself from some old texts dont look so frightened mena i havent gone mad any more than you have nor is it dangerous just think of it asas if i were studying medicine or music im learning things that expand my knowledge in useful ways but to make water come out of water comes out of the ground all the time theres nothing more natural i just help direct it but go on with your tale its more amusing than my study of ancient spells though she was not sure that was true mena did want to get to elya she had not said the things she wanted to yet she described the day she had crept up to the lip of the hill and looked down into that orchard and first seen that reptilian head some part of her had known that here was something different but her mind had not grasped it in time she told of how they had hunted it shot it through with crossbow bolts and tried to weigh it to the ground they had torn shreds in its marvelous wings none of it was easy to relive neither her flight clutching its tail nor the battering she took landing nor the sight of what she thought to be the dead creature when she had climbed down to look upon it i cant believe how close i came to killing her mena said i ordered her shot at when she had never done anything to anybody that shames me now what joy then to learn that the creature was not dead after all joy in watching her heal so quickly in observing her tenderness and her comic ways joy in coming to feel a bond with her that was why elya was so important not only had this creature of such beauty and gentleness chosen her as a friendher mena the killer of maeben and so many other creatures not only that but being with her infused mena with the creatures goodness she felt that goodness inside her body she became part of it and everything about the world seemed better you dont know how much that means to me mena said you didnt see those foulthings didnt look them in the eyes the way i had to for so long i thought of them of what they were worrying about what they might become corinn some of them had such raging hatred in them the tenten beast wasnt just an animal it hated as only humans can which is why it was an abomination corinn said the abomination is that santoth sorcery did that to them corinn ignored this statement your creature cannot be trusted it may change into no no she wont mena said this with all the conviction she could muster she believed it completely of course but it was not all she felt she had dreamed that elya turned toward her with bloodshot eyes with that terrible malevolent intelligence in them but these were only nightmares she now believed the lingering traces of having seen so much in her battles nothing more she meant it when she said elya is what she is and thats wonderful she makes me feel good i havent felt good in such a long time i dont remember when i last felt just joyful do you she was surprised by the question making it a full stop instead of only a part of her discourse she looked at her sister even more deeply realizing that corinn had likely been dissatisfied more than she for longer in even more ways she had never quite realized it but now she was sure corinn did not answer the question directly its preposterous mena smiled at least corinn had not said it with malice perhaps but if so i like things preposterous she leaned back into the comfort of her chair what aspect of our lives hasnt been preposterous what do you intend to do with it shell stay with me as long as she wants to at least shes no burden or danger she eats fruit just fruit her feet are as light on the ground as a birds shell soon be loved by everyone i dont know that i can allow that corinn said she set down her teacup here in the palace i mean there might be an incident i know you favor this thing but you should have ended it be done with these foulthings forever mena looked at the bowl of apricots on the table beside her and plucked one that was a topic she did not want to discuss in truth she had begun to suspect that elya might be pregnant nothing definite gave it away just a feeling of other pulses of life within her she might be wrong how could elya be pregnant if she was the only one of her kind in any event it was better to keep the possibility to herself for the time being it wont be for long she said ill fly on her the next time i go to vumu she bit into the apricot and managed to speak as she chewed ive decided thats what i want to do next go to vumu for a time id like to be the priestess again this time however ill show them maeben at peace ill ask them to look up at the sky without fear theyll look up and see elya and theyll feel safe for once id like to give them that gift for they gave me so much during my time there the people will love it the priests will hate it perfect perfect hardly you may fancy your pet but remember its a foulthing its distorted who knows what please corinn shes not foul im the one who hunted down monster after monster i know foul elya has not a drop of bad blood in her shes beauty corinn gentleness and humor and beauty come come right now and see her corinn lagged behind mena when they entered her quarters she craned her neck around clearly nervous she did not stay that way long though elyafierce winged creature that sent nobles running and caused guards to fumble for their swordswas marching around the far side of the entrance court under the direction of a child aaden sat in the saddle of her shoulders waving a wooden sword and encouraging the creature to attack elya did so although her attack was rather careful maneuvering through the chairs and tables of a sitting area her neck craned about to make sure she did not brush anything and her tail carved elaborate circles occasionally touching objects as if to steady them two maids stood nervously nearby as did one of the princes tutors clearly they had been beseeching the boy to come away but now stood about curious and worried at the same time i didnt know he was here mena said speaking in a near whisper really i didnt not much gets past aaden hes as hard to keep track of as dariel used to be do you want me to call to her to get him off corinn watched awhile before answering no youre right shes gentle even i can see that corinn slipped to one side leaning against a pillar and half hiding herself mena joined her and together they watched you say she is easily hurt corinn asked her wings are paper thin theyre amazing you can see right through them if she didnt heal so quickly shed never have survived but she does heal amazingly fast and she made me heal faster too i should still be splinted and battered instead ive never felt better youve never looked better either corinn admitted you look like a maiden in love for the first time why thank you sister i was going to say the same about you last night sitting next to king grae quite the striking couple you two made you thought that before you dropped from the sky exactly mena said a lift in her eyebrows and a slight purse to her lips so corinn did not accept the invitation your elya might she have any military purpose dont even joke about that i mean it look at her shes all delicacy power too but none that i would allow to be endangered dont even think about it all right all right i had to ask corinn said she is a songbird then not a hunting hawk that was obvious actually in the way she held her hands together and batted her eyelids last night preposterous mena stared at her sister her mouth open and the corners of her lips uptilted it had been a long time since corinn had said something as goodnatured as that she felt awash with affection for her it was poignant in a way for she knew that she had not felt such affection for corinn in a long time but what did that matter now she was standing with her sister spying on a child and a dragon what better thing what corinn asked but mena did not answer when they parted she embraced her sister for a few breaths longer than formality required corinn did not pull away or express any discomfiture all things considered it was the finest few hours mena had spent with her sister since well she could not say since when there must have been a time when they were young and easy with each other but if so she could not remember it anymore perhaps they would grow closer now why not the foulthings were gone elya was found aaden was healthy corinn was queen so confident in control of so many things dariel would be home soon and when melio arrived with the rest of the returning hunters she would run her hands down his back and across his backside and ask him to make love to her and he would of course though he would look at her in surprise smile his crooked grin and find some way to jest but she would close his mouth with kisses she was almost ready to put down her sword for good perhaps the time had come to do as melio had so long wished maybe she was finally ready to be a mother to raise a child to know peaceful things yes she had not felt this good in a long time c hapter t hirty delivegu did not much like the tedious work of espionage it could be quite beneficial a real boon at times certainly that was all true but if he were caught during any of its less dignified moments it would tarnish his image he went to great pains to ensure that he was always seen at ease in control with a drink or cards or a woman at hand delivegu a man with few cares a man above the petty concerns of others one who benefited from human folly but never became the butt of it that was the image of himself he most fancied he wore a cloak of vice around him as normally as others wore clothing and he felt just as naked without it so the fact that he stood pressed to an alley wall for long boring stretches of time was not the sort of thing he wanted anybody to know about it was just the type of action he sometimes needed to take in order to gain useful information that was why he was doing so one night a fortnight after the blood moon banquet he stood alert as the evening progressed he kept to the shadows listening to the footfalls of pedestrians and to the occasional passing carriage and more than once spying passing revelers intoxicated with drink singing as they went ah the type of activity he should be up to once a dog trailing behind a small group of talayan dignitaries sniffed him out and stood at the mouth of the alley growling the ridge of fur along its backbone bristling fortunately the talayans were too caught up in their conversation to pay the hound much attention delivegu stared the dog down cursing under his breath and illustrating the full extent of his annoyance through the vicious way he jerked his head to the side an oftrepeated instruction that the creature should move on if it wanted to stay breathing eventually the dog lifted its leg and peed out its opinion of delivegu on the spot only then did it prance away if delivegu managed to become the queens confidant in the manner he wished he would make sure to delegate duties like this to others not yet though not just yet first he had to get things right and he could trust only himself to see that accomplished this little venture for instance might be a dead end if it was he would not want anybody else thinking that he cared about it personally that he spent an entire night standing in an alley clear your head man delivegu ran his fingers roughly over his face shes just a woman nothing to get twisted about yet he was twisted things had become personal that annoyed him the source and prime target of his annoyance king grae of aushenia that strutting gamecock he had not liked grae from the moment he set eyes on him at the blood moon banquet when he watched a servant leave the queens side wind through the crowd and then lead grae to the queens dais a mere courtesy of royalty he had hoped at first but then he had another suspicion delivegu knew women nobles just as readily as tavern girls he could tell that the queen had been quite taken with the aushenian he knew when indifference was feigned how to read body gestures for the meanings they highlighted or attempted to hide he did not even need to hear their conversation to know that the queen had toyed with grae coy and coquettish and the lout sat there tall and selfsatisfied showing his sparkling teeth in a smile and pointing about the room with his squarejawed chin tossing his auburn hair while the queen ate it all up delivegu had wanted to throttle him it only got worse from there the queen continued to entertain the monarch throughout the week that followed but delivegu could gain no access to her corinn did not call for him she sent him only one letter stating simply do nothing in regard to the woman and child she is not your concern anymore not so much as a thankyou for bringing her the news of wrens pregnancy in the first place nor had his lettersmeant to entice her with the suggestion of new intelligencemerited any answer whatsoever he could not even get a response from rhrenna he tried to call on her directly but got no farther than the surly numrek guards who protected the queens offices what strange protectors they made brutes who looked as if they would just as soon kill a friend as a foe even worse all the information he could gather from his sources made the palace sound like a marvel of joy and optimism princess menas spectacular arrival on that creature had set everyones spirits on high it seemed the island flooded with curious nobles wishing to see the beast which meant more entertainments more dances more banquets none of which delivegu was invited to a barge of entertainers broke off from the floating merchants and docked in acacias harbor they swarmed through the streets taking impromptu advantage of the festive atmosphere making it more so under normal circumstances delivegu would have had a time of it himself but instead he found himself grinding his teeth in worry that grae had used all of this cheer to bed the queen his queen maddening he knew instinctively that the aushenian would not like him of course he wouldnt though the queen probably could not see it beneath his surface charms grae was just as much a cock as delivegu if the aushenian strutted his way into corinns bed and onto the throne delivegus aspirationsfor the chancellorship and morewould be thwarted that decided things for him with nobody else to focus on he aimed his sightsand a good deal of jealous animusat king grae that was what he had been doing for several days now he whispered into a few ears posed questions offered silver he spread word among those who had connections with the servants and other staff in the palace or in the foreign district he was looking for intelligence about the aushenian king anything romantic liaisons in his past proclivities that might upset the queen evidence of cowardice on the battlefield perhaps delivegu had even bribed a clerk with access to the historical library to search the speeches and proclamations issued in the kings name there had to be something grae could not be the faithful admirer that he wanted corinn to think him what did he discover for all his searching not much the king had bedded his share of noblewomen but that was hardly a secret such wasnt even out of keeping with his nations traditions he had been known to bathe nude with male companions in the hot springs of the gradthic mountains but that wasnt anything hed be ashamed of either northerners did that sort of thing his military record was unblemished indeed if his valor in securing his national borders after hanishs downfall was to be believed it was amazing he had lived through it his official proclamations were often critical of the acacian empire of akaran leaders of the past and even of the reigning queen certainly of the quota trade and the league of vessels grip on commerce but so what none of these things was enough delivegu wrote them out in several draft letters but in reading each through he saw how petty it all sounded how insubstantial aliver akaran himself had sought to abolish the quota trade dariel akaran had blown the league platforms to smithereens corinn he feared would see it for what it was and adjust her opinion of him downward he needed something more this search was what had brought him to the district below the palace the area reserved for foreign dignitaries he had been standing in the shadows near king graes accommodations long enough that his legs were numb and his head aching from the repetitive tedium of his thoughts he was so near to slumber that he started when a figure opened the door and slipped into the street the light was faint but delivegus eyes were accustomed enough to the starlight to make out the young man he wore a hooded cloak of aushenian cut delivegu had seen such garments before and found them lacking in terms of fashion aushenians still fancied themselves hunters of the woods and marshes why did cultures always mythologize the past silly really when what was of more import to them was the everoncoming future but he shouldnt be distracted the thing to notice here was that the man wore a cloak when the night was warm he walked with a nervous gait looking around as if he feared being discovered something clandestine was at hand delivegu quiet as a cat in his fursoled leather boots followed the man through the foreign district out the open gate and down toward the terraces through the markets and around the square in which a few early laborers were gathering in the hope of securing work with the dawn the journey took little more than twenty minutes but by the time it ended delivegu scented that his fortunes had shifted the hooded man paid an early call on a commoners messenger service early enough that he had to pound on the door for some time he was eventually admitted delivegu took up his vantage point a little way down the street there he waited until the hooded man reappeared looking just as nervous and headed back the way he had come weighing his options delivegu decided to pay his own call instead of following the man farther he entered with a casual air letting the doorbell tinkle his entry merrily it was a dingy place crowded with crates and rank with the smell of bird droppings there were a few cages around the room large enough to hold messenger birds most of them were empty and the few that were not housed sicklylooking creatures feather plucked and mangy not the type of service a kingor a kings servant evenwould have need to employ the proprietor came from the back looking sleepy and cranky im not open yet he said taking delivegu in with suspicious eyes door shouldve been locked back yourself out and return in a bit ah but you must be open i saw a customer leave just a moment ago that bastard he woke me from a pleasant sleep nearly bashed his head for it you move on before i treat you to what i shouldve given him the man was shorter than delivegu a bit heavy around the middle and had a limp but he moved with gruff confidence coming forward and reaching out to turn the unwelcome arrival around hold a minute delivegu said his voice sharp and dripping with threat be careful whom you touch friend this could be a good morning for you or it could be a very unpleasant one the man froze he stood uncomfortably close to delivegu as his momentum had taken him a step too far even as his grasping arm drew back craning his eyes upward he said i dont care for threats delivegu smiled and eased back a half step well then dont hear one in what i said you need not if youre reasonable all right what do you want message sent eh cant go out just now dont have the bird for it delivegu put on a frown men like you confound me youre a businessman but you offer such gruffness to one who for all you know has arrived to offer you a fortune in commerce hah the man said been in it awhile and thats never happened not waiting for it either whats your business my business friend regards the man who was here before me the proprietor kept his eyes on delivegu he moved backward warily that one whats it to you and then as if he regretted asking the question he added my customers business is private he had reached the counter that ran along the back wall he edged behind it his fingertips touching the countertop twitching slightly betraying more nervousness than his face did you have some weapon back there dont you delivegu asked he had come forward as the man backed and stood now with his legs planted firmly both his arms loose beside his body it would be a mistake to reach for it dont listen to me before you do anything foolish i need to know what is in that note you havent sent it yet surely he paused just long enough for the man to protest that there was no note no protest came i wont tell a soul about this youll live on just as before youll send the note ill just know whats in it and because i know treachery may well be thwarted this situation provides you with many opportunities to lose what i offer is a simple win two options so saying delivegu held his arms out in his left was a small canvas bag heavy with something in his right was a delicate dagger a sack of coins or a blade which do you prefer and i assure you im quite skilled with the blade i was raised badly you see dont look at the blade too closely he added its sharp enough to cut your eyeball youre mad the man said though he did pull his gaze away from the knife the note is to his mother a letter announcing his engagement thats all thats what he said if thats true theres no reason not to show it to me ill laugh and youll laugh and the note will fly to mother no harm done nodding at the dagger he said ive nothing against you but i will gut you like a hog and leave you wrapped in your entrails or ill leave you doubly enriched and all before normal business hours think quickly the man did he valued his life more than his honor a reasonable way of perceiving the world delivegu thought as he took the parchment from the mans fingers unrolled it and read the note was not an announcement of an engagement but by this point delivegu knew it wouldnt be it was at first reading so deceptively simple that one might have wondered why it even needed to be sent it stated b all is progressing will have her confidence soon g delivegu felt the blood rush through his body tingling in his fingers and throbbing in his temples and even stirring in his groin g he was certain that stood for grae and just as certain that she was queen corinn who was the b this was just the sort of evidence he had been looking for though it meant little by itself if it could lead to greater evidence to whom is this to be sent he asked the proprietor had no idea the birds destination was to be a similar messenger service in aos to be picked up by whoever knew to ask for it questioned as to whether that arrangement was strange the man agreed it was but also admitted that he had sent several such notes in the past few weeks i dont ask questions just provide a service you know he motioned vaguely with his hand conveniently the proprietor did not have a bird ready to send the message it would not leave his shop until the next evening at the earliest and this only if his returning bird came back in good health later that day the ones in the shop were convalescing this fact had troubled the man who had left the note the message would be delayed possibly long enough for an earthbound traveler to beat it to its destinationif the traveler left immediately it took delivegu only a few minutes to draw up his course of action he returned the missive to the proprietors hand weighted it with the sack of coins and bade him a good day he did not tell anyone that he was going he sent no message to the queen assuming that it was unlikely she would notice his absence anyway late morning he took passage to alecia easily enough done for many boats cut the waters between acacia and the great city he sailed through the day overnight and disembarked late the next morning he haunted alecias harbor most of the day before jumping aboard a merchants skiff heading north along the coast he spent the night aboard that vessel uncomfortably wet but determined and the next morning found him leaping the gap onto the stone pier of the harbor in aos he had slept little but he had made good time he walked along the pier in something of a trance confident now that he had arrived before the messenger bird could have for a time he watched the old men who were using longnecked birds to catch small fish they sat talking among themselves as their black birds sleek and dangerous looking winged their way into the clear water cutting through the schools of silver fish every so often the men pulled the birds in by strings attached to harnesses on their bodies the birds protested every time coming up angry their throats bulging with living fish unable to swallow them because of the metal rings around the base of their necks the old men talked on as they massaged the fish back up and out of the birds squawking mouths plopping them into buckets strange the way some people spend their time delivegu thought and finally walked on he found the messenger bird shop with surprising ease he was seated on a beach a little way down from it when it opened its doors the street was much the same as its counterpart on acacia his stomach was set grumbling by the scent of onions boiling in seasoned oil and water a soup for the common folk he clamped a hand over his abdomen and breathed through his mouth he had not eaten commoners food in years and did not plan to start again no matter the lure he saw several birds descend toward the coops around the back of the building one of them he was certain carried his message he watched a few people enter the shop but none drew his attention until a blondhaired boy strolled on to the scene he would have ignored him for he seemed as aimless as any street urchin up until the moment he bolted inside the shop that he did with sudden purpose when he left a few moments later he feigned a casual air delivegu didnt buy it and he blended into the crowd in pursuit of the boy he followed him toward the outskirts of the town near enough to the farmlands that he could smell the cow and hog dung he nearly turned back in disgust fearing he had gotten something terribly wrong even as he continued forward he was rewarded for staying with his hunch the boy met a man who appeared to be nothing but a farmer the boy handed him something and stood a moment conversing with him and then delivegu understood b there he was there he really was the infamous barad the lesser the old rabblerouser of the kidnaban mines the sight of him and the recognition of each detailhis bulky stooped frame the boulderlike head atop his thick neck the low grumble of his voice audible even from this distancealmost caused delivegu to stumble over his own feet the good fortune of it was too much to be believed the man had been wanted for years there had once been a bounty on his head that was years ago but he was still an enemy of the empire grae and barad in secret conspiracy against the queen here was the key to all his desires found walking down a street in a nothing crap hole of a village outside aos conversing with a shoeless peasant boy leading a goat behind him with a few deft moves he could capture the empires most elusive agitator and bring shame on grae at the same time these two strokes he was sure would strip away the queens haughty facade and then there would be nothing between him and the rest of her delivegu walked on his mouth flooded with saliva a carnivore seeing a kill in reach c hapter t hirtyone it was always small things about his earlier life that dariel thought of moments that had otherwise been forgotten perhaps it was because they had been forgotten that they had the stealth to slip into his mind unbidden he thought of the first time he had seen aaden laugh his nephew had been but a baby propped upon a maids lap one afternoon as he had done so many times before dariel danced about in an attempt to entertain the boy but this time aaden did not simply watch him this time the boys mouth tilted with mirth and the strangest barrage of sound escaped him at first dariel thought he was coughing but then aaden tilted his head back and waved one arm in the air in an unmistakable gesture he was laughing never had that simple act seemed such a revelation of humanity or he remembered a pair of felt slippers he had once bought as a gift for val and then lost before actually giving them to him how frustrating or he thought of how as a boy he had always stared at aliver when he was not looking more so than fullgrown men the shape of his brothers arms and shoulders and ease with which he handled his training sword had shot dariel through with admiration and instead of remembering wren in battle aboard the ballan entwined with him in lovemaking climbing over the railing of the league warship she helped destroy or standing beside him during the windwhipped funeral ceremony for his father and brother he recalled swimming in the upper garden pools with her one blazingly hot afternoon saying she had had enough she kissed him and rose out of the water and walked away he watched her body displayed as it was beneath a thin swimming shift that was somehow more erotic than actual nudity but once she was out of sight his eyes fell on the line of dark footprints on the pale gray stone such perfectly curved imitations of her feet the footprints had faded so quickly in the sun that he breathlessly watched them disappear such were the things that crept into his mind now during the long hours of caged solitude each time he realized that he was daydreamingand further realized where he wasit was like suddenly remembering something so bad that he could not believe he had forgotten it even for a moment there really had been an entire sea full of corpses he could have dived in among them and swum from one to the next to the next and never reached them all not even if he came up for breath a hundred times long had he feared the lothan aklun now he wished desperately that he had gotten the chance to speak with even one of them perhaps it was silly but he could not help feeling they might have had important things to tell him about the world he was now trapped in when and how would word of this reach corinn surely the ambergris had sailed with news of the treachery he did not have her gift for political wrestling so he knew not how she might choose to respond a small group sent back to parley with the auldek an army prepared to invade what would the league men tell her even if they told the truth the league did not know what had happened to him in addition they had every reason to transform the entire situation into some fanciful version that would suit their needswhatever those were though dariel worked himself into knots thinking about it he could not imagine what was happening on the other side of the world when he thought of mena or wren being told that he was dead or missing it filled him with anguish mor had come to him a second time she entered rigid with control moving deliberately tunnel hovered near him almost seeming like a protector should mor attack him again she said something to him in auldek the large man responded in the same language shrugging as he spoke ending with something that must have been a joke since he grinned at his own words mor did not acknowledge any humor dragging a stool in front of dariel she sat down and faced him directly she switched to acacian if it were up to me alone id just as soon feed you to the snow lions is that an option dariel asked are there lions around here im not saying id want to be eaten but its possible the lions would treat me better than he flinched when mor reached for him she clamped her hand over his mouth and said shut your mouth and let me say what i must then ill go and you can prattle on in your ignorance tunnel will listen wont you he makes good prattle tunnel said tugging on one of his tusks you cannot tell me anything right now mor said let me tell you a few things will you be quiet reluctantly dariel nodded he would rather listen to whatever she had to say than have her turn away in anger again good she drew her hand from his lips i am going to assume that you know nothing lets start at that point and nothing will be missed you are in ushen brae the place you call the other lands we are in the tunnels beneath the city of avina im not entirely clear what happened when your party met the auldek but i can tell you that your people were slaughtered a handful fled back to the league boats but not many youre the only one we have and who are we were not the auldek i am mor of the free people you know tunnel and skylene we are all of the people the people are those you might refer to as quota we are the slaves you sent here many of us are still in bondage some of us fight it she pressed her hand to her chest we are those who fight it the free people you may think that this side of the world is just a place where you discard unwanted children we dont think so not anymore ushen brae is the world its here we make the future wait dariel tried to gesture with his hands but as they were bound he used his shoulders instead shrugging apologetically just wait a moment i will stop interrupting i will really i just mean for you to know that i am not your enemy im an akaran yes and you are quota i know that is a terrible crime of my family but its nothing that i started if anything i hoped i might stop it thats why i cameto help lest this sound too meek he raised his chin as he concluded you do me wrong by chaining me when he stopped mor continued as if he had not spoken you are a prisoner dariel akaran of the very children your family sent to slavery weve grown up we dont stay children forever in the coming days we will decide what to do with you some believe you are here to save us some know better but the elders of the free people are patient and just you will be tested perhapsthough its not likelywe will find some value in you but if you can be no use to us you will feed the earth and none here will weep thats all i have to tell you right now with that mor jumped up from her seat sending it crashing over behind her she turned and was halfway out of the room before dariel spoke wait he said mor froze ill listen to it all dariel continued test me also if that is my fate kill me after that if you wish but let me die knowing you wont understand me but i knowin more ways than you even considerthat i have walked the world half blind that was the way of my people but it doesnt have to continue my brother if he had lived and had met youwould have asked for the same but he isnt here i am so in his place tell me everything please your ignorance would take a lifetime to erase i am not the only ignorant one in this room mor snapped her head around you resort to insults following your example dariel quipped you were a child when you left when i was taken not left dariel conceded the point with a curt nod when you were taken thats true of you thats true of every human living in ushen brae you know nothing of the known world nothing more than a child would generations of people have grown old here lived and died yes but the people never know more about the known world than what children of seven or eight can tell them you may get old and grow wise in your way yes but you know little about acacia mor kicked the stool that was in her way sending it twirling inches from dariels head it clattered to the floor dariel fought to contain his frustration we should be speaking to each other not attacking each other i want to know about life here i want to know whats been done in the akaran name i inherited it toojust as you did its the fact that we dont know each other that has allowed this crime to go on how pathetic you are to claim to want to help us now now that youre nothing mor i have lived years knowing that there was something foul at the heart of my familys empire i knew some of it but not all of it tell me all of it show me and i will tell you everything i can about the world you came from i know you will mor said threat laced in the words this time she turned and left the room before dariel found the words or the heart to stop her in the days that followed his testing began it was not so much a matter of any one challenge to meet it was like no other tests he had ever taken it was a matter of opening himself as completely as possible and giving giving giving the elders according to mor wanted to take him up on his offer to educate them about the known world they wanted to know everything they could about the land that had sold them into slavery at first he spoke hesitantly unsure whether or not he was betraying his people but this was what he himself had asked for half of it at least sometimes mor questioned him a thing dariel found both exhilarating and unnerving but she had other duties that took her away for days at a time more consistently skylene directed the course of his days she seemed to have more freedom with her time than the others most could only steal a few hours every few days away from the chores their masters had for them history religion mythology the old tales geography nations and races and leaders bloodlines and feuds and allegiances the forms and hanish mein and the santoth and aliver they wanted to know it all skylene forced him to arrange these various subjects as best he could before long several scribes spent the hours with him each writing on multiple scrolls each focused on a different topic he would jump from one to other as things occurred to him or as skylene prompted him tunnel visited him regularly also he did not interrogate him although dariel believed he was supposed to the big man pulled up a chair and sat close to him near enough that dariel could smell the fragrant oil that had been worked into his leather skirt and the long laces of his sandals he would joke with dariel smile and laugh at the slightest provocation skylene was fair enough with him but tunnel was alone among the people in treating dariel like a friend returned from a long voyage they were simply catching up it seemed dariel would never have imagined that his existence would come to be what it now was it was peculiar because some part of him felt strangely at ease with it except during those moments of panic and realization some part of him had been waiting for this wanting it he now hungered for where it might lead skylene dariel asked as another session of questioning was about to begin do you know of any way i could send a message to my country the woman stared at him her thin lips pursed wary of the idea she had just entered the chamber in which he sat waiting alone her appearance was as striking as ever but her pale blue hue and avian highlights no longer seemed bizarre to dariels eyes they were now part of her strange that he could grow used to her so quickly she asked what kind of message just something that tells my people that im alive i dont know what the league might tell them it could cause all sorts of problems if they think me dead i dont know what it might lead to if my sister thinks me deador discovers that im captive hereshe may send an army to avenge me or to war with the auldek i dont think thats likely skylene said dariel studied her why skylene thought a moment and then exhaled and shook her head sadly it doesnt matter dariel whatever will happen will happen we cannot change it not yet at least its not possible to send any message we never managed it in twentytwo generations what makes you think we could do it now the league then they may still be along the coast can we get a message to them skylene interjected dont be foolish the only message your sister will receive will be of their making really dariel we have no power where they are concerned anyway mor would never allow contact with them they are our enemies remember for that matter you havent forgotten that they were offering you up to devoth have you no dariel certainly had not forgotten that in fact he had dreamed of that chaotic afternoon more than once i had power over the league once you know there was a knock at the door a moment later the two scribes entered one with a splash of shivith spots across one side of her face the other with a crest of black hair jutting from the back of his head skylene motioned for the two new arrivals to take their seats and ready their writing equipment i doubt that she responded i was at war with them once killed many that may be but that doesnt mean they were in your power you blew up their platforms i know you detailed that already that may have hurt them perhaps it made them hate you enough to give you to devoth but you cant really believe you had them on their knees let me tell you this about the league they made it clear to each of us that you akarans are just pawns to them once they have us quota aboard their ships and are sailing west they dont hide the fact that they are the known worlds real power and the lothan aklun before they were eliminated likewise dismissed you you were their customers but stupid ones ignorant addicted easily fooled and exploited as for us many among the people hate the akaran name and hold you responsible for our slavery but quite a few think your people too pathetic to merit hate none of us think you accurately understand the way the world has been working and you how do you feel skylene answered without the slightest hesitation the kernmy clanhave a saying truth is a white crane with many heads but only one body when they grow agitated the heads eat one another until only one remains and that one truth prevails no the one head cant live by itself not when its part of a body that has suffered multiple decapitations there may be one truth left but it dies when the body that connected it to the other truths dies dariels brow ridged with skepticism yours are a dire people shrugging skylene said the truth overlaps it contradicts but in many ways many things are true thats why i think a little bit of everything about you and your people if thats true it seems surprising that youre talking to me if my people are so pathetic what use are we this did cause her to pause for thought the league has used you the lothan aklun have used you the auldek have used you perhaps we can find a use for you and your information too thats what the elders believe and anyway you yourself proposed this feeling a greater import in the question than seemed reasonable dariel could not help but ask is it what mor believes also a smile started to lift the corners of skylenes lips but before the expression was complete she ran a twist through it that made it more like a smirk you dont want to know what mor thinks we should do with you trust me on that her tone switched growing crisper and more official weve spoken enough lets begin you were going to tell us about the floating merchants it seemed such a distant thing to speak about unreal in this subterranean existence he started by explaining what he knew of the merchants about the way the currents flowed around the inner sea at different times of the year how seasonal shifts made it possible for the great bargescities unto themselvesto sail a circular route that took them all the way to the vumu archipelago they were only marginally governed by the empire really the merchant families of bocoum held them together within an unofficial governmentlike arrangement though their trade was not rich enough to bring them into competition with the league they were fundamental to the swirling flow of goods that kept the empire thriving as he spoke images emerged in his mind at first he thought they were just visualizations to aid his recall of information but then he realized the images were more personal than that he had forgotten but he had first visited the floating merchants when he was a small boy of course he had it was during the spring when the rafts drifted on the slow current that carved the mainlands coastline he must have been six or seven years old in those longago days before the world first went mad he had stepped aboard the raftsnot with his fatherbut holding thaddeus cleggs hand with this uncle to guide him he had gazed in awe at the bobbing flowing moving creation the thousands of rafts made when lashed together the population of the rafts was an amazing polyglot entity diverse as the entire empire there before him at once people of all nations rode the waves making their lives through trade with animals in cages and others roaming free with wares displayed and foodstuffs bubbling and frying and great stores of items piled in warehouses with fisheries and clam hangers cisterns for gathering rainwater and a network of tubing that ran it where needed it was a grand salttinged barnacled confusion and then he remembered that aliver had been with them tall and older smart confident and a bit arrogant everything it seemed a man should be oh how dariel felt tiny in his brothers shadow thats the feeling that washed over him quick behind this flood of feeling came remembrance of the brief relationship they had rekindled as men on the battlefield of talay the emotion of it stopped his narration is something wrong skylene asked dariel fidgeted yes many things are wrong can i have a break weve just begun i know im sorry i just started telling you about one thing and it brought to mind another we have them only for an hour skylene said gesturing toward the scribes one of whom sat with pen poised ready to continue the other waited her turn should the subject change to a different scroll then they have to return to their work dariel realized he did not recognize them perhaps they had been here before likely they had but in their silent roles they had no identity to him perhaps that was good because of it it was easier for him to say i told you before about how my brother fought maeander mein it was his great moment i believe that even though he died maybe it was great because he died its hard to explain everyone who knew him wished he never accepted the challenge certainly the mein would not have kept maeanders pledge in a way it was a situation in which he could not win so why do it why risk everything for nothing thats what it seemed like to me at the time and then when aliver did die it was both unbelievable and inevitable i hated everything at that moment maeander and hanish the war every soldier around us even aliver himself i hated that he had failed and left us left me what i didnt tell you before was what i did in the moments after he noticed skylene nod to the second scribe and knew from the different rhythm of the scratch of her pen that he was being recorded again okay he thought let them have this in writing too maeander killed my brother with a knife following the rules the two of them had agreed upon i sworealong with aliverto abide by the rules and honor the outcome when i saw aliver on the ground and maeander strolling away so pleased with himself i couldnt control myself i hated him so much nothing else mattered i said just loud enough to be heard in the silence kill him when nobody obeyed me i shouted it kill him i ordered hear i ordered it done he had been looking at his hands for a while but glanced up long enough to make sure skylene understood him exactly the scribes pen scratched a little longer and then stopped her eyes rose to look at him so he continued kneading his hands together just like that with a few words i betrayed the honor my brother modeled for the world ive always hated myself for that he was an enemy commander skylene offered you just did what aliver would never have done that honor is honor its not just honor when it suits you he had agreed to terms and so had i im not sure i understand surely aliver did not think that the war would be decided between just two men no matter what it would have gone on yes yes then your actions changed nothing except that you killed one of your enemys leaders dariel almost laughed sadly he had told himself the same thing many times others had said it too there was truth in it but there was also truth in the fact that both he and aliver believed that peopleespecially those who led othersshould be true to their word who knows maybe maeander felt the same maybe he would have lived by the outcome of that duel dariel would never know because he had betrayed his honor the irony of it was thick enough to swim in it was not just the irony that made him laugh it was what skylene had said about the truth having many heads but only one body lets not debate this well end up headless if we do the woman ridged her brow for a moment perplexed but then registered understanding you learn fast dariel not everyone would agree but i try and as soon as you start telling me things about ushen brae i will be all ears is it time for that yet skylene thought for a moment thats up to mor c hapter t hirtytwo when rhrenna first brought her the missive corinn waved her away delivegu had been useful he would be again perhaps and he had a carnal sensuality that parts of herdespite the fact that her intentionally cold facade showed no sign of ithad responded to but that was before grae had stepped in and so completely replaced the other man grae with his squarejawed nobility and all the legitimately pleasing possibilities his nuptial overtures offered a gentleman of noble birth who had proven himself of her class each day of his stay in the palace since delivegu had seemed even more like an anxious puppy she had stopped reading his notes for several weeks now rhrenna had been discarding them without troubling the queen if he did not desist corinn had decided his yapping would have to be silenced more forcefully rhrenna needed only to see the queens expression to know her thoughts in answer she said yes i know but you should read it just the same i wont be the one who didnt deliver this to you tiny threads of annoyance flared out from the corners of corinns eyes one of the few places the passing years had begun to stake a claim she took the note snapped it open she remarked at how brief it was which was unusual for the candovian your majesty i have captured your foe i have barad the lesser and will deliver him to you shortly your loyal servant d she let the note drop from her fingers blowing air through her teeth how boldfaced of him she found no reason to believe such a claim what was he playing at last she had heard delivegu had been sulking about the lower towns brothels digging for secrets and doing whatever else pleasured him barad the lesser on the other hand had eluded the empire for years leaving scarcely any leads a sort of phantom whom she might have doubted altogether if word of him had not been so consistent delivegu is a fool corinn said rhrenna pressed her thin lips together stern for a just a second before laughing we both know thats not true your majesty hes many things but a fool is not first among them you credit this then doesnt matter if i do im patient enough to wait until tomorrow morning she held another folded letter much the same as the first he sent me another you see a private message she displayed both sides of it as if thinking something through she was not actually doing so which was clear from the humor in her eyes shrugging she tossed the note onto the queens table but whats mine is yours of course read it if it pleases you shes gone as giddy as mena with her lizard bird corinn thought as giddy as me with my suitor she glanced down but didnt reach for the letter was she growing lax it had only been a few weeks since mena and grae both dropped into her court but she already suspected she had missed things she would not have before she had failed to note down a few slights decided to ignore a suspicion or two so that they did not interfere with her mood was that foolish or was it time to take some joy in life again joy she thought might not be the weakness ive believed it to be being with grae warmed her and that made her inclined to gentle rule she found herself flirting with him without the controlled guise that had become part of almost every interaction that lowering of her guard had loosened the bands of tension that had so long clamped her skull that was not a bad thing was it grae had taken her hand once as they were sitting on a bench in the high courtyard of the monument to edifuss first defensive towers she did not think he knew that his brother igguldan had once fallen to his knees in awe of the ancients in this spot nor did she mention it for grae was less and less his brothers shadow more his own man every day it was good that she saw him that way for he was a fine king of his people and might yet be a fit monarch for the known world once two days before she had even set free a small work of sorcery in the gardens insects of a sort not seen before antlike beings with large diaphanous wings they seemed to want nothing more than to flit above the onlookers delighted heads they seemed almost to sing as if the flapping of their sparkling wings made music with the air she was aware that she did this as much to impress grae as to delight aaden and his friends but for once she allowed herself the indulgence she looked forward to doing so again let the people fear her sorcery let them love it as well she had even refused to meet with sire nathos who had come to the island with paddel the vintner both of them clamored to begin distribution of the new prios vintage the mistinfused wine that would glaze the eyes of the populace once more it was not that she had truly decided against employing it but she did wonder if it was possible to rule without it she was lovedor could be as many tales were spun about her powers and gifts as had been spun about menas warrior prowess talay was bursting into life again so much seemed right but paddel and nathos certainly believed in the dangers posed by this barad he was the main reason cited to explain the need for the new drug meet him then corinn told rhrenna still without picking up the note see for yourself if what delivegu says is true ill receive him before meeting his prisoner myself if hes lying arrange for his death the next morning dawned as usual during the acacian summer warm but breezy the sun alone in a bluewhite sky the sea turquoise nearby and a rich blue in the depths it was almost ridiculous how unrelentingly perfect the weather was on the island sitting beside aaden corinn felt a pang of nostalgia for calfa ven they would have to go there again soon up into the high damp air where the nights were chill and mornings mist shrouded and the air always haunted by some animal call whether it be a wolverbears roar a loons piping or a stags trumpeting perhaps she would invite grae along with them surely he would love it she almost asked aaden if he would like that also but she was with him for a reason best that it be attended to first the mother and son sat on stools placed for them to look down through slanting panes of tinted glass below them an empty room one chair at its center skylights lit the room brightly while the viewing area was shaded from the sun by an awning they could look down without being observed so placed they awaited the prisoners arrival if this man is who my agent claims he is corinn said he is one of my greatest enemies i know about him aaden said swiping the goldtouched hair back from his forehead but how can he be a threat he doesnt even have an army my tutor said he goes about riling up the common folk but that none of them have yet done anything for all his talk theyre tradesmen and blacksmiths and farmers you think tradesmen and blacksmiths and farmers are no threat to me singly they arent of course but barad makes the many into one thats dangerous we rule because the people allow us to rule they believe we have power but their belief is the delusion that grants it to us dont ever forget that nothing you can do with your sword or with your army is nearly as important as what you must do with your mind with your words there was motion in the chamber below them four marah guards entered the room each with their hands crossed and holding the hilt of both short and long swords ready to draw they squared off around the empty chair facing it a moment later a giant of a man entered hands secured behind his back he had to dip his head beneath the door frame he paused just inside the room and stood for a moment taking measure of the space his clothes hung ragged about him soiled one sleeve had torn at the shoulder after looking around the room for a moment he raised his head and glanced straight up at the glass through which the mother and son watched corinn spoke a bit hurriedly and perhaps to reassure herself as much as aaden he cannot see us the boy said he looks like a peasant a big one but still a peasant another guard blocked the doorway behind the prisoner he shoved him forward with a free hand the other on the hilt of his short sword the guard directed him to sit in the chair and then walked around before him and said something the watchers could not hear so if we assume that this man is a danger to us what do we do with him aaden sat silently thinking for a long time corinn thought for the millionth time how much she loved this boy how was it possible to love so completely and to remember it again and again every day doesnt that depend on how he is a danger what he is threatening to do and how aaden finally said yes those are things to consider he is a danger because he has a gift for oratory he is one of the people and when he speaks to them he makes them believe that all their grievances are caused by us theyre not of course we expect much from our subjects in return we give them the stability of a prosperous nation commoners rarely understand that and they forget it when a man like this comes into their midst so his danger is that he blends together a host of grievances and directs it at one targetthe akaran line at you aaden what is he threatening to do destroy us he believes his peasants could do better at governing the world than we or he believes that he will be empowered by our downfall im not sure which either way he would see me deposed likely killed after some mockery of a trial so what do we do with him we stop him from talking perhaps but that would not undo the things he has said and the emotions he has stirred what is better than silencing him if he must talk we should have him say what we want him to instead of what we dont a smile slowly bloomed on corinns face the answer did not surprise hershe had thought of it herself alreadybut it did please her she reached out and mussed his hair and said clever boy aaden accepted the praise with a shrug you may go now corinn said ill tell you later what this criminal had to say for himself but aaden had more on his mind grae said he would go riding with me tomorrow all the way out to havens rock he claims he has a fishing line long enough to reach the water from the top theres no way thats possible he must be joking i can go cant i you like grae dont you corinn asked trying to make the question sound light and casual youve spent even more time with him than i have he fenced with me not like the others but steel to steel i couldve gotten cut the prospect of this seemed to delight the boy is that so corinn raised an eyebrow this was not actually news to her very little that aaden did went unreported to her for that matter very little that grae did during the last few weeks escaped her either she knew what aaden did not mention about this sparring that the blades they used were light with no edge at all grae could certainly have hurt him nonetheless but ten pairs of marah eyes had been pinned to him the entire time ready to repay any injury with a quick death corinn asked dont you think thats dangerous no not really he said i was quicker than him quicker than he ever was he said almost as an afterthought he added he wouldnt hurt me anyway he likes me of course he wouldnt corinn said and of course he does aadens delay in leaving meant that he was still in the hallway when rhrenna led delivegu into the viewing area after the formalities of greeting the queen were seen to the candovian said your son looks more like hanish mein every day he motioned toward the corridor to explain the comments origins corinn eyed him a moment deciding how severe to be with him at a glance he was just as elaborately garbed as ever his shirt brilliantly white his black breeches tight enough that they seemed to have shrunk to fit his form the hoops of his gold earrings sparkled and he wore bracelets on one wrist that clanged together as he moved but for all the gaudy finery his face did not betray his usual arrogance perhaps his time out of favor had mellowed him you knew hanish mein corinn asked to look at yes only to look at he didnt know me but he was hard to miss when he had the reins of power i liked his style as an afterthought he added then i guess you did too or perhaps it had not mellowed him corinn thought she was unsure as yet she ordered him to explain his claim and document the identity of the man sitting in the room below them delivegu did so readily enough he explained that he had gained intelligence that led him to a certain commoners message service there he had intercepted a message meant for the rascal he hurriedly transported himself to the messages destination it was a gamble a considerable personal expense but it paid off he did spot the man he spied on him long enough to satisfy himself of his identity and then he decided on a way to capture him how did you do that delivegu shrugged and looked the closest he could to sheepish im not proud when it comes to such matters i came up behind him when he was fumbling with the keys to unlock his rented room i hit his head with a club without warning of course how better to do it and lucky i did for he didnt go down from that one blow he turned and reached for me i needed to hit him twice more before he dropped to his knees then he was easier to deal with a bit at least how did you know it was barad before i approached him i questioned an acquaintance of his a young man with i daresay insufficient resilience to resist me this initial information you gainedthat which took you to the message servicehow was that come by delivegu cleared his throat i have something to report that you may find disturbing he paused brow furrowed in an expression of consternation that looked odd i wished you to know the other details first but this part cannot be avoided youre right to ask hear me through please before you respond corinn kept her eyes fixed on him as he proceeded she kept them pinned to his features focused first on his face as a whole and then on its smaller components the crook of his nose the motion of lips the black hairs of his beard the focus was necessary for otherwise she feared she would betray the fact that her heart pounded at twice the rate it had a moment before she would not even look at rhrenna who was hearing the news with her she knew her face had flushed red but her expression remained unchanged alleys and spying following a servant what he was telling her was as you can imagine i had to be quite rough with barad hes a big man you see so i had to be careful anyway he was a little bit out of it and he asked me did he betray me to her i had explained to him that i was in your employ when he asked i almost asked him who the word was on my tongue but i snipped it delivegu demonstrated just how precisely he did so by making scissors of his fingers instead i said of course he betrayed you hes royalty after all why would he side with commoners i said this to provoke confusion or disagreement or something but he responded with none of those he simply accepted it sadly so delivegu inhaled a long breath then said plainly there can really be no doubt your majesty barad your enemy among the people was in a partnership with king grae as i traveled with barad i returned to this subject several times he didnt give much so i told him how it was how king grae had come to you speaking of a plot they had concocted together how you and he worked to find a way to capture him i even said that you and the aushenian were secretly engaged its a skill i have finding the truth even when the one im interrogating doesnt say a thing theres no question though he was in league with grae and now he believes grae betrayed him i deliver him to you in the hope that you will mete out justice as is right inside corinns head a hundred different thoughts assailed her on her face she made sure that nothing could be read despite the internal turmoil she heard herself say calmly well see about all this soon enough i will speak with him now delivegu straightened like an obedient servant eager to please and seemingly happy at her reactionor lack of reaction corinn paused at the door and let delivegu advance ahead of her leaning close to rhrenna she whispered while i am with him bring grae to the upper terrace let him see to whom im speaking watch his face tell me if he shows signs of recognizing him time must have passed but she lost track of it why it was so hard to concentrate she could not say her mind felt sluggish but also touched with a panic that might spread if she were not careful it was not just thinking of grae not just the disbelief that she might have read him so wrongly not just the gasping knowledge that he had held steel and fenced with aaden not even realizing how very close she had come to folly in addition to all this emotions she had not allowed within herself for years rushed in memories of her father of igguldan of hanish the men who had betrayed her each in his own way was grae another of these was she still the fool she had been at sixteen more images of her mother during her illness the memory of crying and crying and crying on her bedspread as the womanshe who was dyingtried to comfort her more there came a bonedeep longing which she almost never acknowledged to sit and speak with aliver right now as adults both of them living and then she was striding through the doorway behind delivegu she walked into the room and circled around to the front of the chair the guards followed her with their eyes and she watched as the prisoners square profile came into view and then changed as it filled out she pulled in her attention blocked out the noise and concentrated all her being on the exchange she was about to have it felt necessary to focus her eyes on a single point while the rest of the world blurred the mans eyes were brown spaced wide rolling toward her they looked heavy as if just moving them would be a monumental task as if they were stone she could almost hear the grinding rumble as they shifted she said lower your eyes the man stared at her a moment longer and then obeyed how could you think the monarch of one kingdom would betray the monarch of another for peasants dont you see how foolish that is how impossible and they told me you were bright devious cunning instead youre none of these things had she really gotten all that out without a hitch or quaver of emotion she had the mans steady attention confirmed it he stared at her feet but said nothing you may speak freely to me corinn said trusting her voice a little more now i am not easy to offend nor do you frighten me if your language is coarse so be it i have some rough about me as well one corner of the mans mouth crooked upward it looked like a tic a jerk of his cheek muscles but the expression held a lopsided smile well speak thats what you like to do isnt it make up speeches exhort rant to the masses try it on an audience of one the man bowed his head moving that smile out of her view she watched him gather himself with a series of inhaled breaths she could have him beaten she thought mutilated killed she couldright now right hereorder his tongue cut out no more speeches then and she realized part of what was jumbling her mind was the song it was high in her roiling about the curve of her skull like liquid flame mixed with sound hungry to get out she did not even need to order another to act for her she could open her mouth and sing him into oblivion you have betrayed your brothers dreams she saw the words on his lips and then she heard them and then put the two together and understood them have i and did my brother detail his dreams to you barad took a few breaths before answering but his voice was sure when he did no hint of deceit or hesitation in it yes many nights he spoke to me in dreams he looked up i make up no speeches corinn akaran i simply recite what i remember what aliver wished me to say to the world you would do well to listen yourself it is not too late to save yourself from ruin corinn was quicker even than the marah in responding to this insult she said nothing she only opened her mouth slightly and let out the ribbon of song already waiting it slipped through the air on a whisper and the thing she had but thought was done the eyes that had dared to look up at her were eyes no longer they were stone replicas frozen in place delivegu gasped one of the guards whispered a curse of amazement barad himself did not move at all his stone eyes stared at her his expression otherwise unchanged she spun away in her offices an hour later she recalled the dream she had just that morning in it she had arranged to meet grae in her chambers she had not explained why but when he arrived the room was lit with low lamps heavy with incense a single musician in a hidden closet piped a faint tune on a bone whistle and she stood in a thin shift a diaphanous garment his eyes had widened into two blue saucers when he saw her she was naked beneath the dress she could see by the nervous difficulty grae had controlling his eyes that he had noticed this the light from the candle beside her she knew would be languid around her curves and the thought of the power she had just standing there pressed her nipples erect against the thin fabric he noticed that as well i am no virgin she had said i am no blushing maiden i have no desire to be in love again such things are of my past i come to you as i am a queen a mother a woman those three things may be too much for you to handle but if you think yourself monarch enough for it i will have you as a husband this is me consider with that corinn had slipped loose the knot at her waist and shrugged the silken shift from her shoulders corinn let grae take her in from head to toe it pleased her to have his eyes adoring herthat prodded her to cut his examination short ill have your answer now by the way his answer in the dream had been to rise and walk toward her swaying oddly as he did raising first one arm and then the other it was a strange ballet that she understood as a custom of his people a dance of the cranes or some such she had thought it lovely and began to return it but that was just a dream in real life she had not worn that shift she had not made that offer sitting in her office after her encounter with barad she checked these facts several times to be sure of them no she had shown the aushenian nothing but gracious hospitality she had been more generous with her time than normal perhaps had smiled too readily and spoke to him with unguarded familiarity but nothing more than that she was so grateful for this fact that she pressed the tips of her fingernails to her forehead and squeezed thanking the giver for her having had at least that much reserve when rhrenna entered her face as pale and distorted as beeswax grown soft in the sun corinn already knew what she would report the secretary confirmed as much tersely grae had nearly swallowed his tongue when he saw barad though rhrenna spoke to him innocently about what was happeningbetraying no suspicion of himgrae had stammered and even trembled a bit sweat had appeared in instant droplets along his forehead and his attempts at looking casual were clearly forced i cannot believe it was all an act rhrenna said but there it is he scorned you this is not about being scorned corinn cut in the words came before she knew she was to say them but they were true scorn was for lesser people than she its about ruling an empire she said and then gave new orders c hapter t hirtythree she cant climb these mountains naamen said theres no way i can carry her kelis answered the younger man plucked the knuckle root he had been sucking on from the corner of his lips indignant so can i and i will but still when we drop from exhaustion shell be no better off kelis answered this with only a sharp grunt and walked on with his chin high inside he feared the same thing they had trudged toward the peaks for several days their scale growing as they approached deceptive massive in a way that surprised him each time he looked upon them they seemed to swell when his eyes touched them as if they inhaled breaths and puffed out their chests to seem larger nor did the play of the light as the sun progressed seem to follow the natural order at times the upper regions of the mountains were snow dusted at others they appeared to have thick vegetation right up to the peaks on occasion he stopped convinced he faced geometries of sheer black rock unclimbable though he never showed it outwardly he half hoped benabe would plant her feet and declare she and shen would go no farther if she did what could he do but acquiesce in matters of a daughters welfare a talayan mother had the final say though shen was a princess she was also just a young girl even if aliver had been alive benabe would have been her foremost guardian but benabe never did shout them to a halt her face in its own way was as changeable as the strange mountain range she is strong kelis thought more than once stronger than she is frightened by the future on the evening before they were to enter the mountains benabe approached kelis she sat beside him and stared up at the range before them just there so close she could have thrown a stone and hit the first of the foothills her daughter had combed and braided her hair the evening before and the rows were tight against her scalp dusted by the dry soil and twinkling here and there with flecks of gold i hate these mountains she said they are not right they are not true kelis prepared a response and then rejected it thought of another but felt it poor he cleared his throat but said nothing behind them naamen and shen slapped palms together as they played a rhyming game occasionally peals of shens laughter flew by them when i was a girl i used to dream of mountains benabe said a strange thing yes i lived in a flat hot place but i dreamed of high cold things i wanted to see snow like the snow king she clicked her tongue tell me you had some foolish notion like that yourself kelis tell me i loved a prince in ways different than he loved me kelis said but only to himself to her he answered its not foolish to want to see over the horizon dont the wise say he who travels farthest best knows his home the wise say many things enough to confuse the rest of us ever since i saw these mountains ive felt like i created them its those old dreams come back to punish me shen says thats not it though she says the stones put them here to welcome us to repel others yes but to welcome us they will guide us through she says and on the other side welcome us to safety she pulled her gaze in and fixed it on kelis do you believe that if your daughter believes ithe paused but then decided what he had begun to say was the truththen i am comforted she is one of the wise yes listen to her shes wise enough to laugh benabe blew air through her nose smiled and the moment of mirth faded as quickly as it had come the strange thing is that im taking my daughter to find sorcerers who scare me to death and im doing it because the only thing that scares me more is not finding them do you know how shen convinced me it was after my first meeting with sinper ou he calls shen his cousin but there is no kindness in him he would make her his wife if he could or marry her to one of his sons and then he would declare to the world that she lived and as alivers daughter was rightful ruler of the known world kelis felt his pulse quicken you really believe he would challenge the queen if he thought her weakened yes but even if he did not i think he would make a grab for all talay the ous have long thought themselves better than the rest of us big lions why shouldnt they be kings and queens i could see these thoughts surging every time sinpers heart pumped you see he would challenge the queen if he could but i think he would be just as happy breaking the world in two talay is rich enough even for a man like him all he needs is my daughter standing beside him he has but to name her alivers heir and all talay will bow to her sinper will accept on her behalf i was sure of this and sure that he already had a spiderweb around us i had hidden her all these years because i wanted her safe unknown better a living village girl than the target for wolves thats what i believed i still believe it but secrets are hard to keep sangae knew about her long before he approached me and then he had no choice but to tell the other elders and what the elders know the ous soon learn you could announce her as alivers daughter yourself take that from sinper the minute the world knows of her shell have a million enemies most of them disguised as friends she will have true protectors too i would be one of them i would die so she might live benabe studied him her large eyes softening with a kindness that made them look fatigued thank you shen would not like that live for her dont die she thinks there is a better way thats what she told me she came to me and she seemed to know all the doubts within me even though id tried to hide them from her she said that there were a few in the world who could truly protect her the stones they promised her that the love they had for aliver they gave now to her only they were stronger than all others combined only they could guide her safely through what is to come she believes them and i believe theyre powerful but i fear they want more from her than theyll ever give to her there are things theyre not telling her i know there are the woman leaned forward got her weight over her feet and pushed herself upright she turned to walk back to their simple camp the moment of confiding at an end kelis could not help but ask another question before she went you named sinper ous ambitions he said but what are yours what do you want for your daughter for a moment benabes face looked hard and kelis thought she might lash out as she had done in their first days of travel i want her to live live and be happy and i hate the world for making that hard for her cousin your daughter does seem happy listen to her laughter benabe did and then said that comforts you doesnt it she did not wait for his answer but stepped away before he could respond the next day they began the ascent or they intended to begin the ascent they looked at the looming barricade before them and strode toward it kelis measured his strides already trying to use his legs efficiently knowing that he might soon have shens weight to bear it was there in the muscles of his thighs that he first knew something very strange was happening though they entered the foothills and soon the mountains though by midday they could look back and see the plains dropping away behind them though all around them were inclines above and ravines below and though they went around boulders and over ridges and intentionally sought the easiest passes upwarddespite all the physical signs does this feel strange to you kelis whispered to naamen drawing him back as benabe and shen led the way the younger man stood a moment taking in the terrain rubbing the elbow of his small arm with the palm of his other were not climbing he pronounced and that was exactly what kelis had been thinking his legs which knew well the burden of carrying his body were not feeling the strain of ascending from what they could see they seemed to have ascended several thousand feet and yet not even shen breathed heavily as she skipped forward chatting with her mother we are looking for sorcerers naamen added shrugging and walking again perhaps finding sorcery is a good sign they camped that evening near a small stream beside a copse of acacia trees kelis would normally have worried about their dwindling supplies they had little more than roots and dried fruits and a few twists of oryx meat but there were more disturbing things to considerdetails small ones but as disturbing as these mountains how had the air grown so cool and moist how in southern talay had they come across a shallow stream of clear water rippling over white stones at first the thickness of the trees was strange enough from a distance they were lovely to behold signs of life and abundance they had left behind miles and miles ago but as he sat studying them he noticed other things the thorns were savagely long their leaves had a strange look to them green on one side a dull gray on the other veinless and as blank as paper their limbs did not curve with the natural lines of most acacias instead they bent like the joints of agetwisted fingers with bulbous knuckles though he had commented on the trees when he first saw them the more he sat near them the more he wished to be up and moving shen he felt should not look too closely at them the next day they dropped into a lush valley crowded with trees and longgrassed meadows marshy ponds spotted the flat areas connected by a web of streams it was an eerily silent place just the burble of water in the air that was it no insects or animal calls no sign of life at all unnatural barely had he formed the thought when shen called out as if in direct refutation of it look birds a flock appeared from behind them thousands of them a mass of black darts that cut into the air rising straight into the sky they turned as one and carved a rough circle in the air above they moved faster than any birds kelis had ever seen their wings tight at their sides and not as far as he could tell flapping at all they looked to be in a great rush soundless save their motion through the air they cut away and dropped over the far edge of the valley come on shen called tugging her mother forward we should follow them as they walked through the valley and rose at the far end of it kelis had the most vivid sensation yet of feeling the mountains move around them the rate of their strides did not match the speed with which even the distant peaks slipped away behind them he even paused to look back and still felt the sensation of moving just the sensation not actual evidence of something amiss he darted his eyes from one area to another as if he would catch the mountains in the act and shame them he never quite managed it when he rejoined the others he found them studying something on the ground a bird black as a raven but with an insect catchers small frame and beak deadits neck snapped apparently from impact with the ground benabe warned shen not to touch it but the girl showed no sign she intended to they all stood staring for a time not too long for the more they looked the less the bird seemed like a bird kelis was sure its wings had been fixed in position stiff as the gliders he had carved from wood as a boy its eyes were blue the exact color of sky and so striking against the dead black of its plumage it was just the first as they walked on through that day and then another and then several more the ground and rocks and slopes all around them grew more and more littered with broken bodies new flocks rose up behind them every so often and charted their way forward each valley brought new displays of the dead and each mornings flock seemed less numerous or vigorous than the first they were not true birds kelis knew they were sorcery like everything in these mountains beautiful yet malformed it may have been the strangeness of the mountain terrain the fatigue of their daily marches or the workings of the magic so obviously woven in the world around them but kelis found his dreams becoming more vivid crystal clear in a manner they had not been in many years often he relived episodes from recent days altered in some way thus the walk that took up his days stretched into the sleeping hours in one dream the crumpled bodies of those birds rose from the ground and tried to fly again their heads swinging wildly from their broken necks wings crooked and shattered they danced leaping again and again only to twirl back to earth tiny bones snapping and feathers littering the ground another night he started awake thrashing his arms and legs as he fought to escape the trees that had suddenly reached out their warped limbs and grabbed him and then came a nightlong dream of a real evening from years before the womanhood ceremony he and aliver had participated in just after earning manhood rights themselves he relived the entire evening in slow detail as one of the newly established males he danced with the other young warriors from all the central villagesaliver among themin the slow procession that wound them around and around the circle of admiring young women the drums beat a steady rhythm into which darted the plucked metallic bursts of thumb instruments it was a long ceremony and it was here again in his dream he relived each step each jump each clap and smile and toss of his head all done at the same time as the other men they glistened with sweat each lean from running and training all chiseled to the perfection the giver first sang into being aliver may have been lighter hued but in the contours of his body and his movements he was the same as any of the talayans kelis knew where he was each moment of the dance he took pleasure in it at times feeling like he and aliver danced for each other their eyes met often both flashing smiles when they did so he knew that alivers joy was in the ceremony itself in anticipation of what was to come and in joy at so completely belonging but to kelis there was more to it part of the joy for him was in the awareness thatshould aliver wish itanything could happen between them no intimacy would be too much no pleasure one kelis would turn away from it was an attraction he felt for no other man and yet something about it felt right full and complete and sublime in a manner different from his attraction to women it could lead to anything but not that night nor on any night thereafter that evening progressed on a tide propelled by the collective will of the village at some point the music changed tempo announcing the time of choosing had come in an instant the new women swarmed in on the men grabbing them by the wrist shouting out their choices with voices and laughter aliver became the center of a swirling chaos of young beauties kelis himself was pulled in two different directions for a time until one girl won the tugging match by grasping his tuvey band and swirling away with him benabe won aliver perhaps with the aid of his acquiescence what a beauty she was then kelis could see it as clearly as any man aliver was as eager as she was eager enough that he left the group at her urging without so much as a glance of leavetaking to kelis perhaps that was the night benabe conceived perhaps while he made love to one woman thinking of a man that man planted the seed that would be shen in another woman perhapsif thaddeus clegg had not arrived soon after to recall aliver to the fight that would eventually take his lifekelis might have watched aliver and benabe wed and would have been near them as shen entered the world and grew he awoke with this thought and during the few quiet minutes left before the others stirred he tried to believe he could have lived satisfied with that and then he had a different thought perhaps shen is my daughter as well that would explain why she scared him so and why he already loved her more than his own life for that was the truth what he had said to benabe was neither a comfort nor a vain boast though he had only known the girl a few weeks it already seemed that protecting her was the single task of meaning in his life and then with an abruptness that meant it took but a few minutes to descend to the plains again the mountains ended one morning the four travelers wove through the foothills and trod once more across a flat landscape one devoid of shade unpeopled and as barren as the far south kelis had first approached with aliver years before even the hardy acacia trees were but stunted infrequent versions of their normal grandeur it was there that they came upon the man naamen saw him first and indicated it with a grunt the group of four stopped and stared the man stood as still as a statue garbed in a robe the same sand color as the land around him he clasped his hands together at his waist and seemed to carry nothing no supplies no weapons or staff not even a skin of water he was hooded but the sun reflecting off the sand lit his face from beneath he stared straight at them as if he had been waiting for them to arrive at just that spot on the world kelis raked his eyes across the landscape searching for others for signs that would explain the man featureless desolation stretched out in all directions he focused on the figure again was he a mirage they were all seeing a sign they had journeyed away from sanity shen walked forward benabe whispered her name kelis half formed a protest himself but he held it behind his teeth he strode to keep pace with the girl as she neared him the man finally moved he fell forward onto his knees and into a bow that pressed his forehead to the ground once there with his arms stretched out to either side and his palms flat against the parched earth the man did nothing more shen glanced back at the others her expression one of amused perplexity she knelt and touched her fingertips to the mans shoulder she intoned the traditional words of talayan greeting old friend the sun shines on you but the water is sweet the water is cool your majesty and clear to look upon the man answered speaking his words to the earth you are loved in those few words kelis recognized the speakers voice i know shen said as if she heard such greetings regularly did the stones send you to tell me so the stones the prostrate man sounded confused for a moment but then his voice picked up with the rhythms of practiced formality the santoth called you and you came that is a blessing come with me princess i will take you to them they have much to tell you before he knew it the mans name whispered through keliss lips leeka alain the man raised his head turned and looked at kelis for a moment kelis thought himself mistaken the mans face was nothing like the craggy one he remembered on the general and then it was and a moment later it was not his features appeared as fixed and solid as anybody elses but his face contained more than a single mans features it was ancient and cracked and eroded with the wear of ages and yet it was also a face of clear green eyes and a oncebroken nose and lips that glistened with moisture when his tongue wet them they dont call me that here the man said but that was my name before c hapter t hirtyfour the breakneck speed at which the league clipper careened into acacias main harbor would have been reckless even in the light of day at night it was madness but league pilots were nothing if not adept at all things nautical and the officer at the helm of the rayfin carved a wild course through the anchored vessels passed the trading floats he hooked the vessel around the inner watchtower and dropped sails only when momentum alone was more than enough to place it skimming along a fortunately unoccupied section of leagueowned pier he shouted for the messenger to disembark before they had even halted the man did not need the encouragement he leaped from a height and ran with all the haste he had been ordered to show a scant ten minutes later sire dagon sat bleary eyed wearing a robe loosely wrapped about his gaunt frame mist so clouded his head that his servants had to carry himagainst his muted protestsand prop him up in his chair even sitting there with the bay windows thrown open to a chill breeze and lamps on high he as yet floated on the chorus of angelic voices he conducted during his mist dreams his head swirled with song his body light as a silken puppet and able to dance in midair only now being tugged back down to earth blinking he asked the messenger what could possibly merit the interruption at such a delicate hour i came in haste the man said so i gather sire dagon said cocking his head back in a manner that for some reason helped him see middledistance objects more clearly the man spoke with clipped ishtat inspectorate tones a fact that registered a spike in the leaguemans attention ishtats were so highly trained that rarely were they charged with tasks as menial as delivering a message what i dont yet know is why but i trust you are about to tell me who sent you the league council why did they not send a messenger bird from thrain the news i carry was deemed too grave to be put in care of a pigeon in care of a pigeon sire dagon found that amusing images of officer pigeons with military bearing cooing orders to a small legion of birds dancing up from the ground with the aid of the music yet pulsing in his veins sire you need to listen quite impertinently the messenger shouted for sire dagons servants he demanded they bring a sobering concoction to match the leaguemans mist distillation he needed him back completely and immediately he said he must have said a few other very convincing things as well because before dagon could stop it his manservant stuffed an invigorating pill up one of his nostrils not pleasant but effective within a minute he was more awake than he wished the burning itch in his nose and at the back of his throat making sure of it forgive me sire the messenger said bowing to him now that his orders had been heeded i was commanded that i waste not a minute in delivering my message but you have to be able to hear it and understand it too this message is from the council without dissent i wear on my neck this collar secured with a truth knot that confirms my words are truth the man stepped forward bent and opened his shirt collar so that dagon could study the thin rope tied about his neck sire dagon yanked at it pulling it close to an untrained eye the knot that closed the circle looked like the confusion a child might create but in its loops and bunches was an intricacy that was very practiced indeed and there could be no mistaking its authenticity the messenger had been sent by the league council sire dagon motioned for the man to step away regaining his dignity he said i am listening and so he sat hearing about the horror that had emerged from sire neens mistakes in the space of few moments everything changed all their hopes their plans all of it would have to wait instead he would have to compose lies faster than ever before he would have to win the queens trust for they would need her armies in the war that was coming a few hours later sire dagon traversed the terraces and stairways that would lead him to the queen a messenger himself now she would not be easy to gain an audience with sire dagon knew the things she had recently occupied herself with apparently she had managed to capture barad the lesser what a stir this had caused among the nobles all the work of some agent of hers one delivegu a lucky man and now one officially acknowledged at court word of the capture had spread among the common folk so that whatever benefit there was in it was not immediately obvious indeed a rumor spread that she had mutilated barad cut out his eyes and shoved stones in their places still others said she cursed him through sorcery it was the sort of mad talk that might have sparked the mans rebellion into life but corinn had finally ordered the distribution of a new wine in so doing she belatedly fulfilled the leagues wishes but that was so often the case she had also politely but firmly sent king grae back to his homeland the leaguemen were not entirely sure what to make of that but there was something of interest beneath the surface of it surely with all this happening corinn had every right to consider herself tied up in a web of complications how very simple such things would seem to her by the end of this day just outside the queens quarters sire dagon stood with his arms outstretched as a marah searched him for hidden daggers he tried to keep his gaze forward his face wrinkled with annoyed tolerance the last thing he wanted to do was look at any of the numrek two of whom stood watching but his eyes had wills of their own they flicked over long enough to confirmdamn itthat the guards on either side of the door were looking at him was there anything to be read in their craggy features he was not sure stupid control yourself he thought without showing it he breathed deep and slow steadying himself leaguemen controlled their emotions not the other way around before he was waved through he even resorted to the silent counting regime he had been taught as a boy arithmetic exercises that he conducted in the back of his mind and that helped render his face expressionless all right the marah said you may enter forgive the formality sire he stood to the side and motioned toward the corridor sire dagon gave him a look meant to indicate that he knew very well where he was going it is what he would have done in normal circumstances again though his eyes chose to disobey him tremulous they slid to the side as he passed and yes the numrek to his left was watching him no mistaking it the beast had been observing him with more than casual interest once in the corridor the leagueman quickened his step trying to walk quietly and listen for any indication that the numrek was following he had to pass another two numrek milling about the anteroom but he managed it without mishap once in the front office proper he swept in on rhrenna tripping on the edge of the carpet and banging his leg against a divan the secretary frowned at him sire dagon he did not slacken his strides reaching out with one hand he clamped his claw around the womans elbow wrenching her into motion she called out in protest but he shushed her savagely be silent your life depends on this the piper sitting in the corner near the queens actual door did not pay enough attention to look perplexed he just glanced at the two rushing forward and lifted his flute to announce their presence he had sounded but a few notes before sire dagon opened the queens door he swirled in and shoved it closed again a moment later releasing rhrenna as he did it was all an unaccustomed amount of physical activity for the man enough to leave him panting corinn had been on her balcony she stepped back into the dimmer light inside studying the two with an unreadable but certainly not welcoming expression your majesty dagon bowed quickly sucking a few breaths as he did so i am here to tell you everything everything without the slightest deception first though have you a secret room a safe room what moving toward her he said you do of course i know you do a room that you can enter from these chambers that only you have the key to and that you can lock where is it sire dagon i no he said not now in a safe place get us there then we talk please corinn your very life is in danger please the queen crossed her arms im in my chambers with my guards but a shout away from whom am i in danger i see only one madman at the moment oh you stubborn thing fine as she watchednow visibly shocked by his outburstssire dagon brushed past her he inspected one corner of the room quickly looking high and low he measured a few steps to the side and then grasped the tapestry he found there along its bottom edge with a flourish he flung it to the side sending the needlework depiction of a sunset behind the senival mountains rippling toward the floor tiles and there it was as he knew it would be nothing more than two depressions at waist height in the stone each about the size of the heel of a childs hand he pressed his against both and pushed for a moment the wall was as immobile as it looked he cursed he heard one of the women whisper something he cursed again and then remembered he pressed harder on the right hand than the left of course a doorsized portion of the wall gave way suddenly smooth and light before his hands there he said turning panting now you know that we know of this would i betray that information without cause please come in with me ill tell you everything once we are inside the queen glanced at rhrenna sire dagon knew some message passed between them but he was too fatigued to riddle it out not that he needed to by the giver he had just revealed a secret hundreds of years old one that by itself changed everything about the trust between the akarans and the league he hoped it worked of course if it did not the queen would likely be dead within the hour without speaking a word or looking him in the face corinn moved past him through the opening rhrenna followed her blue eyes hard on his dagon slipped in behind them he made sure the wall fit snugly back into place and then he stepped away from it from this side the roughhewn stone which appeared to be lit from above by an opening to the sky betrayed no sign of the door only at his feet where a fan of thick dust had been swept aside was there a sign to confirm he had just passed through the wall how strange to finally be here he had known of this place since his early days in his office but never knew that he would see it himself he turned to face the two women before he was fully around rhrenna had slammed her shoulder into his thin chest pushing him back against the wall he felt the prick of a tiny undoubtedly razorsharp blade at his neck the meinish woman pressed it skillfully with enough of the flat of the blade that he could feel the pulse of his artery beneath it and with enough of the edge that he felt his skin on the verge of bursting open around it her small face was close to his chin her teeth bared as if she would bite him as well as cut him he had expected this too but it was savage enough an action to take his breath away again explain yourself now dagon corinn said she stood only a step away for the chamber was small more like a fissure in a cave than a manmade room lit from above she was frightening all highlight or shadow he had no problem believing her capable of sorcery she said rhrenna never liked you shed slit your throat and bathe in the shower of blood that would bring considering that you have shoved us into a secret rooma room that you should know nothing aboutill happily pardon her and curse the leagueman who challenges me a few more breaths this was so awkward but to get through it he must get through it the best way to do that was to hit her so directly she was stunned to silence and then he would regain some control queen corinnhe gaspedfirst you must know that sire neen and much of the envoy were killed ah he flinched at a change in the pressure of the knife he grasped the dolphin pendant hanging from his chest the symbol of the league and caressed it between his fingers the mission is a failure we were betrayed in the most foul way there are traitors within the walls of the palace at this very moment please have the woman draw back her knife corinn did not do so my brother i know not sire dagon admitted is he alive i dont know perhaps he was captured he was under our full protection of course but was as i said betrayed we think by whom the lothan aklun the auldek both we arrived to find them at war they both sought to make us pawns tricked us there was a massacre and your majesty most important right now the numrek have betrayed us corinn stood still for a long time she looked like some beautiful bloodless witch the type of being who might haunt and excite adolescent nightmares for a few moments sire dagon felt he might have failed there was too much to say too much to explain too many lies to navigate even as he created more for a moment the idea of rhrenna slicing his life from him did not seem so bad at least it would end the complications what do you mean the numrek betrayed us theyoh its hard to explain with a dagger at my throat corinn shrugged do it anyway so he did as best he could flinching often feeling the trickles of blood that oozed out of small nicks made by the knife he could smell rhrennas breathnot unpleasantand hear the moist coagulation of his blood on her fingers when she flexed them he told of how the ambergris arrived to find the lothan aklun and auldek in open war with each other the aklun were suffering nearly defeated sire neen tried to arrange a peace but he failed the auldek met with him under the guise of parley he said but calrach chose the moment to switch sides the auldek were their cousins similar in many ways together they slaughtered the entire delegation party only a few from the landing party got back to the ambergris the vessel stayed a time in aklun waters trying to assess the situation by the time they sailed for home they believed two things the lothan aklun were all but conquered and the numrek were trying to get the auldek to attack the known world via the same route they had used so he spoke he did not tell the truth save for the final point as an alternative though his version of events was no less credible than the real one you are telling me were at war at war with a race ive done nothing to all because of a league gambit gone wrong all because you couldnt tell an enemy from a friend sire dagon seemed to have difficulty accepting the entirety of the statement but he could not settle on which part to take issue with he answered rather sheepishly ah yes in part and then not so sheepishly we were not the only ones fooled but that doesnt matter your majesty at the moment i pray that we have the leisure for you to berate our stupidity at length now is not the time though the numrek have played us all for fools and they yet stand outside your door your majesty they must be exterminated right now today this very hour the vessel the messenger arrived in is stuffed with ishtat they are armed and ready and they will take the palace any moment now what corinn somehow made the word sound like a spell of damnation its all we can do if the numrek knew that their brethren have succeeded theyd begin the slaughter thats what theyve been waiting for a sign to commence the marah they will some will die in the confusion but others weve tried to contact to explain you take great liberties rhrenna spoke through teeth that still seemed ready to bite and why should i believe you the numrek have never once shown a sign of deceit oh yes they have majesty theyve written their treachery in blood in your brothers blood i fear you havent seen it but must you lay eyes on everything to believe it real as for you why would i come to you with this tragedy if it were not true what fool would make up such misfortune corinn stared at him for a long moment if this is true how would the numrek learn what happened theyre not going to pilot a ship back themselves are they i i dont know sire dagon sputtered would one of your people carry the message no of course not theyve attacked us we rhrenna interrupted youre the messenger what sire dagon grimaced no im here to warn you you fool rhrenna continued if what youve said is true look at what youve just done you walked in here sweating ashenfaced nervous you think the numrek guards wouldnt notice that then you push us into a secret room what more confirmation do they need that something grave has happened and youre going to attack them only a handful of them are on the island the rest will learn all they need to know because of your actions sire dagon was speechless for a moment he then said but weve brought ishtat theyll attack any moment thats why we are safe in here but even as he said this he felt his logic falling away beneath him of course his actions would confirm the betrayal in the other lands the few numrek on acacia would die but they would act as assassins in their last moments perhaps his appearance had given them a few extra minutes to kill chosen targets the rest of the clan safely on the teh coast would dig in and wait who knew what preparations they had made already what supplies and weapons had been stored corinn speaking to rhrenna now snapped how many numrek are within the palace today when the meinish woman craned around to answer corinn flicked her fingers indicating she could release him she did and sire dagons fingers went immediately to his throat he touched it gently as if his fingers could somehow do more damage than the blade had he realized rhrenna was answering the queen but he caught only the end of it and there is a handful with aaden and mena at the carmelia stadium the queen let out a gasp of air as if she had just been punched in the chest she did it again forming it into a word this time aaden she stepped for the hidden door but sire dagon dove to block it from her out of my way corinn hissed this so fiercely that sire dagon despite knowing it was the worst possible action half stepped to the side he could not help it for it suddenly seemed she had the power to crush him in an instant if he did not obey her shoulder brushed him and he watched her from the back as she sought out the contours that would open the door she had just leaned to push against it when one of the numrek codeth called for the queen from the other side of the door the feigned calm of his voice was shortlived a rush of new voices beat it down with the clang of steel on steel and the commotion of furniture being overturned nearer sire dagon heard the queen whisper her sons name barely more than an exhaled breath c hapter t hirtyfive sitting beside devoth was the most unnerving experience rialus had ever lived through the auldek had all the brutal physicality of their numrek cousins if anything they had distilled it to its essence and then stirred into it a strange gentility that was all the more incongruous something like ferocious anger seethed beneath devoths tanned features but above it lay a veneer of boredom rialus could not decide whether devoth was passionate about life or completely fatigued by it that was confusing but even more unsettling was that the auldek oozed more aristocratic confidence than any acacian noble rialus had ever seenand he had seen many devoth leaned back in his seat one arm propped at an angle his knees splayed wide it was a posture of complete relaxation that also managed to convey that he could spring to his feet at any moment and stride across the world lopping off heads devoth now wore a shirt a thin somewhat dandyish white cotton garment with crimson satin buttons that matched his trousers a gold band ringed his thick neck the tips of his long fingernails had been glazed silver and his eyesif rialus was not mistakenwere lined with black makeup if rialus had seen a numrek so dressed in acacia he would have laughed at the absurdity of it here the effect was almost dashing rialus leagueman devoth asked how do you enjoy being our guest they were sitting with a few others in a private box beneath an awning of a silken fabric that sheltered them from the strength of the sun above and below them stretched a stadium to rival acacias carmelia the terraced benches surrounding it rose at a steep angle to a dizzying height rialus knew that the field was actually dug into the earth the appearance of height was actually one of depth but situated as he was at the midpoint of its height the view below and the expanse above made him queasy youve no complaints i hope devoth prodded rialus leagueman rialus leagueman what an annoyance he had tried several times to make the auldek understand that he was not part of the league he hated them as a matter of fact they had brought him here as a prisoner he spat on leaguemen and had nothing in common with them so he had said but it never sank in one guard had even squeezed rialuss skull and murmured something about the egg shape of it and then laughed at rialuss sputtering refutation that there was anything leaguelike about the shape of his head curses and exclamations bounced around in a fury in rialuss mind but he had to bite back his complaints and reply youve been most kind devoth seemed pleased to hear it he looked at the other highranking auldek seated nearby making sure they took note of rialuss response they were all of his clan except calrach his son allek and his half brother mulat the fact that they were allowed to sit with devoths people was a considerable honor allek in particular drew stares and whispers wherever he went if rialus had not known the reason for their astonishment he would have thought the boy a longlost prince he was more than that he was a miracle to a people who had not seen a child of their race in hundreds of years calrach always more canny than rialus expected had known what he was doing when he brought him along allek who sat in the row in front of rialus and devoth turned around and jabbed rialuss leg tell the truth neptos which is the richer people acacians or auldek i know what i would say but what about you rialus had the momentary desire to kick the grinning youth in the face but he answered the boy calmly he had actually expected some question like this considering how much pleasure the numrek seemed to take in publicly taunting him i cant answer that ive seen most of the known world which is wide and rich and wondrous but ive seen very little of ushen braeas yet only avina and what do you think of it allek pushed very impressive rialus admitted from what ive seen from what youve seen mulat broke in he had just bitten a piece of roasted pork taken from the plates of food that occasionally passed from hand to hand his chewing did not hinder his speaking what youve seen is less than nothing its but a sliver avina stretches along the coast for thirty miles thirty miles of city of palaces and stadiums and monuments there is nothing to match that in your lands devoth did not seem pleased with the numrek presumptions he did not address them smiling instead at rialus you will see more rialus leagueman many grand things youre our guest so youll see the things that make us great we will always treat you well now and in the future you can be sure of it you believe me he had to push it didnt he rialus thought they always did it was one way the auldek were not so different from their numrek cousins yes of course rialus began but then faltered unsure how to express his emotions what was he grateful to be alive thrilled to have watched everyone he had traveled across the gray slopes with be slaughtered looking forward to whatever bloody spectacle he was here to watch overjoyed to be trapped in a land of brutes who threatened to stick redhot pokers up his backside content to know almost nothing of his fate or what was expected of him resigned that if he did ever find his way back to acacia the queen would squash him beneath her shapely foot im quite comfortable he managed good good devoth grinned and tossed his hair around it gives me joy to hear it the mans hard chin cut the air as he looked about his eyes lit green by the sun he kept brushing his hair back from his face but he also moved in a manner to make sure it fell right back before his eyes a second later rialus almost suggested he tie it back with a cord or perhaps get it trimmed not for the first time rialus wondered if devoth was simpleminded or if he really might be unaware of the way in which rialuss life was a misery he knew neither was likely devoth rialus feared was in complete control of everything the crowd which had waited amid a murmur of conversation erupted in applause and shouts rialus kept his gaze on devoth who was on his feet roaring with the rest of them lucky because rialus would not have managed to hide his animus if devoth had been paying attention to him he felt his indignation rising again it did not get far because his eyes caught the motion on the field his mouth opened silent while those around him cheered from six different openings in the wall of the arena columns of armed soldiers strode onto the field by their relatively normal stature rialus could tell they were not auldek but neither did they appear entirely human one group wore wolfhead helmets another was composed entirely of squat muscled brutes their naked torsos gray metal barbs jutting from their cheeks they bore curved short swords in both hands yet another group were slim as acrobats and wore light blue with plumes on their heads in place of helmets they carried only slender pikes you understand this rialus leagueman devoth asked not in the slightest rialus admitted the auldek laughed ah i forget your ignorance so much to learn those soldiers they are not auldek of course not someone in the row behind rialus exclaimed auldek do not draw auldek blood what do you think us devoth explained it was agreed that we would not kill our own that is why our ultimate punishment is banishment not death we fight among ourselves yes he grinned making the statement seem an admission of a guilty pleasure but in something like thisa matter to be decided in bloodwe let our slaves represent us it is an honor for them these are special slaves selected to be divine children they are elevated above other slaves before you are totem warriors of the eight clans of the auldek here see over there he leaned across rialus pointing first toward groups of warriors who had feline facial tattoos and then the others as he named them the shivith the spotted cats those over there are the kern the blue cranes they look slim yes delicate dont be fooled theyre deadly the anet clan worships the hooded snake the kulish krathose with their backs to usblack crows those gray onesantoks the wolves represent the wrathic from beyond the sky mount the fru nithexek are brothers of the sky bear but they are weak few in number the numrek have no totem and theredevoth drew back so that rialus could see past him to the last groupare the snow lions the lvin those are mine my lions my totem he timed this announcement perfectly for the lvin were the last to enter though rialus had no idea what a snow lion was there was no mistaking the impact of the slaves so named they came roaring like some beast of the talayan plains most of them had white faces sometimes tattooed or painted down across their torsos in the center were the largest men several of whom sported tresses as white as snow as they marched and yelled and smacked life into those around them their locks danced about them like snakes writhing there are other totems in the land devoth continued his voice low and filled with pride but they are small ants these are the eight clans we are the ones who decide the future and today we fight for the honor of being the spear point none of your race has seen this none other ever will enjoy and feel privileged both enjoyment and feelings of privilege lived somewhere far from rialuss present state of mind he had yet to sort out the intricacies of auldek social and political life he doubted he would understand it all even if he spent years in ushen brae which he prayed to the giver that he would not over the last few days rialus had seen enough of the slaves to know that they were often tattooed adorned with jewelry and physically modified but the changes were minor on the household servants these warriors were monstrosities yet they were the auldeks own creations why do that to them why not do it themselves if the auldek found such things attractive perhaps it was evidence of his compromised mental state because before he could censor himself rialus heard this question escape his lips why is it the slaves who are so adorned the group answered him with incredulous silence i would have thought that rialus stopped unsure what he might have thought he changed tack i mean why not yourselves since the animals are your totems mulat murmured a curse under his breath and then added stupid piss pot of a man the totems are not animals they are gods who live in the animals several auldek faces continued to stare at him words came from his mouth unbidden very interesting that theyjust slaves i meandecide this spearpoint thing that is what the slaves are for calrach barked over his shoulder it is a blood test you fool i see rialus said that explains it then devoth studied rialus making him unsure whether he was about to reach out and smash him across the nose or have a glass of juice the auldek said motioning that a passing tray should be held for the acacians consideration rialus obliged he took the glass of red liquid in both hands clenching it tightly to keep his hands from trembling calrach is correct devoth said this is the way it is our slaves are our children their fate is inseparable from ours the changes to their bodies are called belonging we dont make all the belonging changes to them ourselves some they make themselves some things only the lothan aklun had the magic for that it seems has come to an end because of the league we will have to be repaid for this very much so and that closed the subject a relief for rialus they turned their attention to the spectacle before them to begin with individual warriors from the different groups taunted others into single combat listening to the banter they threw around the way they laughed and swore and taunted put rialus in mind of the children who dove for oysters at the docks of acacias western harbor those suntanned shirtless youths had the same easy competitive air about them but the divers did not strike blows that severed a crow womans arm at the shoulder or split a cat mans head so that the crown down to below the eyes went spinning end over end or that smashed a lovely crane womans knee between two war hammers rialus really really felt he was going to be sick he motioned as much with the fingers of one hand vaguely calling for attention it was the type of gesture that would have brought a servant to his side in acacia it was ignored here a hot sweat broke out on his forehead and spread throughout his body saliva surged into his mouth and stayed there no matter how much he swallowed what was wrong with these people looking about him he could not match the merriment on their faces with the scenes of carnage that evoked it before long he sat with his eyes closed watching only with his ears which he would have stuffed with wax if he thought he could get away with it and had any thus he passed what seemed like several hours the clash of weapons the cheers of pleasure and the boasting and the occasional screams of agony went on interminably he had begun to think they would never end and he was rather surprised when they stopped a great ovation took over the arena for a time and when it finally died the sound faded to a low murmur of conversation and movement rialus opened his eyes is it over no no not at all devoth said the cleaners will tend the field for a time and then we have the melee that is where matters are truly decided the cleaners as quickly as he thought the question he got the answer several other doors different from the ones the slaves had entered by had also been opened from them emerged the monsters rialus knew by description though he had not seen their work on the plains of talay antoks there was no mistaking the swinish enormity of them nor was there anything hiding the fact that they brought their crosshatched horrors of mouths down on the slain warriors with voracious enthusiasm rialus looked away holding back the convulsions building in his stomach devoth sat back in his seat again relaxed once more so he said as if he were asking how he liked the weather or the view rialus leagueman will you do as we wish may i ask what you intend just so that i can better answer your question devoth thought about this for a time he shrugged gesturing toward the garish units preparing for the next battle he said see those they fight for privilege see how we honor our slaves at times they decide our futures the clan that wins here today will lead the invasion they determine which clan will be the initial spear thrust the invasion of your lands they will beat the winter traveling over the north numrek showing the way he leaned in and whispered these honored ones will have the most fun the rest of the auldek will follow to complete the work why rialus asked devoth looked at him i mean thatthat it need not be war that comes of this i could help make a new treaty with queen corinn as he said it he knew it was true she would be angry and he would suffer her wrath first but in the end he would be able to convince her to see reason they could avoid war of course they could sometimes great sacrifices needed to be made but better that than complete destruction he continued hope already quickening his speech the league could be appeased and the trade continued i daresay you could win even better terms terms devoth said this with an openmouthed grimace as if the word were a dead mouse he had just discovered on his tongue why make total war when you could negotiate peace the queen wouldnt like it but you could convince her to give you a toehold in the known world the numrek have had such i could ask as your devoth had heard enough nah you dont know anything leagueman weve been too long alive too long without real war we havent lived as our ancestors did in many many years time that we do the numrek may have done what you say but they are the weakest among us cowards lowborn this was certainly said loud enough for calrach and mulat to hear but neither of them turned or acknowledged it we true auldek know that nothing matters but bravery in battle we were robbed of this when the lothan aklun gave us everlasting life you think thats a gift they who gave us life denied us immortality made death something to fear this rialus leagueman has been our shame that ends now the auldek will go to war we will die in glorious battle and our womens wombs will quicken with life thats immortality leagueman to die and live on also perhaps you dont understand this but the outcome doesnt matter talk no more of negotiation of terms we will take the world rialus leagueman or we will die with blade bloodied either way is joy for me and doom for us rialus thought doom for us devoth leaned back looking down at the field we have asked you many questions already he said you have answered well because of you we trust the tale calrach tells we believe in the boy allek because of you we will embark on this journey i thank you for that but now is when your work begins you will help us shape our plans you will answer many more questions about your nation tell us the geography draw us maps tell us customs name the powers name the people we will meet you will prepare us so that nothingnothingwill surprise us you will find the things that we have overlooked and you will tell us that as well he paused tented his fingers before him and turned to rialus am i right in saying that you will do these things rialus recognized that no matter how plainly it was put to himthe ramifications of his answer were enormous knots upon knots upon knots all of which should be untied before any answer was arrived at he knew all that was true but he also knew he could never untie all those knots better just to answer so he did c hapter t hirtysix mor had not seen this vessel messenger before that made her nervous no matter how often she told herself it did not matter it was not him she would be speaking to about the important matters he was but the vessel and of course vessels were interchangeable only the contents within mattered but still she had first to look into a strangers eyes and search for a loved one this was not something she had ever grown accustomed to they sat across from each other on a hillock in the barren stretch between two walls once the area had been a park but that was long ago now it was abandoned and overgrown with briars home to rats and other scurrying things they were alone save for the few guards who stood at a distance on the lookout for the unlikely patrol of the divine children they had planned the meeting to avoid this hello mor avenger the man said it honors me to meet you as it honors me to carry an elder within and his message from the free people he bowed his head as he spoke showing her the short bristle of a few weeks hair growth across his crown the skin visible beneath it and dotted with the heartshaped imprints of the sky bear unusual for the fru nithexek was not a numerous clan mor answered him formally the honor is mine may this vessel never crack the man looked up his widespaced eyes were large brown and intense he smiled i have not cracked yet mor avenger i wont today you can rest assured of that before i begin tell me is it true do we hold a prince of the akarans mor nodded could he be the rhuin fa anything could be she answered feeling suddenly testy in addition to uneasy it was inappropriate for him to waste time feeding his own curiosity whether he is or not isnt for me to say pursing his lips the messenger said nor for me to ask judging by your tone forgive me for us in the westlands though we are hungry for hope we hear rumors but weve heard rumors for hundreds of years nothing yet has come of them i didnt take you as that old the man smiled again you are anxious to begin i understand shall we despite her impatience mor scanned the overgrown walls before answering she made eye contact with tunnel who stood with his arms crossed leaning against the arch through which they would exit he acknowledged her with a lift of his chin like everything about him it was a gruff gesture but it was comforting as well yes she said do begin the messenger cleared his throat his gaze flicked to mor amused just a moment longer and then his arms went limp in his lap and he seemed to focus his entire consciousness on his breathing eyes closed he inhaled and exhaled every so often he let out a low moan for a time his head dropped forward as if he were asleep and then it seemed he really was asleep his moaning nothing but faint snoring that was how it always was mor waited watching him curious as ever about what was about to happen then the moaning ceased the mans breathing stopped for an uncomfortably long few moments it was as if the sleeping man had passed into death and then he looked up he gasped and blinked his eyes open his now blue eyesthe whites veined with a crimson lacework of age yellowed and tiredwere not the messengers eyes anymore nor was his voice the same dearest his mouth said the voice coming out did not fit the shape or the movement of his lips a dry voice slow and patient and heavy with melancholy and love it was a voice she knew well from her girlhood but had not heard from the actual man in some years you are not my little girl are you her first impulse was to refute that yes yes she was his little girl of course she was thats all she ever would be it was cruel for him to say otherwise but she had said that on other occasions and it did no good instead she swallowed and said no but i am the one who was that little girl now i am the woman who remembers that girl and remembers you hello yoen the messenger smiled his eyes closed for a moment opened yoens voice said hello dearest i wish my eyes could truly see you at least once more before i fly that would do my heart good let it be so let us make it so a tear welled from mors left eye and raced down her cheek she had not known there was a danger of this she wiped at it embarrassed flooded with memories she rarely allowed to surface yoen the nearest thing to a father she had ever knownmore than that he was father and mother both and a balm for the loss of a brother life was cruel and cruel again to take everything from her as a child and make her relearn herself under this mans care and then later to ask her to be whole unto herself when he escaped to join the elders in the westlands on the sky isle it was too much to bear the thing was she knew that the eyes looking at her though they appeared to be yoens were not his they were the messengers and it was he who was seeing enough to be able to take part in this conversation yoen himself did not see her he had instilled himself and his words inside this man at least a fortnight ago they had lived in him and now the vessel let them out more than that he shaped them he spoke and reacted with yoens voice and mind even though yoen himself was not part of it mor had never understood the process and she had never liked it what do the elders wish of me mor asked tell me of the akaran she could tell him things but whatever responses he made to what she said had to have been embedded in the vessel weeks ago it made little sense but few of the things the people had learned from the lothan aklun did she answered as fully as she could telling yoen everything that seemed important she did leave out how she had reacted during her first encounter with dariel but that was a detail not the substance he needed do you believe he speaks truly with more bitterness than she intended mor said i dont know what truth means to acacians yoens eyes stared at her waited he seems to believe himself he is earnest but that doesnt mean hes truthful he may just be foolish we must be careful with him yoens voice said after considering this for a long moment if he is the living prophecy he must be allowed to find it himself we cannot thrust it upon him we can however take certain steps this is what you will do test him further find a true test mors eyes widened a true test meant a task to be accomplished in the real world with real danger and if he dies then he is not the rhuin fa mor my dearest go with the wait mor interrupted what she knew to be the beginning of a farewell yoen how do we know that we dont err by forcing a role upon him you yourself once told me that the prophecy of the rhuin fa might be nothing more than a tale to keep our hopes alive perhaps we are giving this akaran an importance he shouldnt have putting our faith in someone who may not deserve it though he only had his eyes to express emotion mor was sure she could see the look of fatigued love yoen had so often showered upon her dearest how do you know thats not how prophecy works that question was still circling through mors mind half an hour later after she had parted with yoen bade the vessel farewell and worked her way back down under avina tunnel led the way dariels cell was changed so often and she was so distracted with managing the peoples myriad concerns that it was comforting having tunnels broad gray back to follow they arrived at dariels new room before she knew it tunnel turned and studied her concern on his face she had hardly said a word to him as they walked she realized he had no idea what yoen had said to her considering his obvious affection for dariel it was insensitive to hold to her silence its all right she said reaching out and touching the brawny bulk of his forearm i have no orders to harm him he will just be tested further tunnel lifted his chin a gesture that seemed to have a variety of meanings for him this time she thought it indicated relief acknowledgment of reason and a slight hint of see i told you yes tunnel knows she touched her palm to his muscled chest pulled it back quickly go in let skylene know she may proceed as we discussed she can answer his questions i will listen from here for a time once she was alone in the cramped passageway mor leaned against the stone wall next to the door as in all these abandoned regions the door was old and half rotten it sat slightly ajar tugging at hinges that probably would not hold much longer there was enough space that mor could listen knowing she was hidden from the speakers inside tunnels entry stopped whatever they had been talking about he greeted the prince merrily like an old friend he even audibly slapped him on the back they spoke foolishness for a few minutes although within it mor recognized that tunnel was conveying her permission to finally educate the akaran it was time as she had already discussed with skylene to tell him the truth of things mor noted that skylene and dariel spoke with an alarming level of familiarity she did not like it were they all so infatuated with the akaran even skylene her lover the thought of it almost drove her into the room but she was not ready yet and did not want to enter until she knew what she would say and could do it without hesitation anyway she had agreed that skylene would be kind to him in ways that she was not willing to be perhaps that was all she was doingplaying a role a little too well dariel spoke easily enough the topic nowhis naval battles with the league during the war with hanish meinseemed to fire his oratory he wants us to think him a hero mor thought and because of it she wanted to doubt his version of events still it was easy to listen to him easy to forget her skepticism as he told of ships smashing together of nighttime raids hidden raider camps and the great work of sabotage that destroyed much of the leagues platforms mor remembered that place well and it was stunning to imagine the scene he described flames roaring up into the sky why did you hate them so skylene asked the scratch of a scribes stylus right behind her words your family didand doespartner with them you came here with them it was personal back then there i was a prince of an overthrown empire hiding among brigands fighting the league because they made life hard for the criminals who were my new family yet i came here allied with them more aware than ever of their crimes but was then betrayed by them to the people who enslave you and now im in your hands all very amusing he laughed how can i live day after day trying to make decisions and yet feel that ive not had one moment of control of any of it at least you laugh tunnel said at some point what else can i do you control more than you acknowledge skylenes voice said i would have loved to have seen the platforms destroyed that didnt come without a price what was the price dariel took a moment to respond i lost a person dear to me the man who was my second father a second father mor recalled yoens eyes embedded in the vessels face but then pushed the image away it was not the same whatever the akaran had experienced his loss was nothing compared to what each of the people suffered dariel continued and i came to understand later that my actions killed many quota children i wish that werent so it was children like you who died there mor felt like clearing her throat and spitting or bursting into the room and slapping him again what right did he have to make those deaths a weight on his conscience it was an indulgence he didnt deserve she was pleased by what skylene said in reply you akarans dwell on past failures too much im beginning to think thats what made your line so tyrannical guilt and hiding it yes dariel said no indication in his voice that he took offense mor imagined him grinning as he propped a leg up on a stool but enough of me talking you give me something now you said you would this was met with a moment of silence then skylene cleared her throat mor imagined the tight face she was making the way she would dip her head and sweep her left hand from her forehead up lightly across her plumage what do you want to know she asked everything thats a bit too much to tell at one sitting tell me about the auldek then and she did mor pressed her ear even closer to the gap for skylene began speaking softly good she thought yes do give the akaran truth let it be a punishment to that weak side of him that embraces guilt skylene spoke with her usual conciseness laying out the details in a dispassionate manner that mor herself could not have pulled off it was hard to know truth from myth but some among the divine children had been entrusted with keeping the auldeks oral history they passed on what they had learned to the people the clans of ushen brae had once been much more numerous theirs had been a warrior culture rooted for millennia in intertribal strife a culture in which men lived to die in battle risking everything to earn a place in the warrior halls of the afterworld they worshipped a god of war bahine and a pantheon of lesser animal deities warriors all if they had stayed such skylene said there would never have been a quota trade but things did not stay that way though the tribes were rich in fertile land and resources the constant warring made for feast or famine triumph or destruction they might have been strong with swords and axes when the lothan aklun arrived they thought them hounds fighting over scraps arrived dariel interrupted from where skylene admitted that she did not know but they came and soon after the league did as well it was so long ago that the truth is hard to know for certain but some believe that the lothan aklun and the league were in partnership right from the start as if the lothan aklun discovered ushen brae saw the potential for trade and called on the league to sail the seas for them the thing is dariel skylene said the lothan aklun did not want to trade in ore or spices or oils even the mist was important only because the known world wanted it so for some reason they wanted to base their trade of slaves on quota on souls they created the soul catcher its not a thing not a device or tool exactly its the place where the life force is taken from one and given to another we dont know how it works or why there are words written on the floor they say perhaps the spells are written there or perhaps in some way it focuses the lothan akluns power with it they can take the life force from one body and place it into another on reserve for when its needed this is the reason why devoth didnt die when that arrow burst his heart he has many lives within his skin killing one is anguish but goes away dariel said this is making my head spin for weeks you tell me nothing now suddenly yes well your respite is over dont faint on me just yet though the result of all this is the ushen brae of today the lothan aklun traded mist for quota children and they took them and sold them to the auldek who paid great sums for them the auldek in turn used the slaves to run their world to build their grand cities and produce a greater flow of wealth than they and the lothan aklun could ever have produced themselves see how it all works not really i mean i do but what kind of men would think up such a system and you thought your people were devious mor thought youre children by comparison everybody in it is exploited dariel continued except the lothan aklun themselves ah yes skylene cut in and now with them dead we have a host of new problems to face perhaps you should have a drink of water i have a few more things to say that may make you dizzy c hapter t hirtyseven make her fly higher aaden called as high as she can go his friend devlyn added i dont make her mena said i just ask she chooses on her own i know but she should go higher if i were her id go up and up and up i wonder how high she could go as high as she wants aaden as high as she wants mena smiled watching her nephews upturned enraptured face his mouth hung open with the unanswered question for a moment mena was tempted to snatch up one of the grapes left over from their lunch and drop it on his tongue instead she formed the image of rising in her mind and wished it toward the creature the aunt nephew and his friend sat on a quilted blanket that had been laid out on the short grass of the carmelia the massive stadium named in honor of the seventh akaran kings wife around them the flat field stretched out in all directions running right up to the walls that hemmed the exhibition grounds beyond that terraced levels of bleachers rose up enough contoured benches to hold thousands of spectators they were empty at the moment though save a few cleaners working their slow way down the aisle these mena barely noticed the four numrek guards who stood on watch were more conspicuous spaced throughout the bleachers in an approximate square around aaden their special charge above them elya soared through the air she of course was what so captured the boys attention seemingly in answer to aadens request and menas thought she steadied her wings and tilted into a slow circular flight lifted higher on thermals of warm air youll get a stitch in your neck if you keep looking up like that mena said winking at one of the three servants that stood attending them the young woman smiled back aaden showed no sign of having heard her eventually elya was but a speck in the sky shes going to disappear devlyn said he was a handsome boy slightly taller than aaden dark haired but with features that did not clearly mark his ethnicity she wont will she aaden asked his enthusiasm exchanged for concern and then as if something had just occurred to him tell her to come down now but you just told me to send her up shes barely gotten started mena joked with them for a time playing with their growing anxiety when both boys began to look truly troubled she set an arm on aadens shoulder and did as he requested she was no surer now how the communication between her and the creature worked than she had been at first there were no rules to it no way to explain or quantify it she simply thought to elya and elya responded it was not words mena used but visual images as now she saw the world from high above and imagined plum meting down the contours beneath her taking shape the outline of acacia amid the shimmering cobalt sea the terraced palace and the lower town and the spit of land upon which the carmelia lay three people waiting on a square of woven fabric she imagined all this and knew that elya would both think it and understand what mena meant by it that was just how it seemed to work with images and also with emotions elya could pick up menas frame of mind readily sometimes mena realized what she was feeling only because of something elya did in response to it when mena grew pensive thinking about corinn or concerned about dariel on his mission far away elya might make faces at her invite her to fly or simply draw near and let joy radiate between like heat from her body at other times elya knew when to withdraw when mena and melio were intimate for example elya acted as silly as any maid making a show of embarrassment for having caught them entwined in the bedsheets she backed away with her head low stepping lightly on the balls of her feet had her skin not been hidden beneath her soft plumage mena reckoned she would have seen her blush yes between them there was no other word for it than what she had shouted to melio back in talay love elya had brought a new level of love into the palace much needed as the avian and reptilian and wholly unique winged being plummeted down the last few hundred feet in a headlong dive mena greeted her with thoughts of affection of admiration for her beauty and thanks for the many ways she kept aaden enthralled elya fell toward them with her wings close to her body her head stretched forward and tail straight as an arrow behind her only when aaden and devlyn raised their arms in alarm and the three servants dove for the ground did elya snap her wings out the effect was immediate the membranes of her wings billowed back stretched taut and filled with air her wings caught hold of the air so completely that all of that incredible speed vanished she hung above them for a few seconds and then retracted her wings that rapid clicking as they curled and shrank to nothing but small protrusions on her back the air within them escaped and she touched down lightly on the grass aaden rushed toward her he threw his arms around her neck and pressed his face against her plumage for a time the boy was lost in speaking with her a tumbling stream of words that mena could not follow elya though cocked her head blinked her eyes and wrinkled her nose as if she understood everything the boy was saying and found it all most engaging its too bad grae isnt here aaden said wrenching himself away for a moment he would love this if he was would you let him fly with elya remember what i said i dont command her she could let him ride if she chose but i think she is very choosy as is your mother she almost added she leaned toward him and nipped his nose between her fingers you should feel honored youre special and not just because youre the prince that means nothing to her and she likes you for whats truly inside you the boy took this praise as he took all praise as if it were his due and as if it were as light as the words themselves he climbed upon elya and called for a servant to fetch his bow and blunted arrows with his quiver slung over his back and the ash weapon in hand he urged elya into something faster than a walk the creature was careful with him mena could tell by the awkward way she moved taking care to keep him steady on her back even though it required extra contortions of her limbs devlyn knew better than to ask to ride himself he fetched his own bow and made a show of circling an instant hunting party aaden shouted for mena to join them but she declined she was content to sit on the blanket and watch them to smell the salttinged air and hear the rhythmic concussion of the waves on the base of the seaside wall of the stadium small ruminants about the size of dogs and looking much like lanky potbellied hares munched on the grass a little distance away they had been brought in after corinn chose to seed the field several years ago they kept the grass trim and their droppings made for a pleasantly fragrant fertilizer at first sighting elya they had fled in awkward loping fright now they hardly took notice of her at all at aadens urging elya pressed her body low to the ground intent as a carnivore stalking the grazing animals were no more afraid than hens are with a toddler in their midst they did not love being shot with the blunted arrows though and devlyn seemed particularly good at stinging their backsides how strange to think that just a few weeks ago elya was not even a part of her life that seemed impossible now she was family even corinn saw it and like family elya had affection for the boy that went beyond his personal traits perhaps she smelled the bond between him and mena and offered herself to him because of it or maybe he was special mena warmed to the thought maybe he was surely he managed to balance both his childish nature and a calm acceptance of his heredity and the role it meant lay before him she tried to imagine aliver having been that at ease but he never had been what she wondered did this contrast between them mean what might the reign of king aaden amount to motion on the stairs caught her eye two more numrek had arrived they emerged from one of the tunnel mouths at a brisk pace stopped and scanned the field and then the bleachers seeing the other guards one headed toward the chief of the guard detail and the other walked to the other nearest numrek mena watched them speak for a moment and then she looked at aaden and elya who were at the far edge of the stadium now there was another reason for her good mood a secret she and elya shared three days earlier in the private courtyard that had become elyas domain the creature had shown mena a clutch of four eggs they nestled within a blanket tucked in a basin that caught the rays of the afternoon sun and preserved the warmth in the stone they were like no eggs mena had ever seen beforeas large as dinner plates tapered from one thicker side down to the other only faintly oblong and colored by pale orange swirls against a creamy backgroundbut there was no mistaking them nor could she doubt the nervous hovering concern in elyas demeanor mena looked up from the eggs with moisture gathering on the rims of her eyelids to find the creature standing behind her waiting in the look was a mixture of so many questions it was hopeful proud frightened seeking approval but also defiant ready to react should anger need to be a part of her response in her eyes were the hopes of a mother faced with the enormity of what it meant to create life how elya could have been pregnant or how the eggs could be fertile mena could not explain but she did not want to she just welcomed it or perhaps mena saw the things she imagined she would have felt faced with evidence of her own unborn children either way she formed thoughts of warmth and pride and comfort and joy in her mind and floated them toward elya even now she still felt the pulsing intimacy of the moment she knew that the first thing she would do back in her quarters would be to return to the eggs and whisper kind things to them she had said nothing about it to corinn or aaden or anybody else except the four maids who lived and worked in her private quarters them she could keep nothing from but they were loyal to her and just as smitten with elya they would do nothing to endanger her which is how mena had explained the need for secrecy people are quick to fear she had said speaking to the four young women as they huddled around the nest the evening she learned of the eggs even my sister might think nightmares will be born of these eggs foulthings but we who know elya best know that there is nothing but goodness in her she had waited for eye contact with each of the women before continuing these babies will be beauties they will be blessings on the empire if only we are brave enough to see them born into safety they had agreed as she knew they would even so the eggs made her think even more about journeying to vumu perhaps she should take the eggs elya and melio to the archipelago she could raise elyas offspring there in greater seclusion melio would go with her of course he would especially when she told him she was ready and willing to grow his child within her she and elya would be mothers together and then what perhaps she could start the other project she had been thinking of recently an academy of the martial arts it would not be the same as the marah training she would make it something else less about killing and more about honing the body and the mind and finding peace through mastery of skills she would have to achieve this herself first but she increasingly felt she might be able to now that the wars were over and the foulthings no more princess one of the servants asked will prince aaden be eating anything else or needing anything more from us mena said no i dont think so you may go back to the palace well be along soon as well she used the impetus of the exchange to rise and stretch her legs the newly arrived numrek and the chief guard left their post and proceeded toward the other group of two with their long strides likely corinn was checking up on them mena thought she did that often even within the royal confines and other protected areas mena began to walk toward her nephew and elya im sorry to keep secrets from you mena thought but youll see youll thank me later and we really will find ways to be better to do something with this rule of ours not that she thought it all through in reasoned terms but mena half believed that elya could warm corinns heart by the giver she needed that something had to melt that icy barrier she maintained between herself and the world mena had thought grae could do it but corinn had rebuffed him and sent him away without explanation afraid mena thought shes still afraid to love it did not make much sense but she could not help feeling that elya with time would change that aaden had dismounted his stalking game seemingly forgotten it looked from a distance that the two boys were performing an armwaving drama with an audience of one rapt creature without deciding to mena knew that sooner or later she would mention the eggs to aadena slip of the tongue perhaps an inadvertent hint dropped in such a way that he inquisitive as he was would not let it go unchallenged it would happen and she would shrug and they would keep the secret for a time eventually corinn would find out as well she would purse her lips and ask sharp questions and fume about the dangers and then well then it would be fine how wonderful it would be to have smaller versions of her flying above the island what tales the people would tell then a new age dawning new creatures to announce it mena was still some distance away from the trio glancing back she saw that two of the numrek had climbed onto the field and were following her a tingling of unease climbed up her spine she never liked having people at her back especially not armed ones that was nothing unusual she brushed her fingers along the belt that snugged her tunic at the waist just a strip of leather no weapon on it that realization was another unnerving jolt but just as quickly she brushed it away of course she was unarmed she had made a point of putting down her sword when she returned to acacia it had been hard to do but important because of that who wanted to live with a sword always in hand like another limb not she she quickened her pace briefly skipping ahead in a manner meant to keep her mirthful mood physically alive elyaapparently at a signal from the princeleaped into the air her wings rolled out and beat hard enough to keep her aloft a moment aaden lifted his bow nocked an arrow and drew for a moment it looked as if he planned to shoot her but then he snapped around and loosed the arrow toward the sea elya snapped her wings down hard and bolted after it a game of fetch then watching them mena dropped back into a walk again she approached the boys from one side as four numrek came down the stairs and approached them from the other side and as two others closed the gap behind her the guard in the front beckoned aaden toward him with a hand prince he said his acacian thickly accented your mother wishes for you to come to her please come i will escort you he kept moving forward as he spoke the others close behind him wait mena called but she was not sure why the word shot from her mouth she was only twenty or so strides away she had only to hurry forward and she could leave with them something was wrong the guard had just done something numrek never did her hand automatically went to where her sword hilt would have been there was still no real reason to feel threatened by the princes guards and yet threatened was exactly what she did feel she asked what are you doing i will take them draw back and please princess the queen wants me to that was as much as she heard two things happened at the same time she realized it was that please that had sent her pulse racing numrek never were polite like that even when serving the queen then a shout turned all their heads looking up into the heights of the stadium a figure she recognized as melio dashed up from one of the tunnels armed and followed by a river of marah their swords unsheathed they ran along the landing and hit the stairs at a tumbling run leaping four and five at a time mena grabbed for her sword again and again clutched only the air she looked back at her nephew who was standing beside devlyn perplexed his hands on his hips as if in grownup disapproval of the marahs strange urgency mena cried aaden he turned his head the chief numrek turned back to the prince he stepped toward him grim faced but unhurried a dagger slithering from his sleeve and into his hand the motion was so muted so in line with the matteroffact manner that the numrek usually kept up around the prince that mena did not believe what her eyes told her casually the numrek reached down and drove the blade into aadens belly he twisted it studying the boys face as he did and then yanked the blade out and jabbed it into devlyns abdomen the numrek twisted the blade then ripped it down devlyns intestines tumbled onto the grass the boy collapsing at almost the same instant mena had started to run forward the moment she saw aaden stabbed her strides ate up the remaining distance so that when she vaulted over aaden and toward the numrek she was in full sprint the numrek surprised and still stooped forward with his dagger blade spilling devlyns insides snapped his eyes up the muscles in his back and shoulders and arms tensed and had mena been any slower he would have caught her with an upswing of the dagger but such abrupt complete maeben fury drove her actions that she was a blur of deliberate motion as she flew forward she kicked her legs out to one side she caught the numreks head to her chest clamped her talons around it and held tight as the momentum in her legs swung her around horizontal to the ground she felt two moments of resistance first the muscle of the numreks late reaction and then the catch as the vertebrae in his neck reached the limit to which they could turn they snapped his body was so heavy legs planted so firmly that mena swung all the way around with the now dead head clutched to her chest she let go and landed on her feet she caught the dagger that was just then falling from the numreks suddenly limp grip with her left arm she shoved him in the chest needing to use all her force to make sure his body with the wobbling head still attached fell backward away from aaden who was now a knot on the ground unconscious the others were upon her now two with swords drawn another swinging an ax before him intent on killing her quickly mena moved faster than thought she ducked beneath the hissing arc of the ax that was swept around by the first of them to reach her she stooped under him and sliced the tendons at the back of his knee the man fell roaring to one side knocking one of his companions down and entangling another in his writhing agony the few seconds this allowed was enough for her to scoop aaden up with one arm half dragging half carrying him as she scrambled backward he was warm and slick with blood heavy and so very fragile at the same time he said something a moan or single word or a hope that mena could not make out but that was all the two numrek shoved the wounded man away and came at her their massive strides eating up the distance quicker than she fed it out the one approaching from nearest the oncoming marah said something to the others but they stayed fixed on her mena changed the direction of her retreat to keep him in view as well she did not look but in the periphery of her vision she registered that melio and the others were about to reach the field level near but not near enough she feared she would have to put the boy down again to fight but then something behind her caused the numrek to slow they hesitated weapons raised defensively their eyes widened one of them pointed as if the others might not be seeing what he saw then mena understood and she knew what to do she dropped one shoulder and twisted her body around throwing all her weight behind the other shoulder which came up and around lifting aaden off the ground she swung him in the crook of her arm which she snapped taut at the exact moment to hurl him into the air it was an awkward move her force not entirely controlled the boy somersaulted in the air only then did mena see elya she had landed at a run and was closing the last few strides with her head low to the ground she moved with a frightening reptilian rapidity all sinewy snapping and writhing her feather plumes erect and trembling her mouth open in a rasping hiss her head stretched out neck reached to receive the tumbling boy he slid down her length and his torso smacked against her back cradled between the nubs mena used as a saddle and then elya leaped over mena wings snapping out and smashing down shooting her and the prince up into the waiting sky c hapter t hirtyeight this place is eating itself skylene said thats whats wrong with the auldek they thought they had bargained for a blessing instead they got an everlasting curse they live on bodies the same souls more and more twisted thats the curse of the soul catcher she poured water from a small stone pitcher into two beakers of the same marbled material one she pushed across the table to dariel the other she held up for tunnel who shook his head she sipped from it herself think of it on one hand you live on year after year you die every now and then only to rise again wonderful yes dariel rolled the stone beaker between his palms enjoying the smooth texture of it the coolness against his skin his wrists had been unbound only a few days before he was still relearning mobility a short length of chain still hobbled his legs and chafed his ankles but he was making progress earning their trust that was what this sudden discourse was about wasnt it something had changed he could hear it in skylenes voice and see a hint of something tickling the edges of tunnels bizarre features he said i dont think that immortality is so great a gift not if it keeps you forever separated from loved ones who have died before you true and what if you can never have children you cannot see yourself in generations that will continue after you for some this doesnt matter for others it drives them crazy is that why they started todariel hesitated glancing between the two of them one looking like a bird woman the other like some musclesculpted boar manmake these changes to you thats not what i mean skylene said what they do to us we call belonging they did it as a way to maintain a connection with the animal deities so that they did not give them up entirely it is painful at times but pain passes we grow used to the changes sometimes proud of them how is it even possible skylene smiled tattoos are tattoos we do much of that ourselves there were some chosen by the auldek to make other changes to but anything truly difficult was done by the lothan aklun tunnels tusks they are metal but they are also part of him fused right into the bones of his skull the lothan aklun canor coulddo many strange things no what i referred to were greater corruptions there have been two clans punished for unpardonable perversions the first the whiteeyed snake clan is called the fumel their crime guess it dariel stared at her his face blank he had no idea and it seemed a waste of time to even try to guess the fumel broke the first restriction they started to raise the humans as their own children they pretended they were their own blood some among them tried to make their slaves look like fumel imagine that they had these slaves in fumel guise subjugate the other slaves when the other auldek heard of it they punished the fumel demanding that they turn over all the altered children to be exterminated they would not the other clans united to attack them but the fumel fought by the time it was over too few of them were left and upon those the crimes done against the other clans were too great the fumel were wiped out if you journey to the south to what used to be their lands you may someday see the bleeding road its where the fumel corpses still adorn the stakes they were impaled upon they once had a city built on a hill surrounded by a network of shallow canals when the other clans were done there the hill was a hole in the earth filled with water the bleeding road leads for miles across their lands and ends at that lake its symbolic you see i imagine so dariel thought it sounded like the kind of punishment tinhadin might have meted out that was three hundred years ago since then auldek have not killed one another there was another clan more recently that did another forbidden thing she paused she glanced at tunnel then at the silent scribe who sat listening what did they do dariel asked as if she needed the prompting skylene sighed and said they ate them it may have been a madness that took hold of them it may have been because they believed it was the easiest way to acquire their souls it may have been as some argue that they believed by eating young flesh they would become fertile again they may have done other things as well we dont know all of it we know that it was disgusting the other auldek took all this clans slaves and put them to death the slaves there is no prohibition on killing the people just on eating them or adopting them this time the auldek didnt kill the clan as well after the fumel they vowed they would not do that again their liveseven if they were tainted by crimeswere too valuable to waste now that there were so few auldek left instead the clan was banished sent from ushen brae and cursed never to return the numrek dariel whispered exactly right skylene said your traveling companions the other auldek killed the souls within them so that they had but their one mortal life and then drove them into the north during that time they were not heard from exile meant death in all likelihood but not as a certainty that distinction was enough for the auldek to accept it as just punishment the numrek ate people in the known world too he said mostly when they had just arrived but at other times as well corinn forbade it when she took them into her service ive not heard that they ate human flesh since then they would not skylene said not if they had their sights set on returning to ushen brae dariels head swam with questions what does it mean that theyve come back its all with a purpose a purpose yes skylene hooked her foot around a stool and pulled it out from under the table she sat and leaned forward her elbows on her knees not for the first time dariel noticed how slimly athletic she was feminine but in a way that had a coiled physical danger to it she said think about whats happened the auldek didnt punish them when they returned by their own decree they should cut off calrachs head and set it beside that leaguemans they didnt and they havent banished them again to put it plainly theyve been talking with them your friend calrach returned with an offer they have been discussing it ever since they havent been this excited for centuries what offer that i dont have permission to tell you youll tell me half a thing skylene smiled when does anybody tell all of a thing ive told you what i can her words had finality but her postureleaning toward him knees apart face close to hissent different signals he wasnt sure how to read them ask me something else she said heat rushed across dariels cheeks he very much wished that tunnel and the scribe werent in the room he felt a sudden urge to reach across and touch her skyblue skin it was not an entirely new desire alone so often his thoughts of wren had grown increasingly blurred intermingled with skylenes sharp avian features and mors feline grace more than once he had woken from dreams of coupling in ways he had never imagined in life but such thoughts had no place here he pushed them away why dont you revolt dariel asked the people with their skills and their numbers they could slaughter the auldek skylene mulled the question over something that was both a smile and an expression of grief residing on her features the league the lothan aklun and the auldek have had hundreds of years to perfect their institutions they know our minds when we first arrived the lothan aklun kept us on an isle called lithram len they tested us there asked us things watched us and for a time they let us struggle among ourselves they observed who shared who fought who showed compassion and who was cold inside calculating greedy savage they learned our individual weaknesses and strengths though they saw both as traits to be exploited eventually they sent us to the role that suited each best the meek went to their work the savage to theirs the devious to theirs those with the most rebellion in them become spirit children the ones who get eaten skylene nodded but still you all know where you came from youre more the same than different obviously you havent forgotten dariel our lives here have many faces she placed one of her fineboned hands on his knee her fingers light there are many who work in the fields to harvest mist the generous seeds they are called they labor they dont know theyre laboring because the oil from the leaves of the plants numbs their minds they walk dazed seeing a world different from ours theyre only in this world enough to be sent to work to follow instructions dariel asked mist comes from a plant harvested in a field yes the very thing that helps buy the children from your land is worked by slaves in this one that is the system the lothan aklun and the auldek set up it perpetuates itself while they live mostly at ease she let this sit with him a moment but not everyone is drugged like that we cant all be there are many who work the myriad tasks that sustain the auldek every job imaginable is done somewhere by the people but not necessarily by free people some hate us ones called the golden eyes handle commerce they trade and live lives of some plenty though they are not free others like the divine children kill they are warriors almost to match the auldek they thrive in palaces with slaves of their own they live like nobles until the moment the auldek call for them to fight and then they do that with joy as well some even forget that they are not free forget that their individual desires could be any different from the orders given to them that lvin you saw in the arena a few days backhe was chosen because the lothan aklun knew what he might become i dont know how but they see things in us that we dont see ourselves the lvin in the arena dariel wished he had dreamed that as well it had been the only time since his captivity began that he had seen the light of day tunnel who had watch duty over him that day explained that he had something he wished to show him dariel had followed him through the passageways stumbling on legs stiff from disuse tunnel had taken off his ankle chains for the walk hobbling along behind the man it was obvious to both of them that dariel was no flight risk they met several other slaves in a cramped bend in a corridor a few dariel recognized a few he did not together they crowded around slots in the wall that looked out upon some sort of exhibition ground dariels view was partly cut off by beams but it was enough he soon understoodby the sights of carnage he witnessed and by the roars of adulation and by the tremors driven down into the stone around himthat he was somewhere within the foundations of a massive structure a stadium of some sort on the field below him a mass of warriors butchered one another with a speed and furious precision dariel had never witnessed before the figureslightly armored or not armored at allwere clearly human at least they were the humananimal merging that he knew marked the people tattooed in the various totem patterns adorned with tusks or feathered plumes or what looked like scaly protrusions enhancing their backbones they fought in clan groups each group standing against all the rest they leaped and spun slashed and ducked and kicked and even snapped out somersaults it could have been some mad frenzied acrobatics exhibition except that they worked with weapons swords and axes long spears and jointed staffs that whirled about at bonebreaking velocity death blows were announced by gouts of blood limbs wheeled through the air heads were sliced from shoulders and kicked beneath the churning legs the battle was shortlived by the time dariel understood that one band of warriorsmarked by white tattoos and dangling hair lockshad gained the advantage the fighting was all but over the soldiers of the prevailing group relaxed straightened and let the blood and bits of tissue drip from their bodies there were several opponents left before them survivors from among the other clan groups the chanting in the crowd and the thrum of what must have been thousands of feet on the stone indicated that the action was not concluded yet still it was a moment before one of the winning band stepped out before the others the lone warrior was massive a man muscled like tunnel but as tall as a numrek he carried widebladed axes in both hands his skin was white from midway up his torso over his shoulders and arms and face as grand as any lions his mane framed his head with a bulk of knotted hair and swaying locks nearly white but with a slightly gold tint dariel would have stared at him for a long time but he was still only long enough for his remaining opponents to line up across from him once they did he stepped toward them you see him the chief warrior among the lvin dariel whispered yeah i see him how could i not see him tunnel said good good that you see he is sublime motion the most honored class of divine children as if to demonstrate the definition of this the lvin chief unleashed a longlimbed choreography of slaughter that had touched each of the four opponents before the first one had even dropped to the ground falling from the height of his severed legs it was like a single movement that they did not even try to fight the last dariel saw of the lvin was when he threw his arms out and yanked back his head mouth open he might have roared surely he roared but if so it was drowned out by the booming applause of the unseen crowd saw dariel said correcting skylenes last statement the lothan aklun saw your traits they dont see anything anymore skylene brushed this aside that lvinmenteus nemre is his namelives in a palace with his own slaves his own women whatever he wants he has all of that as long as he fights when the auldek tell him to you see were not so different here from your people over there one manone child evenwill sell out another just so quick she snapped her fingers considering all these things the fact that the people have survived so long in defiance is a wonder whom do you mean when you say the people those in rebellion or all the slaves both it depends on the context in which its used we fight for all the quota slaves even those who harm us and especially those too numb and beaten down to understand their plight privileged or shackled it doesnt matter we are all the people and none of us are free divine children is an auldek title when we are free we will put that name away and just be people instead but you see prince of the akarans the people cant gather an acacian army by issuing a summons the auldek are not easily killed you saw devoth take that arrow through his heart he pulled it out and chopped off the leaguemans head they could have shot him full of arrows he would have risen again and again youve never seen the auldek fight ive seen numrek skylene conceded that was something by cocking her head then righting it the numrek were always lesser fighters among the auldek some say acknowledgment of that is what drove them to their crime in the first place but with the lothan aklun gone dariel said the auldek cant steal more souls they have only so many lives right so if they are attacked theyll be weakened they could be beaten eventually those slaying those spirit souls would suffer would you volunteer to die so that the twentieth warrior behind you might finally slay the auldek you died killing she let the question sit just long enough for dariel to think he would have to answer it and then she went on and even that is only assuming the soul catcher will not be used again its out there you know still on lithram len you think its a thing a thing to be used it is a tool of their sorcery i do not say it would be easy for anyone to master it but neither can i say its impossible who would use it would the auldek they know where it is the lothan aklun made them travel to the island to get their souls its a short trip but it was punishment of sorts since the auldek hate to be at sea just like the numrek dariel said why is that they are fearless about so many things why this terror of water because a different voice said they all started surprised as the wooden door swung open and mor swept in suddenly changing the atmosphere crowding the room with her presence because the auldek no matter how strong cannot swim theyve tried but the same density of muscle and bone that makes them warriors also makes them dead weight in the water they sink she folded her arms and stood defiant as if expecting to be refuted dariel was not about to ah all right thats why they never voyage across the gray slopes themselves skylene added and its why the auldek were so shocked that the numrek did it could only mean they had something important to tell them the last words came out hesitantly her eyes on mor the entire time youve said that before dariel said he let the statement hang inflected at the end like a question one obviously meant for mor she did not answer it but she did say here is something we havent told you its not just the auldek who cannot bear young the same is true of the people we live and die but we do not continue ourselves thats another curse you akarans arranged for us mors eyes cut toward skylene but then snapped back youve learned enough for just now i have a task for you accomplish it and we will hold nothing back from you dariel was still facing the enormity of the revelation mor had just made it explained so much and seemed awful in a way that he could not take in all at once he wanted to it felt important to do so but mor had asked him a question she likely thought he was hesitating because he was considering the answer in truth he did not need to consider it at all he had been waiting listening hiding long enough dariel said tell me c hapter t hirtynine corinn had never run so fast in her life she had never felt more frustrated and frantic filled with an awful urgency that made her want to burst out of her skin and fly she held the skirt of her gown in both hands pulled high so that her legs were free to move marah crowded her on all sides they would have preferred to have held still in a defensive circle around her a human wall with halberds and swords jutting out like the spines of a porcupine it took all the queens effort to keep them in motion she propelled them against their will by shoving them forward and spewing curses and threats at them aaden was in danger aaden might be dead she had stepped out of the secret room into an office strewn with bodies blood and organsboth human and numrek though sire dagon begged her not to go she strode away she had to find aaden hopeful one second near tears the next boiling with whitehot anger just after when interrupted by scenes of violence people confused stunned getting in her way she hated when they got in her way standing about stupidfaced gaping nobles or peasants old or young it did not matter they worked their jaws in meaningless chatter she had never hated them more several times she roared at them and each time they peeled away before her like sheep before a wolf terrified if they prevented her from reaching aaden in time she would kill them coming off a ramp and up a short flight of steps she trod on the hem of her gown and fell against the men in front of her arms pulled her back up hands touched her with an intimacy that would have doomed the owner of them an hour ago one guard whispered respectfully that perhaps they should turn back get her to safety in the upper palace his voice trembled and she recognized him as one of her marah alive after the battle with her numrek guards in her offices well keep you safe there your majesty until in answer she reached for his waist and pulled free the slim dagger sheathed there are you a coward she asked judging by the way the mans face froze he must have thought she was about to slit his throat she let him think so for a second and then sawed at the skirts of her gown the razorsharp blade ribboned the light layers of fabric she tore it all free by the fistful she moved so viciously that she cut the flesh of her thigh she did not notice until a few seconds afterward when the warmth of her blood filled the gash and overflowed by the time she reached the tunnel that led into the carmelia dashed through it and came out in the open air midway up the stadiums ranks she was as sweaty bloodstained and panting as if she had been at the butchery of battle herself she froze as the view rose up before her her eyes searching for her son even as she saw mena and melio and clusters of marah soldiers all fighting a few numrek there were many dead marah already and three of the numrek lay as broken corpses on the field the remaining three were bellowing whirlwinds their curved swords scorched the air around them long hair flying as they wrenched their heads around from one foe to another where was aaden she didnt see aaden he had to be here he had to beand then she spotted a childs small form lying facedown on the grass her breath left her in one long ahhh he was so tiny like a doll oh aaden as she said his name in her head she knew it was not right the name did not fit the body it was not aaden the figure was a little longer of limb than aaden dark haired while aaden was fair it was devlyn she shouted find the prince find him now the command came from something tapped into the urgency of life something far greater than she as the guards dashed down the stairs and ran to either side calling for the prince searching for him among the rows of seats corinn turned her gaze to the ongoing battle her sister was there tiny beside the numrek she facedgreduc who had so often walked behind her greduc who had once held his arm out aaden dangling from it standing as tall and still as a tree grinning as the boys legs kicked in the air corinn pressed her palm to her chest realizing she was frightened now from all the moments greduc had had her and aaden in his power at any time he could have killed them both i am a fool she thought two marah worked with mena making a triangle around greduc but he always turned to keep the princess before him mena held a curved numrek sword in a twohanded grip mena never knew her limits corinn thought and then was appalled what a vile thought tainted as it was by an adolescent desire to see her sister punished for the arrogance she had to get control of her thoughts defeat him mena kill him my sister make him die and die and die mena yelled something at greduc that corinn could not hear the numrek responded and whatever he said caused mena to hesitate her sword drooped slightly one of her hands rose sketching her confusion with a motion of her upturned palm the numrek jerked his chin upward and spat that ended the intermission the attackers drew closer to the numrek who roared into motion battling the marah but always driving toward mena she somehow managed to parry duck slip to the side she stumbled then righted herself and swung the heavy blade around nearly taking off greducs headexcept that he managed to block and stepping back twirled into a surprise attack that caught the marah behind him and took his arm off at the shoulder corinn pitched forward and vomited strong hands grasped her steadying her what was wrong with her her mind was so scattered cluttered random aaden where was aaden she scanned the bleachers her guards were racing through them bending to check under seats dashing along other rows they were looking but she knew that if he was in the stadium she would feel him perhaps mena had hidden him yes that was it hidden him someplace safe corinn stepped forward thinking she would descend toward the chaos and no your majesty a voice behind her said delivegu strode the last few steps to reach her behind him several more marah all of whom rushed past her to join the fight rhrenna followed them as well carrying her dagger you shouldnt even be this close delivegu said if one of them sees you he may charge come draw back with me so that you cant be seen i cannot find aaden corinn said he was here delivegu set his hand on her shoulder and scanned the stadium his face grave he looked at corinn took her other shoulder in hand well find him hes not here exactly she thought hes not here now that seemed a good thing aaden was somewhere else which had to be better than being here hes probably safe exactly corinn echoed hes probably safe rhrenna stood beside her now the palace is secure she said balneaves sharratt is checking the records to determine how many numrek were on the island theres fighting still in the lower town as some of them were trying to flee the island they wont get off and general andeson is already committed to sail for the teh coast to blockade the good delivegu said good he was not responding to rhrenna corinn followed his eyes back to the field one of the numrek had fallen the marah who had killed him worried his back with jab after jab of their swords and then ran to aid the others corinn remained aware that one of delivegus hands still rested on her shoulder she reached out and found rhrennas hand and clasped it together they watched the tide of the fighting turn the next to die got caught dealing with too many foes melio hacked him in the side with a twohanded diagonal swing his blade bit into the numreks side cut him to the spine and then stuck fast like an ax driven too deep into a tree trunk the numrek fell onto his knees yanking the sword from melios grip two marah swept in the first with a downward strike that sliced off a portion of the numreks face the second leaped into a twirling attack that first cut through the arm the numrek raised to block it and then sliced halfway through the side of his skull now only one remained as the rest of the marah circled him their weapons before them he seemed to come to terms with the situation he let his sword droop a moment turning slowly to take them all in it looked like he might be surrendering but then he roared and ran toward mena his sword raised high in a twohanded grip he looked undefeatable unstoppable the marah closed on him with their own furious intent slicing and stabbing then making sure the fallen numrek would not rise again corinn lost sight of mena and did not spot her again until the soldiers began to stumble away from the body some fell to their knees a few sprawled on the grass still others dropped their swords and moved among the injured aiding them it was over corinn saw mena standing a surprising distance away panting her arms limp at her sides and her body curved with fatigue she had dropped the numrek sword and stooped before it as if unsure of what it was she looked like she might fall to her knees at any moment instead she glanced up and met corinns eyes she stepped forward unsteadily she stumbled from the field and mounted the steps toward corinn she seemed to regain some of her abnormal stamina as she climbed corinn shouted her question where is aaden when mena reached corinn she grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her into motion come she said elya has him elya has him of all the things she feared or hoped to hear this caught her completely off guard the lizard has him you look a mess sister mena added rhrenna tell me what has happened the meinish woman began recounting the details she had begun to give corinn a few minutes earlier mena peppered her with questions she answered delivegu and several marah followed as well silent for the time being listening to the two women talk helped corinn through the moments of waiting as they retraced their path back to the palace she tried to concentrate on their voices that talked through the crisis like veterans of such things corinn knew she should join them but she couldnt not until she knew they found elya and aaden in the central gardens of the queens palace arriving they had to push through the throng of nervous servants in the center within the open area of benches and chairs in the middle of the mosaic of the akaran family symbol lay aaden he was on his side one leg crossed over the other his arm cradling his belly asleep or dead corinn could not tell the lizard stood off a few paces it stood propped on its hind legs its forearms held together and its slim paws pressed one against the other corinn moved forward somehow more patient now that she actually saw her son the emotion that had driven her to the carmelia had drained out of her she just wanted to know that was all she just had to know and so she walked calmly across the tiles the hushed crowd watching her reaching her son she knelt and whispered his name she sat down and slid her hands under his head and shoulders and drew him onto her lap there was a strange tangy citrus scent on him that was pleasant to inhale but there was also blood on him yes soaking his clothes all around his midsection oh aaden she said drawing him still closer so much blood he was warm limp as he was she knew that he was yet alive leaning over him she felt breath pass through his lips faint oh but there he breathed but it was fading she heard mena call for the royal physicians and bark other orders reasonable things things she should be saying herself all she could do was hold aaden in her arms and feel grief and fear opening around her like the maw of the toothed worm that lives in the center of the earth she felt it rising hungry enraged the worm was death death it wanted to swallow aaden she had never known what death was but now she did it was a worm in the center of the earth a hungry beast of a thing that wanted her son but she would not give him her son why should i have to ive given so much already why can i not have this one thinga son to love why she realized she was talking to the beast inside her head but it did not care it began before her and would go on after her and never never would care for words like that if she held on to aaden the worm would swallow her as well gulp them both down into the fetid abyss that was its belly she and aaden mena and the servants the entire palace no the island acacia itself if she held on to her son and denied the worm its jaws would rise from the sea and clamp shut around them and drag everything into the deep unless unless she sang i have to sing thinking it she realized she had known it all along the worm was ancient and since she had first read from the song of elenet she had felt it stir she had not admitted it but she had felt it roll and flex beneath the earth it had welcomed her song it wanted it it fed on it why had she not understood this until now mena leaned over her saying something but corinn ignored her and everyone around her it did not even matter if they heard her nothing mattered except that she sing for aaden before the worm ate them all they knew nothing about it the fools corinn had done nothing useful the entire day but she would now with her lips brushing the soft flesh of aadens neck she opened her mouth and breathed out the song it came to her willingly those mysterious words and the notes they rode upon she did not form it she just released it aware that if she did it would heal the damage inside aaden and that would appease the worm it was a promise of some sort a deal she was making with things unknown she sang in the seas surrounding the isle of acacia corinn was certain that the jaws of the beast paused just below the surface halting the great swell of momentum that had driven it it paused because she sang it listened it heard and then the worm sang with her a great bass rumble that was beautiful and horrible to hear c hapter f orty leeka alain it really was the old general several days after encountering the man kelis still found himself reliving his surprise he watched him askance whenever he could relearning his sunbrowned features and trying to order the details of the mans life in a way that might explain his presence here in the arid expanse of southern talay here was the man who had commanded the northern guard in hanish meins time he was the first to face the numrek the first to kill one of those giants they had called him the rhino rider for he had descended the methalian rim into the mainland atop one of the numreks woolly beasts he had been too late with his news of the coming invaders though he fought hard and long on many fronts he had not been able to repell hanishs multipronged attack leeka had been lost to the world after that only to appear years later to rally alivers troops against maeander on the taneh plains of northern talay and then he had disappeared during the chaos unleashed by the santoth now it was nine years later and again the veteran general had rejoined the living he was no longer simply a hardbitten soldier he was something else now but just what that something was kelis could not say leeka did not look a day older than when kelis had last seen him yes at first his features had seemed to shift and reshape themselves but that had stopped after a few hours his face took on a normal solidity his jaw square mouth wide cheekbones high his eyes kelis remembered had been penetrating those of a commander of soldiers who dealt with the world with a hawklike sharpness now his eyes seemed to absorb the world as if he were hungry for everything he saw walk with me leeka had said and your questions will be answered that was all he had bidden them do benabe balked and naamen questioned and kelis felt the weight of that simple request like a stone in his gut he felt he had no control over their fate no leadership to offer except the authority to place them in the hands of forces he did not understand forces he had reason to fear shen though smiled and asked is it far leeka assured her that it wasnt although they should travel slowly and with patience and that was what they did they trudged farther south through a featureless landscape no motion upon it save the rippling dance of heat no living creatures save their group of five with leekas nod of assent they sat out the hottest hours of the day huddled beneath small geometries of shade cast by sheets draped over thin stakes they drove into the ground leeka himself stood at a slight distance hooded and so still that kelis sometimes felt the old general had slipped out of this world and left a scarecrow in his place the four sipped their water sparingly all of them aware of how little they had and how devoid of moisture the landscape was they could not even find the tubers or cacti that years of training had taught them existed in even the deepest desert kelis felt himself going dry from the inside out his flesh became a strange leather that shrank to wrap his muscles and tendons and thinning blood vessels he sometimes pretended to drink from the waterskin to spare the precious liquid for shen though they never said anything about it he suspected benabe and naamen were doing the same leeka never drank he did not sleep he never showed fatigue or seemed to feel the heat as the sun slanted westward each evening they rose and with a few terse words of encouragement from leeka began their trek again shen walked beside the hooded man often she was the only one who seemed at ease with him and also unaffected by fatigue or thirst by the way he inclined his head toward her and the way she tugged on his arm and looked up at him one would have thought they were conversingan uncle out with a favorite niece perhaps but as far as kelis could ascertain very few words passed between them on several occasions when they seemed in animated discourse he crept up behind them close enough to make out the intricate pattern of braids tight against shens skull close enough to hear the clicking of the beads fastened to the ends of them but that and the scuffing of their feet and their slow breathing of the always hot air and leeka swallowing were the only sounds he ever heard he is insane benabe said one evening and he is teaching my daughter the trick of it i do not like that man she had made this clear from the first sighting of the hooded man standing alone in a desert expanse during the passing days she had not tired of reminding kelis of her opinion several times she proposed that they break from leeka and turn north or toward the coast to the east they could return later she said with the help of others her lips were cracked her skin dusty her features gaunt she had to speak slowly between careful breaths but she was no less the fiery protective mother you think a man who stands in the desert by himself is sane she asked you think he should lead us anywhere hes lost and were following him whats that make us ill tell youbigger fools shen says that shen is a child she may be something more as well but she is a young girl first she dreams she trembles and hears voices before you said that i know what i said but what did i know sitting in a mansion in bocoum she shook the thought of it away she was silent a moment and then said i want to say that i will die if he harms her but when people say that they dont really mean it but i am simply stating the truth i will die she jabbed him with an elbow you will too ill see to it before i go though not as constant as benabe it was obvious naamen too had his doubts he approached kelis after she drifted away he walked silently beside him for some time and then said after today we will have no water i know kelis said so you also know that we are walking dead benabe is right we should not have come do not let a coward wear your skin kelis answered all the more harshly because he was wrestling with the same thoughts when you are called to a quest you go you trust we must trust leeka in an answer of sorts naamen had exhaled and took in the desolation around them what more need he say when the entire curve of the world was nothing but sand cracked by the sun so parched that the ground looked to have never known a drop of water naamen said he may be a gatherer of the dead he is taking us to have faith in shen if not in leeka she is the only one among us who matters alivers daughter remember he leads us through her i never knew the prince know his daughter then and feel privileged kelis did not waste any more breath trying to convince him naamen and benabe could base their thoughts only on the world they knew and the things they had seen neither had seen the santoth kelis had neither had ever seen leeka before kelis had and because of it he was sure that they had no choice but to follow him kelis did not truly feel the certainty he tried to project yet what choice had he but to face with dignity whatever came they did not walk as late into the night as usual they made camp on a plain dotted with oblong boulders like slim eggs balanced upright each taller than a man kelis had not seen the boulders until they were among themstrange for his eyes had been searching for anything to break the monotony but there they were the group stood within a cluster of them the others showing unease behind their fatigue leeka kept moving he scooped out a bowl shape in the sand and sparked a strange blue fire into it he had not poured any substance into the bowl nor had he struck flint and tinder nevertheless a flame roiled around the depression like a liquid brightening to a greenish glow then settling to a turquoise illumination that touched all the watching faces and made the world behind them fade with the fire burning but nothing being consumed leeka looked at the group he bade them sit once they had he said touch the fire it will not burn you touch it naamen asked yes leeka demonstrated drawing back a sleeve and pushing his outstretched hand into the substance it rippled at his touch licked up his forearm he showed no discomfort and when he withdrew his hand it was unharmed why naamen asked why should we touch it you should do as your friend suggests trust naamen glanced at kelis at shen and benabe for a moment he looked like a child caught out by an elder but then he pressed his lips together and looked at the liquid flame he shot his fingers into it quickly straight and close together then drew them back stared at them and then eased them in again astonishment loosened his features its not hot he said its like cool water like water leeka said it will refresh you touch and drink of it it will sustain you until you return to your lands just like that keliss thirstwhich had faded to so deep within him that he was no longer aware of itreturned nothing had ever seemed more enticing than that fiery liquid his hand scooped into it and came up dripping flame naamen was right it was cool to the touch he brought his hand to his lips it was delicious and like liquid life as it slid down his throat he felt it reach the center of him and begin to slip out as if into the veins of his body just one handful then he sat back on his haunches head tilted to the sky eyes closed completely filled for a time he forgot everything understanding vaguely that the others had done the same the santoth are here leeka said they thank you for bringing the heir to them she is loved they will answer your questions now remembering the sorcerers as he had seen them on the plains that day kelis opened his eyes and looked around the five of them were alone they will my teachers will speak through me yes now youll answer our questions benabe asked the euphoria of having drunk the flame had filled her features but her voice still had its edge now that we walked through the desert with you for three daysnow we can ask you questions mother shen said leeka said perhaps i should begin with what they think you should know you should know that the santoth are protecting you they have been for some time already they feel your fear and they understand but you are safe here when you leave you will find your way safely back to the world of people they promise you that what do they want with my daughter they want her to be safe safe from what leeka was silent a moment his eyes focused somewhere else eventually he said they wish me to explain shen knows these things she and i have discussed them time that you know as well mother of shen understand without doubt that the santoth have been in communion with the girl her entire life we know you know this and yet we feel the doubt in you dont doubt benabe sat with her daughter at her side the mothers face wore an expression like hurt as if the man had touched an old wound shen must have seen it for she took benabes hand and rubbed it for many generations of the living world the santoth knew no hope they suffered their banishment undying they knew much of what transpired in the world but they were not part of it they remembered so much and yet their grasp of the givers tongue slipped from them it eroded grew tainted it became a dreadful thing even to them you cannot understand how they suffered you do naamen asked they have let me experience it with them leeka answered it is a gift to me but i would not wish this knowledge on you but then aliver came to them as you did but he came unbidden he stirred hope in them again he reminded them that their banishment could be lifted he could have done it being a firstborn of a generation of tinhadins line there had been others of course many others but none of them had sought the santoth none of them came so close to releasing the santoth to do good in the world again aliver said he would thats why his death tormented the santoth they journeyed to find him and they did and in the disappointment following they let themselves release their rage here he looked at kelis but you know that you were there kelis looked down he rubbed the knuckles of one hand with the fingers of the other he did not wish the others to see the horror of that day on his face but he was sure it would be there for all to see why they might ask had he brought them here to those who had unleashed abominations on the world he wouldnt be able to answer my teachers feared that their exile would continue long and long they feared that but when they listened and waited they realized aliver was not completely gone he lived on in the one we call shen the bond they had with aliver continued with her that is why they have been able to speak with her all her life even from when she was in the womb benabe did not look at shen this time but again the girl rubbed her mothers hand comforting there was apology in the motion and yet her young face was eager waiting for leekas words you asked what the santoth wish of shen leeka said they wish only what she wants to give only what her father had tried to give only she can call them back to the world not the queen not the queens child only the firstborn of a generation of tinhadins line aliver was such a son shen is such a daughter and she has agreed this caused benabe to break her silence i dont know what you think she agreed to but i have agreed to nothing im her mother she told you of the stones leeka said for years she told you of them benabe did not deny it shen is a child she knows nothing about leeka raised his hand she knows a great deal mother without insult understand that you are the one who knows nothing about these things for a moment kelis thought benabe was going to hit the old soldier like any talayan tribal girl she had been trained in fisting a martial art that ironically used elbows and knees more than fists she could have driven his nose into his skull before his instincts pulled his head back if leeka felt threatened he gave no sign a great conflict is coming war on a scale never seen before war with who benabe snapped the mein were thoroughly beaten aushenia wishes acacia no harm talayans have their own issues too there is no one to war with the queen grips the world in her fist her fist is not that large leeka answered the santoth can see farther than you or i they see a coming war on a scale never seen before against a new enemy preparations have already begun the glow from the fire bowl was stronger now by its light kelis saw the faces of his companions as they absorbed that news weighed it but that was not all he saw behind them hulked the oblong shadows of the stones he glanced over his shoulder surely they had not been that near before he began to comment on it but found the words stuck on his tongue the santoth leeka continued would aid the known world in the struggle to come if the queen would share the song of elenet with them she has it my teachers know that they feel it every time she reads from it every time she sings they could explain it to her better than she can learn it on her own they could help her and help all the people of the known world benabe was on her knees now leaning toward leeka in an even better position to strike tinhadin who was the greatest of the santoth came to fear sorcery and drove it from the world why should we want it back forgive my asking but who does that serve other than them keliss eyes flicked between her and the stones they crowded so near now that he imagined he could reach back and touch the rock behind him naamen saw them also his mouth opened and remained that way is it a good thing to survive the coming slaughter leeka asked without the santoth you wont without the santoth the known world will learn chaos of a kind its never experienced before without the santoth corinn akaran will not learn the dangers of her sorcery we know that she does not understand fundamental things god talk does not create things anew the giver could but when humans sing we can only steal rearrange and often corrupt there is always a consequence alone the queen will not be able to see the consequences until it is too late she needs the santoth much more than she knows so you wish us to believe benabe said you still havent explained what role my daughter plays in this she will stay here with us leeka said we will hide her and protect her and commune with her and ready her for no benabe said the word with firm matteroffactness no i will not allow that the decision is not yours to make its shens she has made it already mother shen asked softly like naamen her attention had drifted out past the ring of people to the stones surrounding them she cocked her head slightly listening to something beyond the argument about her fate benabe ignored her i will stay with her then she said leekas eyes might have softened as he answered hermight have kelis was not sure that is not possible it must be i will not hand her over to you no matter what she says mother shen said if you wish to help leeka said glancing up to include kelis as well take the santoths message to queen corinn make her to know that the santoth must have the book they will have it whether she consents to it or not shen stood up mother the stones have come they are speaking they want to she got no further her head snapped back her teeth gnashed at the air and her arms flew out she looked like she had been pierced in the chest by something that wanted to lift her into the air benabe leaped to her feet and reached to catch her daughter but the stone behind her suddenly moved it turned into a cloud of sand a moving pillar that had something like a human form at its center it sped past benabe and surged around shens trembling body and caught her as she began to fall backward benabe screamed the other stones surged in on the group spinning together and roaring like an angry wind they mean no harm leeka shouted over the noise they will protect her from all harm until the time is right benabes voice rose louder still grab her kelis tried but the moment he stepped toward the girl he lost sight of her the swirling sand pressed against him he could barely move no matter how he tried to kick or lean or twist his way through it a few times he saw shenher face her legs her supine formrevealed in quick glimpses never in the same place twice leeka said and if the time is right she will let them free she will lead them back into the world if what we fear does come as quickly as it began it ended the pressure holding kelis in place vanished he crashed to the ground bumping against naamen who had also fallen silence stillness the fire was out kelis blinked quickly soon he could see the stars and low moon outlining the people around him he rose counting the figures scanning the featureless plain around them he saw benabe naamen but no one else theyre gone naamen said in answer benabe let loose an ancientsounding wail long held unending her daughter was taken c hapter f ortyone rialus perched on a westfacing windowsill in his quarters several stories above ground level with a view out across the seemingly endless city of avina buildings spread out in all directions mazelike many had been glazed in sparkling hues of crimson and orange more than one tower floated flags that announced their clan affiliation here and there trees rose between the structures tall lean poles that exploded in circular plumes at their highest points above flocks of pigeons swooped in great swaths of motion starlings darted through the air higher up tiny black pinpricks hung in the sky watchers occasionally gulls flew on patrol an air of ownership and condescension in their every motion and in each harsh cry a hundred different columns of smoke billowed dark clouds into the air mixed in among five hundred thinner plumes of gray even more small white puffs belched out of pipes and chimneys the columns were not so much a symptom of the contaminants of the airas they often seemed to be in large acacian cities like aleciaas they were reminders of the thousands and thousands of lives being lived in those countless buildings in workshops and at hearths around public cooking pits and in great halls filled with revelers or so rialus imagined despite the smoke the air tasted fresh enough it carried the salty tinge of the sea the only reminderother than the gullsthat it was so near the edge of the gray slopes lay just to the east over a barricade that through some trick of its architecture replicated a receding cityscape the inhabitants of the city had turned their backs on the shore and seemed to willfully ignore their coastal location if they did glance east they saw the illusion of the continuation of the city nothing else even knowing that a portion of the view was an illusion rialus still marveled at the size of what he could see and at the way it seemed to go on far beyond the reach of his eyes how large was the population as with everything here in ushen braehe no longer thought of this place as the other landsrialus could not make sense of it he heard the auldek bemoan their long centuries of infertility and he mentally marked down each mention of the rare occasions when an auldek did die it only made sense that their numbers had dwindled over time the fact that they would plan such a massive war in the hope that it would return their fertility attested to this as did the awe in which they held allek the annoying numrek whelp on the other hand the expanse around him indicated a thronging population he had put the question to devoth once they had been speaking together during a long session in which rialus was forced to write down every member of the akaran royal line that he could remember from edifus onward the subject enthralled the auldek rialus suspected it was the chronicle of deaths that held a morbid fascination for him so he made a point of detailing how each monarch had succumbed he even made up a few ghastly ends why not who could call him a liar as the meeting ended and feeling that the auldek leader was in good spirits rialus began howi mean how speak it leagueman devoth said you know youre going to so why not do so without the stammering do all your people speak that way rialus inhaled thinking i would speak it if you and the numrek didnt love to interrupt me at every chance he made sure to enunciate how many of you are there how many auldek i mean in ushen brae devoth drew his head back thoughtfully creased the corners of his eyes as if surprised and somewhat suspicious of the question there are enough of us he finally answered and there will be more soon thats what this is all about that rialus leagueman is what this is truly about with that he had turned abruptly away leaving rialus uneasy as well as curious on that occasion and on this one as he recalled it he had to remind himself that he was not the traitor devoth believed him to be though he had spent hours now divulging information that on the surface made him look like the most loosetongued betrayer he told himself this was all a ruse a way to buy time he would find some way out of this situation but he needed to survive in the meantime even if that meant he needed to appear to have betrayed his people as rialus sat on the windowsill telling himself this his servant fingel approached him the backless sandals she wore audibly smacked the bottoms of her feet with each step the sound had annoyed him at first until he understood it was the only sound she ever willingly made she never spoke a word unless it was required a silent servant who announced her presence only with the sound of her feet she was lovely to look upon at first he thought her beautiful despite the fact that she had wire whiskers in her cheeks and tattooed bands under her light eyebrows but before long he began to suspect these things added to her beauty strange as that seemed to him she looked to be meinish by birth had that races pale skin and strawblond hair thin featured delicate with a slightly upturned nose and a slim body that nevertheless drew his eyes back again and again to the contours beneath her simple shift she was nothing like his topheavy gurta but that made it easier to admire her without being pricked by conscience or memory she was quite distracting really all the more so for being so cold and detached speaking in her usual dead tones fingel said his magnificence devoth of the lvin summons you she held out the small marker of carved silver that proved it does he rialus took the marker and rubbed his finger across the lvin emblem embossed on it what do you think would happen if i didnt go told him i was busy fingel stood no expression animating her features as if her mind were blank and she had not heard him speak it was her customary expression she had looked at him directly only once early on he inadvertently spoke to her in the meinish tongue it just happened a flashback to his years spent in cathgergen brought on by the racial purity of her features she raised her gray eyes and studied him the look on her face the sad sympathetic expression one might fix upon a child with a damaged mind and that was it she turned away and never as far as rialus could remember looked him in the face again her constant silence prompted him only to blather more than usual am i important enough to him now that he would tolerate insolence he asked i should be where would he be without me im his expert on the known world perhaps he added offering a faint invitation to conspiracy with his tone and grin we should tell him im not well a headache perhaps what think you of that the girl could have been asleep with her eyes open even a beauty like you can get tiresome rialus said silently though he did not mean it aloud he acquiesced fine ill meet with his magnificence fingel pivoted he followed her his eyes incapable of looking away from her figure he almost detoured to the toilet chamber before he left there in the near privacy he regularly used mental images of fingel as he pleasured himself he knew he could have physically taken her anytime he wanted to she was a slave in his complete power devoth had made that clear for that matter he had bedded servants back in acacia who he knew were not terribly willing just a part of the privilege of his office it had seemed but here he was not so sure he could face fingels reaction she deposited rialus in the care of four of devoths slave soldiers they were young men thick about the chest and as haughty as newly appointed marah though sullen as well two of them had the lvin clans white facial tattooing the third had whiskers none of them were a match in appearance to the victor of the melee but few men would be like fingel they spared no words for rialus as they trudged through the city streets rialus framed by the square of them they occasionally talked among themselves when rialus offered a thought or question however stone silence they acted as if they were waiting for an excuse to ram their rather horrificlooking pikes through his guts nothing new all the slaves he had interacted with in ushen brae made it clear that they held him in complete disdain total lack of interest he could make no sense of it shouldnt they look to him as a connection with their homeland anger or hope either emotion would have made more sense to him they gave him nothing despite his strangely privileged position this troubled rialus might he find no allies here nobody to turn toward to help him find the means to defy his captors though he could not define the shape of his eventual defiance he was sure it must come must if he could find the way to achieve it but he was no closer now weeks later he still knew nothing it seemed of this land or people if he could slip away on his own for a bit explore where he wanted to probe around devoth had promised him that he would learn about ushen brae what had he said youll see many grand things youre our guest so youll see the things that make us great so much for that he had never left the environs of his own quarters except for excursions of a mile or so to meet with other auldek officials escorted always by slave guards would that he could see what they were hiding from him although having thought that maybe being by himself would not be a good idea either there were things living in avina that he had no interest in coming upon by accident once while following devoth through a long hallway past doors that opened onto different gymnasium chambers he had seen a creature that made him stop abruptly it had caught his eye because of its size which was like that of no other creature he had ever seen like one of the foulthings perhaps but he had never set eyes on one of those this thing stood to the height of three or four men and even that was not an accurate measurement for it squatted on long bent legs it was winged as welllarge black jointed wings membranous and foul awkwardly held out as it waddled it looked like some sort of bat made gigantic it was furred on the chest and around its longjawed canine face horrible and somehow made more so by the sight of an auldek high on its back fastened there in a harness the creature leaped about at the auldeks direction its wings aiding it the auldek held a spear in one hand and had several more quivered beside him nice huh thats a kwedeir devoth had said having stepped back to see what rialus was gaping at you dont want to go in there its near feeding time as devoth said this rialus noticed a slave being led in and then pushed against his will toward the creature you dont mean its going to eat that man yes i do strange the way they eat they like to stalk their food even when its presented to them they stalk it and then leap and bite it around its head and then pause every time they do the same they pause and listen as the unfortunate one screams and then they bite down and rip the head off while the body still flails about beneath do you want to watch his eyes seemed inclined to do just that but rialus snapped up a hand to block the view by the giver no devoth rumbled out his mirth but he nudged rialus to get him moving down the corridor a few steps farther on and a highpitched scream cut through the air an anguished cry of terror devoth did not so much as flinch he did however grunt and say we use them to catch runaways good sport on reaching devoths estate his escorts put rialus in the care of the household servants and then turned away without a word and what then was he rushed right in to an audience with his magnificence hardly instead as he expected he was told to wait in the inner courtyard it was a beautiful enough space partially open to the air with pillars of marble that supported trellises thick with flowering vines a pool in the floor gurgled home to eellike fish that cocked their heads and followed rialuss every move it would have been a pleasant enough area to wait in if there had been something to sit on what kind of waiting area did not provide a place to sit typical auldek he thought display luxury while making one uncomfortable at the same time standing he wondered what devoth wanted to talk about this time he feared he had exhausted his knowledge of usable information their last meeting actually had a note of finality to it as if everything had been decided devoth had summed up the entire plan of attack it was to be one great march of virtually the entire auldek population all except those unfit the journey many of the divine children would accompany them warriors and servants both the auldek did not seem to fear to return the quota to their homeland at least not the ones they were planning on taking with them it will be a misery devoth said but we must begin the journey in the winter we will spend the first month trudging into the arctic getting colder each day well stay all along the coastline frozen stiff no doubt thinking ourselves insane for leaving avina on this schedule spring will start to warm the land at about the time we must leave the coast here he pierced the map with one of his long fingers but then when we turn inland it will grow cold again well return to winter thats what calrach swears and he says it should be that way because for a time we travel only upon ice on some inland sea we must be fast though for if we are too late getting there the ice will thin we might fall through calrach lost several of his tribe to that fate devoth spoke this with an air of solemnity rialus had never observed on him at least he added they had but one life to die through strange rialus thought to imagine an existence in which a single death was an oddity he wondered if such a perspective was a strength or if it might be a weakness somehow ive said it before your magnificence but please allow me to express my concern devoth scowled but did not otherwise dissuade him it will not be the same as with the numrek the league will certainly warn the empire you chirp like a cricket devoth said listen chirp no more this war will happen it will be a wonder you cant imagine you dont know how we go to battle we havent done so in hundreds of yearsnot since the early days when we were drunk with the soul catchers gift few of us even remember those times but i do in the past we warred with one another and almost destroyed our race ironic no we win the gift of immortality and become so high with it that we slaughtered one another like never before you have no idea this time the clans will all join in one massive force well roll across the land marching riding haired rhinoceros and kwedeirs and freketes you havent seen a frekete yet have you oh but you will the image of the winged jointed monstrosity that was the kwedeir flashed in rialuss mind the bunched muscle beneath the gray skin the swaying movement the enormity of it as scaled by the auldek riding its back and that was what he had seen what might freketes be he could not help himself he shuddered exactly devoth said he grinned with one side of his mouth snow lions hunting for us and antoks clearing the way behind us still other slaves will push weapons of war well ride singing rialus leagueman chanting joyful the numrek tell me they had a mighty slaughter when they fell upon your lands this though will be like nothing your people have ever seen be glad youll get to watch it from our side instead of from the ground as we trample you leagueman try to understand weve been dead in our living bodies for years now we are ready to live again to battle to risk everything to make children and even to die it will be wonderful for us at least not so much for your people a male servant finally came and got rialus a good hour after he had arrived a short time later the servant paused and pointed to a figure in the center of a large labyrinthine inner garden he is there master can you find your way from here or should i walk farther with you no rialus said more sharply than he expected he was quite capable of finding his way forward now i can see him he thought in the givers name im not a complete idiot he had the impulse to wiggle his fingers in the servants face dismissively but he knew the man would not so much as deign to respond if he did rialus would be left looking silly im fine he said a few steps forward however and he was not sure of that a snow lion stepped out onto the path some twenty feet in front of him it was a massive thing that moved with slow heavy menace for a moment rialus thought it would cross the path but sensing the acacian the feline paused it turned its head and set its gray eyes on him moving as if its head and wild mane were as heavy as stone its tongue lolled out a moment wagging and then was slurped back in rialus cried out eyyaaahhhh his fingers twitched the summons fell from his hand and clattered all too loud on the marble tiles the cat lowered its head the muscles along its back and forelegs rippling beneath its white coat its tail flicked one quick movement that was enough to make rialus start he was sure the beast would leap on him knew that it could cover the distance in one bound knew its large paws hid claws that would grasp him as mercilessly as an alley cat does a mouse indeed the lion seemed to be speaking to him did he realize the beast asked that it could crack rialuss head between his jaws and slop out his brains with his tongue rialus peed he did not feel it coming it just happened the warm flow starting at his groin and trickling down both his legs he would never be surebut he had his suspicionsthat the act of releasing his bladder saved his life the lions nostrils flared it obviously smelled the urine its upper lip drew back from its teeth and trembled for a momenta look of derision if rialus had ever seen one it raised its head turned away in disgust and carried on across the path leaving rialus the sight of its swaying genitalia as a lingering image he considered backing out running to his quarters and changing his clothes but there was not time for that he picked up the summons and carried on walking awkwardly for the urine was already cool hoping his robe would hide any stains as he walked he noticed something strange in the air around devoth things darting and hovering as he stood still a swarm of insects perhaps the beetles performing some strange act of auldek hygiene he could not make out what it was until he drew quite near then he saw more clearly not flying insects at all but hummingbirds ten or more of them zipped through the air above devoth flashing scarlet and metallic green and yellow they darted swirled chased one another and then hovered they were beautiful all motion and grace and they returned again to devoth he even held one on the palm of his outstretched hand they had no fear of him indeed they seemed to be competing for his attention noticing rialus devoth turned to face him he smiled as the tiny bird flitted up from his hand and then settled again ah theres my leagueman do you like my birds they like to dance with me they love me as you can tell and i love them staring at them rialus did not know how to answer he opened his mouth but only a breath of indecision escaped him he might never understand these people he wished to think them foul and base and ugly but nothing as beautiful as a hummingbird had ever loved rialus fast behind this thought came another completely unbidden and without warning what he thought if the world is not meant for acacians after all what if the auldek deserve it more than we as if in answer devoth grinned for the few seconds that he held the grin rialus was certain the auldek could read his thoughts you know leagueman if you hold still like that for long enough one of my birds may nest in your mouth that would do neither of us any good come we have things to discuss well begin the march within a fortnight with that he bobbed his upraised hand and the tiny bird whirred into flight once more c hapter f ortytwo mena would never forget the strange song that corinn whispered to aaden as he lay unconscious and bleeding that horrible afternoon she could not remember the words of it she was not even sure there were words it had a shape that might have been language but that was vague and hidden beneath a melody that defied description it was sound and breath and notes it contained more voices than just corinns mixed with music and exhalation and sobbing and a thousand promises it mystified her and the others as well one of the servants asked if they should pull the queen away from the boy but mena shook her head whatever was happeningwhether the song was a funeral dirge or a sorcerers spellit was corinns right to sing it a mothers right perhaps a queens right when finally corinn drew back and let them attend the prince the physicians gasped in amazement aadens abdomen had healed there was blood aplenty but try as they might they could not find any cuts in the boys flesh bruises yes a swollen line above his groin that looked like a longhealed wound abrasions but the boy simply was not suffering from the dagger wound they had come running to attend he was no more hurt than if he had been through a rough patch of sword training he slept breathing steadily his face as peaceful as that of any child deep in the dreamworld he will sleep until he wakes the queen said but one of the physicians began how did the giver has helped me heal him she said inflecting the gods name in the manner that gave its feminine form let us praise her and be thankful after verifying aadens lack of injury with her own eyes mena had sought out her sister corinn had already turned her back on the scene and was striding away rhrenna rushing to keep up with her mena caught her in the hallway but corinn would not even look her in the face she mumbled something about washing the blood off that was all she left mena standing in the hallway caked in grime corinn had not even looked at elya and that was cruel for the creature was trembling with worry obviously afraid that she had not done well enough mena returned to her and assured her through whispered words and caresses that she had done very well wonderfully well she was a beauty she had saved aaden and corinn would thank her for it once she recovered from the shock believing this to be true mena could not have been more surprised with how quickly her sister hadwell recovered seemed the proper word proper but not the right one several days later aaden still remained asleep but corinn had put her grief and fear behind her she emerged from her chambers as poised and controlled as ever washed clean and seeming all the more forceful in her beauty her face was leaner perhaps just slightly more angular and perhaps several years older though this may just have been because of the tightlipped expression she took on she summoned the queens council and demanded that the senate in alecia send representatives to witness what had happened firsthand and to hear sire dagons testimony she met in various sessions all day long leaving one military briefing to receive ambassadors after which she left for still more meetings she even agreed to go to alecia herself to address the largest audience of senators and representatives from around the empire possible all at once she had time for everyone it seemed except her sister mena could not secure a moment alone with her when they did speak it was only on official matters in the company of others the queen assigned mena the duty of briefing all incoming soldiers on the best manner to fight the numrek even demanding she hold mock battles in the carmelia mena could not help but think this cruel for the stadium brought to mind again and again the horrible moment when the numrek had sunk his blade into aadens belly and then into devlynsthe poor boy she fulfilled her role with melio at her side he was a comfort but it was corinn she needed like elya in her simple way mena too craved corinns absolution her sister managed to deny her without ever overtly saying that she was doing so once when mena asked for a word alone with her corinn looked at her as if she were a slightly slow child of course we can talk she said would you like me to have the merchants of bocoum wait until were done theyve only sailed across to promise their financial assistance and the invaluable use of their barges to transport troops and goods theyve come to offer their aid to the nation at a desperate time but if you would like me to have them wait i will the other option is that we speak later which do you prefer it was no real question obviously mena bowed in answer and withdrew without complaint how could she argue what she wanted was intangible emotional a sense of connection corinn might be incapable of providing while on the other hand corinn seemed a monarch with a hundred hands now each of them was juggling different aspects of this new crisis fortunately corinn allowed mena access to aaden whenever she wished she went there often as she did one afternoon after a long day of fighting and lecturing on the hot field of the carmelia she wanted to see him before returning to her own quarters he slept on as before but she still felt it necessary to visit him thinking that somewhere in his core he might be aware of the world might crave comfort even if he was incapable of asking for it there was a touch of perfume in the air a musky scent that she had smelled before but could not place now some noble perhaps come recently to pay his respects and offer gifts indeed quite a few had done that corinn had permitted only agnates the honor and only if they promised to enter quietly view the prince from a distance and leave whatever present they had in the space cleared to display them a pile of them now crowded the corner oh my lovely boy mena said lowering herself gently to the edge of his bed he lay on his side head resting on his two hands in a posture that looked almost deliberate as if he had taken it just to model sleeping childish innocence she ran her fingers over his hair pulling a few strands back from his forehead and then sat taking him in there was much of corinn in his features which meant much of their mother but there was no mistaking signs of the boys grayeyed father as well she did not see it as much when he was awake now though with the leisure to gaze at his features she could see how much aaden was a child of two nations she wondered if corinn acknowledged it too mena had never seen hanish mein in person strange that a man who had affected so much of her lifeand still didhad never been in the same room as she she had met his brother maeander she had turned herself in to him in vumu and used him to transport her back to the world all those years ago just after she had hunted and killed the god maeben when she looked close at the parts of aaden that were not akaran it was maeander she saw in her head so sharp featured and tall handsome yes but in a highchinned arrogant manner fortunate then that whatever meinish traits aaden showed had been softened by corinns roundedged beauty she did not doubt that the boy would wake just as corinn said whatever had been in that song part of it was power the sorcery corinn had been studying but would he wake remembering the moment the numrek betrayed him would he see that knife thrusting toward him or would he be spared it for that matter had he seen what happened to devlyn mena hoped not for she could not bear the thought that he would live with that brutal image in his mind with the responsibility he might feel for his friends death dont remember it she said none of it was your fault the guilt all rests on others devlyn was a brave boy think of him as dying to save you thats what he wanted thats why he will be remembered as a warrior a hero ill make sure its so and you will too when you wake oh aaden how beautiful elya was when she rescued you so fierce and full of love for you you wanted to fly with her didnt you well you did she loved you so much she swept in and lifted you into the air and carried you away from all that evil see i told you that she thought you a special boy theres the proof and then she did something she had not planned to she paused a moment until she was sure she wanted him to hear this news perhaps it would give joy to his sleeping mind be a comfort to him until he awoke she began i have something to tell you about elya on her return to her quarters she found melio waiting for her he stood on the balcony leaning out to take in the view of the harbor he had set a glass carafe of lemon liqueur on the stone balustrade two glasses beside it one of which was half full any change he asked his eyes soft on her as she approached no he sleeps on perhaps its better that way ive hardly managed to sleep since battling the numrek too much to worry about mena watched him pour for her and then took the glass he offered youve slept more than youre aware she said wryly either that or youve perfected your imitation of a drunken man snoring be nice he said looking affronted he reached to muss her hair but she cocked her head just sharply enough to indicate that she was not really in a playful mood melio took the hint he set both elbows on the weathered stone and scanned the sea its been busy the harbor more boats in and out than ive ever seen the harbor patrol has been keeping them anchored far out controlling the flow he glanced at her inviting a response hmm mena said she looked at him as well though she was still thinking about aaden mena corinn gave me orders today i can tell you havent heard what orders shes sending the elite to support general andeson in teh ill have to go meet with his officers shortly they have the coastline blockaded but its the teheen hills theyre really worried about if the numrek get there theyll be hard to track they could stay alive for months us spending our resources chasing them while the auldek start out on their marchif thats truly going to happen is it mena hated the question but she had to ask it she had heard so much talk the last few days so many rumors but it was still hard to believe that a people so far away were somehow a threat to them the queen seems to think so thats what the league reports and they were the ones who brought the news hard to refute them right now theyre adamant that its happening and that the auldek have no interest in negotiating thats what they were doing when everything went mad melio finished the sentence hesitantly reacting to the way mena cut her eyes down from his face he knew her well and because of it she knew that he understood her to have thought of dariel dariel had been at that attempt at negotiation whatever went wrong happened to him before his eyes perhaps to his body drumming his fingertips on the stone balustrade melio resumed anyway its a sound plan about teh i mean the numrek are here already they are our enemy again theres really nothing but for us to destroy them the elite should be a part of it as their captain i shes punishing me for not taking better care of aaden mena said no shes not dont say that you know your sister he began but then waved that away and began again you know how she functions she is wrapped up in details those come first i doubt very much mena that she thinks any ill of you shes just not one to remember small things like feelings for the first time she sipped the lemon liqueur sipped it once and then tilted it back and poured the entire drink down her throat wiping her mouth with her hand she spoke as if she had not heard melio at all she thinks i allowed aaden to be stabbed and shes right i did i watched it happen stop mena he set his glass down and turned her to face him with a hand at her shoulder that then slid up to cradle her head and neck im only going to say this one more time nobody blames you not even corinn she may think she does she may even act on it but in truth she blames herself its she who made the numrek her personal guards its she who put her sons safety in the hands of brute enemies tell me you didnt always know that it was wrong to think them our allies they ate human flesh what was she thinking trusting them she was thinking about how much she liked it that her guards put the fear of death in everyone else she liked it that she was different and didnt have to call on anybody even her family for protection dont pull away you know what i say is true she knows it as well but you mena kept aaden alive corinn knows that too dont expect her to thank you for it anytime soon but she knows it deep down melio drew his hand away from her neck but only so that he could use both his hands to grasp hers now theres something else we should talk about no she knew exactly what it was she knew because she had been thinking about it too he had been patient and she had known that in the joyful times after he had arrived back on the island and elya was working her magic he had been on the verge of opening the topic again if he had asked a few days ago she would have agreed things were different now let us make a child he said stop using that root powder and lets be parents to a new generation not now look at whats yes now weve waited long enough do you really want to let me leave to face the numrek without even trying what if i dont come back will you wash your hands of my memory mena started to object but he spoke over her why shouldnt i think that you already do it i hate the way you wash me out of you like theres something wrong with me like you dont want any remnants of me inside you every time we make love you kill that part of me that wants to make life with you he dropped her hands a gesture of disgust to match what he was accusing her of his faceso perfect when he smiledbecame a mask of creases disdain frustration it was horrible to see as he backed away mena stepped toward him you just told me not to say foolish things you dont either i always want you inside me always you are here already right here in my center she showed the spot by making a blade of her hand stabbing it in her chest dont tell me the world is going mad again melio said he did not hide the spite in his voice a twisted sort of malice that coiled with vulnerability and lovehard to separate one from the other you always have a reason you wanted to wait until aaden was older to make sure he lived and was healthy nice of you not to compete with your sister but he did live hes healthy and hell wake up soon better than ever hes the heir she cant possibly worry about your having children just tell her that then it was that you couldnt be with child and fight the foulthings fine thats done and now youre going to say that the world is in chaos again too dangerous right not right now afterward excuses excuses mena he said that harshly then seemed to regret his tone more softly he said there always needs to be a new generation no matter the circumstances of the moment we can never know what the future holds but i know whats true right now right now i love you and you love me that love is a gift from the giver and you should thank him for it by making something of it no mena said but then hated the word and knew it was what she meant it was she who drew closer to melio now one arm pulling his torso against hers her other hand wrapping around the back of his head and pinching his hair between her fingers not now but after whatever is comingwith the auldek i meanis over we can try menaaaa he drew the name out exasperated these things of lifelove between two people the quickening of new beingsthey dont stop when events ask them to they are life much more so than the wars we make the monsters we slay tugging his hair she cut in listen i will swear an oath to you my promise to you and to the giver when the numrek and the auldek are dealt with well make a child together i swear it but melio i cant not fight if we are to have war its the only gift i really have to offer its what im good at im maeben on earth i cant pretend otherwise its not the only thing you have to offer melio began but did not explain further he considered her skeptically for a moment make children together not just one we have years of delay to make up for yes thats right she pulled him closer and pressed her cheek against his collarbone he let her stay like that a moment but then pulled back look me in the eyes he said do you swear by maeben as well yes and saying so she realized she did mean it she was going to fight like she never had before she was going to give everything she had because the dream she had conjured of a peaceful life remained a thing to fight for just one more war just one and surely the giver would let her rest you are my vaharinda she said you will give me many children enough to people the world he finally released the wonder that was his smile all the components of his face shifted into joyful arrangement okay mena he said i just hope you get to keep this promise so do i she thought moving her mouth to meet his so do i c hapter f ortythree a fine morning a week after all the chaos with the numrek delivegu walked past the marah guarding the entrance to the queens compound his chin raised haughty and disdainful of their fixed stares he quite enjoyed it how quickly the talented rise when he reached rhrennas offices in the anteroom however he made himself more personable secretary he said showing his perfect teeth i have need of an audience with the queen i know rhrenna said you told me as much thats why i gave permission for you to come this far ill need to know why you wish to speak to her before you go any farther why indeed delivegu thought smiling why indeed oh its a small thing but i think shed like to know it delivegus recent capture of barad the lesser had won him more than a few privileges he now officially had a post in rialus neptoss staff it would have annoyed him if neptosratlike creature that he washad actually been around but he was away indefinitely if not dead corinn kept her plans so close to her lovely chest that very little came through the offices of the councillor what little did the upperlevel staff seemed intent on keeping from him the first days in his post he took to calling himselfprivately of courseacting chancellor delivegu lemardine time would remove the acting and then finally all would be right in the world perhaps he would eventually achieve chancellor and queens consort delivegu lemardine he of the mighty erection that last part was true of course and the rest well one could always dream in keeping with his new role he was granted office space in one of the outer buildings of the palaces governmental wingsnot the most distinguished sector of the grounds documents brought to him from the councillors office had to travel from those rarified regions down several staircases along a back alley through a few underpasses and up a ramp most often trafficked by laborers and their animals the stink of the beasts drifted through his open window he would have kept it closed except the room shadowed as it was for much of the day behind a high archway was damp almost to the point of being chilly something similar could be said about the secretary who came with the office she was not exactly disfigurednobody who worked within the palace displayed any of the physical ailments one might see regularly among the common peoplebut there was something unnervingly masculine about her shoulders wider than normal hips narrower her jaw was square as any aushenian dockworkers her voice just as gruff he was being unkind perhaps she filled her position efficiently enough with barely a wasted word or action he would rather have employed a dimwitted pretty girl that he could have slathered across his desk when the spirit moved him the fact that this woman did not entice him seemed a personal affront even worse he had dreamed about her several times dreams of a sexual nature that left him squirming when he awoke he tried to avoid looking at her not an easy task in a small office space though the palace was abuzz he did not have much official business arrive at his desk fortunately wearing the badge of his new rank allowed him free rein to wander much of the palace the queens office wing remained barred to him as did the akaran familys private quarters that small city unto itself those he needed special permission to access no matter strolling along the upper courtyard gardens chatting with the guards who seemed a fixture at each gateway watching the gapemouthed fish hunt minnows in the pools striding through corridors past senators and league officials and rich merchants kept him entertained they all wore such grave faces concern hung about their shoulders worry over the fate of the empire delivegu viewed the turmoil as an opportunity but not one that should spoil his appreciation of his sudden rise in stature he flirted with noblewomen when opportunities arose he did his best to orchestrate chance encounters especially as one particular girl from manil positively entranced him such a small bud of mouth on her and young enough that he knew just knew he would amaze her with his carnal knowledge even climbing all the way up to old edifuss ancient ruins amused him good exercise for the legs and lungs and by the giver what a view the inner sea all around glistening like colored glass lit from below the tales said the first king was a suspicious paranoid man that was why he perched here so high above the sea with views in all directions delivegu doubted that contained all his character surely a man could not choose a spot in the world such as this without an eye for the splendor of it edifus he was sure had an eye for beauty still though the nation faced a crisis a grave threat a new enemy and all that considering this he sequestered himself in his offices for at least a few hours each day he did his best to keep apprised of the workings in the higher reaches of the councillors offices sending frequent missives to them cajoling information out of their tight fists for his efforts he soon found himself deluged with documents that he was expectednonot to consider and offer his sage opinion on but to sort to stack to arrange as if he were a lower order of office employee he suspected the crates of dusty paper were actually long meant for disposal he nearly made the mistake of storming into rialuss office and accosting the staff but then realized that was likely what they had wanted him to do make a fool of himself prove that he was not one of the elite become a laughingstock clearly his promotion did not sit well with some of his new peers he held his tongue and perused the piles for something helpful to his advancement late one afternoon delivegu came across some sort of diagram or architectural survey he would have tossed it if his eyes had not touched upon a few words written at the top corner he recognized the handwriting immediately rialus neptoss he would have known the crimped writing anywhere he thought it indicative of the character of the man which was why delivegu himself always wrote with bold strong strokes meant to own the page he would have tossed the diagram away right then except that his secretary stepped in to ask if he needed anything more from her for the day not wanting to fully curdle his already dubious mood by looking at her he sank his head toward the document murmuring that no he did not need her anymore she asked if he wanted the pile of papers on the floor disposed of he said that could wait for the morrow she spoke on a bit longer delivegu resolutely kept his eyes on the paper by the time she left he realized he might actually have something of interest in his hands it was a diagram of buildings viewed as if from above the longer he stared the more he believed he saw something familiar in it something about the shape of the exterior walls and the indication of a jutting portion yes it was the royal palace the residence areas as soon as he thought that he noticed the same words palace residence penned in rialuss hand had he read that or had he figured it out himself no matter he pulled a lamp closer as his offices were already well in shadow and growing dimmer by the minute and he made a careful study of the lines and shapes equations and architects notes about materials and descriptions of renovation projects apparently done over the many years crowded the page little of it meant much to delivegu he did however tingle with the suspicion that rialuss cryptic scribblings had been written after all the rest and had some other import half sentences and signs and arrows that could have been meant only as notes to himself for they confused the diagram more than explained anything to make it worse much of what rialus had written he had later crossed out he makes no sense delivegu complained a waste of my time once again he nearly tossed the diagram onto the pile of papers rising beside his desk but if it was a waste of time why had it occupied rialus so long he bent and studied it further it was a map of secret passageways of course it was that was what the broken lines drawn within the walls were yes it did appear that many of the passageways were no longer usable some of them rialus had scratched out with positively angry motions had rialus kept this document at the queens orders or secretly that delivegu could not discern but it did seem clear that the queen had taken pains to eliminate these passages suspecting some deceit were you your majesty he asked wheres your trust your faith in your loyal servants if she had suspected treachery it looked like she had been very effective in sealing the place up each time he tried to trace his way in with a finger he invariably reached a dead end at least that was the case until now thats interesting delivegu said thats quite interesting outside he stood beside the wall in a quiet area of the palace grounds he would not be able to say later whether the secret entrance had been missed or whether corinn had allowed it to stay open nor could he ask of course he suspected that the tunnel had been effectively sealed off for a time but it appeared to have come open again when a new door was knocked into a onceclosed storage space perhaps the queen never knew the change was made but this was conjecture what he did know was that it existed just as the diagram indicated there was a narrow slit in the southern buttress of the royal quarters a fissure between two walls just large enough for a person to slip through it was the strangest thing for one could stand a few feet away from it and not see the opening for what it was even when he did stick his head in a facing wall met him making it seem like the opening led nowhere that was an illusion of the architecture tricky this delivegu thought admiring he moved farther in he had not planned on going far he just wanted to look to verify that the tunnel really took him inside if so he would retreat and consider how this new information might prove useful that was his intention but curiosity kept him moving just a little farther first into that storage room then through it down a passage and still little farther after that the stones sweated the air felt musty and close terribly quiet when he stepped out into an ornate hallway complete with wall hangings and carpets and lifesized statues spaced at intervals he knew he had accomplished all he needed to for an evening he strolled a few steps forward just to feel the soft give of the carpet underfoot inhaling air lightly scented with a citrus incense oh thats nice this could really suit me and the statues looked so very real it made his skin crawl how textured like real flesh they were clothed as ancient warriors from around the empire he could not help but marvel at the work play at staring these wooden warriors down he even challenged one to a duel when he heard the voices he did not initially panic they were not in his hallway but were approaching from around the corner chatting all he had to do was retrace his steps and slip back into the wall the crack through which he had come was just here no not there solid wall there down here a little farther beyond that table no not there either the voices came from two women growing nearer here no nothing but stone he could not for the life of him find his way back into the passageway certain that the women were about to step around the corner he yanked open the nearest door and dove inside as he strode across the room he was aware of a bed and a sleeping form in it still moving he turned to confirm the person did not awaken what he saw caused him to halt he swung back toward the bed tiptoeing and looked more closely the prince for a moment his skin crawled if he got caught in the princes bedroom if the boy opened his eyes and shouted the two voices grew louder delivegu set his sights on what he needed to find a place to hide he ran across the room and slipped behind the curtains that covered one of the floortoceiling windows there was plenty of room for him to stand unseen the door opened and two maids entered discussing something that somebody had done delivegu did not have time to make sense of it for they did something near the bed said a few words directlypresumablyto the sleeping prince and then someone else arrived they greeted the new arrival with deference for the next few moments he tracked the maids by sounds they made tending to details of the princes bedding perhaps quick work he heard them whisper a farewell the door opened and they apparently stepped out whoever had entered after them however remained in the room oh my lovely boy a female voice said it was not the queens though it was familiar he had heard it before but where she did not provide him another opportunity to figure it out for some time she stayed silent at first delivegu stood stiff and breathed carefully and barely moved at all but as the minutes passed he relaxed shell leave soon shell leave soon later still he thought i hope she doesnt fall asleep she did not every now and then he could hear just enough faint noise to indicate movement a creak of weight on the bed breath inhaled through the nose and expelled as a gust through the mouth he imagined her stroking the boys hand gazing down into his face concerned reasonable enough he still wished he knew who the woman was a suitor perhaps did a boy so young have suitors well he is a prince delivegu mused probably has a gaggle of suitors the lad is handsome as well prince i hope you know how to use those good looks in the years to come had i your title oh the damage id have done to the nations virgins hardly bears thinking about the woman spoke he heard her clearly enough and lost interest just as quickly she was saying emotional womanly things about how good the boy was and how the dragon creature had loved him he listened with half his attention until she said something that pulled him back i have something to tell you about elya with that he placed the voice princess mena she who had ridden in on that dragon creature slipped off and spoken so casually to the queen you cant tell anybody you have to promise i mean it promise silence for a moment delivegu had half a mind to step out from behind the curtain and point out that the boy was unconscious if you wait for a response you might be there awhile princess okay since you promise a few more words slipped by without taking shape and then you cant even tell your mother delivegu perked up she wouldnt understand shewell its not easy bearing her responsibilities it makes one hard skeptical always looking for the ill that hides beneath any good sometimes i think that the more you look the more you find the more you look the more you create the things you most fear the princess said something else under her breath she must have looked down and cursed into her hand not liking the direction of her own words delivegu was already calculating the value of what he had heard a bit of criticism spoken to an unconscious boy value naught give us something more he thought this is only for you to know mena said elya has laid eggs four of them oh you would so love to hold them and you will once youre better youll come to my quarters and ill show you them that was the chance event that brought delivegu to the queens offices and had him standing before rhrenna so pleased with himself that he felt no need to rush to answer her he would not be describing the circumstances of the encounter in detail nor discussing the rather troublesome time he had had escaping the royal quarters later that night he would however offer information he would claim to have gleaned from his everreliable sources it would be easy enough to lay the information on one of menas maids someone who might have chanced upon the eggs and might have told someone else who might have told that sort of thing for what reason do you want an audience with the queen rhrenna asked repeating the question for a third time she kept her voice clipped and her gray meinish eyes cold but delivegu knew better his smile was an unwavering crescent and his talent for talking through it long practiced rhrenna now that im a man in high standing i feel inclined to boldness when my darling will you consent to get to know me better privately i mean just you and me wine perhaps good food and a place of comfort to retire to that sort of thing rhrenna studied him a moment before answering dont you mean that question for the queen ah he had not expected that it set him back a moment wondering if the fact that she asked it indicated the queen had spoken to her about it or that she intuited the queen would be receptive ah what man could fail to find her highness a great beauty im no different but the queen would have no interest in me certainly though the sentence was declarative he left it dangling loose ended and rather sounding like a question rhrennas answer was franker than he wished for you dont stand a chance she said enjoy your lecherous thoughts of her in private delivegu thats the only way youll find satisfaction i mean no insult though im of the opinion that no man except aadenwhen he becomes a manwill ever get near the queens heart and what of you then would you ever try me try you rhrenna laughed oh youre a charmer delivegu try you she spun away and resumed perusing the papers on her desk well that didnt go that well he thought he was preparing a witty remark something to brush her off and indicate no acknowledged harm to his sensualists casual demeanor when she continued yes i imagine i would try you she admitted her eyes rose to meet his i think you smell rather good never had the mention of his bodily odor been such an invigorating kick in the groin she did not let him linger on it at present though again she said her voice resuming its official curtness for what reason do you wish an audience with the queen if you dont answer me now youll have to leave she likes changing gears this one fine i wont complain in fact delivegu felt like purring such was the pleasure of his position once again i have intelligence for her he said news that she may find very very interesting i have word that something important is about to hatch four things in fact four things that someone has kept hidden from her c hapter f ortyfour it was a delicate instrument thin and artful a slight curve in the handle with one end weighted and shaped into a handgrip the tip ended in a blackened needle point dariel knew what it was from the moment he laid eyes on it he had spent the last few days studying crude maps of ushen braes coastline in exercising his body and explaining nautical concepts and terms to tunnel and skylene and the others who were to be his crew but this last thing marked the final stage of preparation after this his mission began so youre serious about this you want to tattoo me looking over the device mor narrowed her eyes without markings you stand out like a freak among the people dariel head cocked prepared to take exception to this mor looked at him straightfaced no trace of humor on her feline features like a freak i say or a degenerate others who see you will think you a child who has done nothing in his life unworthy without signs of belonging nothing you say would change their opinion besides that plain face of yours will forever announce your akaran blood it could be the death of you among the people how about just drawing some spots or something stylus and ink that sort of thing its been explained to you already im sure should the divine children question you any stylus and ink work would be readily discovered no your fate has brought you herejust as mine brought me here the tattoos must be real why do i think youll enjoy doing it dariel asked smiling wryly because it hurts you mean she asked playfully innocent in a way dariel had never seen before dariel akaran when i wish to cause you pain it wont be with this ill find a real tool for it believe me i dont doubt you dariel thought i dont doubt you at all i still have the marks from our first meeting remember as she spoke on he had to tell himself to lower the edges of his grin he should not be so pleased about this the tattooing was going to hurt and it was going to be permanent what would corinn think when she saw him again if she ever saw him again she would never understand or approve of something like this it would seem an act of surrender of lessening himself and his stature as an acacian prince she would expect him to command them all to do his bidding the thought nearly made him laugh he had of course commanded many people in various rolesboth as an akaran and as a sea isle raiderbut this was different perhaps in a way that corinn would never understand increasingly the known world seemed far far away not just in leagues but in its hold on his thoughts sitting and talking with tunnel and skylene and some of the others caught up in the horror and largeness that was ushen brae dariel had to wrest his focus back to his homeland again and again it was in danger he knew of attack from the auldek he remained vague on how great that threat was but he tried to remember it and to think of corinn and mena and wren and all his companions from his raiding days and the common people he had come to know and care for while working on his rebuilding projects they mattered and he had to get back to them it will be your temporary pass mor said although the mark itself will not be temporary you may still fail us prince dariel but ive been told to give you the time and freedom to be among us its a chance not to fail after a pause she added i hope you dont dariel nodded never a skilled liar it was the best he could do to express his resolve in truth he had accepted the mission mor offered him for reasons of his own yes he would be part of a small team sent to steal a lothan aklun boat a soul vessel one had been found tied up at the southern end of the warehouse district the league had not yet noticed it probably because a series of skerriessmall rocky islandsblocked the area from the open ocean dariel would prove he was the raider he claimed to have been he would captain the vessel he would pilot it south to a marsh area called sumerled where they would ground the boat and set fire to it thereby denying it to the league andeven more importantfreeing the souls that had been bound to power it dariel had agreed to all of this readily enough to himself he swore that if he got the chance he would flee in the cutter he had no idea if he could really make the lothan aklun ship work and he realized the people themselves knew so little about the sea that they assumed things about his knowledge that they shouldnt have but so be it he would try he would pilot across the gray slopes in it if he had to or follow the coastline north and pick his way through the ice fields he would work out the details later but this might be his best chance at getting home he had to grasp it if he could what totem would you take mor asked sorting through the instruments on a small table i will take what you feel i deserve he said i dont know what you deserve if it was my choice i would wear the face of the shivith spots like yours you jest she said glancing up at him no dariel said he knew it sounded strange and he knew people would stare at him back in the known world but this he could answer truthfully i find the effect quite pleasing im not ready for whiskers just yet thanks some spots thoughif they look similar to yoursmight be interesting but as i said if that offends you choose another totem or someone else could do this instead of looking at him mor closed her eyes and absorbed his choice within herself as you wish and no ill do it she lifted the tattooing needle like a stylus in one hand and turned to face him a tiny bowl of black ash ink pinched in the fingers of her other hand this will hurt but pain is transitory only our legacy endures come sit here before me this will take a while dariel did as she asked she was right of course it did hurt and it did take a long time but every painful moment of it was tempered by the nearness of mors body by the scent of her and the fleeting moments when her elbow or wrist hip or breast brushed against him he tried to remember wren but it was hard when he pictured wrens face he saw it overlaid with tattoos indistinguishable from mors they were both from northern candovia after all by the giver he could not tell them apart anymore im sorry he whispered as she worked about the people not being able to have children i didnt know we should have asked im so sorry we didnt if we had i swear to you things would have been different by the way she paused it was clear to dariel that mor was considering what he said her only answer though was to continue piercing his flesh there she eventually said she picked up the bloodstained towel she had used throughout the procedure wet it in some liquid and used it to clean his face despite himself dariel flinched at each touch the liquid stung she stepped back from him setting down the needle of torture and contemplating her work she smiled so youre amused he asked she laughed into the back of her hand trying to squelch it holding up a mirror she said perhaps you should see yourself see how you look now and forever dariel reached out and accepted the mirror he turned it toward his face he expected to see a stranger staring back at him a beast perhaps something strange and perhaps frightening he expecteddespite the curious anticipation he feltto be frightened by what he saw and sickened by the permanence of it he was not in fact what are you thinking akaran mor asked that i make a fine shivith he said speaking his thought aloud mor made a sound low in her throat well see late the next afternoon he moved as one of a group of ten unbound completely now he followed skylenes slim form through the maze of subterranean passageways that had been his home for weeks this time he was not being shifted to another cell this time they came to a door opened it and stepped outside at first his eyes shot across the field beside them it had been a long time since he had taken in the open world from ground level the sky hung ominously huge above them rows of strange vegetablesbushes about a mans height that bristled with long arms each ending in a fistsized bud of some sortseemed to be marching toward him in military lines blinking it took him a moment to confirm that they were in fact stationary but a moment after that he detected movement coming from another quadrant the wall above him was alive with a sickening slithering unnatural motion the first sight of it made dariels skin crawl he stopped and stared up atwell it was hard for him to say at what the entirety of the long high structure seethed with limbs they were thorny tentacles many ten or fifteen feet long looking like the underbellies of a thousand giant octopuses reaching out with arms lit greenish orange by the dying days light for a breathless moment dariel thought them creatures that might rush down toward him snatch him up and tear him to pieces what are those dariel asked tunnel followed his eyes and took in the wall unimpressed plants he said you dont have plants over there not like those dariel said dont worry tunnel nudged him on the shoulder they wont eat you plants in the inland they may eat you but not these ones come they moved on along the wall undisturbed by the writhing limbs dariel stayed close trying to match the others composure failing at it they cut around buildings and ran through fields and climbed for a time over rooftops dariel had to keep his focus on his progress on the placement of his feet and hands and on keeping up with the others but he took in the panorama that was avina in quick glimpses enormous never ending it seemed buildings jutting up into the distance tunnel had sworn to him that ushen brae was a land of mountains that rose up straight out of great lakes of jungles that stretched from horizon to horizon with insects the size of antoks and flightless birds that hunted the free people in packs like wolves of arctic regions thronging with snow lions and white bears there were creatures out there so fierce that the auldek feared them beasts with massive jaws or stinging parts that could drain life after life out of them these animals he claimed were the reason that the auldek built coastal cities even though they turned their back to the sea tunnel admitted he had never seen any of these wonders or horrors himself but he hoped to one day dariel thought it sounded exciting dangerous in all the ways that set his boys fancy tingling twice the group had to split up to navigate crowded streets dariel walked beside tunnel on one occasion behind a young wrathic named birke on the other birke had no tattoo work that dariel could see but he did demonstrate the wolflike qualities of his clan totem with thick facial hair that covered his cheeks and forehead he also sported canine teeth so large they showed in bulges against his lips even when his mouth was closed they looked completely natural in a strange unnatural way when he smiledwhich he did first on seeing dariels new facial tattoos and then again after they had walked through a crowded thoroughfare and rejoined the group in the shadows of an alleyhe was simultaneously terrifying and hilarious dariel thought he might quite like the young man as a friend should he be provided the leisure of friendship again the sun had fully set and the sky had settled in to early evening dark by the time the group gathered in the corner of a warehouse dariel could smell the sea it was so near just a wall away he thought it smelled like freedom to him skylene sent birke and another man to check the last bit of the route to the destination the rest waited dariel found himself standing beside skylene she pressed closed to him closer than seemed necessary he knew why she was staring at his freshly tattooed face i cant get used to seeing you like that skylene said you look like one of us but i sat talking to you so long i know youre not one of perhaps im becoming one of you dariel cut in his face was still sore and he could not help but feel the touch of her eyes as a physical pain give me the chance at it at least skylene kept looking at him mor must have enjoyed doing that work did she make it hurt what do you mean of course it hurt smiling skylene said it doesnt if you chew kenvu root it deadens the sensations on the skin she touched a spot on his face with a fingertip makes the markings painless she didnt mention that no she didnt mention it dariel snapped whats wrong with her anyway does she just enjoy hurting me slapping me sticking me with needles insulting me every chance she gets is she like that always with others mor has been one of the free people for many years skylene said her problem is not cruelty its that she loves too much cares too much shes missing half her skylene stopped shook away whatever she was going to say instead she lightened her tone anyway she doesnt enjoy hurting anyone i think she likes you actually tell him tunnel said staying her give it skylene looked at him sharply well talk later please dariel said tell me what dont i know about her ah mor wants nothing for herself except one thing though she had committed it still took skylene a moment to continue she had a brother a twin named ravi they were taken together but were separated when they arrived in ushen brae so what shes looking for him in a manner of speaking yes he didnt become a slave he was eaten his soul was taken from him and given to an auldek mor wants to find him i dont know what she thinks she can do i dont think she even knows but they were twins understand they were in the womb together they are two halves of a whole she can feel that he goes on somewhere even though he lives in an auldeks body she wants to face him perhaps to release him now lets stop wasting time lets go theres birke lets be quick she pointed at the shadowy figure who had just reappeared at the far side of the warehouse he waved indicating that the area was free at least temporarily of divine children dariel asked no more questions he fell in step behind skylene with tunnel and the others behind him the rest of the journey was brief they walked for a time through a dark corridor then wove through another jumbled warehouse and finally stepped out onto a seaside dock the salt air off the water was wonderful dariel sucked it in loving the moist touch of the sea breeze on his face it instantly reminded him of val the man he met as a feeder of the palace furnace who later saved him from death in a lonely hovel and raised him to be a raider to love the sea his second father out beyond the edge of concrete pier the sea moved black and shimmering he caught the hulking jagged shapes of outcroppings of rock near shore through which water sieved jets of white foam burst up at regular intervals ghostly in the darkness frightening and full of danger perfect dariel told himself just as i like it just as val would like it wild dariel tunnel called to him from the edge of the pier come see it he jogged forward and looked down for the water was well below the level of the pier there tethered to a lower platform at water level was the boat a very peculiar boat similar to the sailless craft he saw slicing the water beside the ambergris out in the barrier islands walking down the ramp toward it his eyes took in every line and shape of it it was so sleek low to the water covered all over with that white coating particular to league ships it ran more than a hundred feet long but was narrower than any seagoing vessel he had seen before a water arrow the steering wheel was in a raised semienclosed structure near the back the others waited for him standing uneasily beside the rocking vessel seemingly at a loss this after all was where dariels expertise was supposed to take command as yet he had no idea how to make the thing work but that was a small detail certainly spratling could sail any vessel even one he hoped without a sail dariel inhaled a deep breath filled his chest with it and leaped across the narrow gap what began as a graceful move however did not conclude as one the slick surface of the deck shed the leather soles of his sandals so completely that he spent a few frantic seconds dancing as if unexpectedly thrown onto ice his arms wheeling he just managed to get down to his hands and knees where he paused breathing heavily the others watched him perplexed and more than a bit concerned its slippery he explained skylene squinted one eye raising the brow of the other dariel had felt the slippery surfaces of league ships before on sire fens league warship the rayfin and most recently the ambergris this one felt even slicker it may not have been so but he needed to keep his feet under him now more than ever remembering that some of the sailors on the ambergris had worked barefoot he sat and unlaced his sandals barefoot he rose to stand again it helped his skin clung to the coating in a way leather did not he almost felt he could squeeze the deck with his toes looking at the free people watching him he said as if impatient come on take em off and climb aboard inside the steering cabin a few moments later dariel gripped the wheel and said what powers this birke stood next to him wolflike waiting and then confused what do you mean whatwith the boats i know we use the sails and the wind to push the vessel across the water or we use oars at times understand there has to be something to provide the power but here is nothing butbut the wheel he stared at it as if his explanation made him even more confused about the situation wind birke asked his lip curled back exposing his canines he seemed to find the idea barbaric he waved until he got tunnels attention you use wind the power is in the boat just think it to do what you wish think it be serious what tunnel appeared fresh from organizing the others positioning them to best cast the boat off birke answered him speaking in auldek gesturing toward dariel tunnel brushed past him and grabbed dariel by the wrists he slammed his hands onto the wheel you brigand yes act like it hold the wheel drive the boat dariel began a sputtering protest but tunnel spoke over him i know youll do it he added the last sentence casually as he turned away he pulled birke with him alone seeing the motion on the deck below him feeling the rocking of the boat dariel realized that the prow had already been cast off it floated free of the dock these people know nothing of boats they think a boat moves because the pilot thinks it into motion this is a fools mission and im captain of it how about waiting for captains orders he shouted a few of the crew looked up perplexed dariel waved them away this apparently was read as a sign to cast off the other lines before he could stop them the entire vessel was loose and pulled by the outgoing tide looking over his shoulder he saw the jagged teeth of the nearby skerries no longer exciting terrifying instead he cursed to himself and then out loud to everyone they were about to be dashed against stone end of the mission and end of his hopes how had that happened so quickly i never said to cast off he yelled though it was a futile the crew had all they could handle keeping themselves from sliding off the deck especially as it began to roll more in the growing chop just think drive the boat by thinking he still gripped the wheel tugging it as if he would rip it off and then he realized how strange his hands felt on the wheel the material whatever it was hummed against his palms he half pulled back but his hands did not want to leave the thing it held him he could have jerked them away he knew that it was a gentle pull filled with energy it was waiting for him by the giver he mumbled the ship was waiting for him whatever was going to drive it was not in the motion of the air nor in the pull of oars against water it was in the vessel itself he felt it so clearly it was almost as if the boat spoke as much to him tunnel standing on the heaving deck drenched by the waves sending spray high into the air his arms outstretched for balance or in threat or both roared daarrriiiieeeeellllll drive it it was the prod the prince needed without loosening his grip on the wheel he craned his head around they were nearly upon the rocks they rode on the pull of water being sucked out to sea so forcefully that within a few seconds the stern would crash against the rocks with shattering force dariel imagined the prow of the ship slicing through the water his head flew back pulled by the force of the vessel being wrenched forward for a split second he believed it was the force of impact but in the next moment he realized there had been no impact the boat flew away from the rocks with a speed that amazed him he yanked his body back into position just in time to wrench the wheel to starboard so that the boat would not slam back into the pier the crew tumbled and slid about the deck grasping for holds all except tunnel who still managed to stand upright grinning and laughing and roaring with glee daarrriiiieeeeellllll rhuin fa rhuin fa the next few minutes of his life were as hairraising as any he had yet lived the boat was a wonder yes but he had so little control of it it responded to his thoughts but it was hard to remember to think constantly he would let his attention wander for a moment only to realize they were about to smash up against some rocks he would start to shout commands before realizing he had all the command he needed in his hands it should have been easy but he brought the vessel near to destruction a dozen times before they slipped out of the fingers of reaching stones and found deeper open water there he pressed the vessel forward they sped through the night the prow of the boat slapping down each time they came to a wave crest sending up spray had he ever sailed as fast as this he was not sure could not truly tell with the night so dark around them he did believe he could go even faster and longed to do so in the light of day with no fear of crashing into some outcropping of rock by the giver this is a ship this is a ship how could they destroy it it seemed a mad idea the power of it the things he could do with a vessel like this he could be spratling again but a spratling like the world had never seen before he would run rings around the league around anyone dont enjoy it too much skylene said he had not noticed her come up beside him remember why were here you cant still want to destroy this dariel said feel it this is a wonder do you know what i could we must destroy it why dariel asked because it is evil she leaned near him brushing his shoulder and spoke loud enough for only him to hear you believe its so wonderful because of the power within it but its what makes the power in it that is so horrible ships like this one they run on souls dariel the essence of children quota children thats whats trapped within them they burn souls think of a child sent into slavery think of that child tossed into the furnace of this boat firing it from the inside thats what this is i know its enticing evil often is she paused and then said you might want to slow he had been watching her profile as she looked forward he swung his head around and eased back as the prow dropped and some of the exhilaration of speed left him he saw what had prompted her for some time the long shadow of an island to the east had crept closer as they sped along it toward the south now from an inlet of the island came a blaze of light and motion it must have had a deep anchorage for a league brig nestled close to the shore lit up with blazing pitch lanterns small vessels ferried supplies and people ashore men worked on the docks unloading supplies even as they watched new lights flared in windows of buildings all along the shore the league it appeared was taking the place over what island is this dariel asked lithram len skylene said they must have just found it where the soul catcher is she nodded go slowly and pull us back nearer the mainland coast we should not be seen especially now the people need to know the league has found the island dariel sailed as she instructed he managed to cut behind a slim barrier reef that hid them for some time beyond it he increased speed as the glow receded behind them it was only then when he thought about something other than piloting the boat that he chewed over what he had just seen the league were on lithram len the soul catcher was on lithram len no he had never seen the thing himself but he had seen devoth shake off one deathpull an arrow from his heart and live on that was enough to make him believe in the device if they find the soul catcher chamber itself he thought and learn how to use it dariel drew up his face glazed by a thought so sudden that he forgot to see through his eyes or animate his features for a moment the vessel sensing the waning of his focus lost forward momentum the bow drooped and the stern rose and the rocking of the waves took them in its rhythm what is it skylene asked wait a minute dariel managed to say but that was as far as he got he had to think through the idea that had just gripped him it was a mad idea dangerous an idea that would have him dealing with forces he did not yet understand neither mor nor the elders had asked it of him and if he proposed it he would be asking the crewthese friends so new to himto risk their lives as well he should just drive his energy down into the boat and feel it surge forward continue this escape find a way to get the others ashore and then sail away without them go home tunnel bounded up from belowdecks why have we stopped why even think what youre thinking dariel asked himself when did their fight become yours he tightened his grip on the wheel and intended to answer tunnel by pushing the boat back into motion though he thought that his will was not behind it the boat continued to rock dead in the water others gathered near talking among themselves as they approached and then joining the hush of those waiting for him it had been so long since he had thought of a venture like this he could not help but think of val what had he said one of the last things he told dariel before sacrificing himself to destroy the league platforms ive been waiting to understand how best to say goodbye to the world now ive found it thats exactly it dariel felt something similar now not that he needed to say goodbye it was not death he felt near him but life real life a purpose that began here and might lead who knows where what if he began what if we dont take this boat to sumerled not just yet i mean what if instead we go to lithram len what if we destroy the soul catcher ourselves even if we have to fight the league to do it dariel skylene said there are only ten of us a perfect number who would expect it well catch them unaware you want war with the league a voicehe could not pinpoint whosesaid havent you known that was happening all along dariel asked theyve never done anything but make war on us on both sides of the oceanweve just been too dull to see it war with the league thats exactly what i want i fought them before but i didnt finish it with this acknowledgment he felt a sudden need to laugh mirth spilled out of him unexpected all consuming wonderful lets strike them first that seemed such a wonderful notion so very right it felt like the challenge he had been waiting for it was business unfinished and he was sure it was the start of the path to his fate he had never ever felt that so clearly what do you think lets fight them starting here and now well find a way i didnt plan this but weve seen what weve seen we have to do something about it the crew remained quiet all of them looking at one another considering dariel could not read them their altered tattooed and adorned faces seemed as expressionless as he had ever seen them even skylene gave him nothing tunnel did though he slapped one of his thick arms down on dariels shoulders pointing at skylene he said what did i tell you rhuin fa thats what tunnel said dariel rhuin fa c hapter f ortyfive corinn would have to reach all the way around the curve of the world and touch a mind that did not expect it but this should be within her powers dream travel she had witnessed it before she knew it could be done lying in bed beside hanish mein she had listened as he spoke across great distanceseven through the barrier between life and deathwith his ancestors the tunishnevre had been a spiteful coven of the undead with their own source of power one that came from the curse that had denied them true death and that curse had come from tinhadin santoth sorcery as such it should be within her power as well after all the tunishnevre when speaking to hanish had demanded he murder her they had failed they went to the real afterdeath instead as did hanish corinn still lived and ruled and had a son who then was more powerful this was but one of the myriad things that she held in her mind after the numrek uprising and the league of vessels declaration that a war was coming once more across the ice fields she had in a surprising way found a sort of pitching tumultuous equilibrium once she knew that aaden was safeand she did know that with enough certainty to put worry for him behind hershe rode the noise and confusion of unfolding events with a calm certainty much of this came from her realization that she had known something like this was coming all along she had known not to lower her guard she might have been tempted to forget it briefly lured by menas enthusiasm and graes attentions drawn even to notions of higher nobility in her rule thinking she might leave the people free of sedation and ways to bring some of alivers high ideals to life as much as she had held power grasped in one hand she had tried to loosen the clenched fist of her other hand that had been a mistake even the flexion of her fingers in considering the possibilities became an invitation to disaster that was why she had not been ready and had not seen the treachery standing right behind her for so long thats why aaden had nearly died unforgivable when faced with violence right before her eyes she did nothing but watch she was completely unprepared in that moment while mena fought corinn stood and stared that could never happen again she had been lax in her study spending time summoning furry creatures for aaden casting euphoria spells at banquets and creating flying insects foolishness even the water she fed into northern talay was done for the wrong reasons it was needed yes but she had enjoyed the approbation of the masses too much she had delighted in hearing herself called mother of the empire and what was that but a title she had commanded her people to use no the truth was she had been wasting time wasting power such neglect was completely and utterly unforgivable she swore that she would never be that weak again it amazed her that she had let slip so much of the strength that had helped her grasp power and steer the known world out of alivers war and back toward prosperity she had now to remember the person who had climbed to the throne nine years ago she had to be that person again tempered by experience mother to a child whom she would never never let come to harm part of this included determining the real extent of the threat coming toward them trust the leagues version of events hardly sire dagon could profess his complete and utter honesty until he went hoarse she needed to hear from other sources before she could decide how to act dream travel seemed the only possible way it was at least worth a try the first time she planned to attempt it she dismissed her servants and prepared her room herself she dimmed the lamps she lit sticks of incense and set a mixture of soothing herbs bubbling in fragrant citrusinfused oil she put on a formal dinner dress of dark green velvet with a high neckline and full sleeves lying on her back atop her bedspread she smoothed the folds of her dress out around her feeling unnervingly silly did one dream travel in ones garments naked or without a body at all she did not know if any of her preparations were necessary but she needed some sense of ritual something to occupy her as she gradually drew nearer the moment and what to do in that moment was another riddle she had yet to solve however hanish had dream traveled he managed it without true knowledge of the givers tongue perhaps he used some fragment of it or perhaps his success had a different explanation corinn had consulted the song of elenet with this question in mind as ever the words and music of the book had surged up to engulf her as ever she closed it knowing she had learned from it but incapable of putting her finger on the knowledge and examining it she slept for a time a fitful slumber in which she counted the passing hours eventually awake again she just lay calming her heartbeat letting her body go limp against the bedding she allowed herself to drift toward sleep again she focused her attention on her breathing no on the awareness that her thoughts were a thing different from her body housed in it yes but not contained not trapped she imagined her true essence floating up from her body and ah that did not work she lifted her fist and smashed it against the mattress in exasperation she sat up this was not the way it felt like something a fortune reader would instruct her to do some nonsense like when she pretended to be able to read symbols in her girlfriends mind as a child use the song she thought it all begins with the song she fell back against the bed inhaled called up the swirling music that was the givers tongue and very softly sang she did not entirely understand the notes and words and shapes of sound that came from her mouth but she knew the intent was right she wove them in with her hopes with the preparations she had already made trying to shape them even as she felt shaped by the song escaping her she lost herself in the effort at some point she realized the song was not on her lips anymore it was in her it was her and would travel with her she pushed her spirit up and out of her body floating free above the bed and then through the ceiling and beyond for a time she swam through air above the palace such a strange feeling she had an awareness of her physical form but she also knew how very incorporeal it was part of her lashed at the air with limbs that were not entirely there but that were not entirely absent ultimately it was thought not physical effort that moved her through space more than thought it was thought propelled by force of will for some time she flew from point to point above the palace slowly learning to feel the presence of souls sleeping and awake she found she could draw herself to some individuals simply by settling thoughts of them in her mind and then driving toward them thus she felt rhrennas sleeping presence and aadens she knew the bed in which delivegu slumbered not alone any of these she could have stirred awake but they were not her objective she aimed for a person much much farther away dariel she conjured every memory she had of him she held her thoughts of him until she had them within her contained like the seething balls of creation from which she built the creatures she summoned for aadens amusement the song helped her it gave shape to what she wished to do she took that swirling embodiment of memories and thoughts and images and emotions that to her were dariel and then she hurled them forward it was like tossing a great ball of energy a thing that hungered to be released she sped behind hooked to it shooting forward across the inner sea oh it felt good such speed she watched acacia recede as she passed between kidnaban and the cape of fallon before long the mountains of senival rumbled beneath her as if they were a herd of stampeding creatures wonderful such power and freedom she raced across the coast and farther until she forgot what she was doing her progress slowed for a few moments she felt the force that had been pulling her casting about in one and then another direction then it simply stopped in a spirit form immune to the cold or fear corinn hung in the air high above the gray slopes below her the ocean moved in unending undulation watching it she knew the waves gave life to all the earth she knew looking down that there could be no more horrible thing than a dead sea it meant a dead earth by why am i thinking that im here for a reason im searching for her eyes snapped open she gasped a breath so loud she thought for a moment that she screamed it out sitting up on her bed in her gown the air heavy with incense smoke she realized she had failed dariel she had been flying toward dariel driven by her thoughts of him scorching toward whatever place or fate in the world identified him but then the energy that propelled her realized it did not know where to go she should have been able to find him but there was no scent no trail not even an intuitive feeling for where to head at some point there was nothing that was why she had stopped somewhere out above the slopes if her brother was out there she had no power to find him dariel she said in speaking his name she felt a strange dread certainty that she would never see him again neither in life nor through the song the following day passed much the same as the one that preceded it one appointment after another one function before another her last official meeting that afternoon was with paddel the head vintner of prios she kept it short not wanting to look too long at his heavily jowled redcheeked face he sat at the far end of the table from her as unattractive as ever squeezed into a black jacket that was so tight he could barely move his chubby arms she did not sit through all of his fawning praiseladen greeting since last we spoke have the trials of the vintage continued to go well yes of course better than well see here the reports he fumbled with his papers rising to bring them to her just tell me this corinn said she signaled with disdainful fingers that he should stay seated it works as efficiently as you thought before it lifts their spirits gives them a feeling of bliss and yet does not dull minds quite so one might almost say it sharpens and once they taste it they will forever crave it the man nodded vigorously what happens if they are deprived of it theres no reason that they should be deprived of it we have vast stockpiles of the raw ingredients we have enough to last us until we win or lose the coming struggle thats good but again what happens when they are deprived of it you said before that they will do anything to get itbut if they cannot get it what happens to them how long until they recover the nodding stopped paddels mouth puckered a stupid expression that corinn wanted to slap away i dont know we didnt deprive any indefinitely they were sohe grinned and lifted his shoulders a gesture meant to indicate that surely she understood this pointinsistent and so pleased when they had access to it again why deprive them the scowl on corinns face stayed constant that annoys me paddel she said to herself you should have researched this area instead of taking so much personal pleasure from it it was too late now to conduct more tests she had waited too long already let it be done send word to your people she said release the vintage yes he asked excited his mouth now like that of a dog panting in expectation do you mean it i just said it so obviously i mean it how quickly can you distribute it oh quickly indeed the main warehouse is in prios of course but in preparation for your order weve shifted stock to danos alecia bocoum we even had a storage facility in denben we can send word by messenger bird and have crates riding south toward interior talay by tomorrow evening and across west to tabith which will give us the entire slopes coastline the possibilities took his breath away he stammered on for a time and then realizing something looked at corinn with new admiration you are so wise to have arranged this your majesty she showed no pleasure in the compliment instead she flicked her fingers to indicate that he should leave before he reached the door she stopped him one final thing do conduct the test when one is addicted and is deprived indefinitely what happens find out later in her offices with rhrenna corinn closed out the days business the meinish woman read from the meticulous notes she kept detailing a variety of points achieved and yet to be faced on the morrow listening to her voice soothed corinn much of what she said conversely did not wren has petitioned for an audience with you i told her the timing was ill but said i would put the request to you wren corinn exhaled dariels concubine pregnant and growing plumper every day though corinn avoided speaking to her she caught glimpses of the girl often enough her narrow eyes always seemed to be waiting for corinn fixed on her before she had realized they were going to make eye contact she was pretty indeed a northern candovian one of those slim athletic women upon whom a baby is but a shapely bump that adds to her attractiveness a moon to be caressed i cant see her now shed likely ask me to acknowledge her child as dariels it is dariels yes but im not at all sure that i want to declare that right now tell her im too busy if she likes she could retire to calfa ven ill send physicians she could have the baby there in peaceful seclusion i already felt her out about that your majesty she would rather be here in the palace fine corinn said a little coldly as she wanted to close the subject but shell have to wait for an audience rhrenna nodded and noted this on her documents watching her downtilted face corinn remembered that she once thought meinish women uniformly bland of appearance too pale thinskinned with finely drawn features that had a coldness in keeping with their frigid nation at the time she had thought it ironic considering that the men of the same race had been striking especially hanish looking at rhrenna now she realized that her feelings about meinish women had never been accurate yes their features were as described but they had their own style of beauty what had kept her from seeing it was jealousy fear that hanish might one day choose one of his own over her forgetting the annoyance of a moment before corinn acknowledged a very different emotion instead rhrenna im sorry the secretary looked up and studied her for what was this folly to admit a crime and wish it otherwise no she did not think so for what i did to your people oh rhrenna cleared her throat looked back at the documents we werent innocents i know you knew all the time didnt you all the time that we rode together and i showed you the ways of court and we were young togetherall through that time you knew that hanish might one day sacrifice me to the tunishnevre rhrenna drew in on herself she pulled her gaze in head down as she stared at the papers on her lap her blond hair fell around her i never wanted that to happen but you knew it might im not chastising you you are closer to me now than my sister is perhaps i love the blood you share with hanish maybe thats why i feel so close to you for some reason i know that the fact that you would have betrayed me then means that you wont now or ever again am i right the young womans head bobbed you are right i know it corinn said she folded her hands in her lap and inhaled a long breath something about doing so made her feel she had sucked in rhrennas promise and owned it when this is over and were at peace again i will lift the ban on entering mein tahalian theres no reason it shouldnt be opened again lived in again theres every reason it should actually if i did that would it please you rhrenna sat as if she were still studying the pages before her but her gaze had drifted off slightly unfocused i dont think i could live there again maybe if i lived to old age id return but im not sure i think some others would though i know some want that very much it wouldnt be the same of course there are too few of us left but i know some mein who would take their families back to tahalian even their mixed families theyd pry off the beams that seal it open the steam valves and heat the place it could never be the same but it would be good for life to fill the place again i would like to believe that an entire culture cant just be forgotten this time it was corinn who took a while to respond though she had begun the conversation it surprised corinn to realize that rhrenna had truly thought about this before she had even spoken to other mein about it a culture forgotten what a strange idea to corinn it had always been the opposite she had feared the world would remember the mein too well feared that they might yet have some power some way to shape the world hanish so often haunted her thoughts how could he not when he so clearly lived on in aaden the meinin her own mind at leastwere far from being forgotten that had seemed a problem before now however she sometimes wished she had not ordered hanish killed perhaps there could have been some way for them to live together what a powerful pair they would have been rulers for the ages outside a bone whistle announced the advancing hour other flutists and pipers picked up the melody and spread it down from the palace toward the lower town corinn listened until the music faded into the distance reminded by it just how tired she was rhrenna she said i am not going to destroy it all you believe that dont you the answer came back to her with welcome speed yes your majesty i believe that that night after visiting aaden and singing healing into his sleeping form corinn tried to dream travel again she waited even later than the night previous and she aimed for a different target this time dariel might not be reachable maybe dead or perhaps the connection would never snap tight between them she tried not to think too much about it think only until you know what to do then act this time when her spirit lifted and pulled free of the shell of her body and began the long flight through the dark night it was another mans name she screamed out before her racing behind it this one surprisingly easily she found her feet did not exactly touch the floor in the room but she did reach stillness at the foot of a sleeping mans bed his face was hidden beneath a cushion his arms thrown wide he looked like a man recently suffocated but the nasal grinding of his breathing testified to his continued life wake she said a form rolled in the sheets and then settled still again nothing more wake corinn instilled all her will in the command and this time a shape pulled away from the physical form hidden beneath the blankets she could not have said whether the image was clothed or nakedno more than she could have detailed the same about herself he simply was as he was many details of his form blurred were unsteady or translucent at the same time other identifying features showed clear thin shoulders bewildered muffled and ill at ease in a way that would have been expressed by disheveled hair on a physical body but was now a part of the impression of the spirit his face droopy and dull eyed was just as she remembered just as gape mouthed how bizarre that she could reach around the world in spirit form and still find rialus neptos to be well rialus neptos queen corinn he asked she did not answer she looked around the room she could not have said what she would have expected but a grand bed was not part of it nor a chamber with finely constructed furniture wall hangings rugs so thick they must suck at the toes of one walking across them rialus had no finer quarters in acacia her eyes settled back on him this i find very strange she said his head snapped around from side to side taking in the same sights she just had at double the speed this isahdifficult to explain corinn wanted to ask him to do so but she knew her connection with him could not last long she already felt the fatigue of being so far from her body felt the pull back toward it and knew that it would grow stronger with each passing moment and she knew somehow that she was in danger like this if anythingor anybodysnipped the long thread that connected her to her corporeal self she could be lost forever dead even if her body lived for a time in a long sleep rialus neptos she said cutting into his stammering explanation wanting to be direct and calm so that he would be as well is dariel alive dariel ah just answer each question i ask you do no more or less just answer is dariel alive i dont know rialus thought for a moment idont think so there was a terrible battle at you can tell me nothing of him no i wish i could but corinn flared with impatience she realized from rialuss expression and from how the room snapped into greater focus that the intensity of her emotions showed she had his attention again waiting are the auldek planning to attack the known world how did you know that answer yes rialus said yes theyre brutes your majesty not like the numrek i mean not really theyre more dignified do you know they keep beasts like white lions in their palaces just let them walk around like they own rialus in the givers name do no more than answer my questions she gave him a moment of staring intensity to come to terms with this and then asked how great a threat are they very id say they have a large army yes but its not just size that matters they have some terrible creatures antoks and things worse and the auldek cannot be killed cannot be killed well not exactly cannot he fumbled for a way to explain it and then seemed puzzled that he was even doing so looking at her anew he asked am i really talking to you this is so odd corinn flared brighter than ever let me see their army what do you mean think it make a picture of the things you have seen and things you imagine you will see make all those things in your minds eye and i will take them from you he did and she did the images were blurry shadowed overlapping and without context or explanation but she saw vast numbers of soldiers in animal guise she saw beings similar to numrek being chopped down and then rising again and again as if impervious to mortal injury she saw the ranks of an army of men and creatures giants and winged things she saw tramping feet and hulking forms unlike anything in the known world she heard the bellowing of angry beasts and rhythmic chants of war songs so many of them that they faded into shadow in the distance like a neverending parade of demons finally escaped from entrapment and hungry for plunder it was all that she needed to see one more thing rialus neptos she said once she had drawn back and could speak again have you betrayed us the man could hardly have conveyed as much shocked indignation with his real body as he did with contortions of his spirit face no never you must prove the truth of that if you have any honor rialus neptos you will find a way to serve me if you wish to see your wife again you will find a way to serve me understand corinn asked the question but she did not manage to stay long enough to hear his answer she could no longer resist the call back to her body early the next morning corinn summoned her secretary she instructed her to have rialuss wife gurta sent to calfa ven for the duration of the coming conflict put her under my royal protection ah so shes a prisoner rhrenna said she is heavily pregnant you know but ill arrange for her every comfort corinn then called in a bevy of scribes and told them to prepare a dispatch for transport by bird she spoke a message to be sent to the governors and chief officials of each province to the senate in alecia and to a host of other important figures who needed to hear the news first she confirmed the truth of the leagues claim an enemythe auldekdid march against them bringing with them horrible creatures and an army in the tens of thousands among them were many quota childrenwarriors now and with hearts hardened against acacia they were the greatest threat the known world had ever faced if they did not unite and defeat them all would perish battle against the numrek was in comparison just a diversion prepare your people she paused looking over the bent heads of the scribes listening to the scratch of so many styluses against parchment a few of them completed writing and lifted their tools rhrenna asked is that all of it corinn shook her head waited until all the scribes were ready for more tell your people she said that the law of quota which has been in effect since tinhadins time is now revoked as of today no more children of the known world will be sent to the other lands let the people know this invite them to drink the vintage of prios in celebration hear me again the quota is abolished c hapter f ortysix kelis kept thinking he should dig for knuckle root his eyes scanned the dry land for the tiny shrubs that marked them surely they needed to suck the moisture from knuckle root how else could they survive he stood in the mornings sniffing the moving air for moisture for any indication that water lay more in one direction than another nor could he help but tilt his head and listen to any animal sound a call at night a scurrying nearby several times he caught mice with his hand net only as he looked into their trembling frantic eyes did he realize he had no desire no need to eat them once he went so far as to skin a sand snake dry the meat with the heat of the sun and then he sat disgusted by it knowing that neither he naamen nor benabe could stomach such fare this must be santoth magic he thought nothing else explains it almost four weeks since shen and leeka had disappeared he knew because he had counted the days he had right he had scratched the growing number on the dry skin of the back of his hand twentyeight days but it felt much longer it might have been an entire lifetime he might be ancient now everything in the known world might have changed be unrecognizable or for that matter he and the two souls with him might be the only people left on the curve of creation everything else seemed so distant and clouded by time and blurred unreal even events he knew himself to have been a part of struck him as mythic hunting foulthings with princess mena akaran watching aliver akaran dance to his death with maeander mein standing in awe as sorcerers screamed rents into the land dropped worms from the sky and blasted men into vapor kelis a hand gripped his shoulder and shook him naamen leaning down before him looking close into his face his kindly eyes so tired now are you with us he did not wait for an answer we should not let benabe sit alone too long she speaks to herself ah she speaks to herself he had heard those words before naamen had said them before this and he had responded to them in a certain way it was a game between them a way to keep sane by joking about insanity what had he said so do you naamen smiled that was what he wanted to hear no i speak to the winged goat and the boy with cat eyes and my longdead mother thats different of course kelis said rising to his feet my error he draped an arm around the other mans shoulder and together they walked toward the woman who had become the center of their lives right after shen disappeared benabe had been frantic her wail became a scream of rage and loss she ran into the space that the swirling shapes had occupied her arms flailing as if she had hooks on them that she was desperate to sink into flesh for a moment as she lashed the air kelis almost believed the power of her fury could tear through into whatever realm the shapes had escaped to but she did not and the moment passed and eventually benabe lowered her arms and stood panting kelis called her her eyes when she looked at him were burning with anger the hatred she had just directed at the air she turned on him she battered him back and then down to one knee asking him over and over why he had brought them here why hadnt he protected shen why had he let that madman take her daughter why she would have hurt him if naamen had not gripped herwith strong and weak arm bothand pulled her away by the next day however benabe made use of her anger instead of directing it at kelis she organized the manner in which they were to search for shen the first week they took turns marching in daylong treks one of them always stayed at the exact site from which shen had disappeared while the other two walked out in different directions calling her name into the dead silent expanse around them though kelis had lived in talay almost all his life and had explored much of the dry expanse of the continent he had never seen a land so empty of life before yes there were beings out there hiding like the few small animals he caught but the effect of the place was to highlight how vastand how vastly emptyit was he knew that there was an end to the southern reaches of talay of course there was ships sailed the turbulent waters below it and came back north dariel had done that league vessels made the journey regularly he knew this but standing on the flat expanse staring south kelis saw nothing nothing nothing but a parched skin stretching to the horizon and promising more of the same beyond if the santoth had her they had taken her to a place he could not see or hear or reach he tried to remember the things aliver had told him of the ancient sorcerers but he could recall so little sometime in the second week benabes grief shifted form instead of driving her to action it exhausted her she sat still throughout much of the day staring into the empty space before her with glazed eyes on occasion she shot to her feet casting about asking whoever was with her if he had heard shen had they heard her she ran out in one direction calling shen only to turn back a moment later and run the other way tracing loop after loop until kelis or naamen grabbed her then she dropped back to the ground sobbing mumbling that she had heard her daughters voice kelis and naamen took turns sitting with her as the other continued searching neither found any sign of the girl at all their own footprints crosshatched the sand for miles around them testifying to their efforts never did they find a print of anyone else in the third week benabe began speaking to herself she had very little to say to her two companions but she held long discourses she spoke in words yes in sentences but they did not add one on to another to form anything that he could make sense of about the only time he did understand her was when he stepped too close and she said move your shadow as she did on the morning that naamen woke him from his own circular knot of thoughts kelis realizing he had broken one of the rules of their scant interaction sidestepped so that his shadow did not fall across any part of her body at least this had not changed at least she remained aware enough of the world to notice the change in the light caused by his presence that was something should we take her north naamen asked a little later the two men stood a short distance from her whispering we cant stay here can we well die here i want shen back too but nothing that weve done shows that we can find her we dont have the power we should get benabe back to bocoum before she loses her mind completely its her decision to make kelis said we cant take her against her will if she wishes its her right to die here the man rubbed his stunted arm with the palm of his normal one what of my rights he asked but then hurried to explain away anything callous in the question i dont wish her ill i so badly want to have shen back to have benabe back as she was i would do anything to make that happen but days and days pass and were powerless the santoth would not have taken her without a reason and what if that reason is evil how can we know they didnt lure her here just to dont kelis cautioned say those words and benabe will hear them both men looked at her sitting as she had been before mouth moving naamen theres no reason for you to stay go north tell sangae whats happened naamen wrinkled his lips and said with a resignation touched by humor i dont think so if youre staying im staying i want to make sure you get through this you promised a good race after all this is over im going to hold you to it so the two stayed on into a fourth week passing the days much as before they did not range quite so far anymore but they waited and kept their shadows from falling on benabe and waited some more and then came the morning when keliss eyes fluttered open to take in a predawn sky the heavens were a dark shade just the purple side of black alive with stars to the west slightly yellowed by the coming sun to the east lovely and quiet no hyenas cackling or lizards scurrying no bird or insect calls certainly not a sound from another human being just a sublime forgiving stillness he lay like that for some time watching feeling more relaxed than he had in days and days only very very gradually did he realize that the touch of small hands on his was part of what was soothing him and after that realization some moments more passed before it occurred to him to wonder how this could be who was holding his hand he turned to look a young girl sat beside him watching him his hand clasped in her lap hi the girl said she smiled shen whats happening tell me im not dreaming youre not dreaming the girl said and no he wasnt that became clear he had not felt so clearheaded in weeks he stared at the girl studying her features her skin right there before him her round face and thoughtful eyes it was kind of you to wait here she said her words were alive in the air between them clear as they ever had been during their long march down into the far south he felt the breath of them on his face as he felt the warmth of her hands the moisture where their skin touched i thought we might have to search for you your mother would not leave he heard himself say she said you would return and if she was not here for you she would not forgive herself shen smiled again i tried to speak to her sometimes but it didnt work well i think i just made her upset i didnt mean to though shes a good mother i told the santoth that didnt i leeka as soon as the name was out kelis saw a shape standing a little distance away a lurking shadow that made him quickly sit up it had not been there a second before shen stopped him from rising farther and in the pause he realized it was leeka alain clothed just as before head cloaked and just as eerily still had she called him into existence just by saying his name the hooded figure nodded his voice a whisper that came from the blackness where his face should be you did kelis dont be frightened of him its just leeka he only looks scary shen patted his hand how long has it been how long have you been waiting a few weeks no a month one month today the girl nodded face grave suddenly we must hurry then time is short i should explain to you so that youll know and not be frightened and so that you can help me explain to my mother so that she wont be frightened naamen too he will come with us also i want you to hear first though all right kelis nodded good are you ready dont be afraid the santoth are here with me look she cocked her head just enough to indicate a vague area over her left shoulder just as with leeka the beings she named snapped into existence kelis did not see them materialize they were just there when they had not been a moment before the figures stood bunched together hooded vague shapes that the rising sun cast in highlight and shadow seeing them kelis felt his heart pound they looked like an army of assassins standing immobile and yet shifting even in their stillness not entirely of this world he tried to number them but he lost count each time numbers did not seem to stick to them not so many not so few oh why did they just stand there he would have said they were waiting for something but waiting was not the right word they were eating each moment impatient they pulsed with energy contained through force of will they were hungry andkelis knewthey would not wait long what do they want he asked shen stared at them as well though her expression was calm lips puckered in an almost wistful expression they asked me to release them from exile she said and i did you could do that the girl smiled yes silly they asked me the same thing they thought i had to be a boy to do it but they were wrong shen what do they want they are danger shen they were exiled for horrible i know they showed me i saw it all those things that happened long agowith tinhadinit wasnt like the old tales say i saw it and its different she frowned exhaled through her nose looking so very adult and so childlike at the same time the words to continue seemed hard for her to find touching her fingers to her forehead she said they put the knowledge in my head i cant explain it all to you right now but the important thing is that we need them back in the world you know the song of elenet the santoth know when its being read they can feel it for many many lifetimes it went unread it was silent to them they feared it was lost even my father could not find it but that was before its been found kelis someone has been reading it studying it for the last few years for all the years of my life you know who yes my aunt queen corinn i saw the canals she filled with water in bocoum heard tales of the things yes thats part of the problem she is doing things without understanding the consequences consequences the wordand the yawning things it might meanseemed too big for her small mouth what consequences like the foulthings looking slightly impatient shen glanced back at the santoth signed to them with her hands then turned back to kelis they want us to start moving they know how slow we are i cant tell it all to you some things i dont have words for yes the foulthings are part of it the santoth made those themselves and they regret it but they say the beasts are nothing compared to the curses corinn could unleash every time she takes from one place and puts in another place she leaves a scar between the two others of the song can use those scars to enter the living world others of the song kelis shen said placing a hand on his shoulder like a mother might to a child the santoth werent the only sorcerers ever thrown down or banished there were others there were evil ones like the five disciples of reelos there were early mistakes of elenet there are sorcerers from other worlds the giver created some of themespecially if they put their ears to the scarscan hear corinns singing too some of them have already begun speaking to her gaining strength from her she may not even know it but the santoth believe she has opened doors it is only a matter of time before things step through those doors into this world thats why we must go to acacia speak to my aunt let the santoth study the book and prepare to face whatever is coming shen exhaled i think thats enough for now are you ready its a long walk kelis could not imagine what to say better that he be practical we should wake your mother and naamen shes not going to like this shen said speaking through a crooked grin she pushed herself to her feet looking over at her mothers form wrapped tight in a blanket ill wake her with a kiss that will be nice wont it he nodded and watched the girl walk away again revealing herself to be the child she was light on her feet and small so small but what was in store for her a little distance away leeka stood immobile face hidden though his body turned to follow the child and a little farther when kelis swung his gaze toward them were the sorcerers immobile and yet seething with motion watching them all impatient c hapter f ortyseven mena found the note beside her on the bed when she awoke seeing the square of paper she knew exactly what it was and the knowledge twisted her heart melio it meant he was gone probably afloat already on one of the early transports sailing from acacia for the teh coast a cruel trick for he had given no sign that he would leave her like this when they spoke last night nor when they made love just hours ago he had said not a word when she yet again washed herself clean of his seed or perhaps he had the night before naked against him still breathing hard from the conclusion of their lovemaking she spoke as if it were just another night true she did touch on the bizarre realities of their life but these were topics they turned over many times all this that were doing she had said in so many ways it feels unreal i live it yes i do it i slay monsters and ride a winged lizard and lead armies to battle its strange though when i step back and imagine how others will hear this story thats what it is you know its a tale from the distant past its edifus and tinhadin its hauchmeinish its the forms before they were forms how is my killing maeben or slaying the foulthings any more probable than the priest of adaval slaying the wolfheaded guards of the rebellious cult of andar there were twenty wolfheaded guards for one thing you had much safer odds mena nudged him be serious even if people forget the priest of adaval they will not forget mena akaran not maeben not the slayer who flies with beauty not the warrior princess who beat back the savage numrek such things cant be forgotten had they said more yes she believed they had strange though that they had managed to speak of mundane things she had described a dream she had had in her childhood one in which she and a girl had tried to catch fish with nets he had claimed he never dreamed saying life was strange enough for him by far they had talked nonsense about which were worse the bites from mosquitoes in senival or those of the black flies of the aushenian spring at some point mena had rolled away from him and without thought out of habit really went to perform the brief ritual of cleaning her sex and washing away his seed with the herb mixture he so hated perhaps it was at that moment that he parted with her for when she slipped back into bed he turned away without comment or protest his breathing had been steady though not yet that of sleep and she had chosen to wrap an arm around him and hook her ankle over his and share the silence that silence though may have been different to him than it was to her the note she held pinched between the fingers of her two hands testified to that m you were right about everything of course i was slow to learn but i know it now m she knew the words by heart for she had written them to melio almost ten years earlier it was the note she had written him and below it the same postscript i love you if ever the world allows it ill prove it to you exactly what she had written just after returning from killing maeben on uvumal and just before she gave herself up to maeander mein on that occasion she could not face saying goodbye to melio there was too much uncertainty before her everything in the world at risk and she had not been sure that she would be able to face it if he asked her not to she penned the letter and set it beside him and snuck away on silent feet cowardly in many ways hurtful in others and yet the things she wrote to him were completely true he had been right she had been slow she did love him and wanted to prove it someday how to interpret this newer version of the same was he making the same promises to her no because he had no need to prove himself he had never failed her in any way or was he reminding her of the things she once promised and had failed thus far to deliver yes she thought so there was only one thing more she could have done to prove her love to him and she had held off doing it year after year after year she deserved to be reminded of it if it really was meant to remind her of her note to him she understood and if the world allowed her another chance she would not fail to give her all to him she would prove her faith in him if not in the goodness of the world if that was her refrain for the morning by the afternoon she had taken on another shes only my sister mena told herself time and time again i dont fear my sister the fact that she repeated this a hundred times as she walked to answer corinns summons rather belied the assertion when mena entered her office corinn stood behind the chart table studying the array of maps and documents displayed there she looked up distracted for a moment and then calmed her features mena im sorry that melio has had to leave i know that must be hard for you mena cleared her throat finding the opening kindness somewhat disconcerting thank you she said we are coming to times of great sacrifice corinn said much will be asked of all of us much taken from each of us you may believe though that melio will be in my prayers just as much as you are sister just as much as dariel is corinn did not give mena time to fumble through a response to that she came around the table but instead of approaching mena she moved off to the side slightly stopping beside another table i want you to have this the kings trust it is your blade now no one deserves it more than you the kings trust she did not know whether she wanted that blade too ancient too much history tempered in blood if the legends of it were true tinhadin himself had infused it with santoth sorcery making it a blade that learned from each contest it fought and took something from each person it killed hadnt tinhadins grandson used it to execute prisoners something he wished to do personally and with only this sword i have a blade mena said your marah sword is special to you i know corinn acknowledged i know well the tale of how you crawled out of the sea with it strapped to your wrist and became that bird god of yours maeben and true perhaps the blade is a blessing to you youve certainly accomplished much with it but thisshe motioned as if to direct menas attention to the ancient sword something she did not need to do because her eyes were already fixed on itthis is the very blade that edifus wielded with his own hand at carni its stained with his blood look there on the hilt that blackened area that is the blood of the kings hand im sure you know the details better than ihow he almost lost his hand when he caught a foes blade pinched in his grip menas fingers itched a real physical sensation of their own accord they wanted to wrap around the stained hilt and slip the blade free thats what her body cried to do she held back she put one hand to her chest felt for the eel pendant beneath the fabric of her shirt she pressed it there must be awful power in this sword for the look of it was nothing special old battered within a simple scabbard with few ornaments and yet something in her so wanted to pull the blade free the last time she had touched that blade was in the hours after alivers death she had picked it up only long enough to wrap it in a burlap cloth and stow it snugly with the kings possessions when next she spoke of it she gave other soldiers instructions on how to care for it and return it to acacia safely since then she had had no wish to handle it again why do you stand there gaping at it corinn asked a touch of annoyance in her voice its a great gift its mine to give and i offer it to you as a demonstration of my faith in you you are worthy of it pick it up this last was an order no other way to interpret the tone despite herself mena grasped the scabbard midway down the hilt and lifted it horizontal before her do you accept it yes mena said and then specified for now ill take it into safekeeping and use it if i must one day though ill return it to you so that you can give it to aaden its rightfully his that seemed to please corinn good yes good on both counts she nodded with that confirmation mena laid the sword down again now corinn said sharpening the edge on her voice i give you this sword for a reason you have a mission mena i can trust it only to you even if our brother were with us this task would go to you you more than dariel are the wrath that drives the akaran sword hand you will soon have to make use of it she paused looking frankly at mena i would have used this language no matter what but since seeing you fighting the numrek i mean it with much more sincere certainty thank you for what you did mena i had only heard of your feats i believed in them but i didnt understand them now i think i do a little at least of all the many personsgenerals and foot soldiers marah and warriors from around the provinceswho had praised her martial abilities none had ever touched her with quite the sense of pride corinn just did i have received firsthand intelligence that the auldek will begin their march during their own winter theyre timing it that way so that even if they suffer in the early weeks theyll still have solid ice on which to cross the frozen seas above the ice fields comparing that with league reconnaissance we estimate that if they are unchallenged they could arrive on the mein plateau by midsummer thats so soon mena said yes too soon look at these charts with me she motioned mena nearer when they stood side by side corinn drew her finger up along the western coast of the known world from the lakelands north along the ice fields and beyond the boundary that had normally bordered acacian maps i proposed a way to delay them a small force could hold them for some time along the pass through which they will likely traverse from their lands into ours its a narrow strip of land all of it mountainous if they would sail they could bypass it but the auldek fear the sea so theyll have to thread their entire force through a series of narrow passes it wouldnt be easy in any event but i plan for us to make it very much harder indeed she is sending me to my death mena thought for a moment she pondered whether that should offend her was it a bigger crime to send a sibling to her death or did it show a sort of valor on her part perhaps youll even repel them perhaps youll decide the war right there in the far north that would give the singers something to bray about wouldnt it mena nodded thats what her sister wanted her to do thats what her queen expected of her andthough she still didnt entirely understandshe felt powerless to deny her what else could she do in the face of corinns certainty well arrange a meeting tomorrow with all those on acacia who can advise you but youll need to leave soon very soon ive arranged a sloop for you leaving three days hence to carry you first to denben then youll go by land along the tabith way by the time you arrive there your main generals will have gathered and soon youll head north your troops will mostly be candovian though im putting out a call for volunteers with the promise of considerable rewards for those who accept maybe some of dariels raiders will join you theyre supposed to like a good fight arent they she smiled these are just sketches of the details tomorrow you can ask all the specific questions you like and have them answered i know how much i ask but whom can i ask but she whom i trust most menasisterakaran do you accept this mission of course mena said youve left me no choice really corinnsisterakaran wonderful corinn said smiling radiantly make the brutes regret they ever left home i know you will she rounded the desk again her fingers trailing over the papers there as she did thinking the meeting over mena turned to leave by the way corinn asked in a matteroffact tone what will you do with elya while you are gone i dont know as i said before she is not built for war i corinn interrupted her thats become clear to me i hope you know that she is welcome to stay here nothing would make me happier in fact really that mena had not expected really of course corinn stepped around the desk and extended her hand fingers beckoning unsure mena lifted one of her hands and let her sister grasp it she did save aadens life after all mena i was wary of her the way you arrivedquite frightening really i thought she might hide some corruption just below the surface but ive seen no sign of it at all and she more than proved herself by what she did for aaden i may just grow to love her as you do and aaden you know how he adores her it would do him so much good to have her here to greet him when he awakes one fine thing within all this madness do say that youll let her stay here she may reside in your courtyards just as she has been doing mena tried to think quickly through the possible implications of this what about the eggs she suspected they would not hatch for some time she did not know this but it felt that way the eggs gave off an air of contentment of peace as elya had when she stood watching wideeyed and trusting as mena gazed at them she felt they would hatch when the time to hatch was right considering that might it not be better to keep them secret longer corinn may have been struck with sudden fondness for her but it was as yet a new fondness better that it grow more substantial and it would it will if she lived weeks with elya and saw her become more and more important to aaden well then she would know for sure and the eggsor the hatchlingswould be welcomed as the blessings they would be perhaps ill even be back to see it happen let the giver make that so that sounds like its for the best mena said elya may follow me for a while when i first sail she wont fully understand but ill explain what i can to her im confident she will choose to stay in the palace a thought flickered across corinns face but it disappeared so fast mena could not read it the queen said that would be perfect that all sounds just perfect c hapter f ortyeight sire dagon met the others of the league council in a darkened chamber of the league compound in alecia a light distillation of green mist clouded the air moving in ghostly swirls on the air currents the first rank of leaguemen sat in a tight circle each of them leaning back in an intricate reclining chair beyond the first ring there was a second and a third and beyond that the nonspeakers huddled close listening at meetings like this only the first three circles could speak freely and they all did so without really seeing the others it could take a long time between the asking of a question and an answer especially as the groups mistdrenched state meant that they shared a certain linkage of thought their minds hummed like tuning forks that spread the same note among them they had separate minds yes but it wasin the council chamberimpossible for any of them to deceive the others events did not proceed as we expected sire dagon admitted our intelligence about the auldek was partial flawed im afraid an answering rumble of voices reverberated in the dim chamber of the league council you speak in understatement sire graus voice had an unusual clarity to it a cadence untroubled by the tremulous effects of his advanced years dagon recognized what powered it flames of anger stirred up from the slow embers that usually fueled him neen saw what he wished to see not the actual truth he acted on what he wanted to believe driven by emotion blind to the flaws of his actions rarely has a leagueman made such grave mistakes sire grau sat beside dagon in the first circle neither man looked at the other usually the mist had a calming effect enough so that they conducted all council businessno matter how fractiouswith heavylidded calm on this occasion dagon felt an increased level of clarity in his own mind calmed not at all by the unease surging through the chamber in waves it had been many many years since they met to discuss so many events not entirely in their control for the younger among them this marked the first such time sire faleen though below grau in authority calmed them as the council speaker it fell to him to shape the direction of the meeting dagon did not mind at all that he turned it first toward sire neens fiasco in ushen brae he shared among them all he knew of what had happened which was a great deal they had probed the minds of the few ishtat to return alive from the meeting with devoth no leagueman had made it out of that butchers chamber but the ishtat minds housed images of the gore and at least fragments of the conversation preceding neens abrupt beheading all agreed that he should have seen that coming devoth had betrayed his intentions by the way he moved his body and in the way his eyes darted about neen had been too flushed with dubious victory over the lothan aklun to see too sure he held the worlds wealth in his hand fool more than one voice declared faleen did not dispute the label sire neen made grave mistakes he cost us dearly awkward the way he mishandled things a voice in the second row said should he be forgotten a murmur of approval greeted this suggestion yes yes let him be forgotten several voices said at once the greatest enthusiasm was in the outer rows neens demise would allow one of them quicker access to the inner circle dagon craned his head around just slightly and let his eyes cant farther from there searching for the man who had proposed the forgetting he spotted him lean faced although with wideset eyes that tilted downward at the outer edges his name lethel sire lethel he was neens second cousin so much for familial loyalty among the league though none would fault him for it in truth they all shared similar blood sire el said he may be forgotten but his errors should not be grunts of affirmation forget the man remember the folly so as not to repeat it dagon was not entirely sure how one could repeat the specifics of neens folly but he let a low rumble build in his throat his consent to the proposal he is forgotten then faleen said some time later once it was clear that nobody objected that small measure passed quickly what to do with ushen brae now that so much had changed took somewhat longer to work through they turned the issue over for some time exploring the possibilities the problems the likelihood of salvaging something of the once so very prosperous trade the auldek were abandoning ushen brae as they spoke they would leave the continent peopled with many of their formerand infertileslaves do they find a way to return to the old order or must they create a new one let the quota in ushen brae die out or offer them trade instead perhaps they would like slaves of their own so many questions the same in regard to the known world would the auldek conquer likely so many of them walked with a hundred souls beneath their skin a hundred deaths at their disposal how could weak acacians stand before them the fragile coalition of the akaran empire would shatter when such a threat approached the bitch with her plan to end the quota sire revek said does she really mean it there were moments that dagon disliked the shared communion of the council one could not lie the others could even have measured the beating of his heart or felt the sweat on his palms if they wished they would sense that he did not like calling queen corinn the bitch but they would also forgive him after all he did the work few of them did out among the peasants so much of his life in service to them all considering that leaguemen never told peasants the truth about anything their complete openness with one another had an ironic quality yes chairman she likely does mean it at the moment dagon answered she is an akaran after all she remains victim of notions of glory and benevolence especially during times of stress not the substance of benevolence of coursethe show thats what pumps her blood she may abolish the quota now resume it later she may see that the trade is simply no longer viable in a great many ways she is right about that she has no creativity a voice in the third row said there is always a way to exploit for gain we see that yes grau said the peasant folk rarely do many voices climbed over one another in anxious agreement with the chief elder but the bitch has finally consented to release the vintage revek said within a few weeks the entire known world will be addicted to it will that not unite them it will it will sire nathos said speaking about his area of expertise but i dont think that it matters united they may just fall faster let them line up to get cut down better that than that they splinter and hide in the various provinces either way i would not bet on their chances and we need not if the auldek prevail who is to say we cant do business with them when the known world is populated with auldek and their newborn childrenbabies for the first time in hundreds of yearswhat will the auldek wish for peace stability nathos nodded theyll begin to fear death again theyll want sedate docile servants with no rebellion in them theyll want to grow rich as they dream of their childrens lives we will have them in our power just as much as we had the acacians faleen asked and if by some strange turn of events the bitch beats them back i rather hope she doesnt nathos admitted that seems boring but if that happens shell have a newly addicted certainly battered nation to rebuild she has no idea how completely we own her and she still does not know what happens when one stops drinking the vintage no no she let that go untested sire grau chuckled so we have them forever oh my brothers isnt commerce wonderful my mood is rising what else have we to consider sire el reiterated an idea he had proposed before perhaps the time when they need fear their own military might was behind them they should enlarge the ishtat inspectorate if they could not sell quota slaves as regularly they could train them instead they were already doing this on a small scale and the first young soldiers bred on the outer isles had successfully joined the ranks of the ishtat without mishap several from the inner circle including faleen grumbled against this we should be wary lest we make ourselves like the peasants faleen said i want no army to rebel against us no kings or queens or senators i did not propose kings or queens or senators el snapped i propose that we make use of a means of production we have gone to great expense to establish the plantations exist they produce souls bodies we must find something to do with the product lest it all go to rot either the bitch or the auldek or the quota slaves in ushen brae may one day turn against us sire lethel said speaking with unusual boldness from the second circle who knows what the future holds it may be that we dont just need to protect our products and wealth who is to say we wont need to fight for our very existence they lay pondering this for a time and then slowly one by one they gave their consent the conversation continued eventually as the entire group slowed with shared fatigue faleen with graus approval recounted the consensus sire el could build his army on one of the small isles another leagueman would oversee the production of concubines quality ones who would be as much spies and assassins as they were lovers still others would follow the auldeks progress corresponding with them just enough to let them understand the league might yet be their friend and finally they came to where they began the confusion that was ushen brae sire faleen himself would journey across to oversee the exploitation of the aklun relics which some were already searching for another should venture farther right across to the mainland itself the slaves being abandoned there could not be allowed to run amok who will take up this responsibility the response was immediate uncharacteristically swift i will again that voice from the second row sire lethel faleen asked these are affairs of the real world you understand among the peasants there is risk and there is joy in taking risk lethel said my cousin enjoyed risk i do as well will you err as your cousin did no lethel said i will not i believe he should be forgotten but i would not have my family forgotten i will succeed where he did not i swear it if i cannot i will arrange to have my own head set rolling do any object faleen asked for a time a murmur of discussion swept around the rings but it was not true objection few would want the task dagon knew why should they few of these men are like me dagon thought or like neen perhaps this lethel is a person of promise he let these thoughts slip away almost as quickly as he formed them still it alarmed him when el spoke his name dagon you must return swiftly reminded of it fatigue wrung his body anew he had arrived just an hour before the meeting now likely they would turn him back toward acacia in the morn he felt a hard elbow of annoyance press his ribs but he breathed through it and asked have we any particular message for the queen grau cleared his throat harshly as if he had something caught in it that he wished to expel his voice calmed when he spoke use whatever words you like just make her know the league understands that the changing situation means we must all adapt let her know the league has only ever wished to facilitate trade that was in the best interests of the empire this is no time to trade in quota tell her she has our full support and no malice whatsoever you mean lie on every count of course faleen said what other way is there to do business none that i have yet found to be better than our own methods dagon said despite his fatigue he felt rather better now than he had when he began he should have known that would be the case the future always looked brighter when joined with the hazy wisdom of this peers grau must have picked up his thoughts he said on some things we change with the situations of the world but in other ways we stay true to the fundamentals that have always served us yes the answering affirmation filled the chamber with echoing raucous enthusiasmmuted of course by the mist but thunderous by council terms once it quieted down the chief elder added infusing his words with the certainty they all craved the league of vessels will ride out this storm as ever we have this is what has always made us great its why we will prosper now just as we prospered during hanish meins short rule and as we thrived all the years since tinhadins foolish actions who but our ancestors would have had the vision to partner with the lothan aklun sorcerer fugitives from tinhadins wrath blood relatives to that madman who but we would grab the opportunity to help them punish the known world year after year we grew to hate them but it was a beneficial partnership who but we could so long keep it secret that the trade that fueled the world was a product of old hatreds between kinsmen grau chuckled before long the seas will calm the sun will burn away the clouds and we will yet be masters of the world masters of whom is yet to be seen trading what it is yet to be determined but it hardly matters we have many options so what we have is a change of everything and a change of nothing at all on all counts we will profit and dont forget brothers our people are yet searching for this soul catcher we have heard so much about when they find itand other lothan aklun relicsim inclined to believe our losses will be no worse than pinpricks on a rhinos hide dont you agree they did c hapter f ortynine he is designed for war how else to describe it look at him just look at him so rialus thought as he scurried to stay just behind the headman of the lvin the chieftain of the entire auldek nation andas of todaythe commander of an invading army devoth his strides each doubled rialuss his shoulders punched forward and back as he walked squared and higher on his frame than those of normal men as if he wore sculpted armor draped over them but the sculpting was nothing more than his natural contours the bulk measured only in the striated cords of his own muscles he went bare armed shoulder joints rounded knobs bulging at the biceps his backwrapped in tightfitting leatherstarted wide and tapered toward his waist where it met his buttocks and the swinging tree trunks he called legs rialus kept his eyes above this part of the auldeks anatomy feeling the same unease he experienced around thoroughbred animals any creatures designed for violence and latent with sexual strength troubled him he doubted there was even one individual in the known world to match devoths physical stature certainly no acacian ever had and likely no mein either no halaly or candovian not even a freak strawhaired aushenian from the gradthic range was likely to reach the lvins height of eight savagely proportioned feet the benefits of four hundred and some years spent doing nothing but training for war rialus mused that and teaching hummingbirds to sip sweet water from your mouth raising pet lions running endurance races over twenty thirty and fiftymile courses practicing archery singing epic poems and painting with a brush and ink yes rialus had continued to learn more about the auldek with each passing day none of the newfound knowledge however made anything about them make better sense to him none of it balanced the knowledge that the entire nation was ravenous for war rushing toward it with a breathless anticipation that seemed almost childlike though he had a considerable part in the planning stages of the coming invasion this day had reared up before him suddenly things it seemed were moving as fast as the auldeks massive strides thus devoth rialus and their small party went out from the lvin area of avina at a brisk pace they walked atop an elevated network that took them from rooftop to rooftop through a district rialus had not yet visited dropping to street level they strode for a time down a thoroughfare that swarmed with onlookers slaves mostly but all caught up in the excitement of the moment they yelled encouragement and clapped some banged cymbals together the youngest tossed folded bits of paper shaped like birds and insects yet another auldek pastime the light crafts looped in the air above them were they happy to know the auldek were departing it did not seem so the enthusiasm seemed sincere enough and the tears in the eyes of some held both joy and sadness rialus would never understand slaves slick with sweat before long rialus welcomed the coolness as they dropped into an underground passageway the auldek to either side of devoth talked as they moved but rialus did not follow what they were saying it was enough just to keep up and then they emerged into the sun again devoth led them across a rectangle of pink marble he began the ascent of a wide staircase above it nothing but the sky bright blue streaked by high clouds and promising a fine day only as he reached the halfway point did he slow his pace he inhaled a breath head back slightly rialus did the same and he imagined he smelled the scent and essence of many many souls devoth paused he did not turn fully around but he twisted his head enough for rialus to see his sharp profile his long hair tumbled over his shoulders in auburn waves are you ready to be stunned rialus leagueman i think this will be a sight you have never seen the like of before actually rialus thought im rather tired of being stunned this entire journey the waves of the barrier ridge and the sea wolves of the gray slopes punching through the angerwall and gazing up at the heights of the barrier isles the floating dead in the sea and the chaos after sire neens beheading and the list went on and on and by the look of things it would do so endlessly he would just as soon live the rest of his days without such excitement but as he mounted the last steps and the field below them came into view rialus beheld the army that devoth and the other auldek had gathered for their invasion it was enormous countless bodies crowded a massive rectangular clearing that stretched toward the horizon in the near distance separated into rectangular units by their clan affiliation marked by differentcolored armor and garments stood the auldek themselves rialus knew enough to separate them at a glance now lvin and kern and kulish kra nearest anet and antoks and wrathic just behind them the shivith along the left side the fru nithexek a clan he knew little about were a thin line at the rear of the auldek ranks and the few numrek stood in the right corner near the front the totem clans of the auldek rialus tried to find some way to number them but ended up feeling he was guessing there might be twenty or thirty thousand of them not so many to represent an entire race really but they were only a portion of the gathered host behind them stretching back toward the rim of the horizon went the divine children they were likewise sectioned off by the clans that claimed them garishly clothed many of them altered to physically resemble their clans totem animals how strange to see human wolves howling whitefaced lion men baring their teeth cranelike people snapping their heads from side to side others pretending to hiss like venomous snakes madness on a massive scale those farther back lost shape and individual detail they blended into a moving mass they looked like ants swarming piled on top of one another and intertwined so that it was impossible to tell where one ended and another began lining the far edges of the mass of soldiers were the beasts that would also attack acacia kwedeirsthose batlike monstrosities with riders strapped to their backsshuffled uneasily their awkwardly bent wings rustling seemingly eager to fly the kwedeir was not a totem animal as far as rialus knew but the clans aligned with animals fierce enough for battle had representatives also antoks were spaced out in ranks receding into the distance they wore intricate harnesses with pockets in which soldiers perched seven or eight for each creature there were whitemaned snow lions and shivith cats lean and restless ready to bolt wrathic wolves the size of horses with long muzzles that quivered as they growled and even a few sky bears bulky carnivores the color of dirty snow thatjudging by what he could seechose to stand on their hind legs when agitated above it all the crows of the kulish kra swarmed in excited flocks certainly though they were trained pets certainly they were anticipating the slaughter that such a mass commotion must lead to when had the world ever seen such a bizarre murderous throng of man and beast and manbeast and all this rialus knew was a gathering of just a portion of the army a supply train had already been sent out along the route to prepare the wayto stash food supplies and gear to construct makeshift outposts to aid the coming army devoth had explained that hunters and laborers would travel before the main column and that a neverending convoy of slaves would follow it shuttling the supplies to keep them alive in the northern regions to hear him describe it they would drain ushen brae of its population and send a river of new life flooding into the known world just before he stepped away from him to address the crowd devoth turned to rialus he pointed one of his long thickjointed fingers at him you are a witness watch and listen he turned away before rialus could answer leaving him with the disquieting feeling that he might be tested afterward on what transpired this will be the greatest work of your lives devoth shouted to the crowd once they had settled down to allow him to speak he spoke slowly and for a moment rialus found the cadence strange especially as the sentiments themselves were impassioned you know why youre here for war the crowd affirmed that they did indeed know that was why they were gathered it took a while for the approbation to die down since the commanders words needed to be repeated for the farther reaches to hear cheers came back at him delayed by the distance this war was hundreds of years in the making devoth claimed hundreds of years think how fortunate you are you will be remembered for itwhether you live or die you will be remembered and envied for the things you are going to see and deeds you are going to do you will be legends do you doubt it who but the heroes of legend would dare to march into the great north who but legends would kick white bears and ice maidens out of their paths and tread across frozen water walk above a fathomless sea through biting wind and snow across tundra and over mountains who but conquerors would dare face all that just to reach their enemies tell me that doesnt sound like legend judging by the shout that answered his prompt they rather liked the notion he knows how to work a crowd rialus thought yes devoth paced back and forth across the platform hand cupped beside his ear pulling the cacophony in as if it were personal praise eating it with his grin yes for a time rialus lost the flow of devoths discourse it was hard not to just gape at the throng of warriors and beasts antoks pawing the ground kwedeirs rolling their shoulders cracking their jaws as if they might snatch up a snack from all the morsels around them the masses rolling back their enthusiasm in delayed waves the passing moments made none of it less horrifying when the cheering suddenly faded however rialus knew he had better listen more carefully so how could we not offer you a great reward divine children could we not honor you tell me what would you like to have most in the world devoth leaned forward awaiting a response only there was no answering sound the enormous army stood hushed even the antoks cocked their massive heads and listened to the eerie silence of thousands of breathing beings the auldek smiled and nudged one another knowingly but the masses behind them seemed genuinely baffled what exactly is going on rialus wondered you dont know devoth asked let me suggest something then i know you will come on this journey and fight this war with us because you are loyal and you are proud and this more than anything in your lives yet is what you were created for but if you help us gain thiswhen we conquer the acacians like the warriors we once were when we of the auldek race are fertile again and can make our own children when we give up the souls inside us and live only the span of a single life once more when we are mortal again when we have all these things that we most wantthen we will free you the hush that remained was more shocking than sound would have been you will be free to do whatever you wish slay the acacians if you will enslave them if you care to make war or peace as suits your souls we will not hinder you devoth grinned he curved his arm back bicep bulging and tapped his fingers against his chest if it pleases you mass an army and make war on us that would be great fun yes still the crowd held its breath the divine children stared up at devoth rapt so many faces stunned and disbelieving this made devoth laugh lvin kulish kra shivith kern anetall auldek clans lend me your voices let them know what i say is true from one section of the auldek ranks and then another shouts rose in affirmation each group called its name testifying confirming senior members turned and nodded pointing at devoth to verify that he spoke for them all now hear me once more and answer me devoth bellowed above them do you want freedom if so you have only to say so and then to fight for it answer me it took a moment but this time the masses did they cried for their freedom good i am glad you do not disappoint i knew you wouldnt i know this also for this battle we take everything with us for this battle we fly as we havent for centuries we call upon old friends mounts that have not allowed riders for years now mounts that we have promised carnage he turned and shouted back the way they had approached old friends come to me rialus snapped around not knowing what to expect but ready to be surprised again he was he did not hear the flapping of wings though he would dream that he did for many nights to come he saw them first as moving forms that were almost ghostly against the light blue of the sky they rose up one and then two more and then others winged they flew they flew fast taking on size as they grew nearer slicing in and out among one another at times dark crescents of motion in other instances slivers of shapes almost invisible at least that was true until they landed some dropped onto columns beside the army some fell right among the crowd which fled leaving landing areas for them a few flanked devoth on the platform one alit on the steps in front of him between him and the ranked masses this one landed on all fours it stayed like that for a moment as if adjusting the burden of its own muscular weight and then it reared up wings outstretched massive larger even than the kwedeirs built differently the creature was hairless and slick its musculature more humanoid than those batlike creatures more like a being meant to walk upright its back and upper wings were a blue so dark it neared black but its belly face and the front half of its legs were a smoky white its head was like a hairless apes with a protruding jaw full of visible teeth and large eyes that took in the scene with a confident intelligent malevolence rialus forgot to breathe when he recognized the burning in his chest for what it was he tried to inhale and could not remember how devoth turned and glanced at rialus blinked i mentioned freketes didnt i i see you are impressed watch this with that he bounded down the stone steps toward the winged creature the beast turned and followed his progress eyes dilating nostrils flaring with an audible inhalation of air its jaws opened and for a moment rialus was certain the creature was going to devour him instead it tossed its head back and roared an incredible sound that shredded the air rialus slammed his hands against his ears the beast half turned away from devoth it moved one of its wings and offered him a bulging thigh that devoth leaped on with a few deft movements the auldek had climbed onto its back and slammed his feet into the stirrups of the slight frame wrapped around its body he had barely grasped hold of the straps when the creature surged up into the air devoth clinging tightly as it reached the height of its leap the frekete beat its wings and skimmed away over the awed heads of the throng people ducked as it passed flattening themselves on the ground then they rose with bellowing and shouting a cacophony to which the antoks and kwedeirs and the other freketes added a great noise an army announcing itself rialus pulled his hands away from his ears and instead placed a finger to his lips he whispered with no faith that he would be answered giver protect us c hapter f ifty they had to work fast they had a day or two to accomplish their objective dariel figured no longer that was why he pushed the lothan aklun vessel to such amazing speeds it smacked smacked smacked against the green swells sparkling beneath the light of a midmorning sun the prow cut the waves around the rocky southern tip of lithram len and then turned back to race up its ragged eastern shoreline they might be spotted yes but delay was not something they could afford it was true that the league had been struck a blow when calrach rebuffed them sire neendariel could not help but chuckle thinking about him the memory seemed more manageable now that he was free in the world tunnel and several others clinging to the rocking deck nearby looked quizzically at the prince as he laughed that just made him guffaw all the more rather changed your view of the world didnt it he shouted getting your head lopped off i mean the others just stared the fresh air and the motion of waves beneath him and a ships wheel in his hands did a great deal for his humor he felt a vibrant energy at his center that he had not really felt since his days as a brigand captain he let the energy feed him from the inside and he let the urgency pressed on him by the outside world drive him forward knowing the league as he did dariel knew they would not spend much time mourning sire neen nor would they be deterred from whatever it was they intended in ushen brae the activity on the west side of lithram len proved as much it could only be a matter of days before they began exploring the other side of the island where skylene told him the soul catcher was she was the only one of the party to have information about it and that came only from the things mor had told her even this information came largely from a childs memories but dariel knew such things could have surprising accuracy a little way into their northern turn skylene called for him to slow the boat they would have to study the coastline carefully not to miss entrance to the soul catcher it was hidden in plain sight skylene said trees of a type that dariel had never seen crowded the shore slender trunked they were as tall as any pine in the high forest of calfa ven the trees exploded near the crown with branches that shot out in every direction they looked topheavy but the branches entwined with their neighbors and those joined the many into a single linked partnership rocky outcroppings interrupted the trees now and then it was for a particular one of these that they searched riding the waves now nosing along more slowly dariel made sure to scan the sea horizon often for any other vessel but he also watched for submerged rocks and could not help but stare for long moments at the shore on the mainland there are vast forests filled with creatures skylene had come up beside him the breeze off the water stirred the tufts of feathers at her hairline they say there are creatures on ushen braesquirrels and flying rats and howling monkeysthat live their entire lives in the tree canopy imagine that having no need of the ground beneath you the world is odd isnt it thats what keeps it interesting dariel said well yes and this island is interesting too as lush as those trees are as thick no animals live here listen youll hear no calls not even birds they say it has always been that way on lithram len indeed now that she mentioned it the place did have an eerie stillness it was hard to imagine the island not crawling with animal life but he saw no motion save the leaves stirred by the wind staring at the trees they did seem almost as if they glared back like their entwined embrace was not so much an act of mutual support as it was preparation for aggression just after midday birke with his wrathic hunters eyes was the first to see something his arm shot out pointing at first dariel saw nothing but another bulge of rock that pushed through the trees and overhung the water he moved the vessel closer willing it to ride calm on the swells angling so that he could see into the water more clearly there were rocks there rippling and near under the glassy green tint of the water it was not until he swung the boat all the way around and backed into the shelter of a natural quay that he realized he had navigated a route that brought him to rest at a pier a carefully hidden structure just beneath the rock outcropping the others had the boat secured in a few moments and dariel leaped onto the dock even as birke started to ascend a stone staircase cut into the buttress the steps were invisible from the sea but obvious from this angle a curving ascent that kept to the natural contours of the wall dariel followed it was a quick climb and soon he stepped through a darkened opening as if into the mouth of a cave breathing heavily from the exertion the others crowded the room and he had to slide between them as his eyes adjusted he realized the chamber was not truly cavelike it was sculpted oblong and sleek the stone had a light within it a faint illumination that seemed to grow the longer they stood there no one talked but they walked slowly around the chamber tunnel said this is truly it skylene nodded her skyblue face grave and beautiful in the soft light its as mor described exactly she pointed to the bedlike stone platforms ravii mean the child to be sacrificed lies on one of those whoever is to receive his soul takes the other covers come down from above she looked upward indeed rectangular structures hung there and whatever happens is hidden from view the lothan aklun do things thats all she could say who were these people dariel asked some believe that the lothan aklun came from your land sorcerers who fled persecutionshe ran her hand gently over one of the panels not actually touching it but as close as she could come to doing soand became persecutors in this one from my lands dariel thought how could they have come from acacia ive heard no tales of that not all tales get told someone said these sorcerers they put their magic into things skylene continued like they put souls in the boat like this chamber this is the place its all as mor described it may be incomprehensible to us but the league might not find it so they are so near they may find it any day they may have texts to show them its use i dont know if the league has any idea what this can do theyll search for it dariel said theyll find it theyll use it i know that much about them destroy it birke said lets not wait a minute more another man tam answered this with motion he unclipped the mace that hung at his belt gripped it and tested its weight as he decided where to strike dariel understood him to have escaped from the fru nithexek though the only marks of the sky bear on him were dark circular tattoos around his eyes he picked his target a slanting compartment in the wall with handshaped raised impressions on it those near him stepped back dariel began somehow i dont think tam swung the mace the iron head of it bounced back from the panel so forcefully the young mans arm was flung over his head he lost his grip on the mace and several had to duck out of the way to avoid being hit tam cried out and for a cold second dariel thought he might drop dead cursed or something but no it was just the pain in his shoulder and hand that caused him to cry he stood rubbing his shoulder looking hurt and embarrassed at the same time dariel took a moment and then finished the sentence he had begun that we can just bash the place to pieces tam skylene said in a voice that made the statement the commendation she intended thank you for demonstrating what wont work we have to find another way dariel listened as the group talked but he had his own idea and it held most of his attention he circled it unsure he wanted to offer it it might fail for so many different reasons there were risks perhaps as much as anything it meant pushing through a wall of memories he did not relish facing or should he didnt he have to those memories were tied up with the same children who were brought here they included the same people he was now working against he had unfinished business with the league this could be a part of that i think i know a way dariel finally said the others stopped talking and turned toward him i did something like this before we blow it to bitsexplosions flame and smoke tunnel nodded gravely good idea a moment later he added how will we do this thing well need an explosive of course dariel said i think i know where to find one they used the cover of darkness to hide them sailing back around to the west side of lithram len the moon was just a sliver but the stars were bright and dariel seemed to have no trouble feeling the contours of the shore and sensing the dangers beneath the black and silvered water the others were quiet dariel could sense their fear rise to a trembling pitch when the glow of the league vesselcrowded harbor illumed the night sky they were close enough to the shoreline that they saw it first as a hazy smoldering above the dark silhouette of the trees as they got nearer the sky took on a reddish aspect seeming lower and choked with smoke dariel inched the boat around the last headland the bustling harbor with its maze of dock works and the city behind it came into view it hummed with life just as when they had first seen it the moment they were in view dariel knew how much they stood out bright white vessel that they were fortunately the league had already commandeered many lothan aklun ships he saw several moving in the harbor now even more at dock coming around into the light they were now on display for any eyes that chose to see them instead of retreating the prince willed the boat forward toward the burning torches and hundreds of workers each of them an enemy best to hide in plain sight right dariel offered we still agree on that dont we no one answered no one objected either this was as they had planned debated and argued about all afternoon from what they had observed the first time there was no way they could get near the harbor without being seen the night they had passed it during what should have been the dead hours it was lit too well was thronging with laborers and ishtat guards and leaguemen busy making the island theirs so clearly the time of the day or night would not aid them in the end they all agreed they would do just what they were doing now sail in as if they belonged as if they knew what they were about and were as intent on their work as any of the others it was no perfect plan it might work it might not they could easily be discovered if they were they would likely die but they could not sail away from it without trying dariel half wondered why he himself felt such resolution but only half he knew how much this was an opportunity to relieve some small portion of the guilt owned by his family how could he do anything but try to make that happen beyond that it just felt good captain of a ship again with a crew who jumped at his orders even if he had to explain his needs each time and they trusted him they would not let him pilot them into the enemys mouth otherwise skylene had even given him a dagger a small straight blade that he had shoved through his belt yes he was one of them for the time being working the ship closer to the docks he darted his eyes about searching at the same time he checked for danger he knew the barrels would be here somewhere the league never went far without their flaming weapon it would be stored off the ships if possible somewhere removed from the center of activity there yes there on the far side of the harbor at the end of a long arm of pier sat stacks of drums he knew them by their color bright red hundreds of them there was activity at the pier next to it but the area around the barrels was deserted calmly trying to think slower than the pulse beating in his throat dariel steered across the harbor turned and angled in coming to the docks on the far side so that they would be sheltered somewhat from view once docked and tied secure dariel turned to the waiting crew this is it the pitch in these barrels makes an unholy fire itll blast that soul catcher to pieces and leave a fire thatll burn for days there the more barrels we can get the better lets go quickly but calmly they could not be sure that the league used the people as laborers yet since slaves kept by the lothan aklun werent necessarily adorned in the same ways those with the most noticeable signs of belonging stayed hidden skylene tunnel the two others of the kern clan and birke crouched on the far side of the deck under dariels direction the others began the work of shifting the barrels from the pier to the boat the next pier over seemed to be closer each time dariel glanced at it fortunately the boat moored there was on the far side and the attention was thus directed away from them a group of ishtat inspectorate guards stepped off the vessel and stood for a time talking beside it dariel kept up the motions of loading and securing but he watched them every chance he got he just caught the scent of the mist pipe one of them was smoking enjoy it he thought just relax and enjoy the pipe and dont turn around the barrels were heavy enough that they had to be tilted and rolled along on their rims and then carefully leaned from the dock into the hands on board the ship waiting for them this last move in particular needed to be done slowly as demonstrated when tam let a drum loose too soon it crashed down on the edge of the deck and teetered a moment then it fell back against the pier and splashed into the harbors gray waters forget it dariel said keep going im sorry tam said i thought its floating another observed dariel cursed there was no retrieving it as it bobbed under the pier just out of reach leave it he said hoping it would stay trapped among the piers many pylons tam continued to apologize but dariel cut him off not as kindly as skylene had been with him earlier just keep working try to look like you know what youre doing a few minutes more and tunnel had had enough of waiting he crammed himself into birkes shirt though he could not button it and his bulk threatened to burst the seams of the shoulders he went to work and dariel was glad he did where the rest struggled to carry one barrel between them tunnel somehow got his arms around two at a time carrying one under each arm with this help the stacked rows on the boats main deck grew quickly dariel kept busy making sure they were properly secured a few more minutes and they could dariel it was skylene just one word but the tone in which she spoke it told him everything instead of looking at her he scanned the docks he spotted the problem quickly an ishtat guard stood at the end of their pier watching them dariel turned to skylene and with a motion of his eyes reminded her to stay hidden by the time he had turned around again the guard had started toward them were going to have company dariel said just loud enough for those hefting the barrels to hear him keep working except you tunnelget out of sight the ishtat strode toward them now eyes fixed he wore the cloak of his order bright white and trailing behind him as he walked a thin sword hung at his side and one gloved hand rested on its hilt hey he called what are you doing you think you can just drop barrels of league pitch to float away look he pointed toward the water on the other side of the pier the barrel had floated free get out there and fetch that dariel bowed his head and motioned his apology with his hands he called the others and acted as if he would just pull out and pick up the floater the man carried on toward them however as he got closer his steps slowed and when he was near enough to make out individuals he squinted for a moment so perplexed he could manage nothing else and then he said who are you you arent one of ours dariel smiled i he leaped from the deck to the pier and walked toward the ishtat holding an amiable expression who am i he laughed and cocked his head in a manner that suggested he had a story to tell one that would explain all this one that would make them both laugh even if the tale did not make the teller seem entirely free of guilt he tried to convey all this in the few steps it took him to reach the man and it must have worked instead of drawing his sword or signaling an alarm the guard had his chin raised and his hands planted on his hips yes who are you and what do you dariel swept his hand up bringing with it the dagger he slammed the blade in the soft center of the guards neck the mans face registered shock his arms hung limp and this may have fed his terror his eyes cast about as if demanding that his body do things that it refused the prince said my name is dariel akaran if you must know he yanked the blade to the side and pushed the guards body over so that the spray of crimson jetted away from him moving with the bodys momentum he kicked the guard from the pier as the body splashed into the water dariel cast his eyes over the harbor the deck of the nearest ship portholes in its side and the street leading away from the water nothing no one seemed to have noticed not yet at least he spun and said last of the barrels in lads and then lets go the others skylene included stared at him birkes jaw dropped exposing his canine teeth tam was so wideeyed it looked like he feared for his own life even tunnel looked uneasy what dariel asked leaping back on the boat you think this could be bloodless gape at me later now lets keep moving or therell be a lot more blood in the water quickly now quickly the last barrels went on the deck the ropes were untied dariel steered the boat away from the pier and turned it toward the open water this was the part he had feared most to be so close to success but needing moment after moment after moment in clear view of anyone watching work on the docks might not draw much attention but a ship outbound in the middle of the night was a different matter dariel felt a hundred eyes drilling into the back of his head he fought the urge to turn around as much as he held back from surging forward at full speed steady he told himself just steady forward off to make a delivery thats all nothing suspicious here right there before him bobbing for anyone to see floated the loose barrel he wanted to ram the thing and fly but if anybody saw him sail by it without retrieving it he angled the boat toward it pulled up until it bumped the side and then instructed the crew to pull it aboard seconds passed as they grasped for it but it slipped out of reach skylene appeared beside him looking back where he would not the body is in plain sight now she whispered for the first time that night sweat beaded on his forehead and ran down over his temples he had to wipe it from the corners of his eyes still he did not turn around he slid the boat toward the barrel gently tam appeared with a boat hook with it they got the barrel secured against the side at the stern finally they hauled it up steady forward theyve seen it skylene said dariel cursed he tried to find something else to say but nothing came one guard is motioning to some others hes pointing at the water giver dariel ground through his teeth watching as the headland crept closer it might have been a plea but it sounded more like a threat skylene glanced at him a moment and then looked away they converged on it she reported it looks like theyre preparing to launch a boat steady forward as they neared the spit of land that would take them out of the harbors sight line he asked well her elbow brushed his as the hull crossed into the deeper current coming around the headland changing the boats rocking she did not answer until they fell into shadow i dont think they picked us out but perhaps we should make haste and so they did dariel pushed the vessel even faster than before they sped under the light of the stars and then turned and ran around the bottom of the island as the eastern horizon warmed their faces with the coming sun they were back at the soul catcher in no time if tunnel had been impressive on the docks he was a wonder now stripped shirtless muscles glistening with sweat as he heaved barrels onto his shoulders and ran up the steps and though tam had bumbled twice in as many days he worked all the harder to make amends for it now dariel almost told him to slacken his pace but the young one was working so hard he did not have the heart to dissuade him of course they feared a league ship would arrive at any moment but the hours passed without anyone showing before the noon hour they had the chamber stuffed with all but one of the pitch barrels and soon after they had soaked a length of rope in pitch to create a wick all told they had searched debated planned sailed loaded run and hauled throughout an entire day a night and into the next day still when the work was complete and the others cleared the chamber to wait at the boat and dariel stood alone with a torch burning in his hand it seemed the moment had come too quickly all he had to do was finish it standing with the torch clouding the air of the chamber with black smoke he pushed himself forward one step and then another and then he bent and brought the flame close to the pitchsoaked rope even then it was hard he had to tell himself that this was not the same as on the platforms he was not val going to his death nor was he spratling a child being orphaned for a second time he would live through this act and no souls would be lost by it just the opposite this would save lives save souls perhaps even his own the wick took the flame and bloomed to life dariel watched it long enough to verify that it was good and then he turned and dashed out and down the stone stairs glad to feel the sea air on his face unreasoningly gleeful that a vessel full of friends awaited him years before as he had raced away from the exploding platforms on the blacksailed ballan he had not looked back he had feared whatever demon was rising there all the rage roaring up into the heavens the hands reaching out toward him he could not have defined just what frightened him so for it was many things overlapping some submerged in memory but no less powerful this time he turned he held the wheel as the prow cut the sea but he twisted around and watched the others around him clapped and cheered each explosion for there were many hands grasped and patted joy to him and he returned it what he saw was a plume of white smoke that rose slowly above the concussions of flaming rage it tilted like a giant like an enormous tree of ash unfurling into life it looked wonderful peaceful thankful three days later he beached the lothan aklun vessel on a sandspit in a shallow marsh area of sumerled just up the throat of a river that the people called sheeven lek he watched as tunnel directed the others to uncap the last barrel of pitch and let it pour out into the hull of the vessel they lit it and it went up fast with a great whoosh that was a monster inhaling and then a burst of warmth that tilted dariel back on his heels he did not say a word of protest no matter how beautiful the lines of the boat and how incredible the power within it that was stolen power trapped unwillingly enslaved it could never be his and should be freed so it was and he almost felt he could hear the relief of the souls escaping and two days after that he met mor and a small group of the people at the edge of the wilderness skylene presented him to her all of them gathered on a stone slab elevated above the tamed woodlands to the east and the wilds stretching off to the west as far as the eye could see the wilderness looked like it went on forever granite stones ran north to south in great undulating weatherround ridges like the crests of waves at first dariel was not sure where to set his eyes on the abundance of nature or on mor beautiful in the full light of the sun he chose mor skylene briefed her on all that had happened the stealing of the boat the plan to destroy the soul catcher and the success at doing so and then their destruction of the boat it was an official report dariel knew that mor would have heard the details already still they all waited through it dariel searching for any signs of thoughts behind mors eyes he could not read her at all just looking was a pleasure of sorts though was it because of who she was or because beneath the shivith spots he saw wren in the shape of her eyelids and the roundness of her face and the way her cheekbones rose to prominence was it mor he loved looking at or the lover mor reminded him of he really wasnt sure if mor received the news of the soul catchers destruction with any personal emotion she did not show it she did however take dariels hand in hers she pulled him forward a half step and placed his palm against the center of her chest the people praise you she said and thank you you have done for us something we had not managed to do in all our years here you arrived with knowledge we do not possess and used it to aid us likely you cannot know the good you have done but still i praise you for it her expression while she said this was as firm as a nannys measuring out a disobedient childs punishment but after a short pause the corners of her lipsfirst the right and then the leftand then her cheeks as well tilted into a grin its a start at least we wont kill you yet come look at this with me the two moved away from the others climbing the sloping stone which was coarse underfoot with granules that crackled and popped free beneath their weight a flock of long slim birds flew toward them over the hillocks to the northwest they were black silhouettes against the reddening sky until they dropped into shadow and stood out white against the deep green of the trees beyond here the land is wild mor said the westlands it is not unpeopled just wild beautiful beyond measure before the lothan aklun arrived the auldek tribes had settled portions of it but their inland cities are ruins now their cultivated fields reclaimed by forest and jungle her voice had grown conversational in a way it had never been with him before the auldek like to hunt us on their kwedeirs but there are regions of ushen brae that even the hunting parties have never reached the auldek are powerful in their way but they live only on a thin sliver of coastline afraid of the sea on one side with a wall against the continent on the other they were satisfied with that but you are not no never could be i want what is here to make use of this land in ways the auldek have long forgotten if this land were ours to do with what we wanted we would build a paradise like nothing the world has yet seen of course we would who better than slaves to know the value of free life a nation of orphans dariel thought none of whom can have children what kind of future is that mor turned her face toward him think of it we would know how to build a just society thats a thing the world has never seen the sun shone warm on her features her skin looked so soft dariel wanted to run his fingertips across her cheek and down toward her lips wondering if he would feel the shivith spots if he closed his eyes when mor spoke it seemed she had taken some portion of his own thoughts and woven them into something different and pressed it back toward him though i set the marks on you myself i dont fully recognize the face i made ill have to get used to you slowly dariel akaran i should tell you that its certain the auldek are marching to attack your nation i dont know all the details but they take an army like none they have mustered in years they take war beasts and many of the sublime motion i cant say how this will change ushen brae or how it will change your land you have helped us though yoen wants to meet you but i told him that first i would offer you release if you want to go now and somehow aid your people i will not stop you he would have jumped at such an offer a fortnight ago now though he heard it coolly it wasnt that he cared any less about the known world about his family or about wren but the truth was twofold on his own he would never get back home on his own he was but one man who would have to shout for anyone to notice him and the only ones who would notice would be his enemies on his own he would be running a fools errandone of the heart yes but not informed by the mind and too he felt a different purpose it had gripped him on the lothan aklun vessel and had not left him yet perhaps spirits had entered him when his hands held the steering wheel something had happened for he was different and in being different he felt a step closer to being more completely himself he said i would like to meet yoen you really want to know us mor asked us and these lands dariel said yes you know that i have not forgiven you anything it may be that you are truly to have a role in the peoples future but that will only be decided over many many more tests i know and you know that there is no easy road back to your land from here i know mor stared directly into his eyes for a long time long enough that it grew hard for him to return her gaze dariel felt his eyes moisten but he did not blink or break the exchange it may be that you and i are both realists dreamers too i think but realists as well you cannot go to your land right now i cannot accomplish the single greatest thing i hope to right now either ill tell you this though if the day comes that our work here is done i will go with you to your lands i will hunt until each and every auldek is dead and if i have my way ill be able to look into my brothers eyes before he fades from life thats a dream of mine she broke the stare as if it were nothing come then the woman said matteroffactly she showed him her back and began to descend the granite slope dariel watched her go for a moment and then lifted his gaze and looked toward the setting sun across the crowns of trees verdant green gilded beneath a flaming sky he had the impulse to turn and look back over the route they had traveled or make eye contact with tunnel or skylene but for some reason he felt the need to look only forward he began walking feeling the slope of the stone under his feet he followed mor in search of her beautiful land populated by wild things and free people c hapter f iftyone the night before she rose to attempt the greatest works of sorcery she had ever tried corinn had a dream she awoke feeling it heavy with import dripping with guilt she had relived an afternoon earlier that spring when she and aaden had ridden together in a carriage bringing them down from calfa ven the boy as often happened became sick from the jostling of the wheels over the rough stones his face went pale and he sat for a time percolating the stew that as if on cue erupted from him as they started down one particularly steep section of switchbacks corinn hated the scent of vomit it filled her nostrils like a taint of something poisonous she had never been able to deal with this type of sickness and she had not on the day she dreamed of instead she got out of the carriage at the first opportunity leaving maids to care for her son as she walked for a while in the mountain air clearing her lungs that much of the dream was just a version of events that actually had happened a small and inconsequential event one afternoon in the mountains what happened next had not happened in actual life it couldnt the players had not all been alive on that day as she walked taking in the mountain viewthe green and blue of the peaks before her slowly receding as they dropped in altitudea man appeared on her left side and took in the landscape with her corinn looked over at him knowing who he was before her eyes touched him her brother aliver he said nothing just smiled at her shook his head motioned back toward the carriage in which aaden sat likely still green with his illness he was saying that he understood her and that he loved the boy such a good boy he was saying that the boy would be the king he never got to be he was saying that he understood corinns actions and she had no need to explain herself even now as she walked in the fresh air while maids swabbed the vomit from the corners of her sons mouth im not a bad mother corinn had said though aliver had said nothing to suggest he thought she was you dont know how much i love him no of course not a voice said not alivers but the man on her right side walking with them as well she turned toward him hanish mein his clean crisp features his blond hair shone around his face and draped his shoulders his gray eyes glowed she wanted to press her lips against them and pull in the gentle calm of them before she could hanish dipped his head forward he threw his body after it jumping into a somersault before he had turned one circle his body became one large orange leaf it danced on a sudden breeze aliver did the same and the two men who were now leaves twirled and dipped and rose on currents in the air watching them corinn began to whistle though there was joy in the final moments she awoke with the memory of the dreamand of the actual day that began itimbedded in her abdomen as a physical pain a knot that remained within her even after she joined the flow of the living day she swore to herself that if she ever ever got the chance to pull aaden close and kiss and caress him in illness like that she would do it with all her heart holding nothing back but this was not something she could see to today she set it aside and continued with the course she had decided on first she surprised a guard by arriving outside the cell that housed the prisoner barad the lesser the soldier stood nearly asleep on his feet and did not seem to register corinn as a real person until she stood right before him soldier she said open the door the man shot fully awake at the sound of her voice suddenly terrified he turned and fumbled a long time with the keys to the door apologizing the entire time dropping them twice and cursing himself and then apologizing more his terror of her seemed out of all proportion to the circumstances but on entering the cell corinn recalled that any guard of this prisoner had reason to fear her barad sat on a cot against the far wall the bed tiny beneath him like a childs she wondered if he ever lay on it for surely his legs and arms would have hung down to the stone floor thinner already than when last she had seen him angles and joints measured his bulk his legs rose unnaturally long bent at knees on which he had set his crossed arms and rested his forehead a single wrist chain attached him to an iron ring in the wall on hearing her enter barad lifted his head and rolled his sightless stone eyes in her direction yes she thought there is reason to fear me she turned and gestured for the guard to leave them alone he did so gladly you dont smell like a marah the prisoner said after a few moments of silence his voice carried the same grave timbre she remembered from before it held a weight and substance at odds with the lanky emaciated form that produced it do they feed you corinn asked the man squinted she knew he could not see her but a lifetime of habits still ruled his mannerisms the queen so the queen pays a visit to a blind prisoner and to ask after the quality of his meals the world yet offers surprises yes they bring me food i have little appetite though you must regain it then corinn said if i wished you dead i would have killed you i do not wish you to starve barad tilted his head back in a motion that became an openmouthed yawn audible in the enclosed room when he was finished with it he rubbed his nose with his manacled hand the chains clinked dully kind of you no not really i dont have much use for kindness anymore not for its own sake at least corinn looked about the cell for a moment though there was nothing in it to catch an eye do you know that my son almost died barad crooked one eyebrow another gesture made like a sighted man i heard something about that he said i am sorry innocents should not be victims of our wicked dance traitors tried to kill him barad traitors who would kill you as well and enslave or butcher all the people you so love those traitors showed themselves by trying to kill my son and me you see this is something you havent acknowledged the akarans represent the people you love to the world when first an enemy aims to harm them they aim at an akaran heart think of my father the prisoner considered her words for a respectful length of time and then said thats not quite how i see it yes corinn snapped but you dont see it any other way either you dont see you never did and youve made sure i never will again he said this sadly inhaling as he did so i did like looking upon the world i truly did you dont know how it is not to see but to move your eyes and hear stone grinding inside your head before alivers war against hanish you claimed to have dreamed he would return back when nobody knew if he even lived you boasted that he spoke to you in your dreams is that true or was it a selfserving lie i was not boasting barad said and it was the truth as i understood it how do you explain it then i dont do you hear his voice now under a ridged skeptical forehead he said aliver is dead your majesty ive never spoken with the dead no but perhaps you will she thought perhaps very soon tell me was my brother wise he was and were you committed to him completely of course we all were in the brief span that was alivers war nobodynot one single personbetrayed him the thought of that almost took corinns words away she wanted to spit that it could not be true somebody somewhere said ill of him some soldier deserted camp at night some officer coveted his status somebody your majesty i think i understand you better now whats wrong with you is that you feel you are alone isnt that it you are alone and it frightens you but you dont have to i am not alone millionsmillions she said the number but was not sure how to complete the thought she began it with nor did it matter a blind fool you will use all your gifts of oratory in my service no barad said i will not you will you will bring to the people word that in my presence and through long conversation with me you have learned that you were wrong you maligned me mistakenly the truth is not yours to create is that i am the last and only hope for the known world no you know nothing i have looked across the world and seen the coming enemy in my own mind in my head she gestured savagely at her temple as if she would jab her finger through it ive seen them and they bring beasts and hunger and vengeance they will pay you back for the akaran sins corinn could not help but use her body to express herself no thats where youre wrong the auldek will kill us all they want to make our lands theirs andand the quota children returning with them hate all of us not just me you too will you explain to them that you are not the villain who sent them away do you really think theyll stop long enough to hear you the difference between us is nothingnothingif were both dead we will be unless all the known world unites behind me as fully as they did behind my brother that cannot corinn held up a finger as he began to interrupt oddly something stopped him he himself did not seem to know what and his stone eyes did not move at all but he paused and she continued you will tell everybody and have them speak so that my words are spoken by a million tongues i dont trust many people i have no allies who would not abandon me the few who would be true to memena darieldoubt me it pains me that this is true but it is i love them though they dont know it but i even need them i need them to be the people they are she had not thought to say that earlier but now that she did she knew it was true it really was true for a moment the emotion of it choked her and then she wanted to say more mena the goddess of rage who is also so kind with her sword and wings how can i not love her and want her free to be who she is and dariel i dont know whats become of him but i love him and i wouldnt want him to be anything other than what he is either even aliver if he were still among us id welcome with all his ideals and plans i might have to fight with him but they are my family my blood she thought of hanish for a moment but not in the way she wanted to she pushed it back and calmed her voice and said youre not my blood so i dont care what is in your heart i care what comes out of your mouth and i think only of how it will help me protect the known world you barad are going to be one of my staunchest allies never corinn launched herself at him big gangly as he was she smashed into him grasping his head in her arms your mind is mine the man fought against her for a moment he drew back a mallet of a fist cocked and began to bring it forward until she slipped her thumbs around and pressed them against his stone eyes the fist froze his body went limp as if she held the center of him and he could do nothing your mind is mine corinn repeated listen and dont deny it early that evening corinn went to the gardens of menas region of the palace though she felt the fatigue of the song she had sung for barad corinn knew there was more left in her and there were two more things she had to do before she rested tonight was the night for it she felt full of resolve powered by a measure of certainty and she planned to see it through she walked cautiously her eyes often flicking up to the bluing sky elya was far away flying behind mena and though she had many guards looking up at the sky to spot the creatures returning and pipe a warning corinn still moved fast she wove her way through the tables and benches and chairs that seemed to absurdly crowd menas balcony delivegu had given her no specific information on where the eggs might be in the gardens yes but it was no small space it could take hours to find them and this assumed they were real which was not something she could be sure of the night was crisp the moon lighting the stones and plants and furniture well enough she had dismissed menas staff but still still she felt a tingling urgency to and there they were corinn realized she had expected something grander than what she found but that suddenly seemed silly this was no foul nest like menas stories of maeben it was not elaborate it did not smell of death nor was it gilded four eggs nestled in a curl of fabric they were strangely shaped oblong and flatish with swirls of color set into a creamy base warm to the touch they gave her a certain joy it came right through her fingertips a welcome corinn looked around she held still for a long moment sure that she would hear and feel if anybody was observing her nobody was she slipped her hands down into the basin grasped the cloth in her hands and pulled the entirety of it out the eggs snug inside she sat down on a stone bench a little distance away cradling the bundle to her chest she could feel the life pulsing within them wonderful powerful fierce thats what they would be she whispered the notes of the song that had been building in her head she would sing to these children sing to them in the givers tongue so that when they emerged into the world they would do so in a form shaped to her needs she could not have elya but she would have her children yes they were lovely already full of goodness but it was not goodness that she would need in future days before then she would need weapons like none the known world had ever seen these babies would not be feathered timorous protectors they would be her warriors she sang all this into them and she knew they heard and liked what she was telling them they shifted inside their eggs shouldering and stretching the shells already eager to hatch and then the final thing her last work for that night late now in her room the lights dim and all her servants sent away the largest of the spells she had planned it would exhaust her she knew but she did not want to wait for another day there was strength in doing she realized there was power in using the song there were voices happy to aid her voices who in more and more tangible ways urged her on what choice did she have they asked everything was in danger she had to be able to trust someone completely someone whom the people would love and rally behind someone who would take part of the burden from her and carry it with her someone who had held the world in his hands already someone who loved her and would be truly by her side someone who would thank her for forgiving him barad the agitator from the mines of kidnaban a rebel a seditious treasonous poisonous barb in her sidea blind foolwas right she was alone she had been for years maybe she had been since the day she saw herself in the fingers of her dying mothers hands so many years ago when she was but a girl when first she learned how callous the world was that was then the things to come she could not do alone she did not face the future for herself and she did not want to face it by herself she did not have to she just had to take from one place and give to another in this case she had to take from her familys blood she understood that better now the voices helped her the song made more sense now the worm had a beauty as it turned and it helped her gain control she was not a child anymore awkward with her motions clumsy seeing a blurred world her hands were her own now each digit each contour and wrinkle and blemish they were her hands confident in this reassured by whispers from far away she opened her mouth and let out the song that would make for her what she wished death was not so great a barrier she had spent her life thinking it was the final the absolute the end the horrible curse but that was only part of it the voices helped her understand this as she sang it just seemed more and more obvious she had found a truth that escaped those with no knowledge of the givers tongue as she sang she peeled back the barriers between life and death as she sang she searched among the vague forms on the other side of what she had believed to be lifethough she knew the barrier was not the simple thing she had feared and there she found one of the ones she sought at first he was as diffuse as a scent lofting on a breeze spread thin and in communion with so much of the world she drew the traces of him in she sang and the farflung essence of him could not deny her invocation for a time it was like her words were hands and the one she sought was sand draining through her fingers but she sang the harder for it she pulled him toward her so forcefully that eventually he stood before her he was there upright diaphanous luminous at moments but also tangibly physical it was a he and she knew him though the details of his face moved and rippled and would not settle not yet what have you done he rasped like an aged man stirred from a dream of youth for a horrible moment corinn thought the figure was questioning every decision she had made since they had last seen each other she could never explain it all life had placed before her a thousand challenges each with a million barbed entanglements and dangers decisions had to be made and they fell upon nobody but her she had made them as best she could none could fault her none could understand her none could know what it meant to rule an empire none except perhaps the very one who had posed the question she realized time was passing and she had not answered the mans eyes bored into her he asked again what have you done this time she heard the question differently or chose to i have pulled you back to life why how could she answer she could say that she was afraid of the threat marching toward the known world she mistrusted herself now more than ever before and could no longer tell whether the things she did were for good or for ill she could explain that all the power she had amassed was nothing if she was blind to those who would harm her son she had so nearly lost aaden if that could happen what other horrors might yet await her she could have admitted that each weapon she heldher allies the league who lied to her with every other word the wine with which she would make a nation of obedient servants the song that even now danced out over the world stirring a worm deep in the bowels of the earth as it did sowas a twofaced treachery waiting to strike she should swear that she hated sending mena and dariel out as unwilling agents loathed that she seemed incapable of opening herself fully to them she might declare that she wanted none of these things to be so she needed him to help her remedy it all it was all too much to carry on a single pair of shoulders and if he would help her perhaps together they could chart a surer course together than either of them could alone she could have said that she doubted every high ideal that had ever escaped his lips but admitted that a part of her very much wanted to believe all this she might have said but she did not though she meant it all she also knew that she still clung to each writhing portion of the things she hated she was herself the twofaced treachery that she feared and that she wished he might save her from she was even now just a breath away from wishing she had summoned a different person altogether so instead of confessing everything she said because the world needs you things are not complete we need you in life not darkness darkness the figure asked he closed his eyes as if remembering the meaning of the word no death is not darkness nor have i forgotten life each moment brings new souls into the afterdeath they bring news of the living though it fades from them fast but i have not been dead to life he opened his eyes again i know of you and the things you have done corinn had not expected to say what she did then she had not even known she thought it but it was true and it felt very important to say it now then you know that only you can save me please as she waited for the answer the figure before her became that much more tangible just a little more solid not quite so transparent even though he remained vague and half formed the man held up a hand he nodded not in affirmation but to indicate that he would answer her it was an offer that deserved consideration and he was not so at peace with death that he would fail to think it through he just needed a few moments then he would answer her queen corinn akaran folded her hands in her lap and sat as straight backed as she could in her fatigue awaiting the spirits answer readyif he should acceptto whisper his name and complete the spell and bring him truly back into the world aliver akaran she would say and mean every word life needs you still i need you still come back fight the coming war at my side complete the work you left undone
