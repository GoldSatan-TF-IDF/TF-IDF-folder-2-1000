tom swan and the head of st george part three constantinople christian cameron foreword theres something very historical about writing an historical serial for epublication if its been done recently i havent heard about it and yet it has impeccable historical credentials before we had the epub we had the magazine and in that format dumas did it and conan doyle and a host of other authors with magnificent credentials harriet beecher stowe for example and charles dickens its a fine format instead of a single pulse of seven hundred manuscript pages the author can write in blocks with independent storylines that may still have an arc and a complex interweb of characters and motivations i was resistant but not for long so here is tom swan my first serial character tom is firmly based in history italy was full of itinerant englishmen especially soldiers throughout the period and so was greece i confess that the man who forms the basis for the character was not english but italian cyriac of ancona sometimes known as the grandfather of archaeology who roved the levant in search of antiquities and manuscripts that he could beg borrow or steal for the pope and other rich clients in their burning zeal to rediscover the ancient world ancient manuscripts were then and remain incredibly valuable recent rediscovery of a complete text of archimedes in a palimpsest shows that such manuscripts are still out there and give us an idea of the kind of treasures for which tom swan and cyriac of ancona searched if this serial has some success ill write more the format as i say is fun and allows me to explore some nooks and crannies of history and even some characters that id love to take to greater depth philokles in the tyrant series archilogos arimnestoss ionian adversary in the long war series geoffrey de charny in the late middle ages the list goes on and on and ill add pieces rapidly perhaps even one a month readers of my other books are aware that im a passionate reenactor and also a military veteran and that these experiences inform my writing those who are new to me deserve the following reassurance ive worn the clothes and armour and shot the bows and rowed and even ridden some of the horses in the process of working as an intelligence professional i met people who exercise real power every day and i got an idea of how they work and how history works but i dont do this in a vacuum and i receive an amazing level of support from friends fellow reenactors veterans academics crafts people and artists in those last categories id like to thank dario wielec who drew the illustrations he has a passion for historical detail that delights me every time i see his drawings from any period and you can see more of his stuff at httpdariocaballerosblogspotca finally the covers for the tom swan series are provided by albion swords who are to me the premier manufacturers of accurate replica swords in north america i use their products every day how many people can say that about swords chris cameron toronto june tom swan part three constantinople swan had the worst headache of his life in fact he found it hard to think difficult to concentrate almost impossible to understand what the people around him were saying after a long time he decided that he couldnt understand them because he didnt know the language they were speaking after more time he decided that they were speaking turkish but that made no sense as they often used words he knew how did i get here he wondered he was lying on a divan or a couch of some sort at the edge of a bareearth courtyard like the receiving entrance of a great house he lay there watching while a train of donkeys arrived with baskets of fruit and then he went to sleep once awake he realised that he was lying in the servants yard of a house a house in constantinople what happened he couldnt seem to remember he had gone riding with idris met the mans sister after that nothing damn he went to sleep again he woke again and it was dark oil lamps lit a bare room painted white with the edges of the walls decorated in bright stucco there were a dozen people eating on cushions at a low central table hes awake said a childs voice he looked at the foot of his couch and saw a small black boy he smiled he couldnt help himself the boy was so small and implike the boy smiled back a tall african man rose from the table he approached and knelt by swans low bed can you understand me he asked in slow italian swan nodded yes he said the african smiled and the smile lit his face like an internal lamp good i feared that i hit you too hard swan remembered the man something about a message where am i he asked the african smiled nowhere you need to remember he said how do you feel swan swung his feet to the floor sat up and groaned as the blood hit his head argh he moaned the african snapped his fingers and a veiled woman brought him a tall pottery cup drink this he said swan drank the drink had the same bitter salty taste as the stuff theyd drunk during the hawking suddenly he remembered it all hawking khatun beng端l the note he met the africans eyes just as he realised who the man was as the drink hit him sweet dreams englishman said the african we will not meet again when he came to he was hot boiling hot his skin seemed to give off steam he had oil on his skin he could feel it he smelled odd his head was exceptionally clear there was pain in his left temple but mostly this wonderful clarity the room he was in was dark perfumed and a single lamp glowed on a table it lit magnificent wall hangings full of patterns in which his eyes lost themselves and a silver lamp that hung unlit a ball of reflected sparkles and in his clarity of sight those reflections spoke to him of the infinity of spheres that aristotle said made up the universe a shadowy figure passed through a curtain at the darker end of the room and vanished he heard a murmur of sound turkish certainly a new taller figure entered through the curtain walked to the edge of the bed and sat gracefully beside him her hand touched his shoulder and ran down his side to his thigh and down his thigh between his legs hmm auntie said she stood and wriggled and then she was naked except for a chain around her waist and bangles at one wrist and one ankle i wish we had a language in common englishman she said in arabic her left hand ran expertly up between his legs she laughed never mind she said and knelt on the bed she leaned over and her breasts touched his chest her perfumed hair fell all around him he moaned she laughed and kissed him a little too hard and a little too fast it was as if he was delicate somewhere close a woman shouted another screamed auntie paused one finger flicked the head of his penis in arabic she said dont go anywhere she laughed and slipped off the bed swan even deep in the throes of lust noticed that she had a dagger in her hand everything seemed to be happening very slowly for the first time it occurred to him that hed been drugged auntie was magnificent naked in the light of a single lamp wick and he couldnt tear his eyes away she curved and curved there was a sound of running feet auntie said something softly swan would have sworn she said shit in some language or other she picked her long shawl off the floor and slipped it around her body swan tried to prop himself on his elbow but he didnt seem to be in full control of his body one part of him was working very well rather embarrassingly well the rest refused their duty she slipped out through the curtain another scream and the unmistakable sound of one blade on another he tried to get to his feet and failed his erection was comic and he giggled and fell back on the bed the colours of the wall hangings were deep and vibrant more like sounds than colours drugged he couldnt stop giggling a figure appeared at the curtain more running feet and more blades a second figure appeared my poor dear whispered khatun beng端l in italian and then my my my and a giggle wellmuscled arms lifted him he couldnt have resisted if hed wished to he was wrapped in a sheet and thrown over a mans shoulders he had the wind knocked out of him he could only see the floor through the curtain to a vestibule magnificent with gold writing persian there was a corpse face down on the tiled floor stairs a pool of blood and blood running down the steps like some sort of ghastly waterfall at the top of the steps behind them lay the african dead his head half severed by a scimitar and the blood ran on and on over the tiled floor down the steps like some ghastly waterfall beautiful in a way good christ the man carrying him ran down the steps and into another hall and then ran as hard as a man can run while carrying another man it was like a nightmare except that swan was never afraid they crossed a courtyard arched colonnaded and magnificent with glazed tiles and fine hangings even in his dream state swan realised hed been there before with horses up a flight of steps and there were lights appearing all along the top of the colonnade opposite faster said khatun beng端l and then they went through a door into a blaze of light through a set of beads and another and past a great set of double doors of cedar inset with ivory and silver and then he was unceremoniously lowered into a great trunk also of cedar he hit his head and admired the shooting stars that whirled around him khatun beng端ls head appeared framed in the light my poor frank she said her eyes shifted away and back a certain light came into her eyes and she leaned down and put her lips on his he responded instantly his face rose to hers the tip of her tongue caressed his and then she was gone someone slammed the lid of the trunk shut and he was alone in the darkness the extreme alertness didnt fade and he heard a male voice raised in anger but some rooms away perhaps out in the central courtyard and then another and a womans shrill as a fishwifes all in turkish then the sound of a mans hand knocking at the outer door khatun beng端l he cried khatun beng端l and then a long calm string of words in turkish he heard her even across several rooms go barefoot to the door of her apartments and open it turahanoglu omar reis even full of whatever hed been given he knew that voice khatun beng端ls father idriss father what am i doing here swan thought auntie must be his sister he thought his first piece of deductive reasoning in many hours things fell into place his fearless lassitude fell away and he was suddenly and completely terrified omar reis spoke to his daughter for a long time a need to piss began to creep into swans hierarchy of needs and his posture folded in the trunk was growing painful his lower legs were bent back under him his knees burned she said something imperious swan had been an adolescent he knew that tone she said something like fine do whatever you want more footsteps male and many of them after a while he decided that soldiers or servants were searching the place how dare you not in my room she said with all the drama of the young in arabic the cedar doors crashed open im going to die naked in a fancy trunk with a raging hardon swan couldnt decide whether to be more terrified or to laugh aloud drugged for sure drawers were opened a trunk was opened then another then a new voice calm level and wheedling idris then khatun beng端l a shriek of adolescent righteousness that crossed language and cultural barriers in a blaze of light his trunk was opened a crack swans fear made him virtually unable to breathe someones hand held the trunk open just a little idriss voice quite close all turkish swan had no idea what idris was saying he lay there waiting for the trunk to be opened farther the top was ajar about the breadth of a mans fingers khatun beng端l was weeping she said something through her tears idris sounded agitated now the fingers inside the trunk lid were those of a middleaged man the nails were clean but there were scars across all four and a great ring of silver gold and a bloodred stone engraved beautifully engraved with a running horse in greek the letters by the horse said eupatridae the wellborn the jewel of some ancient greek aristocrat two thousand years ago on the finger of a turkish warlord it had to be omar reiss hand swan had time to read the stone admire its age and say three ave marias the trunk slammed shut he heard khatun beng端ls sobs and her brothers gentle remonstrances and then silence time passed his cramps grew greater than his fear and then his need to piss grew greater than either time passed without a rush of feet or the blaze of light that would herald his death the last footsteps died away there were no more shouts from the courtyard the trunk lid was thrown back and khatun beng端l leaned in my poor englishman she said she extended him a slim hand and he took it and to his immense mortification he couldnt rise out of the box his feet and lower legs were pinned under him and there was no feeling in them at all you must come she said he raised himself on his arms and she pulled on his legs until they came free he couldnt feel them at all it was the oddest and in some ways the most terrifying feeling he couldnt stand she couldnt carry him you must do better if my father finds you here he will have to kill you swan looked at her for a moment my lady he said in arabic you brought me here she looked at him and wrinkled her nose so i was in no ahem danger where i was his arabic wasnt well suited to the situation he didnt know any words to convey anything salacious auntie intended to fuck you and then sell you to the armenians khatun beng端l said matteroffactly in prim italian i assumed you would prefer to remain free and alive she smiled utterly desirable perhaps aunties body is worth your life his legs were beginning to tingle i cant move until i get feeling back in my legs he said ah she said she looked him over are you always so solid she asked with a giggle ive been drugged he said he was finding it difficult to sound dashing romantic or even clever i wonder what she gave you khatun beng端l said she must have been very exciting his feet were tingling and his upper legs were hurting a great deal he gritted his teeth you are far more beautiful than your auntie he said time to take the offensive bah you just say that you would have rutted with her like a dog why did i even save you she said she leaned over him are you going to be sick he shook his head have you ever gone to sleep on your arm she laughed i see so you are in pain yes he said somewhat tartly i wish i might discover what drug my auntie used she said indeed his tumescence hadnt reduced not from pain nor time she sat next to him on the edge of the trunk how much longer do you think before you can walk he could barely speak soon he said in arabic does it hurt very much she asked yes he admitted she leaned over and brushed her lips against his it was remarkable how instantly his concern for his legs and the pain there receded her left hand went around his neck and stroked down shoulder blade spine one nail just scratching along the lines and troughs of his muscles her tongue brushed his her right hand voices in the courtyard she stood up and pulled him to his feet flowers of pain blossomed at his ankles and ran down and up and he stumbled and fell despite her grip on him but he got a foot under himself pushed to his feet grabbed her pulled her to him and kissed her he put his right hand on her left breast through her robe felt the nipple and she moaned khatun beng端l called a voice in the courtyard she stiffened dont forget me swan said he tried to find something from the greek poets something to say but his brain was on fire with lust and his legs were afire with pain khatun beng端l came omar reiss voice were dead khatun beng端l said she was clearly shocked to her core it should be my brother out there window swan asked there are no windows in a virgins rooms none that face out she reached for him we are going to die swan had the oddest feeling that this had happened before perhaps it had of course it might be that a doting father would kill only the lover the foreign lover whose death would nicely suit the political situation discrediting the embassy christ ive been had at every level auntie wasnt going to sell me to the armenians auntie was going to play the outraged sister and pass me to the wolf of thrace windows into the yard he asked she pointed mutely at the ornate curtained frame visible through her chamber door it let directly on to the courtyard he went to it as swiftly as his feet allowed and peered through the curtain he could see idris six feet away with a sword and a trio of turks hard men with lined faces and curved swords khatun beng端l im coming in her father said my sister is very angry khatun beng端l was petrified she wasnt playacting she was literally unable to move ill be stoned to death she sobbed i never thought father would come back he said he looked around she had her own apartment with her own slaves and servants six rooms all of which opened off a single door to the secondfloor balconies that lined the arched colonnades of the courtyard bedroom sitting room clothes room he was stumbling from room to room now slaves pretending to be asleep a small workroom with steps going down thats the first place theyll look she cried the kitchen go and talk to your father he said he put an arm around her waist and kissed her we wont die he let go and ran down the steps his unwanted erection bouncing along like an extra limb the outer door of the apartment opened khatun beng端l roared omar reis swan came to the bottom of the steps there wasnt even a separate window to the courtyard hed have taken his chances with that but he was in a stone chamber lined with shelves a pantry there were two curtained doorways if hes here hes a dead man omar reis said auntie says you have polluted yourself there was something in omar reiss manner even through his terror swan realised that the turk knew he knew everything ive been had curiously the knowledge that the turkish lord had set him up probably set him up to be caught with the auntie wheels within wheels stiffened his spine he grew calm if i get through this alive im going to get that bastard he heard the sound of soft turkish boots on the stone steps two doors he slipped through the nearest it was dark he tried to feel his way silently around hoping against hope that there was a trunk a barrel anything to give him a chance he began to consider fighting naked against a professional he stubbed his toe hard fell against cool stone and smelled water a well cover open why not it was indoors turkish voices ten feet away two of them he jumped into the well if you ever want to understand the true meaning of fear jump into a deep hole in total darkness and test your feelings as you fall swan fell his right shoulder impacted heavily on something that hurt him and then he was in water deep cold water he struck it badly and it knocked the wind out of him and he went too deep sputtering it was all he could do not to breathe he didnt know which way the surface was he didnt know if he had enough air in his lungs to allow him to float he was losing it a great bubble escaped him a gob of air lost it rippled past his face im upside down bubbles rise he reversed himself let out another tiny bubble of air and swam a panicked wild thrashing swim but his head broke the surface and smacked into something stone in pitch darkness he took three breaths then he had to swim and his fingers hit stone over his head when he tried a shallower stroke he hit his head again it finally came through im going to die here im in a well he took another breath and reached up he ran his fingers across the stone using his buoyancy to press him against the ceiling i fell from somewhere damn it somewhere within a few feet was an opening he scraped an elbow bumped his shoulder and the feeling of the air on his face changed his head bobbed free there was something under his left hand and he held it an edge for a very long time he simply clung to the edge resting breathing it was a ledge it was quite wide and under only a few inches of water he reached up as far as he could reach and there was no ceiling he got a knee up on the ledge it seemed the hardest thing hed ever done he half lay on the underwater ledge for many many breaths then he got the other leg up he knelt the drug had finally worn off he was pleased to note he crouched on the ledge he wasnt dead but that was about all he could say he was now bitterly cold and very tired it was completely dark utterly dark how exactly do i get myself into these things he began to explore cautiously his rational mind said that he would be weaker later his questing arms found a column he put his back against it and stood cautiously waiting for the feeling of stone against his head all the way but when he was standing tall he felt as if there was still a great deal of space above him there was another ledge above the one he was on it was six feet above him and he only found it because his hands were feeling for the ceiling he got his fingers over the edge and then his hands and then his arms he didnt make a conscious decision he jumped pushed with his arms and he was lying on cool dry stone he instantly revised his chances of survival this was intentional this shelf it was like a path he crawled six feet and felt the drop just in time the shelf ended abruptly it fell away to the water swan knew that at this point if he went back to the water hed die he was just barely managing to keep the panic in check but under the clarity of his thinking was an abyss of pain and fear he was close to losing it the thought im going to die alone in the dark was fully formed and very close he turned with infinite patience and crawled very slowly back the way hed come he knew he was on new ground when he came to rock with no water on it he crawled and crawled after ten minutes he knew that he was going somewhere further it occurred to him that the air was fresh im not in a well he thought or rather hoped at the next column he pulled himself into a crouch and then sat with his back against the pillar after a while his back warmed the pillar he wrapped his arms around himself and shivered he tried to think of khatun beng端ls body of her lips or violantes or tildas but the darkness was all around him and he was cold and it is very hard to be brave in the dark alone when you are cold and wet but he must have slept because he woke and there was light not much light but after hours of complete darkness it might have been direct sunlight he wasnt in a well he was in some sort of underground canal the canal had a ledge underwater probably for workmen to stand on while they cleared obstructions and pollutions above that was a walkway on which hed crawled he looked back he could see the end about forty feet behind him hed crawled forty feet he sighed he looked down into the water it was only about six feet deep it had a current and a few yards away it flowed out from under an arch so hed swum been floated under that arch somewhere there would be an entrance if workmen came here he got to his feet his arms were covered in bruises and he had tender places on his head his hands looked as if hed been in a fight he started walking after what had to have been a mile an incredible distance underground there were steps and then the tunnel split the water came down a small waterfall he flashed on the blood running down the steps and suddenly he thought why did khatun beng端l kill to get me none of it made any sense or rather it all made a scary kind of sense like the sorts of dramas that had played out at englands royal court he turned right because he had a feeling about how the canal ran hed read his classics the water must come from an aqueduct that meant since water flowed downhill that he was now going east towards the venetian quarter he had begun to look at every lighthole they were evenly spaced for the most part twenty feet or more over his head as he walked he began to make a plan after a while he laughed aloud because if he was planning then his brain was working and he didnt think he was going to die which was funny because he was still alone and naked and cold but an hour later he climbed through a set of obstructions into brighter light he could see people hed been hearing them for half an hour the sides of the cistern had long since collapsed and become a public fountain and on one side a pair of small boys bathed while on the other their mothers filled jars they were greek women he could hear them speaking greek he moved carefully behind a pillar despoina he called out i need help in the name of christ the two women drawing water startled like deer they both looked around ive escaped from the turk im naked and i need clothes i promise i can pay please help me he said in what he hoped was his most complacent and charming greek the nearer of the two women made a motion with her hand to the other show yourself heretic she said he called out im naked all the better she said drawing a knife from her gown let me see you she ordered swan emerged from the columns she laughed a frank truly you are not lying she spat why should i save you you franks are worse than the turks money save me and i will pay swan backed away she looked around truly you will pay so will the turks i would guess eh she asked and waved the knife at him the other woman laughed he is young and handsome she made an obscene gesture and naked half an hour later he was at the gates of the venetian quarter dressed as a greek woman silently head averted he handed a folded note to the janissary who passed it in to the venetian guard alessandro appeared ill answer for this woman he said coolly the janissary saluted and smirked and swan followed his capitano where the fuck have you been alessandro said i was set up i survived he shook his head i escaped how do you come to be dressed like a woman like a greek woman alessandro asked its complicated swan said alessandro stopped and shocked him by embracing him well done he said what well done for not getting killed swan asked given the way things are going not getting killed gets a pass alessandro said after a lot of sleep he sat with a cup of wine in alessandros room this is how i see it he said omar reis planned to use me his sister planned to use me and sell me but omar reis always intended to make an unpleasant incident of the whole thing and kill me alessandro fingered his beard had i been caught red handed so to speak the sultan might have refused the embassy or merely used it as a pretext to keep us waiting alessandro shrugged as if he needs a pretext the venetian leaned forward i should send you across to galata before the turks send for you swan looked out into the sunlight warm and dry with wine in him the whole thing was beginning to seem more like an adventure i dont think omar reis can admit i was in his house he must know he knows you werent here his janissaries must tell him of every movement here yes but can he admit that i penetrated his sanctum swan enjoyed his double entendre and lived to tell of it alessandro fingered his beard what if i never returned swan asked what alessandro said all the janissary knows is that you brought in a greek whore swan finished his wine i think ive thought this through give me peter and some money im going to disappear and im going to get the cardinals library out of his house and maybe some other things he nodded to himself i may even manage to get these things shipped over to galata alessandro nodded you think you can use the sewers to get into his house swan was crestfallen that the venetian saw so quickly through his plan yes alessandro nodded this is an excellent plan he said let me give you a word of advice swan nodded do not i beg leave to repeat myself do not seek to avenge yourself on omar reis alessandro rose and poured more wine we have our date the sultan will receive the papal ambassador in three days time we are to leave the city immediately after alessandro handed him wine whatever you do you must be back in three days and no revenge understood swan nodded of course not that would be stupid an hour later he had exchanged notes with simon several hours later a greek wine merchant came into the venetian quarter and sold candian wine to the venetians by the hogshead from two wagons a servant jumped down from the rear wagon and found alessandro and gave him a package alessandro handed it over to swan it contained a set of directions and a full set of clothes ragged greek clothes swan shook his head when do i get to dress well he asked and became a ragged greek veteran a penniless beggar peter became another such alessandro shook his head your whole plan depends on this jew yes and no swan said i have something for him as well then he and peter went into the shadow of the gate together they waited their moment and while the greek wine merchants wagons stopped by the janissary they slipped out the two of them moved carefully peter was too tall to avoid notice but swan needed him he almost laughed aloud when a pair of greeks stopped and gave them alms at least you fought said the elder he clasped peters hand hes lost his voice swan said we fought and well keep fighting the two men looked both pleased and guilty they handed over more coins and walked away quickly peter shook his head theyre afraid he said in french swan followed the route as laid down by simon he assumed that simon was having them watched checking to see that they were alone he hoped so after walking over half the city they came down third hill on a steep street as they descended a heavy grain wagon pulled across the narrow street a pair of men jumped down they had crossbows get on said the one who looked as if someone had burned his face off the second man stood well clear of them a small boy in the back of the wagon lifted the edge of a tarpaulin and they slipped in under the load of hay it was stifling hot and swan immediately had to sneeze i dont like this said peter the wagon rattled and clanked over the streets it had no suspension and swans head cracked against the bottom several times before he found a better way to lie he sneezed and sneezed and one of the guards ordered him to be quiet peter put a linen coif none too clean over his mouth were passing a guard post he hissed swan managed to keep his sneezes to himself for a hundred long heartbeats and then the wagon was moving again moments later the top was stripped back and simon was standing with six armed men what have you done he asked but he seemed more amused than anything you promised me a secret and a profit in your note he said swan sneezed later dressed in an ornate robe and curly slippers swan leaned back on comfortable cushions so you are an agent of the cardinal simon said perhaps swan said my only orders are to retrieve his library can you help me simon rocked his head from side to side perhaps it is risky everything is watched right now you know that a great many of the christian relics have gone missing from hagia sophia from the monasteries from private houses the sultan is furious none of my concern im here for books when im done you may have the house swan said simon made a face is it yours to give of course swan said ill have your brother send you a deed he shrugged a palace near the hippodrome for some information and a little smuggling simon lay back and drank quaveh let me understand this he said i get you to the house from the venetian quarter you go inside and prepare the items you want to ship i ship them to galata for you and i keep the cardinals house swan nodded it was an excellent plan and the only hitch he could see was that simon planned to sell him out he could see it on the mans face damn it why are people so greedy how long will you be simon asked at least a week swan answered an utter lie in his head hed already discarded simon that long simon said why it will take me that long to figure out what to take and what to leave swan said embroidering as he went ill contact you when were ready you get us from the venetian quarter to the cardinals house ill take care of the rest in fact in his head he was already moving on to his next plan but he needed to part amicably from this man before he chose to betray swan immediately he and peter said their goodbyes and slipped out of the jewish quarter at the guard change they were followed hes going to sell us swan said peter sighed i wondered we have to disappear luckily we can swan took a deep breath lets buy food they walked back towards the venetian quarter swans fear at every corner was that the two men following them simons men would sell them to the turks on the spot but they made it to the market and purchased meat pies and then they cut across the ruins of the old forum down the steep sides of the collapsed fountain and into the sewers no one following them had had a sightline or so swan had to hope an hour later they were in the underground cisterns eating meat pies made of the same parts of the cow and the pig that were used in meat pies in london there was more pepper but the taste was strangely familiar peter looked at the apparently endless arches receding into the distance this was built by men swan slapped him on the back im glad you like it well be down here for a long time as it proved it took them two days and a night to find bessarions house and explore the system they were involved in necessary adventures including the theft of a ladder from a monastery and carrying it underground and above ground for almost a mile another theft of rope and a tedious amount of sneaking through alleys dropping coloured cloth through the gratings and then hurrying below to see where exactly they were once swan had to hope his greek was sufficient and went above to purchase supplies he walked carefully watched carefully and dealt with the deafest old woman he could find in the main market by the hippodrome when they were sure reasonably sure that they had the right well swan lay on the walkway on a stolen blanket and drew a map of every part of the sewers and cisterns as he knew them as far as he could see the canals were underground cisterns carrying water from the aqueducts to supply the hippodrome and the palace quarter and any houses lucky enough to be along the major water routes great houses simply had a well cover that opened into a shaft that ran down into the cistern some houses had private cisterns and there was more than one cistern system and they didnt all link up or rather in the time he had swan couldnt see where they linked and he and peter often had to cross an alley or a small hill above ground carrying all their tools stumbling lost in a darkened city the main canals or cisterns had iron rings every so often and nautical bollards at intersections clearly for tying small boats against the current swan couldnt discern whether there were still maintenance crews working as far as he could see the newest stonework was two hundred years old or older and there were four major caveins unrepaired we need a boat he said as he sketched his map peter shook his head people built this he said again he found wonder in everything the grafitti the underground mosaics the bronze fittings where no one could see them no one is this rich the old romans were this rich swan said imagine fresh water in every house peter said we need a boat swan insisted ill just steal one on the waterfront and carry it through the streets shall i peter asked swan stopped drawing the charcoal pinched in his fingers mary and joseph he said there must be a water gate peters head came up he grinned i know who can get us a boat swan said lets cast east it took the rest of the day but they found that the eastern branch of the sewer did indeed run down all the way to the sea it ended at a grate like a portcullis strong iron carefully wrought the water ran out into the sea swans legs hurt from climbing and crawling but he looked at the sea with infinite satisfaction thalatta thalatta he said whats that peter asked thats our way out my friend swan watched for a while and began to search around the water gate for signs of use there were several very cautiously indeed he pushed against the great iron gate he found scratches on the floor that proved it had been opened repeatedly and recently he climbed up the rough stone inside the gate and near the top he found the simple bolt that held it fast he released it felt the heavy iron start to swing and shoved it back with his shoulder almost losing his grip he put the bolt back and dropped to the walkway we can open it whenever we want from inside he said he pointed out the headland opposite were south of galata look at the current peter nodded our galley can drop down on the tide and pass within a stones throw of right here he nodded to himself nightfall or daybreak would be best peter rubbed his beard it would be all or nothing he said if the galley misses the boat the boat is swept away on the current never to be seen again swan grinned peter shook his head i pity the poor bastards in the boat save your pity swan said youll be with them that evening they climbed the ladder up the wellshaft into what they believed to be cardinal bessarions constantinople house despite his meticulous scouting swans heart beat like an armourers hammer smoothing metal as he climbed the ladder as far as it would go then he threw the rope with a grapnel it went up and then it came down and nearly hit him on the head damn swan said peter nodded ill just climb down and wait for you to do this on your own he said swan waited for the archer to climb down then he tossed the grapnel as high as he dared and covered his head nothing happened head still covered he tugged the rope it seemed to have caught suddenly his whole plan for climbing out of the well seemed very very foolish he climbed the rope anyway he tied a second rope to the ladder hoping it would break his fall and then he was in he could smell old incense and there was enough light in the sky to see that he was in a kitchen and that someone had opened the grain pithoi set into the floor enough light to see the row of palettes where people slept kitchen slaves perhaps and enough light to see the sword held at eye height pointed at his face on the positive side it was a european sword and the man behind it looked greek its not always easy to take note of a mans appearance when hes looking at you over a sword but the greek was very handsome with a small pointed beard and moustache excellent skin and a strong chin he was heavily muscled like an athlete or a rower im from cardinal bessarion swan said the young man he was no older than swan breathed out christos anesti he said christ is risen he looked at swan weve been waiting swan lost a few hundred heartbeats when he saw how precariously his grapnel had grabbed the very edge of the well cover he vowed never ever to do such a foolish thing again peter came up the rope the young mans name was apollinaris he spoke perfect italian i work for the cardinal he said proudly are you his steward swan asked im a philosopher the young man said sometimes an actor he frowned sometimes i steal secrets and im an astrologer and a hermeticist swan looked the young man over are you alone here no apollinaris said my whole troupe is here troupe swan felt as if he was missing something were mimes we perform mimes and ancient plays apollinaris shook his head you are a barbarian i see peters head emerged from the well this is peter my friend peter this young man is apollinaris he says he is swan hesitated a philosopher and the leader of a troupe of actors good christ peter said im not the leader apollinaris said nikephorus is the leader i see swan said the young man was on edge and swan had the oddest feeling that the young man was an escaped lunatic he seemed to bounce slightly on the balls of his feet as if overfilled with spirit apollinaris leaned over the well did you really come from the sewers i always meant to explore them swan shrugged am i right in assuming you need to get er out of constantinople he asked apollinaris nodded cardinal bessarion sent a coded message and said he was sending someone to pick us up he said he sagged but that was months ago swan delivered a long string of obscenities peter arched an eyebrow of course he didnt tell us what else could his eminence do what you dont know you cant reveal the fleming sounded vaguely envious books he said relics the head of saint george swan all but spat a troupe of actors you know about the head asked the young man we have it swan crossed himself something he very rarely did you have it yes we stole it from the turks apollinaris seemed very matteroffact about the whole thing he led them down a hall and up a servants stair at the top he knocked softly at a pair of double doors they opened inside stood an enormous man with a cocked crossbow a normally sized older man with another and two women with the muscles of dancers wearing mens clothing and with turkish bows theyre from cardinal bessarion apollinaris said the room had pigeonholes in the walls from floor to fifteenfoot ceilings and every pigeonhole was filled with scrolls scrolls lay on the floor and more were in baskets by the chairs in the middle of the room was a vast table and in the centre of the table sat a reliquary slightly smaller than a mans helmet it looked to be made of solid gold studded with pearls enamel work and jewels swan took it all in the crossbows didnt waver prove it said the big man in greek how swan asked the man looked confused look ive come a long way i thought i was coming for some books but it appears ive been sent to get you lot i have an escape plan and all i need is a boat if you dont want to come thats fine the whole time swan was speaking he was looking at the reliquary it was incredible first he wasnt sure hed ever seen so much gold in one place at one time secondly the workmanship was exquisite divine amazing thirdly it was covered almost vulgarly so in jewels swan wasnt a jeweller but he was pretty sure he was looking at diamonds and rubies large ones one of the dancers stepped between him and the reliquary we stole it she said its ours peter fell on his knees so did swan he couldnt help himself he was twenty years old and hed been a devout christian for every minute of the time his mother had seen to that he didnt make a conscious decision to kneel he just did apollinaris grinned it really is the head of saint george he said may i touch it swan asked filled with the same vague piety that infected him when he was around cardinal bessarion the woman smiled yes i suppose she stepped back how are you getting us out of here how long have you been here swan asked since the siege apollinaris shrugged eventually wed have abandoned the head and left the city theres no getting it out the turks know it is missing and theyll stop at nothing to get it this from the older man swan felt foolish but something made him approach the object on his knees he shuffled along until he reached the low table and he opened the reliquary it had a magnificent door like the door to a miniature cathedral inside was a brown skull a cross had been inlaid into the smooth bone of the forehead otherwise it was just a skull and a very old one they say that whoever has the head of saint george cannot be harmed by monsters or demons by weapons even by torture said the prettier of the two dancers she bowed im irene and im andromache said the other we are acrobats and actors swan smiled and stood youre the old woman at the gate she smiled back and you are the turk the giant bowed constantios at your service he said stiffly the older man bowed as well nikephorus he said he smiled bitterly nikephorus dukas swan tore his eyes from the relic of the noble dukas family he asked one small branch devoted to learning we cannot all be busy ruining the empire he shrugged as if his words were of no account then he pointed at the skull familiarity will make you more comfortable with it he said i confess we were silent for days after we took it it is like living with a gate into heaven said irene she laughed but softly as if she was in church i am too much a sinner to be comfortable living with such a gate swan reached out and touched the skull just for a moment the world went white blank nothing no noise no sight he found he was on his knees again oh my god he said nikephorus nodded exactly if the head was spectacular the library was staggering this is all bessarions swan asked as he unrolled a scroll that seemed to have six plays in greek all lined up together he lacked the true connoisseurs knowledge but the scrolls seemed to be very old the first play was entitled taxiarchoi taxiarchs were the archangels in greek not all of it by any means nikephorus said some of it was mine and some apollinaris laughed most of it we stole or borrowed i prefer to use the term rescued swan read a few lines the main character was the god dionysus so that the play in question wasnt about archangels at all after a moment he guffawed in the scene he was reading a weapons master was trying to teach the god of wine to be a soldier swan had no idea how ancient the play might be but just for a moment he had an odd almost haunted feeling as if the author of the play might be watching him it was funny deeply funny nikephorus nodded that was mine i collected all the plays i could find from the ancient world he shook his head i used to fear that the patriarch and his monks would find out and i would be prosecuted who is this eupolis swan asked nikephorus bit his lip then he smiled i dont really know he admitted with a grandiloquent gesture irene laughed and clapped her hands ive never heard you say that before old man swan looked at another scroll and who was heraklitus he asked a philosopher nikephorus said i havent even read that one he sighed the suda you know the suda swan smiled not at all i fear nikephorus brightened while your ancestors were living in mud huts in hyperborea my dear young man our monks were writing detailed encyclopedias of classical learning he shook his head classical learning comes and goes in fashion and tolerance he said somewhat peevishly as if continuing his train of thought he said i feared all the wrong things and now my whole world is gone heraklitus was a philosopher like aristotle like plato swan asked earlier i think nikephorus said not my field swan looked up at the scrolls hundreds of them are any of these aristotle he asked all this irene said smiling twenty scrolls sat in niches under a small marble bust this is an ancient statue of the man himself swan had that haunted feeling again he took a scroll down an hour later a dirty christian beggar stopped a small jewish beggar on the street i need to get a message to king david the christian said the boy nodded sure boss he said in greek just knock it in peter said swan didnt like waste he prowled around the wellhead because if they knocked it to pieces it would be obvious to everyone how theyd escaped and swan liked to leave mystery behind him when he could it made for a better prank a finer jest and practically speaking while he wasnt sure who would be following him he had a feeling on hands and knees he found the deep crack that ran around the heavy marble block that held the cast bronze and stone wellhead under the drysink he found a pair of holes in the marble cut in at an angle even better leaning against the wall he found two iron bars which fitted into the wellhead block it took four of them to lever it up when they were done they had an opening the size of a small cart leading down into the darkness after dark a wagon rolled up to the gate peter and constantios watched it with bows drawn while the two dancers covered the street and swan went out the door into the courtyard isaac slipped off the wagon box a boat he asked its not even illegal to get a boat you summoned me to get you a boat he glared you know who i am simon means to sell me to the turks swan said you isaac froze i find that sometimes this sort of talk saves time swan said there are more plots here than in the bible i want to make a straight deal i will give you some very valuable items and some information and you will provide me with this boat and take a single message to the venetian quarter and well part friends and be available to help each other another time simon wont ever get to betray me which hell live to be glad of and ill survive to take your letters back to venice why would i need you to carry my letters isaac asked i assume you plan to play the venetian markets based on the sultans invasion of the morea swan shrugged i would isaac laughed not bad why trust me he asked swan shrugged it saves time and if everyone here is going to sell me im dead i have to trust someone i agree isaac rubbed his beard im just not sure anyone has ever chosen me as the one to trust before he laughed i like you mad englishman swan grinned come back in two days everything you find in the house is yours swan handed over a note see to it this goes to alessandro in the venetian quarter like your packet theres nothing in it worth reading isaac smiled mirthlessly balthazar said he liked you he said so i will extend the courtesy of honesty i can give you a day perhaps the two you want then i have to sell you or i look bad to the grand turk if you can make it two swan said i will count it an honest deal isaac bowed i will do my best swan took his hand and they embraced briefly an hour later the boat was floating fully loaded in the current then they all climbed up one more time swept the floors and the fireplaces and the women went out and dumped the ash everything else went into the sewers until the house was clean then they levered the wellhead back into position and slid down the rope and then irene climbed the wall like a spider and retrieved the rope what do we do with the ladder apollinaris asked swan smiled float it with us not far he muttered swan led them along the sewers following his map after the first arch foundations he assumed of the old city walls passing under the arch required very careful management of the boat and the floating ladder but they got through mostly dry swan counted the wells above them and then stopped cut loose the ladder and raised it on to the walkway he grinned at peter and offered no explanation and they were away again in moments the second time they had to pass under an arch everyone had to swim and nikephorus who couldnt had to hold on to the back of the boat the older man was clearly terrified and equally clearly in control of himself to a degree that caused him to rise high in swans estimation irenes figure also caught swans attention cold but triumphant they passed east almost a mile moving easily downstream once they had to get out on to the walkway empty the boat and carry everything around an obstruction where the street above had collapsed into the cavern but there was water on the other side and by late afternoon swan found them a campsite hed scouted in the days before dont go anywhere he insisted tomorrow at sunset out the water gate ill meet you if i cant come follow peter peter came and stood with him is this situation covered by my wages he asked swan considered the question no he said peter nodded would you consider me off my head if i said i want a share swan considered this too im still not quite sure how i make a ducat out of this he said but i couldnt help but notice that you filled your quiver with the cardinals scrolls i may be the only archer in the world with a quiver full of aristotle its true peter nodded you are a far better thief than i am swan said quietly nonsense peter looked at the acrobats you stole the head of saint george i saw you swan considered denial then he shrugged peter nodded so im in for a share so noted what happened when you touched it peter asked try yourself and see its real peter made a noise of derision the gold and jewels are real swan shrugged as you will im off to the venetian quarter dont get lost peter nodded it was after dark when he dropped over the wall from the pisan quarter into the venetian shutters opened when he inadvertently overturned a handcart he kept moving the inn in which the embassy were staying almost defeated him with high walls and a gated entrance on the first level surrounded by high buildings in the venetian gothic manner it was an impenetrable fortress to a lone beggar he walked all the way around its block heard voices and found the stables now empty the stables didnt have any windows but as in buildings with illpaid servants the world over there was an obvious place to climb the wall swan was up and over and in the back yard where once there had been a working fountain and horse troughs in a happier time a door was open at the back of the inn and light seemed to flood out into the yard brilliantly illuminating the man who stood there he was talking to a woman who stood with her back to the light they blocked the door and access swan spent a weary halfhour listening to them flirt and considering the irony hed crossed constantinople undetected and now couldnt pass his own inn door because of a flirting couple you only want one thing you dirty lecher said the woman with a laugh you want it too my darling my pomegranate the man cooed my pomegranates arent all they were either she said why do i even listen to your nonsense because the night is warm and you are beautiful does this work on other women lout there are no other women divine one she laughed in toms expert opinion the whole thing was just a matter of time he sat on his haunches in the shadow of the old horse yard not here lout no one will come aphrodite you are right that no one will come here not me and not you i need you navel of the world oh he had her kirtle open she had to have cooperated in that part and swan gave him full points whoever he was he was trying to get farther aboard her in the doorway swan cursed his hurry but she was of the same mind as swan and boxed the mans ears as it turned out her notion of privacy was the stable which suited swan they made their way across the yard one amorous exchange per step for two people who seemed to him too old to care they protracted the trip across the yard with more moans and caresses than he felt were possible but eventually they vanished into the stables and he ghosted across the inner yard and in through the kitchen door the great inn kitchen was empty he stripped off his overrobe threw it in the fire climbed the steps with his bag on his shoulder and walked boldly to alessandros room he was now a frank exactly where he was supposed to be alessandro was alone by the virgin he said when swan came in swan grinned alessandro he said happily listen capitano i have been to the cardinals house he watched alessandros face but the venetian gave nothing away yes i found a troupe of acrobats living there he said alessandro raised an eyebrow eh he said either it was the finest performance swan had ever seen or alessandro knew nothing they claim to be spies working for our cardinal he shrugged they claim they have a message from the cardinal saying that someone would come and take them out of constantinople alessandro nodded and stroked his short beard i see he said slowly it occurred to me that they might be lying swan said alessandro shrugged he has many agents so you werent told perhaps when i was asleep go and fetch the troupe of acrobats put that way it sounded insane alessandro rubbed his chin again the cardinal is most scrupulous at keeping all of us apart especially those he calls day workers from those he calls night workers swan nodded did you get my note alessandro nodded i didnt have to do anything the bishop has already sent for the ship ser marco will take us off from the quay at evensong tomorrow everyone is packed swan breathed a sigh is the bishop ready the word is hes to be humiliated that we will watch a procession of christian slaves taken by omar reis and see the turkish army setting off to take the morea i know alessandro shrugged truly i fear tomorrow the bishop is a small man and may behave badly am i with you tomorrow or not alessandro scratched his ear i think i can use your wit are we going armed swan asked and armoured we are the bodyguard he is allowed in his letters he crossed his arms best we get some sleep yes swan said an hour later he was making his way along the underground sewers his oil lamp making a tiny glow in the immense darkness of the caverns under the silent city every step he took was foolish he was afraid and yet elated and a fool he had no need to try this he was attempting to navigate the sewers at night without anyone to help him that was foolish if he fell and so much as twisted an ankle his entire enterprise would fail he kept walking i dont need to do this he told himself again but he kept walking he thought it must be midnight when he arrived at the ladder just where he had left it it took him some minutes to raise it alone and he made considerable noise eventually he got the base firmly seated on the walkway and the top inside the wellhead khatun beng端ls wellhead then he paused one foot on a rung of the ladder so i made it here i have the ladder up i can walk away this is insane he found that he was climbing the ladder he shook his head at himself two rungs from the top he rested his back against the wells wall probably just where his shoulder had struck in falling he thought shook his head insane he took the coil of rope off his shoulder and secured the grapnel im sure i swore yesterday never to do this again what if there are people in the kitchen smiling at his own foolishness he tossed the grapnel straight up he did cover his head which was good as it fell back with a lot of noise he sighed paid out one more coil of rope took the grapnel by the stock and threw he heard it hit outside the well he pulled and it came quite easily he pulled it in very slowly dragging it across the stones of her kitchen and it caught he pulled again and it stayed tight caught on some tiny projection or on the crossbeam he went up putting as little weight on the grapnel as possible his back against one wall of the well feet against the opposite wall walking up as hed seen the acrobat girl do earlier she was nice she was pretty why am i doing this up and up at the top he stopped to listen the cover still wasnt on the well his back and sides hurt and his neck he went over the edge screaming eunuchs didnt kill him so he decided after a few moments that he was still safe he paused at the curtain to the stairwell now i can slip down the rope and go i did it i entered her apartment undetected no need to go any farther his soft leather boots made no sound on the steps as he climbed he paused at the curtained doorway to the slave quarters and listened her slaves were silent several were snoring he stopped outside the cedar and silver door it was just as he remembered it if she screams im dead this is foolish in fact this gives foolish a whole new perspective he put a hand on her door it was locked a german lock england had german locks it took him longer than he expected to open it he had to find the tool in his belt purse and it took him far too long to realise that the local workmen had installed the lock upside down click i could just let this go dont try for revenge on omar reis he opened the door very very slowly he had to fight the sudden feeling that it was all a trap the wave of paranoia came and went and he could smell the fear he had exuded he slid into the room closed the door with infinite patience he could hear her breathing it was soft and regular he went to her bedside and put a hand on her mouth thinking it is now officially too late to back out hello he said remember me she hesitated and then threw her arms around his neck then he put his mouth over her mouth no she said and pinned his legs with her own she was very strong there was one lamp lit and she was magnificent no she said she smiled dont be angry it is a matter of life and death she leaned over him and licked his lips listen ive read books there are a thousand other things we can do apparently there were he kissed her at the wellhead and the whole process began again hed meant it to be a kiss goodbye it didnt have that effect but eventually she let him go down the rope or rather he forced himself out of her arms against his own will she dropped the grapnel to him after he was on the ladder and blew him a kiss at the base of the ladder he could still see her light he felt an intense temptation to climb right back up but there had been a change in the air of her apartments and slaves rise early he could smell her on his skin smell her perfume which seemed to be in every fold of linen and silk in her room and on every part of her body rose and lavender and an eastern scent he didnt know and her own scent musky and heady and strong he smelled her on his hands and smiled and then after wrapping his clothes in a leather sack that would be waterproof for some minutes he leaped into the water he swam downstream in the cistern under the arch of the great wall and again he found that darkness and deep water combined to panic him even when he knew that there was an opening at the far end he emerged and pulled himself out on to the walkway stronger this time and sack on shoulder walked all the way to the end of the main cistern he dressed quietly surprised to find that the scent of rose and lavender still clung to him and climbed out of the cistern by the access doors he crossed the main square walked partway down the hill and entered the next system it was very dark and when he saw the small fire that the acrobats had burning he was very happy he approached as quietly as he could but he was fifty feet from the fire when a someone spoke dont move peter said its only me swan said dont make too much noise peter insisted it took me a long time to get them to sleep swan walked carefully along the cisterns shelf to the fire really just a small pile of charcoal that had been laid on the stone and lit but it was warm and he realised that he was cold we have wine peter said andromache appeared beside the fire and smiled at him she had peters soldiers cloak around her shoulders swan accepted a cup of wine all is well peter shrugged and smiled a secretive smile i just spent a day underground with a troupe of actors who cant stop talking he glanced at andromache mind you there are compensations swan finished his wine tonight he said watch for us from the water gate if you dont see the venetian galley yes peter asked yes what exactly do i do if theres no ship switch roles and get them to take you out of the city swan said save what you can thats how it is peter asked by the way you know you smell like a spanish whore i lack your experience with spanish whores swan said what do they smell like attar of roses and old sweat peter said the sun was rising when he slipped over the wall into the inn yard he heard a womans voice from the stable and he smiled and went into the kitchen where shocked servants scurried to get out of his way an hour later face and hands washed in best clothing neat and dead tired he stood in his armour in the atrium waiting for the rest of the embassy alessandro came down with giannis and cesare cesare embraced him then held him at arms length you look like hell he said giannis shook his head you smell like he made a face perfume christ on the cross he does alessandro laughed i thought you were going to bed scapegrace swan forced a grin there was a bed involved he said the three men roared they carried their helmets under their arms rather than wear them as swan had hoped and he carried his through the streets he wondered why hed bothered to wash it was four miles to the palace of the sultan and even in the early morning it was a walk intended to discomfort and annoy as they walked alessandro drifted back from the bishop i have taken some precautions he said swan could barely remain awake yes i think it possible that the sultan could decide to dispense with us he shrugged you mean kill us swan said cesare started yes if so it wont happen at the palace it will be a street attack alessandro was watching the buildings so we will not return along these streets the palace is too public swan asked i have to hope so if he chooses to kill us in the palace alessandro glanced over his shoulder swan followed his eye he hadnt seen yellow face in days and there he was why though swan asked alessandro shrugged as a message because the bishop will annoy him because hes ready for war with venice anyway alessandro shook his head your jew friend isaac sent me a warning swan tried to imagine some higher order of plot where isaac would send them a false warning he shook his head fatigue was not helping him think i would listen to isaac he said carefully listen sleepyhead damn you you english pup i need you and you smell like a french whore and look like a threeday drunk now that i have your attention how far north do the sewers come christ sorry alessandro i havent come this far north and i havent been in or out north of the market by the venetian quarter alessandro shook his head damn it to hell the palace of blacharnae was at the northeast corner of the city it had suffered substantial damage during the siege but its woods and fountains appealed to the sultan and he had taken it for his residence although rumour said he usually lived in a great palace of tents on the plain just beyond the entrance hall was grander in every way than any similar hall in england even the guildhall in london the square of st marks in venice had something of the majesty but the apparently infinite vista of mosaics stretching away from the viewer struck swan with wonder and it was old swan couldnt tell how old but he was awestruck a thousand years old the only man who seemed unaffected was the bishop who led them into the great hall without looking to the right or left up or down neither the mosaic ceilings nor the marble floor seemed to interest him the hall was lined by armoured sipahis who leaned indolently on their lances and did not speak the great doors at the far end of the hall were closed swan stood still there were six christian menatarms counting cesare and four more venetian marines they stood five a side flanking the embassy the bishop two interpreters and four sailors with the gifts they stood and stood so did the sipahis sweat ran down swans neck gathered momentum in the middle of his back and rolled all the way down to the top of his buttocks under his arming coat the arming coat began to grow alarmingly heavy and wet the weight of his harness seemed to grow he could even feel feel viscerally the weight of the sword at his hip he flexed his knees he had too much time to think time to consider the troupe in the cisterns time to consider the flaws in his plans time to consider khatun beng端l time to think about the risk hed run and why revenge the joke was on him he couldnt get her out of his head and he had gone to lie with her to revenge himself on her father a petty wicked sin where did that thought come from im too fucking old for this muttered cesare immediately behind him alessandro was a statue of steel the bishop began to complain at first his complaints were aimed at members of his own staff then he walked over to one of the silent sipahis i demand to see the sultan he shouted spittle flying the man ignored him immediately shrieked the outraged prelate i have waited nineteen days to deliver a letter and some presents the sipahi might have been carved of leather his aged face had vertical lines etched by sun and weather and the man might have been a hundred years old yet he stood in chain and plate his pointed helmet a magnificent display of blue and gold his scimitar hilt made of jade swan looked him over and thought theres a killer i demand to see the sultan immediately shouted the bishop very softly cesare said if we kill him ourselves do you think the sultan will let us go and the great doors opened the bishop caught a hundred feet from his entourage scurried back his heavy garments making the noise of a womans skirts as he crossed the marble floor no one watched him because sultan mehmet ii entered led by fifty royal sipahis followed by his personal bodyguard surrounded by his advisers and friends every man was dressed in silk every soldiers armour was engraved with verses of the holy koran inlaid in gold blued like the sky the courtiers had jewels in their turbans the size of birds eggs their robes were woven in complex patterns and yet the whole made one pattern around the central figure of the sultan as if a single intelligence had chosen all their clothes swan bet that someone had omar reis was standing at the sultans right hand the sultan settled on to his throne and omar reis was allowed a stool at his feet the other courtiers bowed some actually lay flat on their face before the sultan alessandro said quietly kneel all of the menatarms sank to one knee the bishop hissed on your feet we do not kneel to some infidel warlord none of the menatarms moved until the turks began to move at the word of a chamberlain who thumped the floor with his baton the bishop looked close to apoplexy the chamberlain began to speak he spoke in turkish and another chamberlain spoke in persian one of the embassys interpreters began to speak it is a recitation of the sultans titles and names allahs servant flower of felicity lord of rum and antioch the titles went on and on some religious some military some tribal swan went back to thinking about khatun beng端l her hair the scent of her the scent was with him yet he smiled conquerer of constantinople lord of greece he bids us welcome mehmet was young of middle height and quite handsome perhaps twentyone or twentytwo years of age he had large eyes that sparkled with intelligence and the shoulders and arms of a swordsman yet he sat in quiet repose with a dignity often missing in young men especially fighters swan found him the most impressive monarch hed met on the other hand mehmet ii had only henry vi of england as a rival in that regard and the comparison wasnt even fair it was like comparing a magnificent stallion with a small and rather shy donkey the sultan greets you and asks if your lodging was to your satisfaction are you well fed has your stay in his new capital been pleasant asked the interpreter swan realised the there were europeans standing among the turkish courtiers he didnt know them well but there was the venetian senior merchant and there was a florentine who alessandro had pointed out the chief factor of the florentine merchants they were standing with the sultan swan looked at alessandro caught his eye and gave the slightest nod in the direction of the venetian alessandro allowed the slightest smile to cross his face and gave his own minute nod so alessandro had pulled strings to get venice to send a representative which made it almost impossible that they would all be murdered the bishop bowed it was the closest thing to a social concession swan had seen the man make he spoke very quietly to the interpreter who himself bowed he spoke in turkish for what seemed to swan to be a very long time he became aware that omar reis was watching him the man had a slight smile on his face swan smiled back it wasnt the wisest choice but swan couldnt stop the smile it became a grin omar reiss smile faltered the introductory oration ran to its final stanzas in persian thats my bit said cesare at the poety mehmet sat forward the bishop who had been toying with his magnificent crystal crozier suddenly looked up mehmet smiled he leaned over and whispered something to the florentine who nodded and walked across the hall to the embassy even as the chamberlain answered the embassy and the translator began to say the sultan is delighted to accept the plaudits of his cousin the pope the turkish answer ground on a little more pointed than the papal oration in that it suggested that christians had always been the aggressors and islam and allahs servant mehmet and his father murad were but innocent servants of allahs will the florentine stopped and bowed the sultan wishes to know who among the embassy composed the poem at the end before he could be stopped cesare bowed i had that honour you write in persian asked the florentine i write in latin i found a translator he bowed the florentine returned his bow the popes gift was a bridle a magnificent piece of horse tack decorated in gold with medallions of the finest italian work buckles in blued steel and gold dyed a deep red the sultan looked at it smiled leaned over to omar reis and made some remark which caused all the men around him to laugh their interpreters paled the nearer said the sultan says the pope takes me for a horse the bishop went forward with the second gift a cabinet such as italian noblemen used to display their jewels and their antiquities a magnificent piece of vulgarity with a hundred drawers of exotic woods and mirrored backs gold and silver wire inlay marble terraces like a palace reproduced as a piece of furniture the sultan didnt even look at it or the bishop he had started to chat with the men closest to him the bishop stood by the popes great gift and time ticked by literally as there was a german clock in the centre of the cabinet it was wound and set the machine ticking away swan found it fascinating a machine a machine that could measure time eventually the sultan was interested too and when one of his confidants stopped talking he rose suddenly walked down from the dais and stood by the cabinet with the help of the venetian factor he opened the clock and looked at the mechanism then he shrugged and said something in turkish to omar reis who grinned or rather showed his teeth the interpreter closest to swan gulped audibly he says first he takes me for a horse and now for a woman omar reis passed within a few feet of swan he turned to grin his feral grin and his nose wrinkled slightly swan saw him pause in his progress across the floor he looked back not a long look but a mere flick of the eyes swan would have sworn that the wolf of thraces eyes glowed swan had never had such a look of poisonous hatred directed at him in all his life uhoh cesare behind him said boy what have you done alessandro looked at him i smell of khatun beng端ls perfume swans vision tunnelled and for a moment he thought he was going to faint or worse im an idiot mehmet spoke quietly his words clear in the silent hall the bishop bowed and extended a hand with the popes letter the chamberlain took it without any grand display he managed to give the impression that he was handling a small sack of human excrement he deposited the letter with a lower functionary who scurried away mehmet nodded the sultan would like to grant you a boon in return for your magnificent presents said the interpreter he says that he has a surfeit of christian slaves so many that their value is plummeting throughout his empire he is about to launch a great military campaign to crush rebels against his rule and he says this will only result in still more christian slaves the bishop narrowed his eyes most of the embassy were holding their breath the sultan has arranged for some slaves to be waiting for you outside in recognition of the popes magnificent presents he is willing to allow you to free five every turk in the hall laughed the laughter was spontaneous and unforced and even the venetian and the florentine felt it mehmet smiled benevolently at them omar reis looked at swan it took an effort of will for swan to keep his hand off his swordhilt the turks left the hall faster than they had entered the sipahis remained standing nonchalantly around the perimeter yet unmoving as carved stone alessandro looked around whatever is waiting for us outside it will be humiliating and cruel and outside the gates may be worse your excellency i propose that you choose the first five slaves we see so that we may lose no time harden your heart and let us move the bishop nodded let me also recommend that all three of you gentlemen strip your robes and hand them to our sailors he nodded to the bishop your excellency i can protect you better if you are not a slow stiff obvious target the elder of the two interpreters said you are making a mistake if the turks can pretend they didnt recognise him alessandro shrugged i know that argument i have my own they had arrived at the great entrance doors ready excellency the bishop was so pale he might have been a corpse do you really think that alessandro nodded yes we will be attacked probably by an angry antichristian mob in the street the bishops hands trembled gods will be done he said the doors opened the great courtyard of the palace was full full to bursting swan thought at first glance that there must be two thousand men and women there maybe twice as many they were for the most part naked or wore a single garment old and young they shared deeply lined exhausted faces and scars they had been deprived even of hope they stood abject families huddled together or perhaps they were just loose associations of men and women formed in bondage a voice from one of the palace towers called out in greek christians your bishop will now select five of you to be freed present yourselves to him alessandro eyed the crowd swan said well never get through alessandro smiled oh yes we will he looked around one more time the great gates on the far side of the courtyard were opening he looked tired and his mouth was set very hard the slaves began to shuffle towards them the press was instantly very thick and swan stumbled back tell them they are all free and should go through the gate alessandro spoke quietly and every word sounded as if it was forced out of him there will be a stampede swan said yes alessandro said do it the bishop was hanging on alessandros arm the venetian marines were stringing their bows in greek swan roared all of you are free the bishop says so go quickly out the gates go the slaves stopped pressing in there was a moment then there was a roar or rather a deep murmur as the slaves began to comprehend what had been said at the back of the crowd slaves were running for the gate archers began to loose shafts at them from the towers and then the screams began forward roared alessandro cut your way through if you must swan still had his helmet under his arm now it seemed like a foolish liability he wasnt going to put it on his head he drew his sword the bishop had stopped he was trying to shepherd five slaves he touched them grabbed their hands one of them took a turkish arrow in the gut the man sat abruptly legs spread the arrow sticking out of his back he fell forward a little and blood ran out of his mouth but he didnt scream he just looked surprised the bishop began to weep he was holding the hand of a little girl and trying to drag her along and a woman her mother followed them reaching for the girl an arrow struck her and she fell swan swept the little girl up and held her in his helmet arm and ran for the gate no arrows touched him the bishop grabbed another child and dragged him along behind the child screamed the childs father called run run in greek looking back from the gate swan could see very few bodies and a great deal of screaming panic they ran through the gate and out into the main thoroughfare of the northern part of the city almost like a country road so far from the inhabited core but there was no turkish ambush a dozen mounted turks were quietly rounding up the slaves but they offered no violence to the embassy they did smile and laugh and point alessandro didnt stop moving this way he called and they were off across a rubblestrewn field where once there had been a set of noblemens houses the child sitting on swans arm seemed to weigh ten stone and he cursed the useless helmet he was breathing like a bellows the mounted turks watched them go laughing and calling things they went almost a quartermile across the rubble down old streets with no buildings left on either side and through a great field that looked as if it had been recently burned a great semicircle of churches their gold or bronze domes rising above buildings tenements and rubble marked the edge of the inhabited city still another quarter of a mile away to the north behind them a column of mounted turks trotted out of the blacharnae palace weve come away with nine slaves alessandro said he motioned for them to stop and everyone armoured or not stood virtually unable to speak breathing like so many armourers bellows if i escape this i will burn a hundred candles of white wax on the altar of saint mark panted one of the young venetian menatarms cesare simply leaned over and threw up he did it neatly wih the economy of the heavy drinker and then he spat swan had a water bottle and he passed it to his friend who raised it in a mock toast when i die see that donna lucrescia has all my love and give my money to the poor he stood bent over and his breaths came in great gasps alessandro was watching the turks to the north ahead of them at the edge of the suburbs there was a low roar like distant surf alessandro rubbed his chin im going to assume for the sake of speed that you ignored my advice and took some petty revenge on omar reis swan looked at the turks i alessandro raised a hand forestalling argument i have misspent my life wasted my patronage squandered my fathers money and lived a life steeped in sin despite which im not sure i ever managed to be so complete a dangerous ignorant fool as you he shrugged although i admit that you perform these little miracles of idiocy with a certain sprezzatura what did you do gasped cesare sleep with his wife daughter said swan with some pride mixed with regret cesare laughed im so glad im about to die in a great crusade a true reflection of the state of the faith by god we are not a handful of christians standing against the horses of islam were a dozen dupes of thomas swans love affair he laughed he wasnt going to let us go swan argued there was a whine in his voice he might have alessandro said he might not have im sure you made the sultans choice easier he spat pointed with the dagger in his right fist see the crowd he said cesare shook his head they look like greeks they are greeks alessandro said the turks have raised the city against us but theyre christians said one of the venetians swan looked at the bishop we represent the pope he said bitterly most of the greeks hate the pope worse than the sultan he glared at alessandro you cant pin that one on me that crowd was fanned to flames before alessandro smiled his hard killing smile i agree there is plenty of blame to go around he bit his lip how far to the first cistern swan shrugged a mile at least theres an aqueduct above the plataea so there must be an entrance there giannis was talking quickly to one of the freed slaves a woman of forty he was begging her to precede them and proclaim to the crowd that the bishop had saved her he promised her a place aboard their ship she stared at him blank eyed when they rose to their feet she just sat head down so they went towards the crowd with only eight slave children as their protection the crowd was led by priests at least a dozen of them giannis went forward to negotiate and was hit with a paving stone luckily the stone hit the peak of his helmet but the message was clear and his shouts in greek were ignored the turks have set this up beautifully alessandro said we will be murdered by a greek crowd or we kill our way through a greek crowd either way the sultan wins the bishop emerged from his escort he wasnt a tall man just middle height with mousebrown hair and a weak chin but he took his bishops crozier back from a terrified sailor his hands shook but he set his face i forbid you to kill them he said excellency said alessandro he bowed his head the bishop threw his outer robe around his shoulders and put his mitre on his head and began to walk towards the crowd a young man threw a paving stone too big for him it didnt come close to the bishop but it started a horde of small boys throwing clods of earth the bishop kept walking across the rubble in some ways it was the bravest thing swan had ever seen nothing in the bishops previous behaviour had led him to expect this but in his heart he was impressed he thought of profit and loss and all the effort hed put into his plan and he shook his head once and said fuck very clearly in english then he put the small girl down and took his helmet a fine milanese armet out from under his arm his arm was cramping he opened the visor dropped the falling buff and peeled back the hinged cheek plates inside lay the fantastical jewelled reliquary of the head of st george he held it high above his head and followed the bishop the head and the children got them through the crowd alive unharmed and unblooded one of the priests offered to guide them and the party began to work their way south and east through the suburbs mostly abandoned with groups of occupied houses like tiny villages set among the crumbling ruins of others abandoned a few months a few years or a few centuries before as soon as they entered the narrow streets they lost sight of the mounted turks and everything else except the sun in the sky overhead they moved as fast as the bishop and the children would allow them to move the men took turns carrying the children and no one not even alessandro proposed that the children be left up fifth hill and down again with a quick glimpse of the golden horn off to the east shining in the sun across at galata three low vessels were laid out on the quays ready for sea alessandro pointed to them thats our ride home my friends he said and the men responded with another burst of speed down fifth hill on the eastern flank into the dense slum at its base and up along the ridge that held both fifth and fourth hill headed almost due east they took a looping series of alleys and the priest apologised for the state of the streets giannis kissed the mans ring we would be dead without you father he said see that your heretics save the head he responded i need no other reward keep it from the filthy turks and perhaps some day it will return to us high on the northern flank of fourth hill swan stopped the priest i want to get into the cisterns he said the priest looked startled although whether at his greek or his knowledge of the cisterns swan didnt know i can see an aqueduct from here swan insisted the priest paused yes he admitted i can take you there you know the sewers swan shrugged i think so he said the priest nodded few do most of them are thieves the aqueduct ran above ground well over their heads but it gave swan hope he stowed the head again in his armet after the priest touched it venerated it and prayed then they set off under the aqueduct leaving the priest behind everyone was flagging and the sun was headed for the horizon the turks were fanning out from the flank of fourth hill it was easy to see that they had not found the embassy where they expected and now the regiment of cavalry was breaking up now is not the time to fail swan called come on the ground under the aqueduct was rocky but there was an obvious walkway and they jogged along armour creaking and clanking as they went the youngest venetian cut away his tassets they all drank water and ran again down the ridge twice they had to detour around arms of the city new or old that had grown in under the aqueduct and then they were north and west of the market and swan muttered a prayer of gratitude to god he knew where he was almost there he said he pointed down into the market below them where a ruined fountain had collapsed into the underground sewer alessandro took him aside were spent is it true we are almost to your underground palaces half a mile less please everyone we are almost safe alessandro stopped them gathered them in a tight group and they walked on breathing hard down the last slopes of the steep ridge and into the back of a dense residential quarter with houses packed tight some abandoned and some very much inhabited greeks watched them with sullen indifference a group of young men began to shadow them and then as they turned north to pick up the street that swan knew led to the market he saw yellow face at the same moment that the spy saw him the tall man turned hiked up his kaftan and ran kill him swan shouted at the marine but none of them had a shaft on his bow and yellow face was gone before they were ready to loose alessandro looked at him a question in his eyes and the set of his mouth a spy for the turks i think perhaps for omar reis either way theyll be on us in a few heartbeats lets run then said alessandro and suited action to word if they see us go into the sewers swan said but he followed the capitano and they all ran off down the street the bishop tripped and fell one of the sailors paused swan tried to make himself run on but he didnt he ran back and helped the sailor get the bishop to his feet the man was bleeding from an abrasion on his chin take this swan said and handed his helmet to the sailor he lifted the bishop threw him over his shoulders and staggered towards the market now in sight a clod of earth hit the sailor and he stumbled swan thought why am i saving the bishop he staggered on a clod of earth hit him a young greek man ran out into the street and yelled death to the heretics in greek and another clod of earth hit this time striking the bishop on his shoulders the weight of his armour and the weight of the bishop thankfully not the largest ecclesiastical size of bishop but not a slim man was cutting through his burst of spirit the oldest of the venetian marines the one that the others called the spaniard turned paused and came back towards swan without a word he took the bishops legs and they staggered on together the sailor staying with them eyes glazed with fear he didnt have a weapon since no one came to drive them off the greek youths grew bolder and there were stones mixed in with the clods of earth they rang off swans backplate and his arm harnesses swans whole world narrowed to the effort of staggering off balance along the timeworn street towards the distant market it didnt seem to grow any closer he heard hoofbeats they started to cross a major thoroughfare and had only fifty paces to go to the market the old ruin of the fountain was another fifty paces beyond swan looked to the left and saw the horsemen three turkish riders with another dozen well behind them coming at a gallop they were all but on top of him he and the spaniard dropped the bishop in the street as the first arrow flew it passed between them the second arrow screeched along swans left shoulder deeply marking the steel and fell to the street the third arrow all but parted swans hair and reminded him that he didnt have a helmet he got his sword out of his scabbard and his buckler off his hip the bishop curled into a ball and prayed the first turk hurtled by an arms length away leaning out over his horse on swans buckler side an arrow drawn all the way to his chin tom threw his buckler hand up as the man loosed and the arrow struck his bucklers steel boss and left a deep dent all but numbing swans hand the spaniard didnt wait for the second turk but stepped in front of his horse severing the reins and slicing deeply into the horses neck the horse was dead immediately and began to collapse under the turk who nonetheless took his shot at the range of a few feet his arrow caught the spaniard in the middle of the chest and knocked him down then horse and rider fell in a spectacular spray of dust and blood the third turk changed direction to avoid the dying horse ahead of him rose in his saddle holding on with only his knees bow drawn for what seemed like a brief eternity swan was looking down the length of that arrow and then the turk loosed in the same heartbeat the sailor holding his helmet lurched away from the dying horse and tripping over the bishop lifted the armet over his head the turkish arrow crashed into the milanese helmet and careened away swan saw the disgust on the turks face as he went by the armet containing the head crashed to the earth the spaniard was alive the arrow had dented his breastplate and the man was struggling to breathe but it hadnt penetrated the two turks still mounted were turning their horses the other dozen were coming swan gave the spaniard his hand and lifted the man to his feet he took the bow from his bow case whipped an arrow on to the bowstring and loosed at the dozen horsemen charging them as far as swan could see he missed but his attention was now on the two horsemen behind him the sailor got to his feet and went to retrieve the helmet the nearest mounted turk put an arrow into him from fifty feet the sailor screamed fell heavily on all fours and screamed again shot in the groin the two turks started towards swan swan picked up a rock it was all he could think to do an arrow whistled over his head he jumped a move his uncles had taught him leaping hard with both feet he landed by the helmet and his right arm went back the nearest turk took a crossbow bolt just above the waist he collapsed back then forward and still didnt fall from his horses back even though the bolt was sticking halfway out of his back but he dropped his bow the farther man had to rein in to avoid his mates horse and swan threw with all his fear and hate behind it and his rock struck the mans horse in the head and the horse shied violently sidestepping rearing and blew out a great breath utterly spoiling his masters aim and that arrow vanished well over swan who charged the turk while the man tried to get control of his horse his right hand seizing his sword back from his left a few paces behind swan the wounded turk finally fell from the saddle and his horse stopped immediately and stood over her fallen man the turk nearest swan gave up on fighting his mare dropped his bow and drew his sword swan made it to his side and pushed his buckler at the man drawing a heavy cut that rang off the bucklers steel boss and swans countercut scored cutting the mans fingers and his wrist having hit swan cut a reverso up into the mans chin and punched it home with a jab like a boxing blow all in a pair of heartbeats it was a set piece hed learned from the maestro in venice and it worked beautifully even when his opponent was four feet higher and cutting down he was still admiring his own swordsmanship when his victims horse knocked him flat his backplate took the animals kick and he rolled in the dust and saw the spaniard loose an arrow the other group of turks had stopped to shoot it was a natural reaction for an archer but it cost them time and the spaniard loosed shaft after shaft not accurately but the turks were densely enough packed that many of his arrows hit horses exposed flesh even a ricochet or a broken splinter in a horses hoof could change the course of a small fight and his flow of shafts disconcerted them and another carefully aimed crossbow bolt struck tearing a horseman from his saddle swan got to his knees the pain in his back ebbing from unbearable to bearable where the horse had kicked him he retrieved his sword got to his feet and stumbled from the pain the turks had begun to return the marines arrows with interest six for one but the spaniard was canny he loosed and moved loosed and moved always headed for the cover of the market plaza and the distant fountain swan saw giannis at the edge of the market as the greek manatarms leaned out from the cover of an ancient pillar and snapped off another crossbow bolt it hit a horse swan went from walking to a stumbling shuffling jog two arrows passed close to him but the turks were now concentrating all their arrows on the spaniard and all that came his way were overshots he managed to run the bishop lay unmoving the head of st george lay in the middle of the street wrapped in his armet he couldnt think of rescuing either of them right now instead he passed the bishop got a hand up and seized the bridle of the horse standing by the corpse of the first man giannis had killed without breaking stride he vaulted into the saddle gathered the reins and leaned way out over the horses neck no thomas yelled alessandro at his back i got them all into this swan thought he pointed the head of the turkish horse at the enemy pressed his spurless heels into her sides and rolled his weight forward over her neck she got the message and leaped into a gallop swan finally got the reins under his buckler hand and concentrated on holding on with his knees he kept his buckler up near his head he heard the flat crack as giannis discharged another bolt and then he was on them although his mare was suddenly sluggish she slowed from a gallop to a canter and he couldnt make her turn his buckler slammed into an archers hands as he raised his bow and swan almost lost his seat cutting across his body to get the man a weak blow that nonetheless mangled his opponents bowarm swan had never actually fought from horseback before the second turk loosed at him from a horse length away and the arrow went through the outer rim of his buckler passed up the length of his arm and cut into his neck swan was again forced to cut across his body because his damned horse wouldnt turn he missed his cut but by sheer luck the mares stumble and the alignment of his point spitted his opponent on his sword and the man grabbed the blade in his neck with both hands and ripped it from swans grasp at that moment swans horse shot by a dozen arrows subsided to the ground swan fell and hit the ground gently enough but now he lost his buckler too he rolled to his feet there was dust everywhere and they couldnt see him and he had trouble finding them even a horse length away he drew the dagger from his hip ran three steps and threw himself at a man who was looking the other way in the dust the dagger went home in the mans back and swan dragged him from his saddle but instead of a clean kill and possession of the mans horse swan found himself pinned under the falling man his feet still caught in his stirrups and the horse wheeling around them like the equine rim of a human wheel swan let go in disgust and fell backwards and the horse bolted the corpse of the dead man jolting obscenely behind swan just sat in the swirling dust it was as if he was a puppet and his strings had been cut he couldnt seem to get to his feet but the turks the survivors had given the fight up as a bad job and ridden free theyd cantered away north to the next major intersection almost a stadion away even as swan tried to watch them amid the dust and his own fatigue he saw the first of their arrows winging towards him it missed he began to crawl back towards the bishop then he realised that his most prized possession the counts sword was lying pinned under a dead turk he turned and crawled like a baby to the mans corpse his hands were still locked around the blade swan got his feet under him and rose arrows began to sink into the street around him he got his hands on the hilt and pulled he wiped it on the dead mans kaftan and sheathed it and out of pure stubbornness he took the mans curved dagger and his belt purse only then did he lurch into an exhausted run it was only a hundred paces back to the bishop but it seemed like an english country mile men were shouting another of the venetian marines was loosing arrows and arrows were falling around him the spaniard slumped to his knees and then fell to the ground the bishop rose to his knees and lifted his pectoral cross the second marine took a turkish arrow in his shoulder and fell the sailor who had carried the head lay unmoving even as swan stumbled up alessandro lifted the spaniard over his shoulder the man must have been hurt worse than had at first appeared and giannis snapped another shot at the nowdistant turks and slung his crossbow bishop croaked swan giannis saw what he wanted and went to the bishop swan got his hands on the armet the tightwrapped cloth inside the helmet looked intact he shuffled towards the market giannis got the bishop on to his shoulder and followed him cesare joined the greek and took the mans legs and they ran in a sort of sideways shuffle towards the fountain north along the avenue swan could see a man in a plumed turban on a fine bay horse he was at the head of a squadron of turks perhaps a hundred he had a horsetail riding whip in his hand and he used it to gesture at them swan placed his helmet carefully on the ground picked up the spaniards abandoned bow fitted an arrow from a turks nearby quiver and took a deep breath swan roared alessandro they had the bishop at the edge of the fountain he raised the bow the range was extreme two hundred paces at least he drew the nock of the arrow all the way to his own ear as his uncles had taught him it felt odd with the small turkish bow but it seemed to pull very much the way the bows of his youth pulled heavy but beautifully balanced he raised the sharp barbed point of the arrow twelve fingers above omar reiss head he compensated for the breeze let out a little breath and loosed his hand flying from the string as in a dramatic plucking of a harp he ignored the shouts of his companions and watched the fall of his shot because it felt right an archer knows the arrow rose high over the streets of the ancient city and then like one of idriss falcons it fell the wolf of thrace and his horse fell silently two hundred paces away the horse kicked and dust flew and swan could see no more he turned scooped up the helmet and ran i got him he whooped like a boy when he caught alessandro got who asked the venetian i put an arrow in omar reis he laughed alessandro looked at him in disgust if you have done such a foolish thing they will hunt us to the ends of the earth he said wearily now lead us through your sewers there was no further pursuit in an hour the exhausted and bedraggled survivors were in the venetian quarter swan was pissing blood the spaniard had an arrow in his left thigh that the venetian quarter barbersurgeon refused to touch and alessandro sent him on his way a sailor was dead another of the marines badly wounded with an arrow in the shoulder and all of the menatarms were virtually unable to move from exhaustion the two venetian galleys were on their way halfway across the golden horn the sun was setting but north and west of the venetian galleys half a dozen turkish galleys were crossing their lateen yards and making ready for sea the bishop had been pinked by two arrows and was badly bruised by rocks and clods of earth and despite that he was everywhere hobbling on a makeshift crutch full of spirit almost cheerful alessandro watched him not what i expected swan said carefully alessandro seemed to blame him for the whole incident but the venetian shrugged he has surprised himself said the italian he is braver than he thought and a better man it has made him happy i have seen this before he managed a rueful smile perhaps never such a volteface as this but still cesare was downing a cup of wine christ what if we had to like him the venetian bailli entered the yard of the inn and began to shout at the bishop alessandro still had his armour on he waved at the rest of the party get your kit to the wharf now immediately the bailli is threatening to hand us over to the turks swan was on his way to his room when he realised that the small boy standing at the open front door of the inn was familiar the boy brightened when he saw swan king david is looking for you at the gate he said and off he ran in the way of small boys swan thought about it isaac might have something useful to say he would certainly have a packet of his letters for venice or he might have a party of turks or even a dozen mercenaries to take swan alive and hand him to omar reis if he lived i dont have to do this swan thought so he went he was in armour with his sword at his side his buckler was lost there was no janissary at the gate instead there was isaac how did you escape isaac asked as soon as swan appeared i have some tricks swan said wearily i shot omar reis you killed omar reiss horse isaac said swan laughed perhaps it was the fatigue or the heat or the wine but he laughed and laughed and he couldnt stop like a small child isaac shook his head the turks will be here in a few minutes to demand you be handed over he said he pointed across the square where yellow face was obvious by an ancient archway i have to know how how exactly did you get out of bessarions house i had watchers and you eluded them swan rubbed his beard trade secret which i will sell you can you delay the turks by an hour isaac gestured at himself with both hands i a mere jew he shrugged swan waited isaac rocked his head back and forth ah perhaps i could at that he narrowed his eyes i think they want you to get away i think they have decided to use you as an incident if they catch you that might be inconvenient for them as well he handed swan a heavy packet my letters for venice and my cousin simons as well he did not as it turned out sell you to the turks the jewish merchant nodded there is a letter in that packet addressed to you lord idris brought it to my brother in person good christ swan said omar reis will want you dead even if his master mehmet has decided to let you go isaac said nonetheless i can purchase you an hour of time swan reached into the leather bag he wore at his shoulder and took out his tablet of paper and tore off his map of the sewers and conduits he handed it to simon with a bow he didnt have the power in his muscles for a flourish they dont all link up he said sadly i thought they would but you can pass from one to another without being noticed if your hunters dont know where to look isaac was looking at the map these arent streets he said slowly sewers the ancient cisterns thats my map swan leaned back against the gate to the venetian quarter isaac laughed you know the sewers he asked he shook his head hug my cousin balthazar for me pass that packet on and he will see you rewarded i promise you have been most entertaining messire swan swan embraced the man who seemed surprised to be embraced but they kissed each others cheeks and isaac chuckled go with god frank he said thanks swan said and ran back through the gate wait isaac called where did bessarions library go and what if i find you more books swan waved they boarded nike in minutes the men in their armour the embassy boarding with greatly reduced baggage bags went straight to the hold under the rowers feet and swan took a moment to grab an old openfaced bascinet from the venetian guardhouse and put it on his head alessandro came and stood by him at the edge of the command deck where exactly are we picking up this boat he asked swan pointed a mile down the european shore of the horn right at the point ser marco grunted where the currents are the worst nonetheless any venetian knows those waters that is where dandalo stormed the city claudio the surgeon was already at work on the spaniard before they were under way and north of them three turkish galleys left their docks and started down the horn towards them in the failing light alessandro turned and spoke to ser marco omar reis will stop at nothing to get us he said ser marco fingered his beard and looked at the sky and the sea he spat over the side a turkish ship catch me he smiled well see and then the bow was clear of the venetian quay and they were in the current moving south and east i wish swan said and alessandro looked at him you wish he asked i wish id thought to send a decoy swan said another ship waiting on the south side of the city in the old imperial docks alessandro laughed that will have to wait until next time he said swan looked at the turkish squadron coming down the current behind them i dont plan to come back he said ever of course in the same breath he said that he thought of the letter from idris and possibly khatun beng端l he sighed the mile passed very quickly he was in the bow watching from a little less than half a mile he could see the water gate closer in he could see fishing boats along the point and at a quarter of a mile he could see that there was activity near the gate there were too many boats too close to the gate he wondered if they were there ahead of him how could they be even isaac hadnt had time to sell him yet at two hundred yards he saw that all the boats he was looking at were far too big at a hundred yards he saw the tiny cockleshell which was their rowing boat it was emerging from the gate a tiny low thing with too much aboard nikephorus was lying atop the canvas sheet and the rest of them including peter were slipping into the water the waves tossed the little boat dreadfully swan ran aft along the companionway that passed between the rowers amidships thats my boat he said to ser marco that little thing ser marco grunted his eyes flicked up to the darkening sky well tow her under if we throw her a line at this speed louder he said to his timoneer back your oars he leaned over to the helmsman lay me alongside that little boat dont swamp it the venetians seamanship was incredible the helmsman turned the ship a minute turn but one that allowed the hull to pass directly alongside the little rowing boat that bobbed in the current it passed under the oars a sailor at the first oarport passed a rope to nikephorus who took it awkwardly but he caught it the oars remained stationary in the water holding the venetian galley in place even as the current moved both boats together out to sea behind them the three turkish ships began to gain on them the acrobats clearly had had a plan of their own because irene appeared from the water with a coil of rope around her waist and climbed over the ram glitteringly naked to the rapt admiration of the arsenali as soon as she belayed her rope her comrades followed her andromache followed by constantioss heavily muscled form followed by peter who all but bounced up the side and last of all apollinaris by then swan was in the bows giving each a hand as they came over the box that housed the marines in combat alessandro gallantly threw oarsmens cloaks over the women the oarsmen themselves applauded amidships a pair of sailors manhandled nikephorus aboard astern in the setting sun the turkish galleys were almost in bowshot swan got apollinaris up the side and then turned and ran aft again nikephorus was aboard and dry he had a bag in his hand behind him the sailors were pitching bags from the small boat up on to the deck of the galley the first turkish arrows began to fall and ser marco turned to swan whats in the boat the truth now another bag came up the side cardinal bessarions library swan said ser marco nodded give way all he roared and the great oars bit the water he looked aft where the turkish galleys were flying at them i love books he said his eyes met swans but i love my oarsmen more at their feet the small boat still attached to the galley by two ropes seemed to skip along with the venetian ship the sailor who had been aboard throwing sacks leaped clear and caught himself on one of the oarports got a foot inboard and then swung up and over the gunwale as agile as an african monkey more than half of the cardinals collection was still in the boat plato aristotle menander epictetus and aeschylus a play by a greek named phrynichus who had witnessed the fall of miletus a hundred poems by sappho the sayings of heraklitus a work on mathematics by pythagoras even as swan watched the venetian ship gathered speed and the two ropes towing the small boat began to skew her course he was still considering making the jump when alessandros strong right arm pinned him to the gunwale no you dont you fool alessandro shouted swan squirmed the bow of the little boat buried itself in a wave almost instantly the boat filled just as a sailor cut the tow the rowing boat tipped once took another wave directly under swans eyes and sank the sacks leather sacks carefully tied floated for a few moments long enough for peter to seize a marines partisan lean far out over the stern and catch one it hung from the point of the spear for a long moment and the spear caught the last of the sun and then peter whipped the spear up over his head with all his strength and the bag flung as if by a trebuchet passed over the stern and landed in the middle of the ship and before the turkish galleys passed them the rest of the bags sank into the waters of the bosporus swan watched them all sink he stood there at the stern rail as the turkish arrows fell around him until alessandro came and pulled him away its over he said you did well the cardinal never expected us to save his library the actors are more important they are some day perhaps the cardinal will tell us why alessandro shrugged or perhaps they are people and the scrolls are just the words of dead men swan met his eyes you dont really believe that alessandro shrugged i stand with ser marco i wouldnt give the life of one arsenali for a lost book by that faker aristotle or plato the hypocrite he shrugged swan was watching the turks theyre losing the race he said alessandro smiled theres no ship on these waters as fast as a venetian galley he said half an hour later swan collapsed to the deck and slept he woke in the night with the sort of headache he associated with drunkenness and drank some water ser marco was still with the helmsman they were racing along their big sail set and drawing swan was diffident hed learned that the venetian captain didnt like to be interrupted on the command deck even though it was the best place to stand on the ship so he leaned over the rail forward of the helmsmans station and watched the vaguely phosphorescent water race by too tired to sleep ser marco asked yes messire tired and thirsty a little ill swan shrugged ser marcos remaining teeth glittered in the moonlight when he smiled he was missing all four in the centre and it made him look sinister overexertion young man i gather i owe you my life swan smiled messire claudio did the surgery i merely pinned down a blood vessel ser marco nodded i am grateful but many men have saved my life over the years he looked away swan decided a change of topic was in order where are we he asked when ser marco paused he said im sorry i know you dont like to be bothered on the deck ser marco grinned his demonic grin and beckoned come young master join me on the sacred wooden boards of the command platform the helmsman gave him a distracted nod the mans head was clearly somewhere else ser marco waved see the lights swan was about to protest that he didnt see anything but a handful of stars and then he saw them a cluster of pinpricks more yellow than white and what had to be a fire i see them he leaned out over the water as if being a few handspans closer would make a difference thats the isle of marmora they trade in marble it has several good ports ser marco motioned again lean well out and look carefully astern swan suited his actions to the capitanos words he watched for a long time and saw nothing but the faintest glow far astern he didnt want to give up the capitano was a man who loved to present a puzzle as swan knew from months of serving under him and the young were expected to provide answers then he looked at the sea much much closer than the dark horizon there were ships only a few hundred paces astern they could only really be seen by the bow waves they cast blessed saint george swan said as he straightened up and saint mark said ser marcos tugging his beard i thought i thought we were faster swan said carefully ser marco nodded i thought so too ive seen the flash of oars i think they are rowing at night to increase their speed their rowers will be exhausted in the morning theyll have to try for us early at dawn or even before he shook his head they must be very desperate or someone hates us very much swan winced best get some sleep when they prepare to lay us aboard ill call you may trust my word on that ser marco touched his shoulder swan shook his head he had the uneasy feeling that all of this was his fault he lay down and slept morning he woke muddle headed and at first he couldnt imagine where he was his back hurt and he lay on his side on the wooden deck with nothing under him but his rolled cloak and his right arm which was half asleep he thought of khatun beng端l he started to smile and he realised that the ships drummer was just preparing to play the alarm men were already arming half the arsenali were shrugging into armour those who had it the rest guzzled water or wine the marines were all looking to their arrows he raised his head off the deck and thoughts of love were banished a hundred paces astern he could see the long low shape of omar reiss ship and another hundred paces astern of her two more turkish galleys good christ he said to peter who handed him a cup of wine peter nodded i very much like your turkish bow he said i think you may want it it lay atop his armour with a quiver full of arrows the drum began to beat to arms the tales of tom swan will be continued if enough readers want them in tom swan and the conquerors ring in which tom against his better judgement will return to constantinople to find the lost ring of alexander and to buy a whole city for the pope and perhaps end a war or maybe just start one
